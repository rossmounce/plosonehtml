                Figure 1.  Electrolytic ablation of the POA: histological verification and effects on autonomic thermoregulation.(A) Bright-field photomicrographs of serial coronal brain sections (50 µm, cresyl violet staining) are shown for a sham-lesioned rat and a POA-lesioned rat.
Here and in Figures 2, [3], [7] and [8], the number in the right upper corner of the schematic of each section of the sham-lesioned brain indicates the distance (in mm) between the section's plane and bregma. ac, anterior commissure; f, fornix; LPO, lateral preoptic area; MnPO, median preoptic nucleus; MPA, medial preoptic area; ox, optic chiasm; Sch, suprachiasmatic nucleus; SO, supraoptic nucleus; 3V, third ventricle.
(B) The ability of sham-lesioned and POA-lesioned rats to defend their Tb (abdominal) during moderate heat exposure (28°C, 1 h) or mild cold exposure (17°C, 2 h).
The rats could not move to a different Ta; therefore, they were forced to regulate their Tb mostly by autonomic mechanisms.
