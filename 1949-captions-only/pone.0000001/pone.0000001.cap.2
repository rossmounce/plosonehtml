                Figure 2.  Electrolytic ablation of the PVH: histological verification and effects on autonomic thermoregulation.(A) Serial coronal brain sections are shown for a sham-lesioned rat and a PVH-lesioned rat. Arc, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus; ME, median eminence; mt, mammillothalamic tract; sox, supraoptic decussation; VMH, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus.
Other abbreviations used are the same as in Figure 1.
(B) The ability of sham-lesioned and PVH-lesioned rats to defend their Tb by autonomic mechanisms during moderate heat exposure (28°C, 2 h) or mild cold exposure (17°C, 2 h).
