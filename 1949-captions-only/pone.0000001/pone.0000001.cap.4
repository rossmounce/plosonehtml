Unlike the POA lesions, lesions of the PVH strongly attenuated both cold-seeking behavior (P = 0.035) and hypothermia (P = 0.047) caused by a high, shock-inducing dose of LPS (<a href="#pone-0000001-g005">Fig. 5</a>). The observation that lesions of the PVH had no effect on the LPS-induced warmth-seeking behavior and fever is somewhat surprising, because electrolytic and excitotoxic lesions of this structure have attenuated the febrile response to LPS in several studies <a href="#pone.0000001-Lu1">[26]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000001-Horn1">[28]</a>. However, the animals used in these previous studies were not allowed to select their preferred T<sub>a</sub>. Furthermore, the previous studies were most likely conducted under subthermoneutral conditions (for detailed discussion of thermoneutrality, see Ref. <a href="#pone.0000001-Romanovsky5">[47]</a>). Under such conditions, fever is caused primarily by activation of brown fat thermogenesis <a href="#pone.0000001-Szekely1">[48]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000001-Crawshaw1">[49]</a>. In contrast, PVH-lesioned rats were allowed to select their preferred T<sub>a</sub> and used behavioral thermoregulation (moved to a warmer environment) while responding to LPS administration in the present study. Not only does a supraneutral environment warms the body of a rat exposed to it, but it also allows the animal to mount the fever response by using skin vasoconstriction instead of the energetically expensive thermogenesis <a href="#pone.0000001-Szekely1">[48]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000001-Crawshaw1">[49]</a>. Hence, the PVH is likely involved in the circuitry of fever when the response is mounted primarily by activation of brown fat thermogenesis. When fever occurs due to warmth-seeking behavior, skin vasoconstriction, or both, the PVH loses its important role in the response. Such a scenario is consistent with the fact that the PVH controls primarily thermogenesis and not skin vasomotion <a href="#pone.0000001-Yoshimatsu1">[50]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000001-Sakaguchi1">[52]</a> or thermopreferendum (present study). The effect of PVH ablation on LPS-induced cold-seeking behavior was highly selective: the same electrolytic lesions that strongly attenuated this behavior affected neither cold-seeking behavior caused by moderate heat exposure or RTX nor warmth-seeking behavior caused by mild cold exposure or menthol (data not shown).</p>
