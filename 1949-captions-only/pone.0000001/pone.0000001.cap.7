                Figure 7.  Excitotoxic ablation of the PVH: histological verification and effects on autonomic thermoregulation.(A) Bright-field photomicrographs of serial coronal brain sections (50 µm, Klüver-Barrera staining) of a sham-lesioned rat and a representative rat with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the PVH.
The magnification of photomicrographs and the scale vary in different panels.
Panels I-VI: ×40 (magnification) and 500 µm (scale bar).
Panels VII and VIII: ×100 (magnification) and 200 µm (scale bar).
Panels IX and X: ×400 (magnification) and 50 µm (scale bar).
(B) The ability of sham-lesioned rats and rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the PVH to defend their Tb by autonomic mechanisms during moderate heat exposure or mild cold exposure.
