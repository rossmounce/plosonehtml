                Figure 8.  Excitotoxic ablation of the DMH: histological verification and effects on autonomic thermoregulation.(A) Bright-field photomicrographs of serial coronal brain sections (50 µm, Klüver-Barrera staining) of a sham-lesioned rat and a representative rat with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the DMH.
The magnification and scale of each panel are the same as those of the corresponding panel in Figure 7.
(B) The ability of sham-lesioned rats and rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the DMH to defend their Tb by autonomic mechanisms during moderate heat exposure or mild cold exposure.
