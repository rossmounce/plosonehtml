                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the current understanding of erythropoiesis.Hematopoietic stem cells exist in two distinct compartments: cells in N2 are actively replicating and contributing to blood cell formation.
They are supported by a larger quiescent pool (N1).
Cell replication leads to an exponential amplification (2K) of progeny that ultimately differentiate into the various types of cells present in the circulation.
