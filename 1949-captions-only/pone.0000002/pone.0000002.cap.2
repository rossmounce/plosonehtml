                Figure 2.  Allometric scaling of reticulocyte count.We plot the logarithm of reticulocyte count of a given mammal as a function of the logarithm of its mass (in gram).
Plotted data correspond to a total of 40 mammal species with masses ranging over 6 orders of magnitude, from voles to whales.
The data corresponds to the mean value of the reticulocyte count for each species.
A straight linear fit leads to a coefficient of 0.745, remarkably close to the ¾ exponent (R2 = 0.94, p&lt;0.0001, CI 0.70–0.76), with an intercept of 7.641.
Hence for the smallest mammal (a shrew with ~3 gram), we predict a reticulocyte count of ~1×108.
