                Figure 1.  Cnidaria host genome phylogeny reconstructed using Bayesian methods from 18S, 5.8S and ITS data, and is a 50% majority rule consensus taken from the MCMC analyses after plateau (i.e. ‘burn-in’ trees discarded).The Bayesian posterior probabilities are given for each node.
Taxa containing a HEG are highlighted; the non-functional HEG is boxed.
Taxonomic classification is also distinguished; O(A)  =  Octocorallia (Alcyonaria); C  =  Corrimorpharia; S  =  Scleratinia; Z  =  Zoanthiniaria.
