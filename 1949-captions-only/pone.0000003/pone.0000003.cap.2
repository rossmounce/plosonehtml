                Figure 2.  Comparison of Actinarian and HEG phylogenies.
                     A. The numbers above each branch are the Bayesian posterior probabilities (again after burn-in trees discarded), and those below the branch are the support generated from a likelihood bootstrap analysis (n = 1000).
The HEG tree is unrooted (it is unknown) and displayed in such a way as to minimise the differences with the host tree.

                     B. The null distribution for the likelihood ratio test generated by evaluating Î´ for 1000 non-parametric bootstrap resampled data sets, 50% of which are drawn entirely from the host data and 50% from the HEG data.
The likelihood ratio for the observed partition is shown.
