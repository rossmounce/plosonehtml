                Figure 1.  Targeting strategy for introducing to ROSA26locus.(A). Diagram of targeting constructs to introduce Dox responsive transgenes into locus.
A1 and A2 introduce the same activator transgene in opposite orientations.
B1 and B2 introduce the same responder transgene in opposite orientations.
(B) Four different cell lines were produced with the activator and responder transgenes in different orientations (C) Southern blots probed with 5′ and 3′ flanking probes produce the correct band sizes to demonstrate appropriate targeting of constructs.
