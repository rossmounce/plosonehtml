                Figure 2.  Dox regulated gene expression works appropriately at the ROSA26 locus.(A) EGFP expression induced in A1B1 cells by addition of dox to a final concentration of 1 µgml−1.
(i) and (iii) Phase contrast.
(ii) and (iv) EGFP fluorescence (B) EGFP expression in single targeted and double targeted cell lines in reponse to 1 µgml−1 dox.
Induction of EGFP is only seen in the A1B1 cells (F(2,30) = 1167.61, p&lt;0.0001).
Each point is an average of three measurements each from two independently targeted cell lines.
Error bars denote standard deviations.
Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences.
(C) Dose response curve EGFP expression in A1B1 cells in response to dox.
