                Figure 3.  Expression level is dependent on orientation.(A) Diagram of orientation of constructs in cell lines.
(B) A1B1 and A2B2 cells induced with doxycycline (i) A1B1 phase contrast (ii) A1B1 EGFP expression (iii) A2B2 phase contrast (iv) A2B2 EGFP expression 
(C) Graph of expression levels in induced and uninduced cell lines quantitated by fluorimetry.
A2 cell lines have higher EGFP expression compared with the A1 cell lines (F(1,40) = 346.09, p&lt;0.0001).
Expression levels between the B1 and B2 cell lines were not significantly different (F(1,40) = 0.05, p = 0.8211).
Each point is an average of three measurements each from two independently targeted cell lines.
Error bars denote standard deviations.
Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences.
