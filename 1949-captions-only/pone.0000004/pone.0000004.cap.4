(C) Graph of expression levels in induced and uninduced cell lines quantitated by fluorimetry.
Expression of EGFP is higher when these cell lines have lost the selectable marker cassette (F(1,40) = 77.25, p&lt;0.0001).
The orientation of the TRE EGFP makes no difference to expression level (F(1,40) = 1.14, p = 0.2910).
Each point is an average of three measurements each from two independently targeted cell lines.
Error bars denote standard deviations. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences.
