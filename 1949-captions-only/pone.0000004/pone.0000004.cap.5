                Figure 5.  Expression level is decreased when selectable marker is removed and promoter is in same orientation as ROSA26 promoter.(A) Diagram of orientation of constructs in cell lines.
(B) Α1Β1 ανδ Α1Β1Δ cells induced with doxycycline (i) A1B1 phase contrast (ii) A1B1 EGFP expression (iii) A1B1Δ phase contrast (iv) A1B1Δ EGFP expression (C) Graph of expression levels in induced and uninduced cell lines quantitated by fluorimetry.
Expression of EGFP is lower when the selectable marker is removed from the A1 cell lines (F(1,40) = 51.77, p&lt;0.001).
Again the orientation of the TRE-EGFP makes no significant difference to the expression levels observed (F(1,40) = 0.05, p = 0.8295).
Each point is an average of three measurements each from two independently targeted cell lines.
Error bars denote standard deviations.
Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences.
