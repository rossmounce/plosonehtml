<h4>Original articles and reviews</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>A considerable number of the 100 most-cited articles in each field are apparently review articles. The distinction between original articles vs. reviews is often difficult. It may be more relevant in the biological/life sciences, where a distinctive feature may be the presentation of new data, but even this rule is not absolute. For example, <em>Ca â€“ A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</em> publishes on an annual basis extremely highly-cited papers summarizing cancer statistics. While these are original data, they are practically annual reviews of the burden of disease due to cancer. The distinction between original articles and reviews is very impractical in the physical, mathematical, and social sciences, where several fully original papers are likely to deal with theoretical, conceptual, or mathematical constructs without specific empirical data.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>Allowing for this caveat, <a href="#pone-0000005-t002">table 2</a> shows the split between reviews and original articles among the most-cited papers in three life sciences, using conventional understanding of what would constitute a review in these fields. The concentration into very few journals was very prominent both for reviews and for original articles, when these were considered separately. Diversity indices showed similar or stronger concentration in each subgroup category compared with the overall analysis. However, the order of journals in the top ranks was different in each subgroup. For example, in Pharmacology and Toxicology, the two most common journals publishing most-cited papers were exclusively review journals (<em>Pharmacology Reviews</em> and <em>Annual Reviews of Pharmacology and Toxicology</em>); <em>PNAS</em> had published the largest number of highly-cited original articles, followed by <em>Molecular Pharmacology</em> and for both of these journals, all their most-cited papers were original articles. Review specialization of journals was less prominent for most-cited papers in some other fields, such as Clinical Medicine (<a href="#pone-0000005-t002">Table 2</a>), where the three journals with the highest number of most-cited papers published both original articles and reviews. However, even in this scientific field, some journals published only most-cited reviews (e.g. <em>Ca-A Cancer Journal</em>) and others published only most-cited original articles (e.g. <em>Lancet</em> and <em>PNAS</em>).</p>
