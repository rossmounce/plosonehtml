                Figure 3.  Differentiation of E-RoSH cells.
                     In vitro differentiation a) Morphology of E-RoSH2.1 cell culture two weeks after plating E-RoSH2.1 cells on matrigel coated plate, b) The patent E-RoSH2.1 derived tubular structures were labeled with CFDA, a cytoplasmic green fluorescent dye (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) and propidium iodide, and viewed by confocal microscopy (left panel).
The tubular structures were incubated with acetylated red fluoresecent diI-labelled LDL (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) for 24 hours and counterstained with SYTOX Green™, a green fluorescent nuclear dye (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) before analysis by confocal microscopy (right panel). c–e) Immunoreactivity for vWF, Tie-2 and CD34 on sections of E-RoSH2.1 derived tubular structures. vWF immunoreactivity was visualized using HRP-based detection system.
Brown precipitates indicate positive staining.
The nuclei were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin. CD34 and Tie-2 immunoreactivities were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC.
Nuclei were counterstained with PI. f) Flow cytometry analysis of E-RoSH2.1 cells for endothelial markers before (right panels) and 60 hours after (left panels) induction of differentiation by plating cells on matrigel.
Nonspecific fluorescence was determined by incubation of similar cell aliquots with isotype-matched mouse monoclonal antibodies or with secondary antibody alone.
g) Gene expression during in vitro differentiation of E-RoSH2.1 cells on matrigel as measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
