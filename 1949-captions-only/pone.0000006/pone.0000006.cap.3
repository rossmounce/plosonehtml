                     <em>In vitro</em> differentiation a) Morphology of E-RoSH2.1 cell culture two weeks after plating E-RoSH2.1 cells on matrigel coated plate, b) The patent E-RoSH2.1 derived tubular structures were labeled with CFDA, a cytoplasmic green fluorescent dye (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) and propidium iodide, and viewed by confocal microscopy (left panel).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>The tubular structures were incubated with acetylated red fluoresecent diI-labelled LDL (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) for 24 hours and counterstained with SYTOX Green™, a green fluorescent nuclear dye (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) before analysis by confocal microscopy (right panel). c–e) Immunoreactivity for vWF, Tie-2 and CD34 on sections of E-RoSH2.1 derived tubular structures. vWF immunoreactivity was visualized using HRP-based detection system.</p>
