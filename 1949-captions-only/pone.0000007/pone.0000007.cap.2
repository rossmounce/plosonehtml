                Figure 2.  Relationships between individual variation and FA for shape and size.(A) Shape variation and FA quantified by Procrustes distance.
(B) Shape variation and FA quantified using Mahalanobis distance.
(C) Variation and FA of centroid size.
The solid lines are major axis regression lines, and the dashed lines in (A) and (C) are the theoretical limits for the situation when left and right sides are independent (FA variance is 4 times the variance among individuals; see text for details).
