                Figure 4.  Matrix correlations between the covariance matrices for individual variation and FA.(A) Matrix correlations including the diagonal blocks (variances and covariances for x and y coordinates of each landmark).
(B) Matrix correlations for covariance matrices without the diagonal blocks (only covariances among landmarks).
