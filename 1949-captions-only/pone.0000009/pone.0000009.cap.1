                Figure 1.  Signaling at the membrane through Arm phosphorylation.A, Schematic of side (left) and top (right) views of one parasegment of the epidermis of a Drosophila embryo.
Six cells produce denticles; two point anteriorly and four point posteriorly.
Hh-producing cells are green, Wg-producing cells are red, and the extent of their signaling domains are shown by the corresponding color arrows.
B–M, Phase contrast views of embryos (ventral is up and anterior is left).
B, Wild-type denticle pattern. C, armO43A01 (M/Z) mutant disintegrates due to a lack of epithelial integrity as cellular junctions deteriorate[29], [70].
D, Low levels of expression of ArmAA using the Mat15-GAL4 driver restores some epithelial integrity in an armO43A01 (M/Z) mutant.
E, Strong expression of an α-catenin/E-cadherin fusion protein rescues the armO43A01 (M/Z) mutant to a similar level (Notice that different drivers were used between D and E to obtain a similar phenotype).
F and G, Stronger expression of ArmAA using the Arm-GAL4 and Mat15-GAL4 drivers rescues most epithelial integrity, but leads to disorganization of denticle polarity.
