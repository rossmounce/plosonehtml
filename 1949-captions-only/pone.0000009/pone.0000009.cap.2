                Figure 2.  Novel phenotype of ArmAA where the planar organization of denticles is disrupted.Aâ€“C, Denticles are colored as follows: those pointing anteriorly are red, posteriorly are green, to the top of the page are blue, and to the bottom of the page are orange.
A, Wild-type parasegment showing denticle polarity.
Almost no denticles point incorrectly (i.e. those that are colored blue or orange).
B, armF1A M/Z mutant shows a slight increase in denticles that point incorrectly.
C, Approximately half of the denticles in an armO43A01 (M/Z) mutant expressing ArmAA point incorrectly (i.e. there is an approximately equal number of denticles in each of the four colors).
