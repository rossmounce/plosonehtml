                Figure 3.  The precursors of denticles, the Actin foci, are mislocalized in embryos expressing ArmAA, and the asymmetric distribution of Arm is disrupted.A–D, wild-type. E–H, armO43A01 (M/Z) mutant expressing ArmAA.
A, Actin staining shows the Actin accumulation that is the precursor to denticle formation.
B, In wild-type embryos, Arm localizes to the D/V boundaries of the smaller, rectangular-shaped cells that will produce denticles.
C, Overlay of Arm and Actin staining shows that the denticle-producing cells are smaller and rectangular.
D, Schematic of a parasegment showing that the cells that produce denticles are smaller and rectangular than the cells that do not produce denticles and that the Actin foci that will become denticles (red dots) are located on the posterior margin of the cells.
Some cells produce more than one Actin focus, but only one shown per cell for simplicity in the schematic.
E, Actin staining shows that most cells produce denticle precursors, though some cells do not.
F, Arm staining shows that the stereotypical cell-shape changes are impaired, and the asymmetric distribution of cell membrane Arm is disrupted.
