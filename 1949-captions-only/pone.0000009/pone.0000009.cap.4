                Figure 4.  Wg and Hh act as instructive signals for the orientation of denticles in the Drosophila embryonic epidermis.(Left top) Schema depicting wild-type epithelia with denticle polarity direction depicted by black arrows.
(Left middle) Schema showing that Wg (red cells) expression along the ventral midline transforms cells to naked cell-fate, and leads bordering cells to rotate their denticles toward the source of Wg.
(Left bottom) Hh (green cells) expression does not transform the cell-fate, but leads to denticles orienting away from its source.
Aâ€“I, Phase contrast views of embryos (ventral is up and anterior is left).
A, wg and B, hh mutants display relatively random planar polarity and the ventral lawn of denticles phenotype (see[19] for a detailed explanation of denticle cell fates).
C, Same image as in B, but with denticles colored according to orientation, as in Fig. 2.
Note the relatively random distribution of colors.
D and E, Ectopic expression of Wg in a stripe perpendicular to its normal pattern leads to a reorientation of denticles toward the source of Wg in both wg and hh mutants (arrows).
