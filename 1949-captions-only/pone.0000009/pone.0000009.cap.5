                Figure 5.  Wg and Hh can relocalize the Actin foci that are denticle precursors.A–D, wg. E–H, wg, Sim-GAL4/UAS-Wg. I–L, wg, Sim-GAL4/UAS-Hh.
C, Overlay of A, Actin and B, Arm staining shows that the stereotypical cell-shape changes are impaired and that all cells produce denticles.
D, Schematic showing the apparent random localization of denticle precursors (red dots).
E, Actin staining showing that expression of Wg along the ventral midline causes naked cuticle to form in some cells along the midline.
G, Overlay of E, Actin and F, Arm staining shows apparent cell-shape reorganization in cells that are transformed to the naked cell fate along the midline.
In most cells that border the cells that lack denticle precursors, the Actin foci are relocalized to the D/V margin of the cell.
H, Schematic showing the D/V localization of denticle precursors in cells that border the naked cells along the midline.
K, Overlay of I, Actin and J, Arm staining shows that in at least 8–9 rows of cells surrounding the ventral midline, the denticle precursors are consistently relocalized to the D/V margins of cells.
