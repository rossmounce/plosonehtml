                Figure 6.  Smo, Dsh and Arm are required for polarity signal transmission.A, A dsh ((M/Z)) mutant embryo showing a lawn of randomly oriented denticles.
B, Expression of Wg along the ventral midline does not affect denticle orientation in embryos that are mutant for dsh.
C, A smo (M/Z) mutant embryo also shows a lawn of denticles phenotype, and a loss of planar polarization.
D, Expression of Hh along the ventral midline in smo mutant embryos has no observable effect on the planar polarization of denticles, or on the lawn of denticles phenotype.
E, armF1A (M/Z) mutant embryos show a denticle-covered cuticle phenotype, but some patterning is preserved due to a low level of Wg nuclear signaling activity retained by this allele[29].
F, Expression of Wg along the ventral midline in some cases leads to a disruption of the patterning observed in armF1A M/Z mutants alone, and causes mispolarization of denticles.
