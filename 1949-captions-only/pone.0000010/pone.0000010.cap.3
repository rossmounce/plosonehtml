                Figure 3.  
                        emm pattern of pharyngeal GAS in Brussels and Brasília.
                        emm pattern A–C strains are throat specific, whereas emm pattern D strains have a skin tropism.

                        emm pattern E strains are found at both sites. In Brussels, strains with emm patterns A–C (56%) and E (41.5%) were predominant among strains isolated from naso-pharynx (pharyngitis and scarlet fever included).
In Brasília, the A–C pattern was rare (14%) amongst pharyngeal strains while E pattern (61.5%) and D pattern (18.5%) were predominant.
REA: rearranged emm region.
