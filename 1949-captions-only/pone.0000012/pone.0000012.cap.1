                Figure 1.  Single-step and iterative tracing on an epidemic tree, developing from left to right.Nodes are infecteds, lines are contacts, contactees that were not infected are not represented on the tree. Grey infecteds are asymptomatic, white infecteds are symptomatic, infecteds with a thick border are isolated or quarantined.
Solid lines are traceable contacts, dotted lines are untraceable contacts.
A. Single-step tracing.
In A1a-c, a symptomatic infected is isolated and his traceable contactees are quarantined.
In A2a-b (some time later), one of the quarantined infecteds got symptomatic and his traceable contactees are quarantined.
B. Iterative tracing.
In B1a-c, a symptomatic infected is isolated and all infecteds directly or indirectly linked to this infected by traceable contacts are quarantined.
All quarantined infecteds form a traceable cluster.
