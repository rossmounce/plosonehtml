                Figure 2.  The effectiveness of single-step contact tracing without tracing delays.Effectiveness is expressed as the minimum proportion of contacts that need to be traced for effective control (critical tracing probability pc
                     *).
The plots show pc
                     * as a function of the latent period relative to the mean time to detection (Ï„lat).
There are four special cases: A. Short infectious period and variable time to detection; B. Short infectious period and fixed detection time; C. Long infectious period and variable time to detection; and D. Long infectious period and fixed detection time. 
The three curves denote pc
                     * for different values of the pre-isolation reproduction ratio R
