                      = 1.5.Effectiveness is expressed as the minimum proportion of contacts that need to be traced for effective control (critical tracing probability pc
                     *).
The contour plots show pc
                     * as a function of the tracing delay δ and the latent period τlat, measured relative to the mean detection time, for four special cases: A. Short infectious period and variable incubation period; B. Short infectious period and fixed incubation period; C. Long infectious period and variable incubation period; and D. Long infectious period and fixed incubation period.
