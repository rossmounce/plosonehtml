                Figure 4.  The effectiveness of single-step and iterative contact tracing for control of influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease.Effectiveness is expressed as the minimum proportion of contacts that need to be traced for effective control (critical tracing probability pc
                     *); pc
                     * is plotted as a function of the relative delay (Î´, proportion of the incubation period) or the absolute delay (days).
