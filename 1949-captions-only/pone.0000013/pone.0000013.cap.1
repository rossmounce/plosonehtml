                Figure 1.  Shematic representation of pFlox hVEGF-A165 cassette, where VEGF expression is activated by Cre-mediated excision of STOP cassette and expression of human hVEGF-A165 in vitro after AdCre mediated transduction of NIH-3T3 cells with plasmid loxP-STOP-hVEGF-A165. CAG = CMV-IE enhancer+chicken β-actin promoter; triangle = loxP, a 34 bp long recombination sequence; STOP = DNA element to prevent VEGF expression; hVEGF-A = human VEGF-A165 cDNA; pA = rabbit β-globin polyadenylation signal.
