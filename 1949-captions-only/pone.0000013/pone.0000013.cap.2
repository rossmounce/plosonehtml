                Figure 2.  Edema after AdCre mediated local gene transfer detected by MRI and results from human and mouse ELISA analyses after local GT. Discrete edema (white areas pointed with arrows) is clearly visible between day 1 and day 7 under the skin in T2 weighted MRI images in the transduced leg muscles, their fascias, and in the fat tissue within the transduced muscles.ELISA assays were done as described in the Methods.
