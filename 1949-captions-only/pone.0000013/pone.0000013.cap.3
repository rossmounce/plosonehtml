                Figure 3.  Expression of human and mouse VEGF-A after AdCre gene transfer in vivo.A. hVEGF-A165 ELISA from sera after AdCre gene transfer.
B. ASAT values in transgenic and control mice after AdCre gene transfer.
C. CRP values in transgenic and control mice after AdCre gene transfer.
D. Expression of hVEGF-A165 mRNA using RT-PCR.
Lanes; 1 = Aorta, 2 = pancreas, 3 = kidney, 4 = heart, 5 = spleen, 6 = liver, 7 = positive control and 8 = liver without RT (500 bp pointed with an arrow).
&lt;500 and &gt;500 in B and C refer to hVEGF-A165 serum levels in two subgroups of transgenic mice.
