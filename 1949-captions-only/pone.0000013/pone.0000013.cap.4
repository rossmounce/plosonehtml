                Figure 4.  Short term histopathological changes in the liver four weeks after gene transfer.A. Increased number of capillaries showing branching and sprouting (CD 34 immunostaining).
Insert: PCNA immunostaining in nuclei correlated positively with the degree of angiogenesis.
B. Control liver only revealed weak positivity in hepatic vein branches (CD 34 immunostaining).
C. Details of neovascularization in the liver: formation of glomeruloid bodies and enhanced sprouting and branching (pointed with arrows, CD 34 immunostaining).
D. Vascularization and proliferation in livers after AdCre gene transfer.
ELISA values refer to two subgroups of mice with low and high hVEGF-A165 levels in serum.
Bar: A insert, C–50 µm; B–100 µm. GT: gene transfer, cap/mm2: capillaries/mm2, NF: not found, * p&lt;0,05.
