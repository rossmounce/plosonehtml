                Figure 5.  Long-term histopathological changes after activation of hVEGF-A165 expression.A. Liver: Dilated hepatic vein branches and mild dilatation of the sinuses (marked with *) (Haematoxylin-eosin).
B. Liver: focal basophilic hyperplasia consisting of fat-filled hepatocytes (pointed with arrows), (Haematoxylin-eosin).
C. Heart: epicardial calcification in ventricular myocardium (pointed with an arrow), (Haematoxylin-eosin, insert Alizarin RedS staining specific for calcium).
D. Control heart. (Haematoxylin-eosin).
E. Heart: ventricular myocardium revealed discrete edema and dilatation of subepicardial vessels (CD 31 immunostaining).
F. Tuba uterina revealed high vascularization and focally dilated venules and arterioles (pointed with arrows), (CD 31 immunostaining).
G. Pancreas with focally increased vasculature (Haematoxylin-eosin).
H. Control pancreas. (Haematoxylin-eosin).
