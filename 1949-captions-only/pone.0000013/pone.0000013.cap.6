                Figure 6.  Major changes after 16-months after activation of hVEGF-A165 expression.A. Liver: Encapsulated hepatocellular carcinoma was highly necrotic and focally calcified (Haematoxylin-eosin).
B. Lung: Papillary adenocarcinoma. (Haematoxylin-eosin).
C. Macroscopical changes in liver (box shows the area of the microscopical sections in F–H).
D. Macroscopical changes in spleen, control spleen on the left (microscopical sections in I–K).
E. Macroscopical changes in paratubarian area (microscopical sections in L–N).
F. Cavernous hemangioma featuring focal hyalinization.
G. The same tumor mass area with higher magnification (haematoxylin-eosin).
H. Weak focal hVEGF-A165 immunoreactivity was present in the same area (True Blue as a chromogen), arrows indicate positive cells.
