                Figure 1.  Schematic illustrations of the methodological approaches used.A. Time schedule of CPP procedure: 120 min of baseline recording without food in all-white tank, followed by 60 min of recording after food administration.
Red color was present for 15 min, starting 5 min prior to food administration.
B. CPA procedure: Each day, zebrafish behavior was recorded first in the test tank with all white walls (5 min), then for 5 min after half of the tank walls changed to red color.
Horizontal black bars - stimulating electrodes. Electric shock (yellow “lightening”) delivered only in the red zone.
C. T-maze with Start and Choice zones, inserted color filters and deep water end compartments.
The apparatus (30 mm water level) included a starting zone, 40 × 30 mm, separated from the rest of the maze by a transparent removable partition.
Behind the partition, there was a long 80 × 20 mm arm and two short 60 × 20 mm arms, which lead to the removable deep water chambers (85 mm water level).
