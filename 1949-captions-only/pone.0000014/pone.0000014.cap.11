                Figure 11.  Conditioned place avoidance (CPA) in wild-type young (A) and middle-aged (B) zebrafish.Y-axis: % time spent in the red zone of the test tank at Baseline (BL), during Conditioning and Extinction phases of the study.
Conditioning phase: * p&lt;0.00001 for main group and training day effects; no significant difference between age groups.
Extinction phase: between group comparison: p&lt;0.0003, &lt;0.0001 and &lt;0.0001 for day 4, 5 and 6, respectively; within middle-aged group comparison, relative to Baseline, p&lt;0.01, NS and NS for day 4, 5 and 6 respectively; within young group, p&lt;0.0001, NS and &lt;0.02 for day 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
