                Figure 2.  Development of anticipatory increase in locomotor activity prior to food administration in wildtype (A) and ACHE mutants (B) of different age, and in IR zebrafish (C).X-axis: % change in activity level within 30 min prior to food administration, as compared to preceding 90-min period.
First day of significant (p&lt;.05) change in group behavior in young (*) and middle-aged (**) fish.
Note that BL was assessed after 7 days of new timing of daily food administration in white/white environment.
Young fish – diamond, middle-aged fish – square, old fish – triangle.
Wildtype – black; ACHE mutants – green; IR zebrafish – orange.
