                Figure 4.  Baseline locomotor activity level is significantly reduced in middle-aged (2 years old) and old (3 year old) fish, compared to young (1 year old) zebrafish.Y axis: mean distance traversed. Solid color of each bar – slow motion; diagonal part –fast motion.
* p&lt;0.05 for comparisons between young and middle-aged, and p&lt;0.001 between young and old zebrafish.
No significant difference between two older groups.
