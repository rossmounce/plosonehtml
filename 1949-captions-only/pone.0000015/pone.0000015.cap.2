                Figure 2.  ES cells maintain the undifferentiated phenotype on E-cad-Fc-coated plates.(A) R1 cells cultured for 5 days in the presence or absence of LIF were stained with anti-Oct-3/4-specific antibody.
In the presence of LIF, there was nuclear staining of Oct-3/4 in cells cultured on both gelatinized plates or E-cad-Fc-coated plates.
(B) The expression of 3 genes that are markers of the undifferentiated state was analyzed by RT-PCR.
