                Figure 3.  Pluripotency of ES cells on E-cad-Fc-coated surface.(A) R1 cells were maintained on gelatin or E-cad-Fc for 26 days, and then were cultured to form embryoid bodies.
After 14 days culture of embryoid bodies, expression of marker genes was analyzed by RT-PCR.
Lane 1: undifferentiated cells; lane 2: on gelatin; lane 3: on E-cad-Fc.
(B and C) Characterization of teratomas from ES cells (EB3) cultured on an E-cad-Fc-coated surface.
(B) H&amp;E staining of teratomas showed the differentiation into ectoderm (epidermis), mesoderm (cartilage, and striated muscle cells) and endoderm (ciliated columnar epithelium, possibly bronchial epithelium).
Differentiation into ectoderm was confirmed by specific staining for the neural markers βIII-tubulin, GFAP, Neurofilament-M and GAP-43 (C).
Scale bar indicates 50 µm.
(D) EB3 cells cultured on gelatin- or E-cad-Fc-coated dishes for 15 days were introduced into approximately 100 blastocysts of C57BL/6 (B6) mice in each group, which yielded 4 and 7 heads of chimera pups, respectively.
