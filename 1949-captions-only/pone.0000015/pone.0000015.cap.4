                Figure 4.  Effect of LIF concentration on the maintenance of undifferentiated state on ES cells.(A) R1 cells were cultured for 5 days in the presence of various doses of LIF (0–1,000 units/ml), on E-cad-Fc-coated plates (open bars) or gelatin-coated plates (closed bars).
Then cells were replated onto gelatin-coated plates and three days later, the ratios of ES cell colonies with high ALP activity were estimated.
*:P&lt;0.05 vs. gelatinized plate in the presence of 1,000 units/ml LIF.
#:P&lt;0.05 for ES cells cultured on E-cad-Fc-coated plates versus gelatinized plate in the presence of same concentration of LIF.
(B) The maintenance of the pluripotent efficiency of ES cells, which was cultured on an E-cad-Fc-coated surface at a low concentration of LIF (100 units/ml), was assessed by the characterisation of teratomas.
ES (EB3) cells were maintained on E-cad-Fc-coated surface in the presence of 100 units/ml of LIF and then transplanted into mouse testis.
H&amp;E staining of teratomas showed the differentiation into ectoderm (epidermis: top right, bar: 100 µm), mesoderm (striated muscle cells: top left, and cartilage: top centre, bar: 100 µm, inset: 10 µm) and endoderm (ciliated columnar epithelium, possibly bronchial epithelium: bottom left, bar: 50 µm, inset: 10 µm).
Differentiation into ectoderm was confirmed by specific staining for the neural markers GAP-43 (bottom centre) and Neurofilament-M (bottom right).
