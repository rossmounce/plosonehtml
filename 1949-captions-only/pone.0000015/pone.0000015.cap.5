                Figure 5.  ES cells show higher proliferation and higher transfection efficiency on the E-cad-Fc-coated surface.(A) The proliferative activity of ES cells on a gelatin- or E-cad-Fc-coated surface was evaluated.
EB3 cells were seeded on gelatin-coated (open square) or E-cad-Fc-coated (filled square) dishes and the cell number was counted after staining with alamar Blue reagent.
The data indicate means±SD of experiments (n = 3). **:P&lt;0.01 versus gelatinized plates.
(B) BrdU incorporation of EB3 cells under colony-forming (on gelatin) or scattering conditions (on E-cad-Fc).
Relative BrdU incorporation value was evaluated.
The data indicate means±SEM. §:P&lt;0.001.
(C) Transfection efficiency of ES3 cells cultured on gelatin- or E-cad-Fc-coated surface.
Relative expression of GFP was evaluated.
