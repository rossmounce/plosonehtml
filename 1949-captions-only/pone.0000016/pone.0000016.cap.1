                Figure 1.  Expression pattern and subcellular distribution of TORC1 in rat hippocampal neurons.(A) Northern blotting analysis of TORC1 mRNA in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum of adult rat brain.
28S and 18S RNA were used as a control for RNA loading.
(B) Western blotting of protein extracts from hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum of adult rat using TORC1 antibody.
Equivalent protein loading was confirmed by probing the same blots with beta-actin antibody.
(C) In situ hybridization analysis of TORC1 mRNA expression from coronal section of adult rat brain.
(D) Immunohistochemical analysis of TORC1 subcellular distribution in CA1 region of rat hippocampal neurons (upper panel), Hochest 33324 was used for nuclear staining (middle panel), merged image (lower panel).
Scale bar: 20 Âµm.
