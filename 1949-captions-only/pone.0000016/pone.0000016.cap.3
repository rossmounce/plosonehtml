                Figure 3.  Requirement of TORC1 for CRE-driven gene transcription in cultured hippocampal neurons.(A) Statistical analysis of CRE-luciferase activity from neurons transfected with indicated plasmids that were left unstimulated or stimulated with high KCl.
(B) Statistical analysis of BDNF mRNA level from EGFP, WT-TORC1, DN-TORC1 infected hippocampal neurons that were left unstimulated or stimulated with high KCl, GAPDH mRNA of each sample was used as loading control.
(C) Representative Western blotting analysis of phospho-CREB (P-CREB) level from EGFP, WT-TORC1, DN-TORC1 infected neurons that were left unstimulated or stimulated with high KCl for 5 min.
Protein loading was confirmed by probing the same blot with CREB antibody.
(D) Statistical analysis of phospho-CREB (P-CREB) level from EGFP, WT-TORC1, DN-TORC1 infected neurons from four independent experiments.
*, p &lt; 0.05, compared to non-stimulated control group.
In both (A) and (B), data were obtained from three independent experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate.
Error bars indicate SEM.
