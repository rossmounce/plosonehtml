                Figure 4.  TORC1 nuclear translocation correlates with L-LTP induction.(A). Immunohistochemical staining of TORC1 after basal stimulation (upper panel), 1×HFS (middle panel) and 4×HFS (lower panel).
(B) Immunohistochemical staining of phospho-CREB (P-CREB) after basal stimulation (upper panel), 1×HFS (middle panel) and 4×HFS (lower panel).
Scale bar, 20 µm.
(C). Quantitative analysis of TORC1 immunohistochemical staining after indicated stimulation.
(D) Quantitative analysis of phospho-CREB level after indicated stimulation.
In both (C) and (D), data were obtained from at least eight slices collected from three independent experiments.
*, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01 relative to basal group.
