                Figure 5.  Requirement of TORC1 for L-LTP in hippocampal slices.(A) Representative picture of EGFP infected slice used in electrophysiological recordings.
Scale bar: 100 µm.
(B) Statistical analysis of input-output ratio from control slices and slices infected with DN-TORC1 or WT-TORC1.
(C) DN-TORC1 but not EGFP infection blocked the maintenance of L-LTP as compared with EGFP infected slices and non-infected control slices (percent baseline, at 3 h, DN-TORC1  =  109.2% ± 6.5 vs EGFP  =  178.3 ± 10.2 and Control  =  176.9 % ± 13.4).
(D) WT-TORC1 infection switched E-LTP into L-LTP, DN-TORC1 infection did not affect E-LTP (at 3 h, WT-TORC1  =  145.6 % ± 10.7 vs Control  =  102.8 % ± 6.2 and DN-TORC1  =  103.0 ± 7.5).
Scale bar: 300 µV, 10 ms.
In both (C) and (D), representative fEPSP traces taken at the times indicated (1 and 2) are shown at top, arrows indicate the time of HFS.
