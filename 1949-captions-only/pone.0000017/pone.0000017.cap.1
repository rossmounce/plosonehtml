                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic analysis of SAR-1 and the cultivable ST102 isolates.Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated MLST loci was performed on a collection of representative B. cepacia complex strains as described [11].

                     B. cepacia complex Group K, its separation into two clusters (A and B), and the position of the ST102 clones and SAR-1 metagenome.
The positions of the genome reference strains, B. cepacia complex Group K strain 383 and B. cenocepacia J2315, are also indicated.
Bootstrap values and genetic distance scale are shown.
