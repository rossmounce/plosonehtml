                Figure 2.  Macrorestriction analysis of the cultivable ST102 strains.The genomic macrorestriction fingerprint profiles resulting from restriction digestion with SpeI (Panel A) and XbaI (Panel B) are shown for the following strains in each lane: 1, LMG 23255, 2, LMG 23250, 3, LMG 23251, and 4, LMG 23253.
Molecular size markers were run in the lane M and the size of relevant bands is indicated in kb.
