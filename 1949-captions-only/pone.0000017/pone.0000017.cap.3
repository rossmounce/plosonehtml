                Figure 3.  Genomic distribution of Burkholderia SAR-1 and B. cepacia 383 genes homologous to B. cenocepacia J2315.The distribution of homologous genes (blue) and absent genes (yellow) are shown for each B. cepacia complex Group K genome (indicated on the right).
The panels correspond to the three J2315 chromosomes (chromosome number indicated on the left).
