                Figure 1.  JAK2 V617F induces polycythemia through autonomous overproduction of erythrocytes.(A–C): Hematocrit (A), blood hemoglobin (B), and reticulocyte counts (C) from cohorts of Balb/c or B6 mice transplanted with syngeneic BM cells transduced with empty vector (green, n = 2), or retrovirus expressing murine JAK2 WT (blue, n = 10) or JAK2 V617F (red, n = 15).
In the case of the B6 cohorts, untransplanted mice (“Normal”, n = 4) were used instead of empty vector controls.
The difference between JAK2 V617F and JAK2 WT recipients was significant (unpaired t-test) for hematocrit (P&lt;0.0001 for Balb/c and P = 0.0071 for B6), hemoglobin (P = 0.0011 for Balb/c and P = 0.0024 for B6), and reticulocytes (P&lt;0.0001 for Balb/c and P = 0.0195 for B6), while there were no significant differences between vector and JAK2 WT recipients.
(D) Reticulocyte stains of peripheral blood from recipients of BM transduced with JAK2 WT (left) or JAK2 V617F (right).
(E–F): Erythrocyte survival curves (E) and red cell mass determination (F) for the three groups (Balb/c background).
The red cell mass of JAK2 V617F recipients was significantly greater than that of recipients of vector- or JAK2 WT-transduced BM (P = 0.0068 and P = 0.0009, respectively, unpaired t-test).
(G) Plasma Epo levels for the three groups (B6 background).
The mean Epo level (bar) of JAK2 V617F recipients was significantly lower than that of recipients of vector- or JAK2 WT-transduced BM (P = 0.0048 and P = 0.0151, respectively, unpaired t-test).
