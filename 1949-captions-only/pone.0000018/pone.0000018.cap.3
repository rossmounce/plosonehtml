                Figure 3.  Histopathological characterization of the MPD induced by JAK2 V617F.(A–C): Hematoxylin and eosin stains (magnification 500×) of BM (A), spleen (B), and liver (C) from representative polycythemic recipients of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM.
In the spleen, a lymphoid follicle (f) and an area of erythroid hyperplasia (e) are indicated.
The same tissues from recipients of JAK2 WT-transduced BM showed no pathological changes compared with normal controls (data not shown).
(D) Wright-Giemsa stains (top panels) and acetylcholinesterase stains (bottom panels) of purified megakaryocytes from recipients of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM (right panels) or normal control mice (left panels).
Note the preponderance of small megakaryocytes from JAK2 V617F recipients, some of which are undergoing proplatelet formation (arrowheads), accompanied by abnormal mitoses with low apparent ploidy (insert).
(E) Flow cytometric analysis of BM and spleen from a representative recipient of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM, stained with the indicated hematopoietic lineage antigens.
The mean fluorescence intensity of GFP expressed from JAK2 retroviral provirus was reproducibly and significantly lower than the GFP fluorescence of a comparable BCR-ABL retrovirus (data not shown).
Note the shift of GFP+/lo erythropoiesis (TER-119+) from BM to spleen and the expression of GFP in low abundance CD41+ megakaryocytes.
