                Figure 4.  Constitutive activation of signaling pathways by JAK2 V617F.(Aâ€“B): Western blot analysis of primary myeloerythroid cell extracts from control (normal) mice and recipients of JAK2 WT- and JAK2 V617F-transduced BM.
(A) Activated JAK2 (anti-pY1007/10008, top panel) and total JAK2 (middle panel) blots.
Note that JAK2 V617F is modestly overexpressed and constitutively active.
Anti-actin immunoblot demonstrating equivalent protein loading is at the bottom.
(B) Constitutive activation of Stat5, Gab2, and ERK, with overexpression of Bcl-XL in spleen cells from JAK2 V617F recipients.
Primary myeloerythroid cell extracts from mice in (A) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies against total or phosphorylated Stat5, Gab2, ERK, and against Bcl-X.
(C) Oligo- to polyclonal MPD in recipients of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM.
Genomic DNA from spleens of individual JAK2 V617F recipients sacrificed at the indicated times post-transplant were analyzed with a radioactive GFP probe that detects a distinct band from each proviral integration event.
