                Figure 5.  Evolution of JAK2 V617F-induced polycythemia to “spent” phase with myelofibrosis.(A) Box-style plots of hematocrit (red squares, left axis) and reticulocyte counts (blue triangles, right axis) in a cohort (n = 12) of Balb/c recipients of syngeneic JAK2 V617F-transduced BM, followed for over eight months after transplantation.
Similar data were observed for a B6 cohort (data not shown).
(B) Increasing fibrosis (demonstrated by reticulin staining) in spleen (left panels) and BM (right panels) of representative JAK2 V617F recipients at about 3 months (middle panels) and 7 months (bottom panels) after transplantation.
Note the marked increase in reticulin staining at 7 months in the JAK2 V617F recipients, but not in recipients of JAK2 WT-transduced BM (top panels).
(C): Efficient transfer of the PV-like MPD by transplantation of BM from primary mice sacrificed either in the early, polycythemic phase (left, n = 3, sacrificed 72–167 days post-transplant) or the late, myelofibrotic phase (right, n = 2, sacrificed 208 days post-transplant), to lethally irradiated syngeneic secondary recipients (n = 6 for early phase and n = 4 for late phase).
The graphs depict mean hematocrit (black, left axis), reticulocyte count (white, right axis) and peripheral blood leukocyte count (grey, right axis) of the donors at the time of sacrifice, and of the recipients at day 30–70 post-transplant.
For transplants performed in the late phase of the disease, the hematocrit and reticulocyte counts of recipients were significantly higher than of the donors (P = 0.0407 and P = 0.0337, respectively, unpaired t-test), while there was no significant difference between donors and recipients transplanted in the early phase.
