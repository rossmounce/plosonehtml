                Figure 7.  Polycythemia and reticulocytosis induced by JAK2 V617F responds to kinase inhibitor therapy.(A) Hematocrit (left panel) and reticulocyte counts (right panel) of cohorts of mice treated with twice daily oral gavage with 100 mg/kg imatinib (n = 3), 10 mg/kg dasatinib (n = 4), or vehicle (n = 2), determined before initiation of therapy (white bars, “pre”) or after 2 weeks of treatment (black bars, “post”).
The hematocrit and reticulocyte count were significantly decreased in response to imatinib therapy (P = 0.0267 and P = 0.0053, respectively, unpaired t-test), while imatinib had no effect on these parameters in normal mice (data not shown).
(B) Inhibition of Ba/F3 parental cells grown in IL-3 (green squares) or Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (magenta triangles) or JAK2 V617F (red circles) grown without IL-3 by JAK Inhibitor I (left) or AG-490 (right).
Note that both JAK Inhibitor I and AG-490 inhibit IL-3-dependent proliferation of parental Ba/F3 cells, but only AG-490 inhibits the growth of BCR-ABL-expressing cells, as previously reported [48].
(C) Hematocrit (left panel) and reticulocyte counts (right panel) of mice treated with continuous parenteral administration of 300 µg/day AG-490 (n = 3) or vehicle (n = 2), determined before initiation of therapy (white bars), or after 2 weeks of treatment (black bars).
The hematocrit and reticulocyte count were significantly decreased in response to AG-490 therapy (P = 0.0134 and P = 0.0374, respectively, unpaired t-test).
There was no significant effect of AG-490 on the hematocrit or reticulocyte count of recipients of JAK2 WT-transduced BM (data not shown).
