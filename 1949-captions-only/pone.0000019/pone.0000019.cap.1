                Figure 1.  Gene expression is significantly altered in NPC1 fibroblasts.(A) Supervised hierarchical clustering of the top 200 genes after SAM analysis.
The dendrogram at the top shows clustering of NPC and control fibroblasts into distinct groups.
Genes with higher expression are shown in red; genes with lower expression are shown in green.
Gray bars indicate missing data.
Cell lines clustered in the following order (left to right): control lines AG10803, GM05659, GM09503, GM03726; NPC-1 lines GM017909, 59413, 83.16, and GM18453.
(B) Significance Analysis of Microarrays [12] was used to identify genes that varied in expression between NPC fibroblasts and control fibroblasts from healthy patients.
The plot of the data from 43,000 elements reveals approximately 3600 significant genes that have increased expression in NPC fibroblasts (shown in red).
