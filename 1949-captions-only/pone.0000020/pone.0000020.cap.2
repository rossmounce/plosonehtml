                Figure 2.  (A) Basic S-E-I-R compartmental model of infectious disease, in which outbreak dynamics are represented by the number of individuals in four compartments corresponding to susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed (or recovered) individuals.The rate at which individuals move from susceptible to exposed is according to mass-action dynamics with proportionality constant α.
Individuals move from exposed to infectious at rate η and from infectious to removed at rate γ.
(B) By assuming that the number of susceptible individuals is approximately constant (an appropriate approximation for outbreaks in which prevalence is never a large fraction of the total population) we introduce the new variable β = αS and reduce the four-compartment S-E-I-R model to a two-compartment model, designated here by the state variables X and Y.&nbsp;
