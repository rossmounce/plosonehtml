                Figure 4.  Average daily removal rate of infectious individuals (γ) increased consistently for eight weeks following the initial outbreak of SARS in Singapore in 2003.Average infectious period obtained as g = 1/γ.
Error bars are 95% confidence intervals calculated from the t-distribution given the mean and standard deviation of observed intervals between onset of clinical symptoms and removal.
Confidence intervals are not provided for week 0, where only one case was observed (so zero degrees of freedom), or week 8, where the combination of high standard deviation in the observed interval (s.d.: 1.9) and few degrees of freedom (d.f.: 5) results in a nonsensical confidence interval that includes zero and negative values.
