                Figure 5.  Plot of standardized residuals vs. leverage for nine observations used in the statistical model.One point (corresponding to week 8, in the upper right hand corner of the plot) exhibits high leverage and falls outside the Cook's distance contour at C = 1.
As this point may have unduly influenced the estimated model, the full and reduced models were re-fit to the data excluding this point.
