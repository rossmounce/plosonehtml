                Figure 6.  Relationship between the average latent period (x-axis) and average total outbreak size in simulations (y-axis).Latent period is log2 transformed (to illustrate a wide range of possible values) and ranges from 1 d to 4096 d (~11 y).
The approximate location of SARS is indicated by the arrow.
