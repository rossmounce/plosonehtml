                Figure 1.  Es1e SCID mice injected intravenously with neuroblastoma cells develop multiple disseminated tumors.SK-N-AS cells (5Ã—105) transduced to express luciferase were injected into tail veins.
One month following injection of tumor cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally with luciferin and imaged using a Xenogen IVIS imaging system, according the directions of the manufacturer.
Multiple tumors were present in 100% of mice.
Two representative mice are shown.
