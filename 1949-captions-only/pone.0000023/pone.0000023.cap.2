                Figure 2.  Schematic diagram of the protocol for NDEPT.Human neuroblastoma tumor cells are injected intravenously to produce disseminated tumors.
At an appropriate time after injection of neuroblastoma cells, neural stem cells or neural progenitor cells transduced with adenovirus to express a prodrug-activating enzyme (in this study, a secreted form of rabbit carboxylesterase [rCE]) are injected intravenously.
Following migration of stem cells or progenitor cells to tumor foci and a delay of 3â€“4 days to allow relatively high level expression of the prodrug-activating enzyme into the extracellular milieu at the tumor sites, mice are treated with the prodrug (in this study, CPT-11).
The prodrug is activated selectively at tumor foci, to increase the therapeutic index of the prodrug.
