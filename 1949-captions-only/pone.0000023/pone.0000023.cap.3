                Figure 3.  HB1.F3.C1 cells injected intravenously localize to micrometastatic human NB-1643 neuroblastoma tumors in the liver of a mouse.(A) Dissected liver from a representative animal with hepatic metastases; the animal was sacrificed two days following injection of HB1.F3.C1 cells into the tail vein.
(B) Low- and (C) high-power magnification of a section of tumor-involved liver, stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Tumor cells appear dark purple (black arrows); normal tissue appears pink.
(D) Liver section stained with an anti-human mitochondrial protein antibody and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Tumor micrometastases stain dark brown (red arrows); normal liver tissue is purple.
(E) Immunofluorescence microscopy of liver section.
HB1.F3.C1 cells were CM-DiI-labeled prior to injection and are evident as red cells.
The liver section was stained with DAPI; tumor foci are identified by areas of densely-packed DAPI-stained tumor cell nuclei.
