                Figure 4.  HB1.F3.C1 cells target macroscopic metastatic neuroblastoma in the bone marrow.X-ray image of hind limb of a mouse with advanced stage neuroblastoma (Day 82; left panel, scale bar: 1 cm).
Confirmation of the tumor mass as human SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells was performed by immunohistochemistry using anti-human mitochondria antibody (not shown).
The CM-DiI-labeled HB1.F3.C1 cells (red cells, injected into the tail vein 3 days prior to sacrifice) localized to tumor in the marrow (right panel; scale bar: 200 Âµm).
