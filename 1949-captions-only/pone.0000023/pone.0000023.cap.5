                Figure 5.  HB1.F3.C1 cells injected intravenously localized to microscopic bone marrow disease.Concordant detection of v-myc (HB1.F3.C1 cells) by PCR and TH expression (neuroblastoma cells) by RT-PCR in bone marrow specimens.
Bone marrow samples isolated from animals injected with HB1.F3.C1 cells were analyzed for the presence of v-myc (HB1.F3.C1 cells) or the expression of TH (NB-1643 cells).
HB1.F3.C1 cells were present in the bone marrow only when tumor cells were also present.
HB1.F3.C1 cells were not detected in the bone marrow of non-tumor-bearing animals.
The positive controls (+) were DNA extracted from HB1.F3.C1 cells for v-myc, and RNA extracted from NB-1691 cells for TH.
The negative controls (âˆ’) contained no DNA or RNA template, respectively.
