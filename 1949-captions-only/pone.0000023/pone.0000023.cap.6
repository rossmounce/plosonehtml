                Figure 6.  Mice bearing microscopic NB-1643 tumors were injected intravenously with 2 million HB1.F3.C1 cells pre-labeled with CM-DiI Red Cell Tracker.Normal and tumor-bearing organs were harvested, sectioned, and stained with DAPI. HB1.F3.C1 cells were not detected in normal (A) brain, (B) kidney, (C) heart, (D) intestine, or (E) skin tissue.
Rare, single, HB1.F3.C1 cells (white arrows) were seen in (F) lung, (G) liver and (H) spleen.
Scale bars: 200 µm (A–E), 100 µm (F–H).
