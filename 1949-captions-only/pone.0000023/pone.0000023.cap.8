                Figure 8.  Treatment protocol of HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE/CPT-11 NDEPT.One day prior to being used in treatments, cells were transduced with the AdCMVrCE construct (see text).
The treatment schedule was based on the time-course of expression of the secreted form of rCE, following adenoviral transduction of HB1.F3.C1 cells (Danks, unpublished observation) and on a schedule of administration of CPT-11 that has been shown to be relatively effective for neuroblastoma patients [35].
