                Figure 9.  Therapeutic efficacy of rCE/CPT-11 NDEPT.Mice (10/group) received one of the following: 1) 2 million HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced with AdCMVrCE (MOI = 20) encoding a secreted form of rCE; 2) CPT-11 (7.5 mg/kg) alone; 3) transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells and CPT-11 (7.5 mg/kg).
Animals that received HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE cells with CPT-11 survived significantly longer than mice receiving only HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE cells (P&lt;0.0001) or only CPT-11 (P&lt;0.001), suggesting an enhanced tumor targeting and tumor cell-killing effect of CPT-11.
