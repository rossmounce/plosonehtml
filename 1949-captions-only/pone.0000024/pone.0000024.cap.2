                Figure 2.  Sequential analysis of antibody responses against the whole viral lysates (A), N protein (B), and pseudotyped virus with S protein (C) of SARS-CoV in 30 recovered patients over 2-year period.Serum samples were diluted 100- and 900-fold prior to ELISA and neutralization studies.
Both dilutions were used to carried out experiments presented in (B) and (C), where the only 100-fold diluted serum were used for experiments presented in (A).
The top and bottom of each rectangular box denote the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, with the median shown inside the box.
Horizontal bars extending from each box represent the 90th and 10th percentiles.
Significant differences between samples are indicated by grey stars with their respective p values.
Otherwise no significance was found.
