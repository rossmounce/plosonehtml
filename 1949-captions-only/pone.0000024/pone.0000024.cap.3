                Figure 3.  Sequential analysis of CTL responses against a pool of peptides derived from N protein in 30 recovered patients over 2-year period.(A) The average number of spot forming cells (SFC) per million of PBMC from recovered patients at month 3, 12, and 18 post onset of symptom.
No significant differences were found among these samples.
The top and bottom of each rectangular box denote the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, with the median shown inside the box.
Horizontal bars extending from each box represent the 90th and 10th percentiles.
(B) The average number of SFC per million of PBMC against various pools of N protein peptides (open rectangle) and percent of PBMC samples recognizing various pools of N protein peptides (closed rectangle).
An arbitrary line was draw at 3000 SFC per million PBMC to identify peptide pools that are preferentially recognized by the recovered patients in this cohort.
