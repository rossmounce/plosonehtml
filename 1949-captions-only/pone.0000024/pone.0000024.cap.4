                Figure 4.  The actual composition and cross-broad layout of each peptide pools derived from the N protein (upper panel).The 57 peptides (one is not listed) were pooled into 15 groups, 7 of which (NX1-7) are listed vertically and 8 are (NY1-8) listed horizontally.
The actual amino acid residue sequences preferentially recognized by the recovered patients are highlighted (lower panel), which correspond to residue sequences between position number 211 to 235 and 330 to 354.
