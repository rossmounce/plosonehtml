                     The effect of DTT and vitamin C on NO-release and eNOS activation in endothelial cells.(A): Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and stimulated with increasing concentrations of DTT and vitamin C for 1 hour and NO measured in the supernatants.
(B): Total NO release from PAEC following 1 hour incubation with 500 µM DTT and vitamin C in the absence or presence of the NOS inhibitor, L-NNA (500 µM).
NO was measured directly using a Sievers NOA 280 chemiluminescene analyzer and the results were corrected for background levels of NO present in the medium.
Results are the mean (±SEM, bars) of two experiments (n = 12), *p&lt;0.01 versus control.
(C): Western blots showing the effect of increasing concentrations of DTT, vitamin C or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on the phosphorylation of eNOS (phospho-eNOS) at serine-1177 in PAEC after 15 min.
(D): Western blot showing the presence of S-nitrosylated proteins of PAEC pre-treated with 30 µM SNAP (lanes 1–3) or vehicle (lane 4) for 1 hour and then incubated with 500 µmol/L DTT (lane 2) or 500 µM vitamin C (lane 3) or vehicle (lanes 1 and 4) for 1 hour.
