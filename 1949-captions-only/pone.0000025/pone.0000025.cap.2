                      tube formation.
                     A Endothelial cells grown on growth factor-reduced Matrigel were stimulated with (I) the vehicle alone (control) and with (II) 10, (III) 100, (IV) 200, (V) 500, and (VI) 1000 ÂµM DTT.
Cells were observed 24 hours after stimulation and results recorded digitally.
