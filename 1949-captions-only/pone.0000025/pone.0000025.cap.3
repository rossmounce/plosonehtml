                Figure 3.  
                     The long-term effect of DTT on capillary-like tube formation.
                     A Porcine aortic endothelial cells were seeded on growth factor-reduced Matrigel and stimulated with the vehicle alone for 1 day (I) or 1 mM DTT (II–V) and observed at (II) 1, (III) 7, (IV) 14, (V) 21, and (VI) 28 days.

                     B Histograms showing the quantitative analysis of the mean total tube length per 40× field.
Results are the mean (±SEM, bars) of three different fields.
