                Figure 4.  
                     The effect of vitamin C on capillary-like tube formation.
                     A Porcine aortic endothelial cells seeded on growth factor-reduced Matrigel were stimulated with either the vehicle alone (I), 10 µM CuSO4 (II), 200 µM vitamin C (III), 200 µM vitamin C and 10 µM CuSO4 (IV), 500 µmol/L mmol/L vitamin C (V) and 500 µM vitamin C and 10 µM CuSO4 (VI), for 24 hours.

                     B Histogram showing the mean total tube length per 40× field.
The results are the mean (±SEM, bars) of three different fields of three independent experiments.
