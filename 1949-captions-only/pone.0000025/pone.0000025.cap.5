                     DTT-induced capillary-like tube formation is dependent on guanylyl cyclase and PKG activity.Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) plated on growth factor-reduced Matrigel were pre-incubated for 30 minutes with the NOS inhibitors, L-NNA (500 µM) and L-NIO (10 µM), guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10 µM), or PKG inhibitor, KT-5823 (1 µM), at 37°C in medium containing 0.2% BSA prior to stimulation with 500 μM DTT or vitamin C for 24 hours.

                     A Vehicle alone (I), DTT (II), DTT and L-NNA (III), DTT and L-NIO (IV), B Histogram showing the mean total tube length per 40× field of PAEC following stimulation with DTT in the presence of L-NNA and L-NIO following 24 hour incubation.

                     C Vehicle alone (I), DTT (II), DTT and ODQ (III), DTT and KT-5823 (IV), D Histogram showing the mean total tube length per 40× field of PAEC following stimulation with DTT in the presence of ODQ or KT-5823 following 24 hour incubation.

                     E Histogram showing the mean total tube length per 40× field of PAEC following incubation with vitamin C in the presence of L-NNA, L-NIO, ODQ or KT-5823.
