                Figure 2.  Principal component analysis (PCA) and the expression pattern heatmap of known target genes for Oct3/4 and related genes.(A) 2D-views of PCA for 2,757 genes that were identified as significantly differentially expressed during this time course.
(B) The expression pattern and ES/TS specificity of each component of PCA was classified into 4 groups (Group I ~ Group IV).
(C) Known target genes for Oct3/4 and related genes.
(D) Top 30 up- and down-regulated genes from 0 h v 24 h.
