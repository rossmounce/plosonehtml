                Figure 3.  Delineation of Oct3/4-downstream target gene network.(A) A list of genes that have been experimentally demonstrated as the direct downstream targets of Oct3/4.
Yes: genes that were also detected by the global ChIP assays.
No: genes that were not detected by the global ChIP assays.
Mouse homologues of human genes identified in Boyer et al. were generated using NCBI HomoloGene Build 49.
(B) Comparison of gene lists obtained by the expression profiling (list 1 plus list 2) and global ChIP assays.
