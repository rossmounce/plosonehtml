                Figure 4.  (A) Primary targets of Oct3/4. Genes are separated into four groups: Genes detected by the current expression profiling, mouse ChIP-PET assay, and human ChIP-on-chip assay; previously known target genes that were also detected by the current expression profiling; Genes detected by the current expression profiling and mouse ChIP-PET assay; Genes detected by the current expression profiling and human ChIP-on-chip assay.Genes classified as transcription factors by GO annotation were shown in bold.
Genes that were down-regulated by the repression of Oct3/4 in ZHBTc4 cells were shown in blue.
Genes that were up-regulated by the repression of Oct3/4 in ZHBTc4 cells were shown in red.
(B) Representative GO categories that are enriched in the primary targets of Oct3/4 in a statistically significant manner (FDR&gt;0.05).
