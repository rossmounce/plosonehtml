                      is regulated by Oct3/4.(A) Luciferase assay for 4 candidate Oct3/4 target genes and one known target gene (Zfp42).
(B) Luciferase assay for deletion analysis of region upstream of Tcl1 gene. s1 and s2 are candidates for Oct3/4 binding sites, with sequence shown in (E).
(C) EMSA for two candidate sites.
The arrow indicates the band for Oct3/4/oligonucleotide binding.
