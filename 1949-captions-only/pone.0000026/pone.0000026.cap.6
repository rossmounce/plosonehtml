                     Functional analysis of Tcl1 in ES cells.(A) Expression level of Tcl1 gene effects on cell proliferation.
The number of ES cells decreased when Tcl1 was knocked down by shRNA.
(B) RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of ES cells with shRNA of Tcl1 gene.
Tcl1 gene expression affected active Akt1 (p-Ser.473 Akt1), but not wild type of Akt1.
(C) Reversibility of Tcl1 downregulation effect.
The number of cells was rescued in the absence of Tet.
(D) Photomicrographs of ES cell cultures.
