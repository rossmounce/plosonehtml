                Figure 1.  Time series for segments of the simulated landscape.(a–d) correspond to vaccines being placed in front of the river.
(e–h) correspond to vaccines being placed after the river.
(a) and (e) are the first patches to be initially infected in both scenarios and are the furthest from any impedances.
(b) and (f) are the patches closest to the vaccine corridor and river, respectively.
(c) and (g) comprise the patches which contain the vaccine corridor and river in each simulation.
(d) and (h) are patches beyond the vaccine corridor and river.
