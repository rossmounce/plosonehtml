                Figure 1.  Experiment Design.For each group a direction discrimination test was performed before and after 9 days of training and CFFT was measured at the beginning of each training session.
In Direction-Training, subjects reported two-targets (shown in white) at the end of the trial and a specific direction of motion was paired with task-targets.
In No-Motion training, task was the same, but no dots were displayed.
In No-Coherence training, task was the same but dots all moved randomly.
In N-Back training, task was to report if a letter was repeated twice in a trial (in this case the L; shown in white for graphic purposes), there was no relationship between task-targets and motion directions.
