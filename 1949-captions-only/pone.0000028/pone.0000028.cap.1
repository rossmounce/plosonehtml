<a id="article1.body1.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>In Direction-Training, subjects reported two-targets (shown in white) at the end of the trial and a specific direction of motion was paired with task-targets.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec1.fig1.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.fig1.caption1.p5"></a><p>In N-Back training, task was to report if a letter was repeated twice in a trial (in this case the L; shown in white for graphic purposes), there was no relationship between task-targets and motion directions.</p>
