                Figure 3.  Motion-direction sensitivity change from Direction Training. a, performance for paired-direction on pre-test (dashed-line) and post-test (solid-line).
b, performance for averaged across non-paired directions on pre-test (dashed-line) and post-test (solid-line).
Error bars reflect standard-error.
