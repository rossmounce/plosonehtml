                Figure 4.  CFFT changes for control groups. a, CFFT is shown for each day for the No-Motion Group (solid-line) and the Flicker-Only Group (dashed-line). 
b, CFFT is shown for each day for the No-Coherence Group (solid-line) and the Flicker-Only Group (dashed-line).
a, CFFT is shown for each day for the N-Back Group (solid-line) and the Flicker-Only Group (dashed-line).
Error bars reflect standard-error.
