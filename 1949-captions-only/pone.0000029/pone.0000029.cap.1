                Figure 1.  MG Induces Apoptosis in the Murine Alveolar Macrophage Cell Line MH-S (A) MH-S cells were treated with different concentrations of MG for 24 h.Cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed using a FACS instrument.
Apoptosis was scored as the percentage of cells appearing in the area below the G1/G0 peak, representing cells containing DNA&lt;2N.
Error bars representÂ±SD.
Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; *, P&lt;0.001 for MH-S cells treated with 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mM MG versus untreated MH-S cells.
(B) Western blot analysis was used to detect the activation of components of apoptotic signals, JNK, caspase-3, and caspase-9.
JNK was activated as early as 1 h after MG treatment, followed by the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9.
