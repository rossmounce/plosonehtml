                Figure 2.  Mycobacterial Infection of Macrophages Stimulates AGE Formation. (A) Macrophages were infected with BCG for 1 day and AGE levels were determined by FACS analysis.
AGE formation was strongly increased during infection of macrophages.
(B) Significant formation of AGE was also observed at sites of active TB; upper left: staining with mAb against macrophage marker (CD68), upper right: staining with mAb against AGE, lower right: staining with mAb against marker for activated macrophages (Ki-67).
Consistent results were observed for three TB patients.
