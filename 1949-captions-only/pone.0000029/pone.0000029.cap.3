                Figure 3.  GSH Reverses Apoptotic Effects of MG/AGE on Macrophages.(A) Macrophages were pretreated with GSH and infected with mycobacteria for 1 day.
As a positive control, macrophages were infected with mycobacteria without pretreatment with GSH.
AGE levels were determined using a FACS instrument.
Red line: negative control (without infection), black line: positive control, blue line: pretreatment with GSH. 
The augmentation of AGE levels was reduced during mycobacterial infection when macrophages were pretreated with GSH. 
(B) Pretreatment of macrophages with GSH reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells during mycobacterial infection.
Error bars representÂ±SD.
Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; *, P&lt;0.05 for MH-S cells pretreated with GSH and infected with mycobacteria versus MH-S cells infected with mycobacteria without pre-treatment with GSH.
