                Figure 4.  Cytokine and Chemokine Induction by MG.MH-S cells were treated with 0.8 mM MG.
TNF-α and CXCL10 concentrations in the culture medium were measured at various time points as indicated on the X axis.
Relative OD values were calculated by setting the OD value to 1 at time 0 h.
A significant increase of TNF-α (A) and CXCL10 secretion (B) was observed after MG treatment of MH-S cells.
This confirms the results of microarray experiments.
Error bars represent±SD.
Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; *, P&lt;0.05 for MH-S cells treated with MG (6, 8, and 24 h after treatment for TNF-α and 24 h after treatment for CXCL10) versus untreated MH-S cells.
