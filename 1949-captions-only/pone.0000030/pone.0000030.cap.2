                     <strong>A)</strong> MR100 yeast cells (<em>Δtpi1</em>) were transformed with the various p416GPD-based expression plasmids encoding wild-type human TPI as well as the pathogenic variants Met1_AAG, Cys41Tyr, Glu104Asp, Gly122Arg, Ile170Val or Phe240Leu, respectively, and plated on minimal SC <sup>-leu-ura</sup> medium supplemented with 3% ethanol/0.1% glucose.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>Afterwards, single yeast clones were selected and grown as represented by the schemes on SC <sup>-leu-ura</sup> medium plates supplemented either with 2% glucose or with 3% ethanol/0.1% glucose at 30°C. <strong>B)</strong> MR100 <em>Δtpi1</em> yeast cells expressing wild-type TPI or the different pathogenic TPI variants were grown until logarithmic phase.</p>
