                Figure 2.  Human wild-type and pathogenic TPI variants can substitute for yeast TPI1.
                     A) MR100 yeast cells (Δtpi1) were transformed with the various p416GPD-based expression plasmids encoding wild-type human TPI as well as the pathogenic variants Met1_AAG, Cys41Tyr, Glu104Asp, Gly122Arg, Ile170Val or Phe240Leu, respectively, and plated on minimal SC -leu-ura medium supplemented with 3% ethanol/0.1% glucose.
Afterwards, single yeast clones were selected and grown as represented by the schemes on SC -leu-ura medium plates supplemented either with 2% glucose or with 3% ethanol/0.1% glucose at 30°C. B) MR100 Δtpi1 yeast cells expressing wild-type TPI or the different pathogenic TPI variants were grown until logarithmic phase.
Then, the same cell number of each culture was spotted as 5-fold serial dilutions onto glucose media or onto glucose media supplemented with different concentrations of lithium chloride. 
Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30°C and growth of the different yeast strains was analyzed.
