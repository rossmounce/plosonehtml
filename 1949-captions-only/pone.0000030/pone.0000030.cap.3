                Figure 3.  Pathogenic TPI variants display catalytic activity in vivo.MR100 Î”tpi1 yeast cells expressing wild-type as well as the pathogenic TPI variants Cys41Tyr, Glu104Asp, Gly122Arg, Ile170Val or Phe240Leu were grown until the logarithmic phase and equal cell numbers were collected.
Afterwards, the enzymatic assay was performed as described in the Methods section.
The catalytic activity of each pathogenic TPI variant was compared to the activity of the wild-type enzyme.
Each column represents the mean value of multiple measurements of 4 different yeast clones.
Error bars indicate standard deviation.
