                Figure 4.  An alternative translation initiation start site within the TPI mRNA.
                     A) The first 17 codons of the human TPI sequence and the netstart scores are presented. The introduced mutations are indicated in bold letters.

                     B) MR100 Δtpi1 yeast cells were transformed with the respective plasmids encoding TPI, TPIMet1_AAG, TPISer3_TER or the variant TPI2ndATG.
Ethanol lysates were prepared from logarithmically growing yeast cultures and the expression level of the different TPI variants was analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal α-TPI serum.
Please note that no sample was loaded in case of the lane marked with a dash.

                     C) COS1 cells were transfected with the plasmids pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-TPI, pEGFP-N1-TPIMet1_AAG or pEGFP-N1-TPISer3_TER.
