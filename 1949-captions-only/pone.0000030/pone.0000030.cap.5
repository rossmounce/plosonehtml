                Figure 5.  Dimerization behavior of wild-type and pathogenic TPI variants.
                     A) The yeast two-hybrid strain L40ccua was co-transformed with plasmids encoding LexA-TPI, AD, AD-TPI or AD-TPI2ndATG as indicated.
Afterwards, transformants were spotted on SC media lacking tryptophan and leucine, onto SC medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and uracil, or onto nylon membrane for analyzing the activity of the three reporter genes (left panel).
For quantitative analysis of the lacZ reporter gene activity a liquid Î²-galactosidase assay was performed (middle panel).
Each column represents the mean value of four measurements.
Error bars indicate the standard deviation.
The expression level of the respective bait and prey proteins was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against lexA or gal4AD (right panel).
