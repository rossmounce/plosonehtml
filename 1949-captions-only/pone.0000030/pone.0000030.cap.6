                Figure 6.  Overexpression of the Glu104Asp TPI variant results in a reduced expression level of endogenous TPI.COS1 cells were transfected with pTL-Flag-TPI-WT or pTL-Flag-TPI-Glu104Asp as indicated.
After 48h, lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described in the Methods section.
Loading of equal protein concentrations was demonstrated by tubulin staining (lower panel).
In addition, similar levels of FLAG-tagged wild-type TPI and FLAG-tagged Glu104Asp TPI was detected in the respective cell lysates (middle panel).
