                Figure 7.  MR100 Δtpi1 yeast cells expressing the Ile170Val TPI variant are hyperresistant to diamide.MR100 Δtpi1 yeast cells expressing wild-type as well as the pathogenic TPI variants Cys41Tyr, Glu104Asp, Gly122Arg, Ile170Val or Phe240Leu were grown to stationary phase, serially diluted to OD600 values of 3.0, 1.0, 0.3, 0.1 and spotted onto SC medium plates containing different concentrations of diamide.
Sensitivity/resistance was determined by comparing the growth between the different yeast strains after incubating the plates for 3 days at 28°C.
