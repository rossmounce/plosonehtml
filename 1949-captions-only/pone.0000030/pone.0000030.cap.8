                Figure 8.  Consequences of mutations within human TPI.Homozygous mutations within TPI affecting enzyme dimerization cause TPI deficiency, whereas homozygous mutations resulting in an inactive TPI allele are lethal.
Compound heterozygous individuals having inherited one inactive and one allele defective in dimerization properties will develop TPI deficiency, whereas heterozygote individuals having inherited a heterozygote null allele have an evolutionary advantage. (+: wild-type TPI; âˆ’: TPI with aberrant dimerization property; 0: allele encoding no or a catalytically inactive TPI).
