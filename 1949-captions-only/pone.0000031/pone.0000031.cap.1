                Figure 1.  Resistin Preferentially Induces Inflammatory Markers in Human WAT.Human WAT explants were incubated with 10 ng/ml TNF, white bars, or 50 ng/ml resistin, grey bars, for 24 hrs and the fold change for several markers assessed by comparison with their level in basal cultures after 24 hrs.
In 
                        A
                      both gene (left) and protein (right) expressions of proinflammatory cytokines are shown, while 
                        B
                      represents other inflammation-related effects in WAT.
