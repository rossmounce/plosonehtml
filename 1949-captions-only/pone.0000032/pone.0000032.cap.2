<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>For a better representation, genes induced in the invasive cancer stroma were calibrated on the PIN stroma, those induced in the PIN stroma were calibrated on the invasive-cancer stroma.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>(B–G) Immunohistochemical validation of cathepsin D expression in invasive cancer stroma; cathepsin D (brown) was highly expressed in stromal cells (arrowheads) associated with invasive cancer, in contrast to tumor cells (T) where only occasional staining was seen (B,E); cells expressing cathepsin D were positive for vimentin (brown), confirming their mesenchymal origin (C); double staining of cathepsin D (brown) and vimentin (blue) highlighted their co-expression by fibroblasts/myofibroblasts (D); anti-SV40T antibody staining (nuclear, brown), (F), and double anti-cathepsin D/anti-SV40T antibody staining (blue/brown, respectively), (G), further confirmed that cathepsin D expression was primarily in stromal cells.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin (B, C, E, F).</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p6"></a><p>(h) Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression of cathepsin D, B and Z in fibroblasts derived from CR2-TAg prostate cancers (1) compared to those derived from PIN prostates (2).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p7"></a><p>Samples were collected from 24-week (invasive cancer) and 10-week old (PIN) mice, just as for the microarray experiments.</p>
