                Figure 2.  Validation of stromal genes identified by microarray analysis.(A) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed microarray results for 11 transcripts found to be differentially expressed between PIN and invasive cancer stroma.
For a better representation, genes induced in the invasive cancer stroma were calibrated on the PIN stroma, those induced in the PIN stroma were calibrated on the invasive-cancer stroma.
(B–G) Immunohistochemical validation of cathepsin D expression in invasive cancer stroma; cathepsin D (brown) was highly expressed in stromal cells (arrowheads) associated with invasive cancer, in contrast to tumor cells (T) where only occasional staining was seen (B,E); cells expressing cathepsin D were positive for vimentin (brown), confirming their mesenchymal origin (C); double staining of cathepsin D (brown) and vimentin (blue) highlighted their co-expression by fibroblasts/myofibroblasts (D); anti-SV40T antibody staining (nuclear, brown), (F), and double anti-cathepsin D/anti-SV40T antibody staining (blue/brown, respectively), (G), further confirmed that cathepsin D expression was primarily in stromal cells.
Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin (B, C, E, F).
Magnification 100× (B–D), 200× (E, G).
(h) Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression of cathepsin D, B and Z in fibroblasts derived from CR2-TAg prostate cancers (1) compared to those derived from PIN prostates (2).
Samples were collected from 24-week (invasive cancer) and 10-week old (PIN) mice, just as for the microarray experiments.
