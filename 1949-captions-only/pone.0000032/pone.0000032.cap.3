                Figure 3.  Prognostic value of “stroma up” genes for human prostate cancer.(A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of prostate cancer patients (columns) obtained using “stroma up” genes (rows).
Red indicates high relative levels of gene expression and green represents low relative levels of gene expression.
Genes in the cluster are ordered according to decreasing z values (Table S4).
“Stroma up” genes divide prostate cancer patients in two main clusters (red and blue); (B) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the groups of patients defined by “stroma up” genes shows that the two groups of patients differ significantly in the overall survival time (p = 8.05×10−5; red, poor prognosis group; blue, good prognosis group). Similar analyses performed using “stroma down” genes can be found in Figure S3A.
