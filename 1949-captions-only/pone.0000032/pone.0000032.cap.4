                Figure 4.  Prognostic value of “stroma up” genes in different human tumors.(A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of breast cancer patients (columns) obtained using “stroma up” genes (rows) ordered according to decreasing z values (Table S5).
“Stroma up” genes divide breast cancer patients in two main clusters (red and blue). 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the groups of patients defined by “stroma up” genes shows that the two groups of patients differ significantly in the (B) overall survival time (p = 6.97×10−5), and (C) metastasis-free time (p = 0.0018). Similar analyses performed using “stroma down” genes can be found in Figure S3B,C.
(D–F) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of lung (D), gastric (E), and renal cell carcinoma patients (F) shows that groups of patients defined by “stroma up” genes do not differ significantly in the overall survival time (p&gt;0.05). 
Red, poor prognosis group; blue, good prognosis group.
