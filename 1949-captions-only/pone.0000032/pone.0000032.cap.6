                Figure 6.  Histological pattern of securin expression in human cancers.Representative images of securin expression in human cancer samples.
Securin expression (brown) is observed in tumor and stromal (arrowheads) cells in (A) late-stage PIN and (C) breast carcinoma in situ tissue sections.
Invasive cancer stages of (B) prostate, (D) breast, (E) lung, and (F) ovarian cancers show strong securin expression by both tumor and stromal (arrowheads) cells.
Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin.
