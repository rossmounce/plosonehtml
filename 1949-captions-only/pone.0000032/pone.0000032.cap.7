                Figure 7.  Histological pattern of cathepsin D expression in human cancers.Representative images of cathepsin D expression in human cancer samples.
(A) prostate (B) breast cancer showing cathepsin D expression (brown) by tumor and stromal cells; (C) large-cell lung carcinoma and (D) lung adenocarcinoma showing cathepsin D expression by tumor cells and to a lesser extent by stromal cells; (E, F), cathepsin D is almost exclusively expressed by stromal cells in small-cell lung carcinomas (E) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (F), whereas tumor cells are almost devoid of cathepin D expression.
Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin.
