                Figure 8.  Stromal cathepsin D expression promotes PNEC cell migration and proliferation.(A) Quantification of PNEC cell migration in 3D matrigel co-culture with cathepsin D-deficient (CTSD−/−) or wild-type (CTSD+/+) fibroblasts after 30h of co-culture; (B) PNEC cell proliferation and (C, D) elongation are increased in the presence of conditioned medium (CM) derived from CTSD+/+ fibroblasts (C), compared to CM derived from CTSD−/− fibroblasts (D).
Experiments were performed three times, each time in quintuplicate.
Representative results are shown.
