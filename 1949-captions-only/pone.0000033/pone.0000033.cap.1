                Figure 1.  Structure of the reporter cassettesa) The endogenous μ gene. 
The boxes labeled V and C represent the exons encoding the variable (V) and constant (Cμ) regions of the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain gene.
The relative positions of the intronic enhancer (Eμ) and switch (Sμ) regions in the V-C intron are shown.
The Eμ enhancer is depicted with three components: the core enhancer (E) flanked by matrix attachment regions, M and M′.
b) Recombination-mediated cassette exchange.
The upper panel depicts a DNA segment in which (inverted) LoxP sites (1L and L1) flank a gene encoding the HyTK fusion protein (hygromycin-resistance and thymidine kinase [gancyclovir sensitivity]).
As described previously, this DNA segment was inserted in the genome of the recipient hybridoma cell line [9].
The HyTK and μ cassettes are represented as thick lines, with major exons as rectangles, the LoxP sites as triangles (L1 in the “forward” orientation, 1L in the “reverse” orientation).
