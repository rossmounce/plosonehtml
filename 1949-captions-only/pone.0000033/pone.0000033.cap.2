                Figure 2.  Analysis of μ expression by northern blota) As described in the text, multiple independent replacements were isolated for each vector, and the concentration of IgM in culture supernatant of these cell lines was measured by ELISA (Table 1). 
Total RNA was isolated from representative cell lines and analyzed by Northern blot probed with segments of the μ and κ genes.
The intensity of the bands was quantified by phosphorimager, and the μ/κ ratio, normalized to the value for cells expressing #626, is indicated below each lane.
b) Results from the northern blot in (a) are listed next to a diagram of each enhancer-derived segment.
