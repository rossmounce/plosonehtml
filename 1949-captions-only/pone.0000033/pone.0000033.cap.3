<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and intracellular μ chains were stained with μ-specific fluorescent antibodies.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p3"></a><p>~10<sup>4</sup> cells were then analyzed.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p4"></a><p>In these histograms the horizontal axis indicates the mean fluorescence (logarithmic scale) and the vertical axis the number of cells with the corresponding fluorescence. M is the mean fluorescence for each population.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p5"></a><p>Z10/HyTK, the recipient cell line was used in this case as the negative control, and its mean “fluorescence”, M<sub>0</sub>, for each experiment was subtracted from the mean fluorescence, M<sub>x</sub>, measured for a cell population expressing reporter “x”.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p6"></a><p>This corrected fluorescence is compared with M<sub>626</sub>, the corrected fluorescence in that experiment for the reporter #626 with the full enhancer.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p7"></a><p>Thus, the “normalized” fluorescence, N<sub>x</sub>, for reporter “x” was calculated as N<sub>x</sub>  =  (M<sub>x</sub>−M<sub>0</sub>)/(M<sub>626</sub>−M<sub>0</sub>), where M<sub>626</sub> is the mean fluorescence for the reporter with the full enhancer and M<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence for the recipient cell line or other μ non-expresser.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig2.caption1.p8"></a><p>σ is the standard deviation of the fluorescence. In order to correct for variation in background “fluorescence”, we calculated a corrected coefficient of variation, C<sub>x</sub>, for reporter “x” as C<sub>x</sub>  =  (σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>−σ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>/M<sub>x</sub>−M<sub>0</sub>, where σ<sub>x</sub> and σ<sub>0</sub> are the standard deviations associated, respectively, with reporter “x” and with the recipient cell line or other μ non-expresser.</p>
