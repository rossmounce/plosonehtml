                Figure 3.  Flow cytometry of μ expression from reporter gene bearing different segments of the full enhancer.Transfectants bearing the indicated reporter genes were analyzed by flow cytometry. 
Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and intracellular μ chains were stained with μ-specific fluorescent antibodies.
~104 cells were then analyzed.
In these histograms the horizontal axis indicates the mean fluorescence (logarithmic scale) and the vertical axis the number of cells with the corresponding fluorescence. M is the mean fluorescence for each population.
Z10/HyTK, the recipient cell line was used in this case as the negative control, and its mean “fluorescence”, M0, for each experiment was subtracted from the mean fluorescence, Mx, measured for a cell population expressing reporter “x”.
This corrected fluorescence is compared with M626, the corrected fluorescence in that experiment for the reporter #626 with the full enhancer.
Thus, the “normalized” fluorescence, Nx, for reporter “x” was calculated as Nx  =  (Mx−M0)/(M626−M0), where M626 is the mean fluorescence for the reporter with the full enhancer and M0 is the fluorescence for the recipient cell line or other μ non-expresser.
σ is the standard deviation of the fluorescence. In order to correct for variation in background “fluorescence”, we calculated a corrected coefficient of variation, Cx, for reporter “x” as Cx  =  (σx2−σ02)1/2/Mx−M0, where σx and σ0 are the standard deviations associated, respectively, with reporter “x” and with the recipient cell line or other μ non-expresser.
