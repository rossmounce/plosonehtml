                Figure 4.  Flow cytometry of μ expression from partially insulated reporter gene.(a) Two independent transfectants expressing reporter #635 (#635/a and #635/b) were analyzed by flow cytometry, as described in Figure 3.
(b) The transfectants #635/a and #635/b were subcloned, and secreted IgM was measured for each subclone.
The statistical parameters, M, N, σ, and C are defined in the legend to Figure 3.
