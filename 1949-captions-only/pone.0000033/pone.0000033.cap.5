                Figure 5.  Flow cytometry of μ expression from reporters with mutant enhancers.a) Two independent transfectants expressing the #654 reporter were analyzed by flow cytometry.
b) As in (a) two independent transfectants bearing reporter #651 were analyzed by flow cytometry, as described in Figure 3. 
The transfectant 651/b was biphasic and yielded subclones with different levels of expression, 651/b3 and 651/b5.
To assess the stability of this difference, these subclones were re-subcloned, and the mean fluorescence, M, and normalized fluorescence, N, of eight re-subclones were measured.
Nm, the mean value for N for the re-subclones and the associated standard deviation, were calculated.
The values of Nm for each set of subclones were significantly different and close to the value of the N for their respective parents.
The statistical parameters, M, N, σ, and C are defined in the legend to Figure 3.
