                Figure 6.  Analysis of μ RNA produced by weakened enhancers.a) Total RNA was isolated from the indicated cells and analyzed by northern blot as described in Figure 2. 
The asterisk indicates that the cells were incubated for approximately five days with 6.7 mM 3-aminobenzamide prior to isolating RNA.
The upper panels present results for various insulators derived from the gpt cassette and from the igf2/H19 locus; the lower panels present results for various mutant enhancers. For vectors #629 and $635, the segments of the gpt cassette, S, x, y, z are defined in Figure 1.
Reporters #648 and #650 bear the insulator (DMD) from the igf2/H19 loci of mouse and human, respectively.
b) The normalized μ/κ ratios from (a) for cells grown in normal medium (NM) or medium supplemented with 3-aminobenzamide (AB) are listed next to diagrams showing the insulators and enhancers in the reporter genes.
