<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>Because 3-aminobenzamide also affected the fluorescence of the μ-negative cells, Z10/HyTK, the normalized fluorescence (N or N′) for cells grown in 3-aminobenzamide was calculated two ways: For cells bearing the reporter gene, N was calculated by subtracting the mean fluorescence of the parental cell line, Z10/HyTK, grown in normal medium; N′ was calculated by subtracting the mean fluorescence for cells grown in 3-aminobenzamide.</p>
