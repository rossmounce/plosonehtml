                Figure 7.  Flow cytometry of cells treated with 3-aminobenzamide.The indicated cells, grown either in normal medium or in medium supplemented with 3-aminobenzamide, were analyzed for intracellular μ protein by flow cytometry, as described in Figure 3. 
Because 3-aminobenzamide also affected the fluorescence of the μ-negative cells, Z10/HyTK, the normalized fluorescence (N or N′) for cells grown in 3-aminobenzamide was calculated two ways: For cells bearing the reporter gene, N was calculated by subtracting the mean fluorescence of the parental cell line, Z10/HyTK, grown in normal medium; N′ was calculated by subtracting the mean fluorescence for cells grown in 3-aminobenzamide.
