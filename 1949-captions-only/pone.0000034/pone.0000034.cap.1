The electrodes are 92 µm in diameter, reside in a 16×64 grid, and can be set to a specified voltage via connection to a PC with appropriate software, allowing different patterns of on and off electrodes to be used at each step in the construction of the array. The overlaying porous reaction layer (PRL) provides a solid support for attachment of our product DNA, similar to the CPG used in the column of a commercial DNA synthesizer, while maintaining close proximity to the electrode. This close proximity is necessary since the electrode array will be the source of the reagent (acid) used in the deblocking step of the DNA synthesis (<a href="#pone-0000034-g001">step D, figure 1</a>). In previous work, the deblocking reagent was light, and it was contained to a specific region of the chip by masking techniques. As stated earlier, this necessitates the production of a mask and precise alignment at each deblocking step. In contrast, in the electrochemical case reagent generated by the electrode is able to diffuse into the PRL but is prevented from excessive diffusion by the presence of a buffering agent in the surrounding solution. Near the electrode, the buffer is overwhelmed, allowing reaction of the ECG reagent with the PRL bound substrate; but further away, the concentration of the diffusing reagent is insufficient to overcome the concentration of the buffering agent, and no reaction occurs. Since the selection of which areas of the array to deprotect is done electronically, no mask is utilized and no alignment is necessary.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2"></a><p>The production of acid from an electrochemical reaction has been known for some time<a href="#pone.0000034-Volke1">[10]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000034-Baizer1">[11]</a>. The development of a system for the electrochemical generation of acid using a hydroquinone/benzoquinone system for the removal of the DMT group during DNA synthesis was reported by Southern in 2005<a href="#pone.0000034-Southern1">[12]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000034-Egeland1">[13]</a>. While Southern showed that the generation of an EGA (electrochemically generated acid) was possible for a macro scale linear electrode, this procedure was never miniaturized to the scale and multiplicity useful for the production of a DNA microarray. In his technique, Southern relies on the diffusion of reagents from their electrode of origin across a solution filled gap to react on an opposing solid glass surface. On the small scale needed for the production of a microarray, diffusion of the acid generated at an electrode to neighboring electrodes becomes a serious problem. Montgomery <a href="#pone.0000034-Maurer1">[9]</a> reported a solution to this problem using a buffered aqueous system, (demonstration in supplementary material) however the presence of considerable water in the deprotection step can be problematic due to the need of anhydrous conditions in the coupling step of the overall procedure.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.p3"></a><p>Using the electrochemical arrays described above, we have recently reported the development of an electrochemical system using diphenylhydrazine for the removal of the t-BOC protecting group during peptide synthesis <a href="#pone.0000034-Maurer2">[14]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000034-Maurer3">[15]</a> and on spatially contained, Pd-mediated transformations such as the Wacker oxidation, <a href="#pone.0000034-Tesfu1">[16]</a> Heck reaction <a href="#pone.0000034-Tian1">[17]</a>, alcohol oxidation <a href="#pone.0000034-Tesfu2">[18]</a>, and Coumarin formation <a href="#pone.0000034-Tesfu3">[19]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.p4"></a><p>As a non-aqueous alternative for acid generation, we have been studying the anodic oxidation of a hydroquinone/anthraquinone system (<a href="#pone-0000034-g002">Figure 2</a>). The oxidation of each mole of hydroquinone generates two moles of protons. To the mixture is added an organic base to limit the diffusion of protons to neighboring array elements. In this case, we chose a concentration of base below the concentration of acid that will be generated in the electrochemical reaction. In the area immediately surrounding an active electrode (anode), the amount of acid produced exceeds the amount of base present, and the generate acid is of sufficient strength to remove the DMT protecting group. As the acid diffuses away from this location, it encounters more base and, hence, is no longer able to remove the DMT group, thereby confining DNA synthesis to a discrete area on the array. Following the deprotection, standard DNA coupling strategies are employed to build upon the substrates that were selected for deprotection. With the containment of the synthesis achieved, the cycles are merely repeated, in each step deprotecting only where the addition of a new nucleotide is required, to generate an array of many different DNA oligonucleotides.</p>
