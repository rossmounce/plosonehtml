                Figure 4.  Example of a portion of an array with a box pattern of electrodes used for deprotection and synthesis with varying concentrations of base during the deprotection step. Note that the central electrode and electrodes surrounding the box are not active during deprotection and so should not have any synthesis occurring over them.
