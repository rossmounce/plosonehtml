                Figure 8.  Hybridization analysis of 42 arrays demonstrating the sensitivity and linear dynamic range.Each point represents the mean of the normalized probe intensities for the spike-in control transcripts across three arrays plotted against the concentration of spike-in control transcripts.
Error bars indicate the standard deviation across the three arrays at each data point.
Spike-in control transcripts were added to a complex background of K-562 cRNA at 13 different concentrations ranging from 0.25 pM to 1024 pM (approximately 1:600,000 to 1:150 mass ratio) in two-fold increments.
Sensitivity was determined to be signal detectable above the average signal for the same probes on a set of no-spike arrays (solid line) plus 3 standard deviations (dotted line).
