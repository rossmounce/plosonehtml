                Figure 1.  Plasmatic glucose and hormone levels at different ages.
                     (A) Glucose concentration (n  =  12 animals/point); (B) plasma levels of insulin (n  =  12), and (C) plasma levels of glucagon (n  =  6).
Symbols denote statistically significant differences, (*) p&lt;0.05 and (**) p&lt;0.0001 with respect to previous age, (â€ ) p&lt;0.05 with respect to d6.
