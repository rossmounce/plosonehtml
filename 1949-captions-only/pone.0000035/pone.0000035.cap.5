                Figure 5.  Insulin secretion at d20 and d28 explored by RHPA.(A) Bar graphs represent insulin secretion index at d20 and d28, in response to different glucose concentrations, mean ± SEM, n  =  4 experiments by duplicate, (*) p&lt;0.05 with respect to 15.6 mM.

                     (B) Percentage of insulin secreting beta-cells from the total population as identified by insulin immunocytochemistry after the RHPA; mean ± SEM, n  =  4 experiments by duplicate, **p&lt;0.0001 with respect to d20.
