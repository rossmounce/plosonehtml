                Figure 1.  Stoma autonomy in its blue light-induced openingIndividual stomata were irradiated with a short pulse of blue light by focusing an argon laser attached to a confocal microscope.
(A) Irradiated stomata.
(B) Nearest neighbour of the irradiated stoma.
Confocal sections showing the stomatal opening in both wild type and phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant, before (left) and two hours later (right) the blue-light treatment.
(C) Differences between the stomatal opening before and two hours after the blue light treatment in both irradiated stomata and their nearest neighbours dark-adapted stomata.
Wild-type irradiated stomata increased pore opening.
In contrast, the irradiated stomata of the phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant experienced no change.
The nearest neighbours to the irradiated stomata remained unaltered in their movements.
