                Figure 2.  Blue light-induced stomatal movement signals are not transmitted from non-stomatal epidermal cells to their adjacent stomataA short pulse of blue light from the argon laser was applied to all epidermal cells adjacent to randomly selected stomata in both wild type and phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant.
Such irradiation caused no effect in the stomatal movements.
(A) Confocal sections show the stomatal apertures before (left) and two hours later (right) the non-stomatal epidermal cells illumination.
(B) Differences between the stomatal aperture before and after the blue light treatment.
Note that illuminated stomata increased opening in the wild type, and remained unaltered in the phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant.
Bars show the mean of at least 15 measurements with standard deviations.
Images show staining with calcofluor resulting in strong fluorescence in cell walls.
Scale bar: 3 Âµm; all images are the same magnification.
