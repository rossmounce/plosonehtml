                Figure 3.  Dissociation of PHOT1 from the plasma membrane in blue-light irradiated cells(A) Stomata blue-light irradiation.
Confocal section of the epidermis of a dark-adapted PHOT1-GFP seedling showing all GFP signal attached to the cell surface (left).
Section of the same field 3 min after the initial scan (right).
The intensity of the GFP signal decreased in the irradiated stoma.
No changes were detected in its neighbour epidermal cells.
(B) Stomatal neighbour cell irradiation.
Epidermal sections before (left) and after (right) the blue-light illumination.
The argon laser provided the blue-light source.
