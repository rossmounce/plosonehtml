                Figure 4.  Nearby parts of an Arabidopsis leaf can experience steep differences in irradianceSolar blue light decreases sharply between the unshaded (0 µm) and shaded portions of the abaxial side of an Arabidopsis leaf.
The average distance among stomata in Arabidopsis varies between 50 and 100 µm, indicating that neighbour stomata may be exposed to widely different light conditions.
Data are means and standard errors of three replicates.
Inset, Image of overlapping leaves illustrating the sharp transition between illuminated and shaded areas.
