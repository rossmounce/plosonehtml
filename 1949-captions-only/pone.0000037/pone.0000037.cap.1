                Figure 1.  Lateral Views of Wild-Type and MO-Injected EmbryosThe genes targeted by MOs and the observation time are indicated for each image.
‘rpl5; MO116’ and ‘rpl5; MO117’ indicate two MOs designed and injected separately for two functional copies of rpl5 on the zebrafish genome.
‘rpl5; MOmix’ indicates the mixture of MO116 and MO117.
Control MOs that included 5 mispaired bases were also used; one example of a control MO injection is shown (rpl38; misMO).
Note that compared to the control, the rpl38 morphant is shorter and displays a light-colored eye and thin yolk sac extension.
Scale bar, 500 µm.
