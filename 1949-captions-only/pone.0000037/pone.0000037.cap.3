                Figure 3.  Schematic Representation of the Extent of Abnormalities in Brain and Body Trunk(A) 6 parts of the brain, 3 parts of the body trunk, and a dorsal view of the trunk are indicated in wild type embryo.
a, optic tectum; b, 4th ventricle; c, midbrain-hindbrain boundary; d, anterior part of head; e, rhombencephalon; f, telencephalon; g, body along yolk sac extension; h, tail; i, tip of tail; j, dorsal view of the trunk.
(B) The deformations were assessed using a 3-level severity scale; dark gray indicates a severe effect, light gray indicates a mild effect, and white represents no apparent effect.
Detailed information and images of the abnormalities in the morphants are available at the zebrafish database (http://zebrafish.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp).
