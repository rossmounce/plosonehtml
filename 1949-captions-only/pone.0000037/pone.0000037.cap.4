                Figure 4.  Similarities between the Clinical Features of Human Brain Diseases and Defects in Zebrafish Morphants(A) Common features shared between Abidi X-linked mental retardation and microhydranencephaly are listed on the left and the corresponding changes in rps4 and rps15a morphants are indicated on the right. 
(B) Telencephalon hypoplasia is seen in rps4 morphants, and reduction in size and deformity of the telencephalon is apparent in rps15a morphants (white arrows).
Unclear subdivisions of the brain and flattened foreheads (arrowheads) can be seen in lateral views of these morphants.
