                Figure 1.  Differential shape of the trifluoroacetate (TFA) and acetate (AC) nanoparticles as visualized by electron microscopy.During compaction of the EGFP expression plasmid, the presence of TFA as the lysine counterion produces ellipsoidal nanoparticles with a minor diameter &lt;18 nm whereas acetate produces rods with a minor diameter &lt;8 nm.
Scale bar, 100 nM.
