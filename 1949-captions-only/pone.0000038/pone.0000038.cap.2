                Figure 2.  Ocular expression levels of EGFP mRNA after intravitreal injection.At 2 days post-intravitreal injection of 0.6 Âµg of compacted DNA, the lens, pigment epithelium/choroid/sclera (PECS), and retina were isolated.
qRT-PCR was used to assess EGFP mRNA levels and normalized to the neuronal housekeeping gene HPRT.
Both the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP nanoparticles produced substantial expression of EGFP in the lens as compared to the naked plasmid control.
In the PECS (A) and retina (B), both nanoparticles produced EGFP mRNA at levels several fold higher than naked plasmid.
No expression of EGFP was detected in any of the mock-injected samples.
