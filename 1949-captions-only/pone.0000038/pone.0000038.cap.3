                Figure 3.  EGFP localization in ocular tissues following intravitreal injection.Direct fluorescence microscopy was utilized to localize EGFP expression in ocular tissues at 2-days post-injection of 0.6 µg of compacted DNA.
(A) Retinal autofluorescence was present in the outer segment of all samples including mock- and naked plasmid-injected eyes, however EGFP fluorescence was detected in the GCL of both the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP injected eyes.
(B) Upon examination at higher magnification, EGFP expression was confined to the GCL in the AC-GFP-injected eyes, and present in the GCL and IPL of TFA-GFP-injected eyes.
(C) Expression of EGFP was also detected in the cornea, trabecular meshwork, and lens following intravitreal injection of both TFA and AC nanoparticles (only AC shown).
“FITC” channel imaging was performed as described in the Methods Section.
