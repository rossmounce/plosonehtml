<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p2"></a><p>(<strong>A</strong>) Retinal autofluorescence was present in the outer segment of all samples including mock- and naked plasmid-injected eyes, however EGFP fluorescence was detected in the GCL of both the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP injected eyes.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p3"></a><p>(<strong>B</strong>) Upon examination at higher magnification, EGFP expression was confined to the GCL in the AC-GFP-injected eyes, and present in the GCL and IPL of TFA-GFP-injected eyes.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig3.caption1.p4"></a><p>(<strong>C</strong>) Expression of EGFP was also detected in the cornea, trabecular meshwork, and lens following intravitreal injection of both TFA and AC nanoparticles (only AC shown).</p>
