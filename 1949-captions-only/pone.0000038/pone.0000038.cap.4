                Figure 4.  Ocular expression levels of EGFP mRNA after subretinal injection.At 2-days post-subretinal injection of 0.6 Âµg of compacted DNA, the lens, PECS, and retina were isolated, and qRT-PCR was used to assess EGFP mRNA levels.
Both the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP nanoparticles produced substantial expression in the PECS and retina.
In both tissues, the AC-GFP nanoparticle generated EGFP mRNA levels nearly 2-fold higher than the TFA-GFP nanoparticle.
EGFP expression was also observed in the lens; however there was significant deviation between samples, possibly reflecting the amount of nanoparticle reflux into the vitreous because of back-pressure during syringe withdrawal following some of the subretinal injection procedures.
