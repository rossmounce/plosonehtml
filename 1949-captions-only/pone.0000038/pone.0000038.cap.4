<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p2"></a><p>Both the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP nanoparticles produced substantial expression in the PECS and retina.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p3"></a><p>In both tissues, the AC-GFP nanoparticle generated EGFP mRNA levels nearly 2-fold higher than the TFA-GFP nanoparticle.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.fig4.caption1.p4"></a><p>EGFP expression was also observed in the lens; however there was significant deviation between samples, possibly reflecting the amount of nanoparticle reflux into the vitreous because of back-pressure during syringe withdrawal following some of the subretinal injection procedures.</p>
