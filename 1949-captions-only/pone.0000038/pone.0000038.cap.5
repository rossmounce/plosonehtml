                Figure 5.  EGFP localization in ocular tissues following subretinal injection.Direct fluorescence microscopy was utilized to localize EGFP expression in ocular tissues at 2-days post-injection of 0.6 µg of compacted DNA.
(A) EGFP fluorescence was detected in the ONL and RPE of eyes injected with the AC-GFP and TFA-GFP nanoparticles, respectively.
(B) EGFP was also detected within the optic nerve (asterisks) and the extraocular muscles following injection of the AC-GFP nanoparticle.
Scale bars, 10 µM.
