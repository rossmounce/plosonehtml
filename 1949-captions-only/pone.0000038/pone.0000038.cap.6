                Figure 6.  EGFP immunoreactivity following subretinal injection.To eliminate any artifacts due to retinal autofluorescence, immunohistochemistry was performed with a Cy-3-anti-GFP antibody on paraffin-embedded ocular sections from eyes taken at 2-days post-injection of 0.6 µg of compacted DNA.
An absence of or minimal EGFP immunoreactivity was found in the mock-injected and naked plasmid-injected eyes, respectively.
Examination of sections from eyes injected with the AC-GFP nanoparticle revealed high-level EGFP immunoreactivity in nearly all of the cells in the ONL.
Lower levels of EGFP were also detected within the upper half of the INL.
Scale bar, 10 µM.
