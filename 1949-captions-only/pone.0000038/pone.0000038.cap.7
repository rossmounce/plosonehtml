                Figure 7.  Assessment of retinal function following subretinal injection.ERG analyses were performed in adult Balb/c mice (n = 4) after 7 and 30 days following subretinal delivery of 1 uL saline, naked plasmid, AC-GFP, or TFA-GFP and compared to uninjected controls (UN).
To assess rod photoreceptor function and signal transmission scotopic ERG was performed on dark-adapted mice and photopic ERG was performed light-adapted mice to assess cone photoreceptor function.

                  (A) At 7 days post-injection, a significant decrease from WT amplitudes was observed in all injected eyes (p&lt;0.05) as an immediate consequence of the injection procedure and subsequent retinal detachment, however there was no significant difference among any of the experimental groups (p&gt;0.05) in the scotopic and photopic amplitudes.

                  (B) By 30 days post-injection, no significant difference in scotopic and photopic amplitudes was observed between WT and injected groups (p&gt;0.05), demonstrating the lack of toxicity associated with nanoparticle-transfection in photoreceptors.
Significance was determined with ANOVA and Bonferroni's pair-wise comparison test.
