                  <strong>(A)</strong> At 7 days post-injection, a significant decrease from WT amplitudes was observed in all injected eyes (p&lt;0.05) as an immediate consequence of the injection procedure and subsequent retinal detachment, however there was no significant difference among any of the experimental groups (p&gt;0.05) in the scotopic and photopic amplitudes.</p>

                  <strong>(B)</strong> By 30 days post-injection, no significant difference in scotopic and photopic amplitudes was observed between WT and injected groups (p&gt;0.05), demonstrating the lack of toxicity associated with nanoparticle-transfection in photoreceptors.</p>
