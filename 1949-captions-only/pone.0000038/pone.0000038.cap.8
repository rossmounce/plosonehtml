                Figure 8.  Dose-response of EGFP mRNA levels to increasing amounts of nanoparticle DNA following subretinal injection.Multiple doses of the AC-GFP nanoparticles were diluted in saline and delivered via subretinal injection.
qRT-PCR was then performed to assess EGFP mRNA levels in relation to photoreceptor-specific genes.
An increasing trend of EGFP mRNA was detected in response to increasing levels of nanoparticle DNA delivered.
At the highest dose of 4 Âµg of DNA, the levels of EGFP were nearly 88% of rod opsin mRNA.
Lesser doses achieved expression levels near other photoreceptor-specific genes involved in blinding diseases.
