The virtual character (Learner) appears to be on the other side of a partition and seen through a window.
The cue word and four possible associated words are displayed with the correct associated word shown in capitals.
After the participant reads out the five words the Learner answers with one of the four possible answers.
If the answer is incorrect the participant turns up a voltage dial on the shock machine b, and then presses a button to administer the shock.
For the HC condition the window area where the Learner is displayed is covered, and the Learner's answer appears in text underneath the cue word and possible answers.
