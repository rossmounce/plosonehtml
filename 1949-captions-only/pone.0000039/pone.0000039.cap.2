                Figure 2.  Skin conductance waveform average around the shock times.
                     a, Event triggered average of 20 s segments of skin conductance waveform, the events being the times when the button that gave an electric shock to the virtual character was pressed.
The grand mean was calculated over each shock and each person and the result for the VC is shown here (n = 439*).
Each waveform was adjusted by subtracting the corresponding individual's mean SCL during the baseline period.
For each participant a number of pseudo random shock times distributed over the learning period, equal to the actual number for that person, were generated â€“ also with the adjustment for the individual's mean baseline SCL.
An average curve was formed like this 500 times, and these are shown as the many overlapping thinner curves.
A histogram of the values of these pseudo random curves at the 0 time point is shown inset.
