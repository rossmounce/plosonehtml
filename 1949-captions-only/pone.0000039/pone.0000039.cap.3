                Figure 3.  Significance Levels for differences between the SCLs for the VC and HC by shock number.For each shock the SCL (adjusted by subtracting the mean baseline value) at the time that the shock is administered is found for each of the n = 23 in the VC and n = 11 in the HC.
A rank sum test is used to test the hypothesis that these are drawn from the same population.
The vertical axis shows the significance level for rejection of the null hypothesis.
By examination of the medians of the samples in each case it is clear that for the later shocks the null hypothesis would be rejected in favour of the alternative that the SCL is higher for the VC.
