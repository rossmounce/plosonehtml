                Figure 4.  Times between asking the question and indicating the intention to shock.The vertical axis is the time between the participant finishing reading out the 5 words forming the question and saying “Incorrect” after the Learner did not respond, at questions 28 and 29 (the last two).
The horizontal axis labels refer to the question number and the condition VC or HC.
The plots are standard box plots, where the box shows the median and interquartile range, and the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range.
Values outside the whiskers are outliers, the single outlier shown as a cross.
At the 28th question the time difference ranged from 8 s to 78 s with a median of 23 s for the VC (n = 19) and from 4 s to 13 s with a median of 7 s for those in the HC (n = 11).
The Wilcoxon rank sum test rejects the hypothesis that the two samples are from the same population with P = 4.4×10−4.
At the time of the 29th (and last) question the equivalent results are: 5–43 s with a median of 13 s for the VC (n = 16), and 5–14 s with a median of 8 s for the HC (n = 11).
Here the difference is significant with P = 0.0175.
