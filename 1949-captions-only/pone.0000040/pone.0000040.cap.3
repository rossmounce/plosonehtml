                Figure 3.  Mapping of the serospecificities of VL patients against L. donovani antigens.The proteins of total lysates of L. donovani isolate BHU2 (MHOM/IN/02/BHU2) promastigotes were separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with a pH gradient of 4.5–7 in the first dimension and a 12.5% SDS-PAGE in the second.

                     A: Western blot developed with autologous serum.
330 Leishmania antigens could be counted.

                     B: The corresponding silver-stained gel displaying 1067 protein spots.
68 of 330 antigens could be assigned to protein spots in the silver-stained gel.
Six of the protein spots, indicated by arrows and numbered 1–6, were processed for protein identification by mass spectrometry.
