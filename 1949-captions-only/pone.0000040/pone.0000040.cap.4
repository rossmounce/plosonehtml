<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>The resulting fragments were extracted from the gel pieces and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig2.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig2.caption1.p4"></a><p>Upon processing via MASCOT, the antigens were identified as HSP70 (spots 1, panel <strong>A</strong> and spot 2, panel <strong>B</strong>), gp63 (spot 3, panel <strong>A</strong>), EIF-4a (spot 4, panel <strong>C</strong>), Ef2 (spot 5, panel <strong>D</strong>) and grp78 (spot 6, panel <strong>E</strong>).</p>
