                Figure 5.  Confirmation of the protein identifications for spots 4 and 5 by PSD mass spectrometry for peptide fragmentation fingerprint (PFF) analyses.Panel A shows the PSD spectrum of a 1447 Da fragment of the protein in spot 4 and panel B that of a 1757 Da fragment from antigen spot 5.
The former was identified as the tryptic fragment HNLIQGLVLSPTR from EIF-4a corresponding to the L. major sequence of this protein and the latter as the tryptic fragment AYLPVAESFGFTADLR of EF2 also of L. major.
In both cases, the protein identification by PFM analyses were, thus, confirmed by PFF analyses and homology to the sequences of the proteins in L. major.
