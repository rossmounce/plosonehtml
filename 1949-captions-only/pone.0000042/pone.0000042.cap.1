                Figure 1.  Minor H antigen PCR-SSP.PCR-SSP of DNA of two unrelated individuals (CAN and 80821) was performed and analyzed as described in the Materials and Methods section.
The first lane of each minor H locus represents the immunogenic allele; the second lane displays the non-immunogenic allele.
Bands relevant for minor H antigen typing are boxed.
The products of 439 and 504 bp reflect the internal control for the immunogenic and the non-immunogenic allele respectively.
The control band for UGT2B17 has a size of 761 bp.
Since the minor H antigens UGT2B17 and H-Y have no allelic counterpart, the latter typing was performed with a single set of primers.
