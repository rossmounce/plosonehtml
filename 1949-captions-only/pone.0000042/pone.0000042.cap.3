                Figure 3.  Analysis of donor/recipient HLA and minor H antigen typing.A. Query section: Minor H antigen typing data can be entered by marking the checkboxes per allele per minor H antigen. HLA typing data has the 2-digit format. Full typing for all HLA loci is not required. After submitting the query, a page with results will appear
B. Results: The results section lists minor H antigens relevant in the particular donor-recipient combination based upon the HLA typing. In case donor and recipient are minor H antigen matched, as is the case here for HA-1, the sign “ = ” will appear between donor and recipient. In case recipient and donor are minor H antigen mismatched, the disparities are indicated by an arrow. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the immune responses. In this example immune reactivity can occur in the recipient-to-donor (host-versus-graft, rejection) direction for HA-2 and HA-3 and in the donor-to-recipient (graft-versus-host) direction for HA-8 and for the various H-Y antigens.
The tissue distribution of each relevant minor H antigen is listed as “broad” or “restricted”. By clicking these terms, a detailed list of target cells expressing the minor H antigen will be displayed.
Minor H antigens are presented by selected HLA molecules. The HLA alleles expressed by recipient and donor that are not able to present a minor H antigen are listed at the bottom of the results section. Information will appear in case a particular minor H antigen cannot be presented by a specific HLA sub-allele (4-digit format; in this example HLA- DQB1*0503/0504 for DQ5/H-Y).
