                Figure 1.  
                     M. tuberculosis persists in a non-replicating state inside adipocytes.
                     A. 3T3-L1 mouse (grey bars) and primary human (black bars) adipocytes were infected with M. tuberculosis, clinical isolate MT103, at a MOI of 1.
Mycobacterial binding to the cells was measured after 4 h at 4°C in the presence of various inhibitors.
Man, yeast mannan; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; pA, polyadenosinic acid; pI, polyinosinic acid; Fuc, fucoidan; PC, PAz-PC, a predominant form of oxidized low-density lipoprotein.
Results are expressed as % of the binding without inhibitor (Ø).

                     B. 3T3-L1 adipocytes (grey bars) and pre-adipocytes (black bars) were infected as described in A. in the presence of Fuc or PAz-PC.
