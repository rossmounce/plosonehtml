                     M. tuberculosis accumulates lipid droplets inside adipocytes.3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes (A–C&amp;E) and pre-adipocytes (D) were pulsed with M. tuberculosis MT103 at a MOI of 1 for 4 h, then chased with fresh medium for 24 h and observed by electron microscopy.
In A., the arrow indicates a mycobacterial vacuole shown at higher magnification in the inset; LD, lipid droplet; bar = 2 µm.
In B., perilipinA/B was immuno-stained with gold-conjugated antibodies.

                     Mtb, M. tuberculosis; bar = 200 nm.
In C, bar = 500 nm.
In D&amp;E, bar = 200 nm.
