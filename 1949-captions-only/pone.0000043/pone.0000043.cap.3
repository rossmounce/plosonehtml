                Figure 3.  Detection of M. tuberculosis in adipose tissue from individuals with latent or active TB.
                     A. Perinodal adipose tissue was taken from biopsy of the mediastinal lymph node from a patient with active TB.
Bacilli were immuno-detected using an anti-BCG rabbit hyperimmune serum (right panel).
As a control, a serial section was stained with serum from a na√Øve animal (left panel).

                     B. Perinodal adipose tissue was taken at autopsy from two individuals (upper and lower panels) with no clinical sign of pulmonary TB.

                     In situ PCR was used to detect IS6110.
