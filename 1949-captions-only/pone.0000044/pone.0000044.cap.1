                Figure 1.  HCNCp mRNA Transcripts Are Upregulated During EncystationSAGE revealed increased steady state abundance of HCNCp transcripts beginning at 12 hr encystation through 42 hr compared to trophozoite (“troph”) and 4 hr encystation.
SAGE data is presented as percentage of all tags sampled at a given time point.
