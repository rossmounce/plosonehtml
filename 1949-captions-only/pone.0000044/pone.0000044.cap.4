                Figure 4.  Presence Or Absence Of The HCNCp Gene And mRNA Transcripts In Trophozoites Of 9 Giardia Strains/Subclones(A) Genomic PCR found that the gene for HCNCp is present in all giardial isolates except for GS/M (upper panel).
Lower panel shows tubulin controls for each isolate.
(B) HCNCp mRNA transcripts were detected in all strains/clones tested except for the most divergent known Giardia strain infecting humans, GS/M (upper panel).
Tubulin controls for rt-PCR without reverse transcriptase (“-“) or plus reverse transcriptase (“+”) are shown in the lower panel.
Sizing markers are indicated by dashes to the left side of the figure in kb.
