                Figure 1.  Brenthia moths are jumping spider mimics.The moth (upper image) mimics jumping spiders (lower image) with wing markings, wing positioning, posture, and movement (drawing by Virginia Wagner).
These moths survive encounters with jumping spiders more often than controls.
Moreover, jumping spiders respond to them with territorial displays that are normally directed towards other jumping spiders, indicating that Brenthia moths are being mistakenly recognized as jumping spiders, and not as potential prey.
