                Figure 1.  Programmed methylation of the human γA-globin promoter
                     A. Two IEs (yellow) bounded by loxP elements (stippled black) were inserted into the γA promoter region of a YAC containing the human β-globin locus [18], and this was used to generate transgenic mice that were then crossed with two different cre-expressing lines. 
In the first line (Cre) [19], cre is expressed (red) prior to implantation.
In mice carrying this construct the IE is deleted before the wave of de novo methylation, and surrounding CpG sites thus become methylated (red circles).
The second cre-expressing line carries interferon-inducible cre [20].
In these mice (Mx-cre), the IE remains present during implantation and protects adjacent regions from methylation.
By treating adult animals with polyI-polyC, cre activity could be induced (red) and the IE removed, generating an unmethylated version of the transgene.
