                Figure 2.  Effect of DNA methylation on gene expressionA. RNA from purified adult or fetal liver erythroblasts and MEFs from Cre (γA promoter methylated) or Mx-cre (γA promoter unmethylated) crossed transgenic (lines 47, 64 or 113)) mice were subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR on 1 or 3 µl samples to detect human β (HBB) or γ(HBG)-globin RNA. 
We measured Aprt expression to control for the amount of cDNA in the reaction.
Genes expressed at high levels were quantitated by diluting the input sample (e.g. 1/105 for Aprt in MEFs).
In order to distinguish between the two γ genes, we took advantage of a PstI restriction site that is present in γA and not γG 
                     [51].
A smaller induction of γA was observed in line 66 which is only partially unmethylated at the promoter (data not shown).
The degree of IE excision in purified erythroblasts from induced Mx-cre carrying mice was found to be &gt;90% by PCR analysis.
The data for fetal erythroblasts was taken from an animal with a “methylated” γA gene, but we have demonstrated that it is indeed unmethylated in fetal liver (data not shown), as expected.
