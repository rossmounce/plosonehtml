                Figure 3.  Effect of DNA methylation on promoter structureMononucleosomes were prepared from either non-erythroid (A) or erythroid (B) cells taken from Cre (methylated) and Mx-cre (unmethylated) founder (64) transgene crosses and subjected to ChIP analysis using anti-Ac-H4.
Input (I) and bound (B) DNA fractions were used for semi-quantitative PCR on 1 or 3 µl samples using primer sets specific for the γG or loxP-inserted γA promoter regions.
For each ChIP preparation, the Acta1 gene (green) was assayed as a negative control and the Actb gene (yellow) as a positive control.
The results are summarized in graphic form after normalizing to Acta1 (green) enrichment (set at 1.0) (coefficient of variance = 17%).
The results for the Cre (blue) and Mx-cre (red) mice are shown.
Results for β globin are presented for comparison.
The data shown for non-erythroid cells was obtained using mononucleosomes from MEFs, but the graph summarizes results from 3–4 ChIP experiments on both MEFs and lymphocytes.
