                Figure 4.  γ promoter methylation pattern in patients with HPFHThe γA and γG promoter regions were analyzed for CpG methylation on individual clones by the bisulfite technique.
To this end we used Fibach culture erythroblasts derived from normal individuals, as well as heterozygote HPFH1 or β0 Thalassemia (IVS-II-I, G⇑A) patients.
Black circles indicate methylated CpGs, whereas open circles indicate a lack of methylation.
The numbers in the margin indicate how many clones were fully methylated.
