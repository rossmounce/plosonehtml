This plasmid (+2IE) was later used as a template for homologous recombination in the YAC (see <a href="#s4">methods</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>The map indicates the restriction site locations according to PubMed accession number NG_00007.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>Bold marked restriction enzymes are methylation sensitive. Total founder embryo DNA was digested with HindIII alone or together with CfoI, or alternatively with StuI/XbaI alone or together with HpaII, MspI or AvaI.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Southern-blot analysis was performed using probes 5′ or 3′ as labeled.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.fig1.caption1.p6"></a><p>From this experiment, we conclude that a double IE is capable of inducing undermethylation over a distance of at least 500 bp in each direction.</p>
