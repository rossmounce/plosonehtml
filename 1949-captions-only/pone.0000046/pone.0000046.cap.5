                Figure 5.  IE induces undermethylation in transgenic miceWe made transgenic embryos (12.5 dpc) using either a plasmid that contains the normal promoter of the human γA-globin gene (-IE), or a plasmid that contains the promoter of the human γA-globin gene modified to harbor a dimer of the IE bounded by two lox elements (+2IE) 40 bp upstream to the γA transcription start site, and tested total founder embryonic DNA for methylation at specific restriction sites by southern blot analysis. This plasmid (+2IE) was later used as a template for homologous recombination in the YAC (see methods).
The map indicates the restriction site locations according to PubMed accession number NG_00007.
Bold marked restriction enzymes are methylation sensitive. Total founder embryo DNA was digested with HindIII alone or together with CfoI, or alternatively with StuI/XbaI alone or together with HpaII, MspI or AvaI.
Southern-blot analysis was performed using probes 5′ or 3′ as labeled.
The sizes of expected bands are indicated on the autoradiogram. Data shown are representative of results obtained with several transgenic founder mice for each construct.
From this experiment, we conclude that a double IE is capable of inducing undermethylation over a distance of at least 500 bp in each direction.
