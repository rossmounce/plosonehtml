                Figure 1.  Location of H3K4M3 correlated with Hoxa9 expression level. (A) Diagram of 5â€² Hoxa cluster genes, from Hoxa5 to Hoxa11, showing the location of the amplicons used for quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipiation assay (qChIP).
The enrichment of H3K4 methylation was determined by qChIP in AT1 cells (B), AR1 cells (C) and MEF26 cells (D).
(E) Hoxa9 expression levels in the indicated cell lines as determined by qPCR.
The relative expression level of Hoxa9 gene was calculated relative to that in MEF26 cells.
