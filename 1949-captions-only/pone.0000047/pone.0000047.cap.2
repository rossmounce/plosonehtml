                Figure 2.  Active and repressive histone modification markers were co-enriched in Hoxa9 locus.Active histone markers including H4K16Ace, H3K4M2 and H3K4M3, were indicated as grey bars.
Repressive markers including H3K4M1, H3K9M2 and H3K27M2 were indicated as black bars.
(A) AT1 cells maintain both active and repressive histone modifications at amplicon 2.
(B) AR1 cells show aberrant high expression of active histone modifications but low level of repressive histone modifications at amplicon 2.
(C) and (D) show that MEF26 cells contain both active and repressive histone markers at amplicons 2 and 4, respectively.
