                Figure 3.  Menin is required for both active and repressive histone modifications in AT1 cells.Menin excision (Men1Δ/Δ) dramatically reduced active (A) and repressive (B) histone modifications.
The highly enriched peak of H3K4M3 and H3K4M2 were almost completely abrogated.
(C) Menin excision also reduced the expressions of Hoxa5, Hoxa7, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10.
No expression of Hoxa1 and Hoxa13 was detectable.
(D) 4-OH Tamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment substantially reduced menin expression as compared to non-tamoxifen treated AT1 cells.
Mouse β-actin was used as control.
