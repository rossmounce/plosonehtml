                Figure 4.  Cdx4 is crucial for the expression of 5′ Hoxa cluster genes in hematopoietic AT1 cells.(A) Expression profile of Men1, MLL, Cdx4 and Hoxa9 was determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR.
Ectopic expression of Cdx4 increased the expression of 5′ Hoxa cluster in AT1 cells (B) but not in AR1 cells (C).
