                Figure 5.  Cdx4 and menin co-regulate the reporter activity driven by Hoxa9 regulatory elements.(A) Diagram of Hoxa9 locus, showing the locations of amplicons and the corresponding reporter elements B, D, E and F.
(B) Co-expression of menin and Cdx4 with reporters in 293 cells induced the activity of reporters pB and pE.
The reporter activity was arbitrarily calculated relative to vector control.
(C) Western blot shows that in vitro synthesized and transiently expressed Cdx4 was specifically detected by anti-Cdx4 antibodies.
