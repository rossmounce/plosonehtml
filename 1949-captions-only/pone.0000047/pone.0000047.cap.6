                Figure 6.  In vitro detection of Cdx4 protein binding sites in the regulatory region of Hoxa9.(A) A diagram of Hoxa9 locus, showing the corresponding locations between amplicons for qChIPs, reporter elements for luciferase analysis and oligo probes for EMSA.
(B) The wild-type and mutation sequences of probe 2 (left) and probe 6 (right).
The Cdx protein consensus binding sites were underlined.
Wild type sequence of Probe 2 contains one potential Cdx consensus binding site (CBSs) while probe 6 contains two tandem CBSs.
(C) Cdx4 protein was able to bind probe 2 wild type sequence but not the mutant sequence.
Asterisk (*) denotes a band that likely resulted from partially degraded Cdx4.
Their binding was inhibited by anti-Cdx4 antibody but not by a control IgG (left panel).
The same in vitro binding assay was conducted for probe 6 and its mutant (right panel).
