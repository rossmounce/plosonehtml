                Figure 7.  Loss of menin abolishes Cdx4 binding to chromatin targets.(A) qChIP assay shows that Cdx4 and menin have a similar binding peak at amplicon 2.
Menin excision (AT1 Men1Δ/Δ) almost completely blocked Cdx4 binding.
(B) The amplified PCR product for amplicon 2 was separated on 1.5% agarose gel.
