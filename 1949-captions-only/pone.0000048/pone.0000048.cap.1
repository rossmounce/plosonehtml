                  A: Short axis high resolution, high field cardiac MRI of a FXIII−/− mouse 2 days after coronary ligation. Arrows: intrathoracic hematoma adjacent to experimental anterolateral infarction.

                  B: Autopsy confirms a blood clot (asterisk) originating from myocardial rupture at the border zone (arrow) of the myocardial infarct.

                  C: Histology of 1A shows rupture channel (arrows), filled with blood.

                  D: In patients with ruptured MI, FXIII levels were significantly reduced (*p&lt;0.01).
