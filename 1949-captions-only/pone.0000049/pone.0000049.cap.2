                Figure 2.  The Three Possible Attractors Generated by the Mutual Inhibition Network under Different ConditionsBlue dots represent the expression pattern for cells cultured overnight in Medium N, while purple dots represent that for cells that were transferred from Medium N to Medium N plus nalidixic acid and cultured for 3 days until the number of cells increased sufficiently for flow cytometric analysis.
The diagonal correlation for purple dots was not related to any relationship of GFP and RFP expression, but was attributable to the leakage of fluorescence of GFP and RFP to the 600 nm dichroic filter and the band-pass filter at 525 nmÂ±25 nm, respectively.
