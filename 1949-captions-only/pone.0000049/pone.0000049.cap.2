<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>The diagonal correlation for purple dots was not related to any relationship of GFP and RFP expression, but was attributable to the leakage of fluorescence of GFP and RFP to the 600 nm dichroic filter and the band-pass filter at 525 nmÂ±25 nm, respectively.</p>
