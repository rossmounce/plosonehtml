<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>After transfer to Medium M cells were sampled at 0.5 h (green dash-double-dotted line), 2 h (green solid line), 5 h (green broken line), and 7.5 h (green dash-dotted line).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>After transfer to Medium T cells were sampled at 0.5 h (red dash-double-dotted line), 3h (red solid line), 5 h (red broken line), and 7.5 h (red dash-dotted line).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Green and red fluorescence of each cell was measured by flow cytometry. By taking the ratio between the two fluorescence intensities, the influence of the diagonal correlation with the slope of 1 shown in <a href="#pone-0000049-g002">Figure 2</a> could be cancelled.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p7"></a><p>Similarly, the temporal changes in Medium M were calculated from 2 h to 5 h (green broken line), and from 5 h to 7.5 h (green dash-dotted line).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p8"></a><p>The temporal changes in Medium T were calculated from 0.5 h to 3 h (red solid line), from 3 h to 5 h (red broken line), and from 5 h to 7.5 h (red dash-dotted line).</p>
