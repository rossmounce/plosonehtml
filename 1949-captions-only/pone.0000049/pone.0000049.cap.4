                     E. coli OSU1 cells with pALL7 were subjected to serial overnight culture with an inoculum size of 6×107 cells/l every day in changing environments.
(A) Days 1–5 in Medium N, days 6–7 in Medium T, days 8–10 in Medium N, days 11–13 in Medium M, days 14–15 in Medium N, and day 16 in Medium T.
On the last day of serial overnight cultures in the same medium, the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis.
(B) Days 1–5 in Medium N, days 6–7 in Medium M, days 8–9 in Medium T, days 10–11 in Medium N, days 12–13 in Medium M, and day 14 in Medium T.
