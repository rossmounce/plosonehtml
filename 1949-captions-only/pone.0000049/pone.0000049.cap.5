                Figure 5.  Microscopic Examination of Cells Cultured Overnight in Three Different MediaGFP and RFP fluorescence of cells in Medium M, N, and T were examined using an Olympus IX70 microscope and a KEYENCE VB-6010 CCD camera.
For the GFP channel, a BA470-490 excitation filter, DM505 dichromatic beam splitter, and BA515-550 emission filter were used.
For the RFP channel, a BA520-550 excitation filter, DM565 dichromatic beam splitter, and BA580IF emission filter were used.
The exposure time and the sensitivity expressed as ISO values are shown in the pictures.
Scale bar, 5 Âµm.
