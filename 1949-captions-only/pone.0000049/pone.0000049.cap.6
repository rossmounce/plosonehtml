                Figure 6.  Simulation of Dynamics of Networks with Mutually Inhibitory OperonsBlack, green, and red indicate activity A, and the expression levels at the two operons, m1 and m2, respectively.
Culture conditions were captured by N1, N2 (see Supporting Information). We employed a changing environment: (N1, N2) = (10,10) from 0 to 2000 step, (0,10) to 8000, (10,10) to 10000, (10, 0) to 16000, (10,10) to 20000.
The parameters used in this simulation were: S(A) = 6A/(2+A) and D(A) = A, N_thr
                     1 = N_thr
                     2 = 2, P = C = 0.01, and n1 = n2 = 5.
Initially, the environment contained both nutrients at sufficient levels from t = 0 to 2000, and activity A was less than but very close to 1.
Then, following the change in the environment causing depletion of N1 = 0 but with N2 = 10, the system started to lose the activity, which destabilized the Attractor W, and entered the regime with two attractors, where the attractor with higher levels of m1 is selected.
When returned to the nutrient-rich environment at t = 8000, the system came back to the single attractor with m1 = m2 = 1.
