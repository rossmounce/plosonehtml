<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>Culture conditions were captured by <em>N</em>1, <em>N</em>2 (see Supporting Information). We employed a changing environment: (<em>N</em>1, <em>N</em>2) = (10,10) from 0 to 2000 step, (0,10) to 8000, (10,10) to 10000, (10, 0) to 16000, (10,10) to 20000.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>The parameters used in this simulation were: <em>S</em>(<em>A</em>) = 6<em>A</em>/(2+<em>A</em>) and <em>D</em>(<em>A</em>) = <em>A</em>, <em>N</em>_<em>thr</em>
                     <sub>1</sub> = <em>N</em>_<em>thr</em>
                     <sub>2</sub> = 2, <em>P</em> = <em>C</em> = 0.01, and <em>n</em>1 = <em>n</em>2 = 5.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Initially, the environment contained both nutrients at sufficient levels from <em>t</em> = 0 to 2000, and activity <em>A</em> was less than but very close to 1.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p5"></a><p>Then, following the change in the environment causing depletion of <em>N</em>1 = 0 but with <em>N</em>2 = 10, the system started to lose the activity, which destabilized the Attractor W, and entered the regime with two attractors, where the attractor with higher levels of <em>m</em>1 is selected.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p6"></a><p>When returned to the nutrient-rich environment at <em>t</em> = 8000, the system came back to the single attractor with <em>m</em>1 = <em>m</em>2 = 1.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p7"></a><p>Then, the environmental conditions were changed to depletion of the other nutrient, <em>N</em>1 = 10, <em>N</em>2 = 0 at <em>t</em> = 10000, and the system first deviated to express more of <em>m</em>1 but less <em>m</em>2.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p8"></a><p>This deviation to the side of the non-adaptive attractor occurred by chance, but the small value of <em>m</em>2 did not compensate for the nutrient depletion and the activity is reduced close to zero.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p9"></a><p>Then, the noise term in equations (1) took over in influence on the system.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p10" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.fig1.caption1.p10"></a><p>This fluctuation decreased only when <em>m</em>2 happened to rise sufficiently to allow activity to increase again at around <em>t</em> = 11000.</p>
