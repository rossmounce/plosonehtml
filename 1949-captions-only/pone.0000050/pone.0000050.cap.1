<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>Double positive cells were identified as NKT cells and gated on for further analysis to determine CD4 (PE) and CD8 (biotin followed by strepavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5) expression.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>(B) NKT cell subsets were identified by staining for Vα24, Vβ11, and CD4 as in 1A and then gated on for further analysis. Expression of the indicated cell surface marker on these subsets was then determined.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Combinations of the following antibodies were used, depending on the particular stain: Vα24 (FITC or unlabelled), Vβ11 (unlabelled or PE), CD4 (PE, biotin, or unlabelled), CCR7 (unlabelled), CD62L (PE), CD94 (unlabelled), CD161 (FITC), CD28 (biotin), goat anti-mouse (APC), and strepavidin (PerCP-Cy5.5). One representative donor is shown.</p>
