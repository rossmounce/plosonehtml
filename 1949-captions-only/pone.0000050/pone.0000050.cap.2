<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>These cells were re-stimulated for 6–8 hours using DCs pulsed with α-GalCer (100 ng/ml), or alternatively, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, in the presence of GolgiStop (BD) and were then intracellularly stained with antibodies against IL-4 (PE) and IFN-γ (APC).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>NKT cells were also co-stained with anti-Vβ11 (FITC) to exclude contaminating non-NKT cells.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>For adult NKT cells, CD4 expression was also assessed by cell surface staining (CD4-biotin followed by strepavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5) to differentiate CD4+ from CD4− NKT cells.</p>
