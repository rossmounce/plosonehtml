                Figure 3.  Chemokine receptor expression on polarized NKT cell subsets. One representative neonatal or adult sample of 5 is shown for each.
(A) CCR4 expression on polarized NKT cell lines was assayed by staining with anti-CCR4 (unlabelled followed by goat anti-mouse APC) and anti-CD4 (PE) to differentiate between adult CD4+ and CD4− NKT cells and anti-Vβ11 (FITC) to exclude contaminating non-NKT cells.
Isotype control is depicted in light gray.
(B) CXCR3 (unlabelled followed by goat anti-mouse APC) expression on polarized NKT cell subsets were assayed as in 3A.
