<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>For A, B, C, and D, one representative donor out of three independent experiments is shown. (A) NKT cells were added at an Effector:Target (NKT cell: 3T3 cell) ratio of 1:1 to adherent 3T3 cells in the presence of different α-GalCer concentrations.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>After 18–20 hours, NKT cells were collected and stained with anti-CD25 (unlabelled followed by goat anti-mouse APC) to determine activation.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>(B) As in A, NKT cells at an NKT:3T3 of 1:1 were activated in the presence of varying concentrations of α-GalCer.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p5"></a><p>After 18–20 hours, cells were collected by trypsinization to remove any 3T3 cells that were still adherent and target 3T3 cells were stained with propidium iodide to determine their viability.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p6"></a><p>(C) α-GalCer was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml to adherent 3T3 cells.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p7"></a><p>NKT cell subsets were then added at different NKT:3T3 ratios. Viability of 3T3 cells after an 18–20 hour incubation period was determined as in 5B.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p8"></a><p>(D) Polarized nCD4+ NKT cells were generated as in <a href="#pone-0000050-g002">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p9"></a><p>The cytotoxic capacity of these NKT0, NKT1, and NKT2 lines was assayed as in <a href="#pone-0000050-g005">Figure 5C</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p10" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.fig1.caption1.p10"></a><p>One NKT:3T3 ratio for each donor is shown.</p>
