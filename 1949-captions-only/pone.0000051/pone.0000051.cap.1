                Figure 1.  Generation of Thr668Ala Knock-in Mutant Mice.(A) The targeting vector (a1), a partial map of the APP gene (a2), the resultant targeted allele (a3), and the knock-in allele after Cre recombination (a4) are illustrated.
Filled boxes denote coding sequences of exons 17 and 18.
Shaded parts in exon18 correspond to the 3′ non-coding region.
A substitution is represented by a dot in exon 18.
B, BamHI; X, XhoI.
Probes for Southern blot analysis for screening of targeted ES clones are indicated with small bars in (a2–4).
PCR primers (E1 and E2) for genotyping of mice are indicated with small arrows in (a2 and a4).
(B) Verified sequences from wild-type (T/T), and Thr668Ala mutation homozygotes (A/A).
