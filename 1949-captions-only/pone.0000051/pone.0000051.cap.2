                Figure 2.  Normal brain structure and expression and distribution of proteins related to neuron and glia in Thr668Ala mutant mice. (A) Nissl-stained hippocampal sections show no difference between wild-type (T/T) and Thr668Ala mutation homozygotes (A/A).
Scale bars represent 500 µm.
(B) Immunohistochemical analysis in CA1 hippocampal region of aged (&gt;12 mo-old) mice.
Immunostaining for GFAP (astroglial marker), synaptophysin (presynaptic marker), and MAP-2 (neuronal dendritic marker) in hippocampal CA1 region of wild-type (T/T) and Thr668Ala mutant (A/A) mice are shown.
S.o., stratum oriens; Py, pyramidal cell; Rad, stratum radiatum. Scale bars represent 50 µm.
(C) Western blot analysis of APP, X11L, MAP2, synaptophysin, PSD95 (postsynaptic marker), and GFAP from the brains of 12 mo-old wild-type (T/T) and Thr668Ala mutant (A/A) mice.
