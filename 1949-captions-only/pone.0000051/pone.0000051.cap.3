                Figure 3.  APP and sAPP in wild-type and Thr668Ala mutant mouse brain.(Left) APP and sAPP in wild-type (W) and mutant (M) mouse brain. Homogenates of brains taken from 12-month-old mice were fractionated as described and analyzed by immunoblotting for sAPP and APP holoprotein (22C11), APP (APP/C), phosphorylated APP (pThr668APP), sAPPα, sAPPβ and MAP2B.
Protein bands observed in the insoluble fraction (ppt panel) of sAPPβ are non-specific.
(Right) sAPP and APP levels are displayed.
The densities of the bands from soluble APP (sAPP) were standardized to the densities of MAP2B, and those from APP were standardized to the densities of actin.
All were normalized to unity for wild-type mice (1.0). The bars indicate means±S.D. (N.S.; n = 4).
