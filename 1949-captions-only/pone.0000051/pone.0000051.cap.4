                Figure 4.  Aging-dependent phosphorylation of APP and APP CTFs and quantification of CTFs in wild-type and Thr668Ala mutant mice brain.(A) APP phosphorylation state in brains of post-natal day 0 (P0), young adult (2-month), and aged adult (12-month) mice.
The upper panel was probed with anti-pan-APP C-terminal antibody G369, and the lower panel was probed with an anti-phospho-threonine-668-specific antibody.
W, wild-type mouse; M, Thr668Ala mutant mouse.
(B) APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (APP CTFs) in wild-type (W) and mutant (M) mouse brain.
C99 and C89 are products resulting from cleavage of APP by BACE, while C83 results from cleavage of APP by ADAM-10/-17.
PhosphoC99 (pC99), phosphoC89 (pC89), and phosphoC83 (pC83) are all mono-phosphorylated at Thr668, and these peptides are numbered here according to standard APP695 nomenclature.
(C) Expression levels of CTFα and CTFβ in middle aged wild-type and Thr668A mutant mouse brain.
Various species of CTF are schematically represented at the left and indicated at right with bars.
