                Figure 5.  Hemi-brains from wild-type (upper panel of six blots, labeled “Wild-type”, far left) or mutant (lower panel of six blots; labeled “Mutant T668A”, far left) 5-month old mice were used for fractionation on iodixanol density-gradients as described (4).Equal aliquots (according to volume) were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies as specified: anti-early endosome antigen 1 (Transduction laboratories, EEA1, top panel), anti-cis-Golgi matrix protein (Transduction laboratories, GM130, second panel), anti-protein disulfide isomerase (Stressgen, PDI, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum, third panel), anti-post synaptic density 95 (Transduction laboratories, PSD95, a synaptic membrane marker, fourth panel), anti-pan-APP (G369, fifth panel) and anti-phospho-threonine668 APP (Cell Signaling, bottom panel).
