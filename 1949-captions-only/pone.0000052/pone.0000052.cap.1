                Figure 1.  Non-parametric regression of the natural logarithm (log) of Alzheimer's incidence rates on age.Rates were estimated per 1,000 person-years.
The diameter of the circles for each data point is proportional to the square root of the number of Alzheimer's cases.
For visibility, very small circles have been replaced by asterisks.
The solid and dashed curves were obtained by weighted non-parametric regression methods using sm and loess, respectively (see Methods); the smoothing parameter corresponded to span = 1 in both cases [52]â€“[54].
The two curves closely agree and depart significantly from a linear model (sm regression, P&lt;0.0001).
There was no evidence for non-constant variance (score test, P = 0.88).
