                Figure 2.  Non-parametric regression of the number of basic cognitive units (BCU) on age.The BCU count is expressed as a proportion with respect to the average normal BCU count at an early age (say, age 20 years).
Again, circle sizes are proportional to the square root of the number of Alzheimer's cases, asterisks represent very small circles, the solid curve was obtained using sm, and the dashed curve was obtained using loess (span = 1).
Data points were directly derived from the z-scores associated with the corresponding Alzheimer's incidence rates, using the equation: BCU|age = 0.5−0.1× z-score, where the threshold (c) is 0.5, and the standard deviation (SD) is 0.1 (see Methods).
The plotted curves were derived from the average annual incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease (see Fig. 1), but virtually identical curves were obtained by direct weighted non-parametric regression of BCU points on age.
Again, both BCU curves closely agree and depart significantly from linearity (sm regression, P&lt;0.0001).
Thus, BCU counts decrease with age up to approximately age 85 years, and then level off.
