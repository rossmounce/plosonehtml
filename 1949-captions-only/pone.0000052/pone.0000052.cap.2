<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>Again, circle sizes are proportional to the square root of the number of Alzheimer's cases, asterisks represent very small circles, the solid curve was obtained using <em>sm</em>, and the dashed curve was obtained using <em>loess</em> (span = 1).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p3"></a><p>Data points were directly derived from the <em>z</em>-scores associated with the corresponding Alzheimer's incidence rates, using the equation: BCU|age = 0.5−0.1× <em>z</em>-score, where the threshold (<em>c</em>) is 0.5, and the standard deviation (SD) is 0.1 (see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p4"></a><p>The plotted curves were derived from the average annual incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease (see <a href="#pone-0000052-g001">Fig. 1</a>), but virtually identical curves were obtained by direct weighted non-parametric regression of BCU points on age.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p5"></a><p>Again, both BCU curves closely agree and depart significantly from linearity (<em>sm</em> regression, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p6"></a><p>Thus, BCU counts decrease with age up to approximately age 85 years, and then level off.</p>
