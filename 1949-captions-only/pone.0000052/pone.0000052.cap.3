                Figure 3.  Non-parametric regression curves of basic cognitive units (BCU) on age, for women and men.The overall pattern of these two BCU loess curves was similar to that found for the total population (see Fig. 2), with a leveling off at older ages.
However, there were statistically highly significant differences between women and men (generalized additive model for log incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease, P = 0.0015).
While the two curves are very similar up to age 75 years, women deteriorate more than men at older ages.
