(<em>C</em>) Cyclin B and Phospho-H3 transiently peaked as control-treated cells passed through mitosis, while they accumulated in PIASγ-B treated cells (these blots are from mit + int cells).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>Apc2 and Smc3 are loading controls. (<em>D–G</em>) Most PIASγ-depleted cells appeared to arrest in metaphase until the end of the experiment (~12 hours after reaching mitosis).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>Accordingly, chromosomes became progressively over-condensed (from <em>D</em> to <em>G</em>); arrow indicates the largest metacentric chromosome in each spread.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p5"></a><p>Unlike cells arrested in c-mitosis with nocodazole, PIASγ-depleted cells did not open chromosome arms. Proper chromosome alignment is evident in the side views of metaphase plates (<em>D,F</em>) and in the polar views (<em>E,G</em>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p6"></a><p>In some cells one or two chromosomes lay off the metaphase plate (<em>H</em>); since these cells usually displayed overcondensed chromosomes and because this stage followed formation of a complete metaphase plate (see time-lapse material), we describe these as de-congressed metaphases.</p>
