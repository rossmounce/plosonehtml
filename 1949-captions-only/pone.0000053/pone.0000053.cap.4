                Figure 4.  Anaphase is induced by Aurora B or Cdk inhibition in PIASγ-depleted metaphase cells.(A–E) Depletion of Hec1 using RNAi [30] induces a persistent spindle checkpoint arrest in prometaphase (A).
The Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 (5.6 µM) [29] bypassed this arrest: cells performed anaphase (B,C) and exited mitosis within 30 minutes (D,E).
(F–J) Cells arrested in metaphase by PIASγ depletion similarly perform anaphase and exit mitosis upon ZM447439 addition, but with slightly slower kinetics than Hec1-depleted cells, demonstrating that: (1) spindle-kinetochore interactions are functional after PIASγ-depletion, (2) sister chromatids are able to migrate to opposite spindle poles, (3) the metaphase arrest after PIASγ-depletion is due to a checkpoint response. (K–O) Anaphase and mitotic exit are induced by the Cdk inhibitor roscovitine (150 µM) in PIASγ-depleted metaphase arrested cells.
