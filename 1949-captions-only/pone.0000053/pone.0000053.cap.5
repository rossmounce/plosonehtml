<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>RNAi was performed as previously described <a href="#pone.0000053-GimenezAbian1">[13]</a> and cells allowed to reach mitosis after early S-phase synchrony in the presence of nocodazole: (<em>A</em>) c-mitosis arrest with nocodazole after Apc2 depletion; (<em>B</em>) complete sister chromatid separation in the presence of nocodazole after hSgo1 and Apc2 co-depletion. (<em>C,D</em>) hSgo1 is required for sister cohesion when a persistent spindle checkpoint is induced by Hec1-depletion (cells were synchronized and Hec1/hSgo1 depleted as described in <a href="#pone-0000053-g003">Figure 3</a> and <a href="#pone.0000053-GimenezAbian1">[13]</a>): (<em>C</em>) Prometaphase arrest after Hec1-depletion; (<em>D</em>) complete sister separation after hSgo1 and Hec1 co-depletion. Numbers on these micrographs (<em>A–D</em>) indicate % cells that arrested with these phenotypes 20 hours after release from S-phase. (<em>E–N</em>) hSgo1 depletion does not result in sister separation when PIASγ is co-depleted, either in the absence (<em>E–J</em>) or presence of nocodazole (<em>K–N</em>): (<em>E,F</em>) metaphase arrest after PIASγ-depletion; (<em>K</em>) c-mitosis arrest in nocodazole after PIASγ-depletion; (<em>G,L</em>) complete sister separation after hSgo1-depletion, with or without nocodazole; (<em>H,I</em>) metaphase arrest after hSgo1 and PIASγ co-depletion; (<em>M</em>) c-mitosis arrest in nocodazole after hSgo1 and PIASγ co-depletion. (<em>J</em>) After release from early S-phase, hSgo1-depleted cells arrest in mitosis with separated sisters, while almost all PIASγ-depleted and hSgo1/PIASγ co-depleted cells arrest with cohered sisters. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with nocodazole upon release from early S-phase (<em>N</em>). Nocodazole used at 0.25 µM. (<em>O–R′</em>) Immunostaining of myc-tagged Rad21 in HeLa cells. (<em>O–R</em>) Merge of DAPI (blue), CREST (green), myc-Rad21 (red). (<em>O′–R′</em>) myc-Rad21 staining only.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>(<em>O,O′</em>) Control cell. Rad21 localizes strongly between kinetochores, revealed by CREST signals, and weakly between chromosome arms. The term “metaphase-like”, as in the other panels, refers to the fact that metaphases are not unequivocally identifiable after the pre-extraction and fixation procedures required before immunostaining. (<em>P, P′</em>) PIASγ-depleted cell at metaphase displaying a pattern of myc-Rad21 localization similar to that of control cells. (<em>Q–Q′</em>) Sgo1-depleted cells. The cell on the left is most likely an early prophase cell (judging by the closely paired sister kinetochores) and shows high myc-Rad21 staining throughout the nucleus, while the cell on the right does not have any detectable myc-Rad21 (most chromosomes have paired kinetochores while several have already separated, typical of precocious sister separation in prometaphase after hSgo1 depletion). (<em>R,R′</em>) Metaphase cell after PIASγ and hSgo1 co-depletion. No detectable myc-Rad21 staining is observed though sister centromere cohesion is maintained (kinetochores are paired).</p>
