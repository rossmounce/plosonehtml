(<em>A</em>) metaphase; (<em>B,C,D</em>) failed sister disjunction during anaphase and subsequent exit from mitosis. In <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> sister chromatids can still be observed to be cohered while the chromatin is largely decondensing (double arrows). For comparison, small inserted panels show metaphase (left-most panel) and anaphase (two panels on the right) in the presence of ZM447439 alone. (<em>E</em>) Frequency of cells in which sisters were able to disjoin upon addition of ZM447439, with or without ICRF-193. (<em>F–I</em>) Immunostaining of Topoisomerase IIα in HeLa cells expressing H2B-GFP (inserts show a slight enlargement of a selected region from the same micrograph). (<em>F–I</em>) Merge - Topoisomerase IIα (red) and H2B-GFP (green). (<em>F′–I′</em>) Topoisomerase IIα staining only. (<em>F′′–I′′</em>) H2B-GFP only. (<em>F–G</em>) Control mitotic cells showing Topoisomerase IIα localized to cores and concentrated at centromere regions; (<em>H</em>) PIASγ-depleted mitotic cell with diffusely localized Topoisomerase IIα on the chromatin; (<em>I</em>) PIASγ-depleted mitotic cell with Topoisomerase IIα localized to cores but not strongly enriched at centromere regions. (<em>J</em>) Classification of Topoisomerase IIα and INCENP immunostaining patterns in control and PIASγ-depleted mitotic cells. The “Kinetochore” and “Core &amp; Kinetochore” categories required that Topoisomerase IIα was strongly concentrated at the centromere regions.</p>
