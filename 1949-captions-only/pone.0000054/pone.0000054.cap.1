                Figure 1.  EGFP inhibits NF-κB and JNK activation in 293T cells(A) Activation of an NF-κB luciferase reporter by a Flag-tagged API2-MALT1 fusion protein is inhibited by EGFP in a dose dependent manner.
(B) EGFP does not block NF-κB dependent luciferase activity induced by expression of the p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB (C) Activation of an NF-κB luciferase reporter by Flag-API2-MALT1 is inhibited by EGFP mutated for the TRAF6 binding motif (D) EGFP but not pmaxGFP prevents TNF-α induced activation of the NF-κB luciferase reporter and phosphorylation of IκB-α and JUN in 293T cells.
EGFP does not increase HSP70 levels or induce HSP70B′ in 293T cells.
Fluorescence intensities (Ex485/Em520nm) for EGFP and pmaxGFP were both ~100 fold above background. (E) N- and/or C-terminal EGFP fusion proteins (for API2, CHIC2, NXF5a, NXF1, MALT1, Actin, Rab5, Syndecan binding protein 2 (SDCBP2) or β-Tubulin) and EGFP with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or a farnysilation site (pEGFP-F) reduce TNF-α-induced NF-κB luciferase reporter activity in 293T cells. Bottom: In humans, HSP70 is constitutively expressed under normal conditions, but Hsp70B′ is only induced in response to stress.
There is no basal expression of Hsp70B′[28].
As a positive controle for HSP70B′ expression, 293T cells (lane 2) were heat shocked at 44°C for two hours (lane 3) and allowed to recover at 37°C for 5 (lane 4) or 18 (lane 5) hours before harvest. NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity is represented for each experiment as fold induction of vector transfected cells and is represented graphically as the mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments.
All molecular weight standards are in kDa.
