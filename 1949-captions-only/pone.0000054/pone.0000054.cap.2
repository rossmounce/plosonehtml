                Figure 2.  EGFP blocks Lys63- and Lys48-linked polyubiquitination.(A) 293T cells transfected with the indicated constructs and treated for 4 hours with 20 ng/ml TNF-α (lane 5 and 6) were immunoblotted with anti-Flag (API2-MALT1), anti-HA (HA-Ub-K63) and anti-EGFP antibodies (left panel) or anti-IKKγ immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Flag (IKKγ) or anti-HA (ubiquitin) (right panel).
(B) EGFP affects K48-linked polyubiquitination.
293T cells were transfected with a Ubiquitin construct with only Lys48 available for polymerization (HA-Ub-K48), treated for 4 hours with 20 ng/ml TNF-α or left untreated and cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA (Ub-K48) and anti-EGFP antibodies.
Fluorescence intensities (Excitation 485/Emission 520 nm) for EGFP and pmaxGFP were comparable (~100 fold higher then background values), expression of pDs-Red was confirmed by Fluorescence microscopy.
(C) EGFP stabilizes exogenous API2-Myc in 293T cells via reduction of its Lys48-linked auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
(D) Stable expression of EGFP in the merkel cell carcinoma cell line MCC14.2 reduces polyubiquitination and enhances endogenous p53 expression levels.
The average ratio and standard deviation of p53 to actin signals are given (three independent experiments), (Ub)n : polyubiquitinated proteins.
