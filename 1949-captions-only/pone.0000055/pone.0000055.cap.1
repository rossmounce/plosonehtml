                     (A) During development, VDJ recombination causes enormous variability in TCRβ chain by randomly selecting different combinations of 23 V, 2 D, and 13 J gene segments, by nucleotide insertion (), and by nucleotide deletion from V (), D, and J () genes.
This results in a diversity of an estimated 106 different β chains per individual.

                     (B) N-deletion causes shortening of the Vβ and Jβ segments.
The number of nucleotides deleted from Vβ and Jβ germline DNA is limited.
N-deletion of 192 published TCRβ mRNAs was determined.
The figure shows the cumulative percentage of CDR3βs for the number of nucleotides deleted.
