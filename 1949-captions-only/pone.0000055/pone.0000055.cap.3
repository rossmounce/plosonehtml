                Figure 3.  Spectratyping and T-array for Jurkat T-cell clone mixed with peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells.Jurkat cells were added in different dilutions to a background of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells.

                     (panel A) CDR3 spectratyping with Vβ12-specific primer.
The arrow indicates a length identical to 14 amino acids, which is the length of the Jurkat CDR3β.

                     (panel B) A detail of the T-array scans.
White arrows indicate hexamer sequence GTTCGG, which is complementary to the first six nucleotides Jurkat NDNβ region.
