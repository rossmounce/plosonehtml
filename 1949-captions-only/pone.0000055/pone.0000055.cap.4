                Figure 4.  Clonal expansion of T-cells from a CMV+ donor after antigen specific stimulation.
                     (panel A) The fraction of antigen specific T-cell clones determined with NLVPMVATV-loaded tetramers.

                     (panel B) Spectratyping of unsorted Vβ13+ and Vβ13+/Jβ1-2+ fraction.

                     (panel C) CDR3 sequence of the clone identified compared to the Jβ1-2 germline sequence.

                     (panel D) T-array of unsorted Vβ13+/Jβ1-2+ fraction.
