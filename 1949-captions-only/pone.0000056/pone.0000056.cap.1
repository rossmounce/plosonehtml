                Figure 1.  Demography of normoxic and hypoxic fliesFlies fed on a 10S10Y regime were exposed to atmospheric oxygen (21% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) as indicated.
(A) Survivorship analysis.
Hypoxia decreased the mean life span from 33.6±0.8 days (n = 79) to 6.3±0.1 days (n = 282).
(B) Age specific mortality.
Hypoxia increased five fold the slope of the representation, suggesting an accelerated ageing.
