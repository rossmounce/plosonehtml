                Figure 4.  Dietary yeast promoted hypoxic deathA. Mortality trajectories of hypoxic flies reared on 10% sucrose diets supplemented with different concentrations of yeast as indicated.
Sample sizes were 10S1Y : 130, 10S2Y : 119, 10S4Y : 117, 10S5Y: 104, 10S10Y : 282.
B. Compared actions of dietary yeast on hypoxic and normoxic flies.
Flies were reared on a 10% sucrose diet supplemented with the indicated concentrations of yeast under normoxic (open symbols) or hypoxic (filled symbols) conditions and mean survivals were determined.
S.e.m were smaller than the sizes of the points and are nor represented
