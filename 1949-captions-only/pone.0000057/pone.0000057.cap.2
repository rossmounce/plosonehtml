                Figure 2.  Splenic architecture and cellular composition in susceptible B6 and in resistant F1 mice.Spleens from B6 mice (left panel) and from F1 mice (right panel) were either fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (A–D), or they were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and analysed by immunohistochemistry (C–M).
Sections are from naive mice (A, B) or from T. cruzi- infected mice (C–M) at the indicated day of infection.
Cryosections were stained for CD4 (E, F), CD19 (G, H), CD8 (I, K), or by the TUNEL reaction (L, M).
Micrographs A–K at original magnification 100×, micrographs L, M and insert in D at 400×; inset in D shows centre of a secondary follice.
