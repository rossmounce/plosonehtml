                Figure 4.  Murine T. cruzi susceptibility loci map to Chromosomes 5, 13, and 17.Nine microsatellite markers from the three candidate genomic regions previously identified as suceptibility loci [30] were typed in an additional 22 T. cruzi- susceptible B6xF1 backcross mice (see table 3 for respective markers).
Single-point (dashed line) and multi-point (solid line) calculations of χ2 are shown for all 68 susceptible backcross mice including the 46 from the original study.
Dotted lines at χ2 = 16.56 and χ2 = 8.74 indicate thresholds for suggestive and significant linkage, respectively.
