                Figure 3.  Overlays of a crystal structure with its unrefined and refined homology modelsThe crystal structure: green, Protein Data Bank ID: 1XE1; the unrefined homology model: yellow, provided by the Protein Structure Prediction Centre (TMR01, http://predictioncenter.org/caspR/); the refined homology model: red, refined from TMR01 using the same protocol [15] for the 3D model of Anopheles gambiae acetylcholinesterase.
