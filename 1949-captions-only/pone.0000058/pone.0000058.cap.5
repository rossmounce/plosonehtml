                Figure 5.  Multiple sequence alignments of acetylcholinesterases of insects and mammals listed in Table 1.The alignments were generated by CLUSTAL W (1.83). C286 and R339 of Anopheles gambiae acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the corresponding residues in other species are colored in red. The mammalian and A. gambiae AChEs are highlighted in yellow. The multiple sequence alignments of AChEs of 73 species are shown in Figure S2 of Supporting Information.
