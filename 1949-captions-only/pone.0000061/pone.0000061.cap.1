                Figure 1.  Computation of marginal distributions for all variables (arcs and nodes) of a hypothetical toy graph.A node in the network is a random variable that can have one of two values, false or true (0 or 1, respectively).
Both the brightness and the size of a node represent the strength of the probability that the corresponding molecule is present/active in the tissue or cell of interest, P(Vi = 1).
A higher probability is depicted with a lighter color and larger ball radius (see key to the node color and size); when the P(Vi = 1) drops to 0, the node disappears from the figure (the ball radius drops to zero).
Each arc is a random variable with three possible different values: inhibit, activate, and no effect (−1, 1, and 0, respectively).
Complete confidence that an arc AV,U

If both probabilities (P(AV,U
