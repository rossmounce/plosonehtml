                Figure 2.  Distributions for all arc and node variables in a large human molecular network.(A) Prior distributions for arcs and nodes computed by automated analysis of thousands of research articles.
(B) Reconciled marginal distributions for all variables in the graph: The graph has changed to improve the consistency of individual pieces of information, some of which were conflicting in the graph A.
Green, blue, yellow, and red nodes correspond to genes that were previously reported as associated with Alzheimer's disease, autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, respectively.
The nodes that we mentioned in the text have the following coordinates: WNT1 (6b), HBP1 (6b), EMX2 (6b), SRF (3b), SP1 (3b), TP53 (4b), PSEN1 (5c).
