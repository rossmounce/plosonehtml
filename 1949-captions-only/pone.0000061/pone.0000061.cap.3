                Figure 3.  Figure 3. Difference and entropy-change graphs for networks shown in Figure 2.(A) The absolute difference between the reconciled (Figure 2 B) and the prior (Figure 2 A) distributions.
For the activate arc value, an increase in probability is shown in yellow; a decrease is shown in red.
Similarly, for the inhibit arc value, an increase in probability is shown in blue; a decrease is shown in green.
For graph nodes, positive changes (increases) in the probability of observing the node in the active/present state are shown in red; negative changes (decreases) are shown in blue.
(B) Differences in the Shannon entropy (bits) for arc and node variables between the reconciled and prior marginal distributions.
Red variables lost their entropy (gained information), whereas blue ones increased their entropy (lost information), after computation of reconciled distributions.
The nodes that we mentioned in the text have the following coordinates: WNT1 (6b), HBP1 (6b), EMX2 (6b), SRF (3b), SP1 (3b), TP53 (4b), PSEN1 (5c).
