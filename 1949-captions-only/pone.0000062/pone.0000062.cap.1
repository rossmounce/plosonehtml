                Figure 1. Error-bar plots of residuals from the least-squares regressions of brain (a,b) and testis (c,d) weights on body weight, and sexual mass dimorphism values (e, f) by mating system and female promiscuity determinations.
Variables were logeâ€“transformed prior to regression analysis.
Error bars represent one standard error of the mean.
Mating system: MMMF, multi-male/multi-female; PA, polyandrous; Mon, monogamous; SM single male.
