                Figure 1.  Species richness in each habitat class.Richness is shown by rarefaction curves which describe how the number of species changes with the number of individuals sampled, thus controlling for both sampling effort and bird density.
Thick lines indicate mean richness and thin lines indicate 95% confidence intervals.
Note that the “late pine” line hugs the first part of the “mid pine” line, ending at two hundred individuals and twenty species.
