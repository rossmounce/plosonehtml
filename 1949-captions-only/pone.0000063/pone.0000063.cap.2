                Figure 2.  Species evenness in each habitat class.Evenness is shown by the probability of interspecific encounter (PIE, shown by thick lines; thin lines show 95% confidence intervals).
PIE controls for both sampling effort and bird density, and uses repeated re-sampling of the data to calculate the probability that the next bird sampled will be of a different species.
Therefore, high PIE values indicate high species evenness.
See “caveats” section of Discussion for an analysis of how detectability differences might influence the curves in this figure.
