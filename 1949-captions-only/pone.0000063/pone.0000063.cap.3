                Figure 3.  Indices of bird abundance for six habitat classes.Filled bars show means and standard errors of indices of abundance calculated by counting all birds within 50 m of each count center.
Habitat classes with the same letter are not significantly different from one another in a Tukey HSD multiple means comparison calculated using this data.
Open bars show estimated abundance with 95% confidence intervals from DISTANCE software using all birds detected up to 150 m.
Numbers above bars show the percentage difference between the DISTANCE estimate and the estimate made by counting birds within 50 m of count centers.
(E = early pine plantation, M = mid-aged pine plantation, L = late pine plantation, N = native forest, X = Exurban areas, T = thinned native forest.)
