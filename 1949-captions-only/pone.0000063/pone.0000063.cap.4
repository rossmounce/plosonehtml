                Figure 4.  Detrended correspondence analysis of bird communities calculated at the scale of transects.Each point represents the position in ordination space of the bird community detected at one transect.
The two axes show the relative position of each transect in the multi-dimensional space defined by the species found on each transect.
Thus transects with similar bird communities cluster together on the graph.
The first axis (DCA 1) is the one along which most of the variation in the ordination space is arranged (eigenvalue = 0.56), the second axis (DCA 2) is the second most important axis through the ordination space (eigenvalue = 0.44).
