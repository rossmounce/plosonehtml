(B) The relation of MRS to n-6 PUFA content, and to (C) n-3 PUFA content in phospholipids of skeletal muscles. Shown are partial residual plots (i.e. the independent effect of each predictor variable) from general additive mixed models using a smooth term for body weight (estimated df = 2.66, F = 4.77, P = &lt;0.001) and linear terms for n-6 and n-3 PUFA content. To adjust for phylogenetically caused correlations models included the family membership of each species as a random factor.</p>
