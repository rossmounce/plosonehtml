                  cno2
                   zygotic null mutants display gain and loss of progenitors.
All panels show lateral views of stage 11 embryos stained with an α-Eve antibody.
(A) Eve wildtype (wt) expression in a subset of dorsal muscle/heart progenitors and founder cells (2–3 cells) per hemisegment.
(B) cno2
                   mutants show gain (arrow), loss (arrowhead) or a wildtype number (asterisk) of Eve+ progenitors in different hemisegments.
(C) Embryos in which NAct, Wg and RasAct are simultaneously expressed in the mesoderm display a cno2
