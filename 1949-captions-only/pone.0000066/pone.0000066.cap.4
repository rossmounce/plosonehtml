                Figure 4. Cno inhibits Wg-Dsh pathway and links it with Dl-N pathway.
Table shows % of embryos and hemisegments (Hs) for each indicated genotype that display extra Eve+ cells.
At least 70 embryos/770 hemisegments were counted in each case. P&lt;0.001 for all genotypes except for UAS-wg; cno2
