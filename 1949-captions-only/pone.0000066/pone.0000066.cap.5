                Figure 5. Cno physically interacts with Dsh and N.
(A) Coimmunoprecipitations from embryonic lysates.
Left panel: Cno is coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Dsh.
Right panel: Cno is coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous N.
Different sizes of the Cno protein coimmunoprecipitated with Dsh and N (see text).
A Rat and Rb sera without the Dsh or N antibodies were used as negative controls.
(B) In vitro coimmunoprecipitations (see also Fig. 7I).
Left panel: HA-tagged Dsh (DSH-FLN) does not coimmunoprecipitate with N.
