                Figure 6. Overexpression of Cno leads to the stabilization of Dsh and N close to the membranes of Eve+ interacting cells.
The most dorsal part of two hemisegments of stage 11 embryos are shown in all panels (63Ã— magnification).
Eve marks a dorsal equivalence group in the mesoderm (blue).
(A, C, E, G) In wildtype (WT) embryos, Dsh (green) and N (red) colocalize at some regions in Eve+ cell clusters (arrows).
(B, D, F, H) Cno overexpression (UAS-cno) leads to an increase of Dsh and N close to the membranes of Eve+ cells (arrows).
