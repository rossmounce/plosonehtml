                Figure 7. Wg-Dsh signaling releases Cno-mediated Ras repression.
(A–H) Lateral views at high magnification (63×) of stage 11 embryos showing three hemisegments.
(A, C, E) In wgCX4
                      mutants neither diP-MAPK (green) nor Eve (blue) expression is detected in the mesoderm, which is marked by Twi (red).
(G) The FGFR Htl (red) is also downregulated in wgCX4
                      mutants.
(B, D, F, H) Both diP-MAPK (B, D) and Htl (H) expression are rescued in wgCX4; cnomis1
                      double mutants; Eve expression is not rescued (F). tp, tracheal pits.
