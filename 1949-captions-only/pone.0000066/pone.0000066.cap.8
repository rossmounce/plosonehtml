                Figure 8. Summary of physical interactions and working model.
(A) Diagram summarizing the physical interactions between Cno and Nintra, RasAct and Dsh.
(B) Working model.
The modulation of the information conveyed by three signaling pathways, Wg, N and Ras-MAPK, is critical for muscle progenitor specification.
Our data show that Cno interacts physically and genetically with these three pathways, negatively regulating the information flow to key progenitor transcriptional targets, L'sc and Eve.
In this model, the Cno/Dsh interaction is pivotal to modulate signaling thresholds.
Cno/Dsh interaction facilitates the release of Cno repression on RasAct signaling and the inhibition of N signaling by Cno. Dsh recruitment by Cno leads to canonical Wg signal inhibition. Arr, Arrow; Fz2, Frizzled2.
