                Figure 2.  Endocytosis-related proteins co-precipitate from rat brain synaptosomes and co-precipitated protein recovery is ionic strengthsensitive.Proteins immunoprecipitated with H-clathrin (left panel) or STG (right panel) from rat synaptosome lysate after exposure to the three salt buffers.
Each panel shows bands that correspond in molecular weight to the labeled protein recovered after the three salt treatments (see Fig. 1 legend).
For example, comparing the 1150 mM salt-treated to the control, 150 mM salt-treated, there was a high recovery of H-clathrin, a moderate recovery of L-clathrin or S-intersectin and a low recovery of dynamin.
The asterisk denotes an intermediate intersectin proteolytic fragment, as reported previously.[31] Other details as in Figure 1.
