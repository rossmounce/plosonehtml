                Figure 3.  FR analysis of SAE.Analysis frequency histograms. Each plot shows the fraction of a variety of co-IP-protein recovered at 1150:150 mM salt after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to (A) H-clathrin, (B) AP180, (C) L-clathrin, and (D) STG (the IP-proteins).
Each bar is the mean±SE of the indicated number of separate IP experiments as in Fig. 1C.
The vertical dotted lines indicate the 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 recovery fractions. E. Plot of mean±SE FR values for IP of S- or L-intersectin compiled from co-IP values for the indicated IP-proteins (y axis; see text).
F, G. Protein complex model relative to the IP-protein.
Working models of the protein complex depicted by the FR set for a single IP-protein using H-clathrin as an example.
In F the co-IP proteins are displayed with linking bars with widths proportional to their FR value (there is no significance to the distance between the proteins in this diagram).
Dynamin is depicted as either linked directly to H-clathrin or, because of its low FR value, linked via intersectin (see text).
In G the complex is depicted as a linear sequence of co-IP proteins in order of their normalized FR values (number in box) starting from the IP protein, H-clathrin, on one end (i) or at the centre (ii) of the complex. FR values for S- and L-intersectin were very similar as if they can substitute for each other in this complex.
