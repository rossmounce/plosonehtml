                Figure 4.  FR protein complex analysis.A. Each figure is a model of the protein complex with each protein indicated by a box together with their respective IP-protein FR values (see Fig 3A).
Thus, in Ai–iii AP180 is one IP-protein and the upper numbers for each co-IP-protein reflect its FR values. Similarly, STG is the second IP-protein and the lower numbers in each box are its FR values.
The FR value for the IP-protein itself is always 1.0.
Proteins are mapped to a single locus (solid line box), two or three loci (dashed line box) or to multiple loci (dotted line) with only a few possible positions shown.
Hypothetical proteins are indicated in italics.
