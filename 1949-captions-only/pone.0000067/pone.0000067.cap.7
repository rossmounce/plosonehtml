                Figure 7.  Localization of the SAE complex at the transmitter release face.Isolated chick ciliary ganglion calyx synapses were immunostained with antibodies against protein pairs.
We used ICA plots to test for staining covariance (plot of normalized pixel intensity for each immunostain against the (A-a)(B-b) function, where A and B are the normalized pixel intensities for stain A and B and a and b are their respective means) in which a left skew indicates segregated staining, a symmetrical plot random staining and a right skew staining intensities that covary (see Methods).
A. Calyx stained for secretory vesicle marker SV2 (green, left panel) and STG 1 (STG; red, left panel) with ICA plots as labeled.
The presynaptic calyx and postsynaptic neuron are indicated.
The left panel is an overlay of the two black/white images.
The ICA plots are for SV2 versus STG (left panel) and STG versus SV2 (right panel).
B. As in A but staining for STG (red, left panel, left ICA plot) and the SAE component, stonin2 (green, left panel, right ICA plot).
C. As in A but staining for Stonin2 (green, left panel, left ICA plot) and AP180 (red, left panel, right ICA plot).
