                Figure 1.  Genomic fragments of type 2 VDPVs amplified by RT-PCR for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.The polyprotein encoded by the Sabin 2 genome is represented by a rectangle on the genomic RNA.
The 5′ UTR (partial), P1, VP1, and 3D polymerase regions that were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced are represented by 4 rectangles with dark cross hatching below the genomic RNA.
They correspond to nt 183 to 747, 748 to 3384, 2482 to 3384, and 5986 to 7368, respectively, of Sabin 2 (Acc: X00595).
The downward pointing arrow indicates the start of the hypervariable region of 5′UTR.
The upward-pointing arrow indicates the location of the genetic recombination in the 3D polymerase gene.
The letters R1 through R6 correspond to the separate regions used for sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis as shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4.
