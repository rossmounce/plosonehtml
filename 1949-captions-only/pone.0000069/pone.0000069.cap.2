                Figure 2.  NICER Identity Analysis of the aVDPVs: genomic recombination fingerprint in the 3D polymerase gene, and identity plots for the P1 and VP1 regions.
                     Upper panel: An Identity Plot created by the NICER program of the nucleotide sequences of Group 1 (G1) and Group 2 (G2) aVDPVs compared with Sabin 1 (S1) and Sabin 2 (S2) at each nucleotide position of 3D where Sabin 1 and Sabin 2 differ.
The nucleotides of the query sequences are scored as identical to Sabin 1 (light orange/light grey(B&amp;W)), identical to Sabin 2 (dark brown/dark grey(B&amp;W)), or different from both (grey/white(B&amp;W)).
The upward pointing arrow (G1-X), indicating the most likely position where identity of the Group 1 sequences shifts from Sabin 2 to Sabin 1, has been placed between positions 19 and 20 which corresponds to nucleotides 6693 and 6705 of Sabin 2 (Acc: X00595).
The downward pointing arrow (G2-X); indicating the most likely position where identity of the Group 2 sequences shifts from Sabin 2 to Sabin 1, has been placed between positions 52 and 53 which corresponds to nucleotides 6771 and 6774 of Sabin 2 (Acc: X00595).

                     Middle panel: An Identity Frequency plot to indicate the frequency of occurrence of nucleotide positions in P1 (region R3) of the reference sequence (Sabin 2) where the equivalent nucleotide on at least one of the query sequences differs was created by the NICER program.
The number and frequency of identical positions (all of query sequences differ and all have the identical substitution; N/N) and near identical positions (all but one of the query sequences have identical substitutions; N-1/N) is shown for analysis of 6 Group 1 aVDPVs isolated between 1998 and 2004 (A); the 6 Group 1 isolates in A plus the 3 Group 1 aVDPVs isolated in 2005 (B); the 6 Group 1 isolates in A plus the 3 Group 2 aVDPVs isolated in 2006 (C); and all 9 Group 1 and 3 Group 2 isolates (D) is shown.
