                      is a method for estimating of the date of initial exposure based on regression analysis of the accumulation of the % of 3rd position synonymous substitutions from all codons with single nucleotide substitutions in VP1 (region R4 in Fig. 3D).
The date of initial exposure to Sabin 2 was determined by extrapolation backwards to 0% substitutions. (r2 = 0.886).
Group 1 isolates are represented by open circles while Group 2 Isolates are represented by open triangles.
