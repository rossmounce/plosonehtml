                Figure 5.  Geometric mean titers (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against Type 2 strains by age group.The GMT for each strain was calculated for each age group after data was normalized by comparison to titers from a standard pool of 20 positive sera included in each analysis as described in Materials and Methods.
The cohort (see Table 2) for which each GMT point was determined is shown at the top of the figure.
The symbols for each isolate are in Fig. 5B.

                     
                        Fig. 5.A
                      represents GMT of neutralizing antibodies to poliovirus in sera from cohorts aged 15 months to 15 years in which the complete immunization history of all individuals was documented.
