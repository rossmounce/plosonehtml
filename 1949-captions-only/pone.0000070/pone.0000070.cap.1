                Figure 1.  The tellurite reductase activity in crude extracts prepared from S. epidermidis CH is dependent on NADH as cofactor.The tellurite reductase activity present in crude extracts of S. epidermidis CH cells was followed over time as the increase in absorbance at 500 nm due to the conversion of tellurite to tellurium in the presence (▪) and absence (•) of NADH under standard assay conditions.
The values shown represent the means of three independent determinations made with crude extracts containing 1.2 mg/ml total protein.
