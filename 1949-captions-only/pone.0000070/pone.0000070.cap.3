                     <sup>2−</sup> reductase activities of catalase <em>in situ</em> were carried out by resolving proteins on polyacrylamide gels, incubating gel strips in the presence of substrate, and developing gel strips to reveal the presence of specific products of each reaction (Woodbury et al. 1971; Gregory and Fridovich 1974).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>For dismutase assays, 25 µg of protein were loaded in each gel lane; 250 µg of protein was used for tellurite reductase assays.</p>

                     <strong>(A)</strong> The results in <a href="#pone-0000070-g003">Fig. 3A</a> show that bovine liver catalase (a tetramer of 255 kDa) migrates as a single band on native gels (lane 2) with an apparent molecular mass similar to that of a 244 kD standard (lane 1), and has both hydrogen peroxide dismutase (lane 3) and tellurite reductase (lane 4) activities.</p>
