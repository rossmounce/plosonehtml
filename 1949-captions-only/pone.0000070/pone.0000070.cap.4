                     <strong>(A)</strong> Aliquots of exponentially growing cultures of <em>E. coli</em> strain JWK3914 (<em>katG</em>) carrying plasmids pBAD (<strong>a</strong> and <strong>c</strong>) or pCAT (<strong>b</strong> and <strong>d</strong>) were spread onto the surface of plates with LB medium, 15.5 Âµl K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub> (4 mM)(<strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>) or hydrogen peroxide (3%) (<strong>c</strong> and <strong>d</strong>) were spotted onto the centers of the bacterial lawns, and cells were grown to reveal zones of inhibition (Fuentes et al. 2005).</p>

                     <strong>(B)</strong> The mean areas of growth inhibition zones (cm<sup>2</sup>) were determined from three independent experiments; thin bars represent the standard deviations.</p>
