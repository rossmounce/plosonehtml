                Figure 4.  Figure 4. Expression of the S. epidermidis katA gene in E. coli confers increased resistance to both tellurite and hydrogen peroxide.
                     (A) Aliquots of exponentially growing cultures of E. coli strain JWK3914 (katG) carrying plasmids pBAD (a and c) or pCAT (b and d) were spread onto the surface of plates with LB medium, 15.5 Âµl K2TeO3 (4 mM)(a and b) or hydrogen peroxide (3%) (c and d) were spotted onto the centers of the bacterial lawns, and cells were grown to reveal zones of inhibition (Fuentes et al. 2005).

                     (B) The mean areas of growth inhibition zones (cm2) were determined from three independent experiments; thin bars represent the standard deviations.
