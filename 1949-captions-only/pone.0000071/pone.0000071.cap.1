                Figure 1.  Detection of native PrPC in milk of human and animals.A volume of 10 ml fresh, ultra-high temperature treated (UHT) and pasteurised (Past) milk were enriched for PrPC using Alicon PrioTrap® technology.
Concentrated PrPC was analyzed by Western Blotting using PrP−mab 8B4 (Alicon AG).
The molecular weight markers are indicated. Recombinant bovine PrP(25−241) (Alicon AG) was used as a standard.
