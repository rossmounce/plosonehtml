                Figure 2.  Specific binding of anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies to milk PrPC.Various anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies were used for detection of PrPC in fresh cow milk.
A Tau-1 protein-specific monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control.
Recombinant bovine PrP(25âˆ’241) (Alicon AG) and recombinant Tau-1 protein (Chemicon International) were used as a standard.
