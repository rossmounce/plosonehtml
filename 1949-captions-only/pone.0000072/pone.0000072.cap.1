                Figure 1.  Demographic and genetic data for the Scandinavian wolf population between 1991 and 2002 averaged over two-year periods.a) mean number of wolves and b) mean (Â±s.e.m.) inbreeding coefficients (blue) and standardized heterozygosity (red).
The number of genotyped wolves (n) per group of years is indicted above the X-axis.
Both inbreeding coefficients (F
                  5,82 = 5.95, P&lt;0.001) and standardized heterozygosity (F
                  5,82 = 4.97, P&lt;0.001) show significant differences among the groups of years.
