                     [18]
                     : (1) The ‘wa’ note is a short and steeply rising note, appearing as a more or less straight line on the spectrogram; sometimes appearing slightly concave.
It consistently spans over 100 Hz in the frequency domain, which sets it aside from the ‘hoo’ note.
(2) The ‘hoo’ is a low frequency quiet note consistently spanning a much narrower frequency range than ‘wa’ notes.
(3) The ‘leaning wa’ notes may be more or less straight like the ‘wa’ notes but longer in duration, and therefore lean more to the right; sometimes they have a slight bump in the middle.
(4) The ‘oo’ note is of a relatively even pitch and therefore produces a flat note, as seen on the spectrogram, of varying duration.
Sometimes it may rise slightly at the start.
