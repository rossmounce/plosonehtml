<h4>Song composition: overall differences</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>Apart from the first 10 notes only, we found additional overall differences in song composition depending on context: ‘sharp wow’ notes were significantly more common in predatory than in duet songs (Fisher's Exact test, p = 0.001), appearing on average 236.4±346.8 s into a predatory song (n = 11). We also found ‘sharp wows’ in some duet songs (n = 6/14, mean latency = 71.5±47.2 s), but interestingly, they were all given by groups that had not been fully habituated to human presence (groups D, J, and NOS; <a href="#pone-0000073-t001">table 1</a>). It is likely, therefore, that the ‘sharp wows’ are notes given in response to any disturbance, which can be incorporated into regular duets and predator-induced songs.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2"></a><p>Overall, songs given in the predatory context were significantly longer than songs in the duet context (mean duration = 2005.0±1560.0 s, n = 11, versus 625.9±450.7 s, n = 14, U = 28.0, p&lt;0.01; Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed). Predator-induced songs were always introduced by a long series of soft ‘hoo’ notes. The number of these notes differed significantly between the predatory and the duet contexts (predatory: 100.9±110.9, n = 11; duet: 9.2±8.3, n = 14; U = 4.0, p&lt;0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test; two-tailed). Correspondingly, the total duration of the ‘hoo’ note series in the predatory context was significantly longer than in the duet context (predatory: 158.7±290.6 s, n = 11; duet: 9.8±13.1 s, n = 14, U = 17, p = 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed).</p>


<h4>Female great calls</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1"></a><p>The female great call, finally, is a stereotyped sequence of notes described as a phrase, lasting on average 17.43±1.32 s (n = 13). Females reliably produced great calls in both contexts, but during duets they were delivered significantly earlier compared to when responding to predators (duets: 80.0±35.2 s, n = 14; predatory: 682.4±669.8 s, n = 9; U = 2.0, p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed) with no overlap: Great calls during the first two minutes were reliably linked with the duet context, whereas great calls given after this time period were always associated with the presence of a predator (Fisher's exact test, p&lt;0.001). Males usually replied to female great calls with a specific phrase, but these replies came significantly earlier in the predatory than in the duet context (predatory  = −1.3±1.7 s, n = 9; duets: 1.0±3.4 s, n = 14; U = 23.0, p = 0.012, Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed). <a href="#pone-0000073-g005">Figure 5</a> summarises the main differences.</p>
