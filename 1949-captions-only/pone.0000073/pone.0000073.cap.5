                     Differences in the composition of songs given as part of normal duets or in response to predators: The top two graphs portray the number of notes present in the sequential analyses of just the first ten song notes, where n-values represent the number of individuals (only adult males and females are included).The lower six graphs show overall compositional differences in song types according to the parameters measured. N-values represent the number of song bouts in each context.
