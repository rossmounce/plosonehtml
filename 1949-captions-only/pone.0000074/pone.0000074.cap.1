                Figure 1.  Maximum likelihood phylograms for (A) Microhylidae (-lnL = 24126.41696) and (B) Natatanura (-lnL = 53106.71363). Branch support is indicated as follows: black circles: ML bootstrap support (BS)≥75% and Bayesian posterior probability (PP)≥0.95; triangle pointing to the right: BS&lt;75%, PP≥0.95; triangle pointing to the left: BS≥75%, PP&lt;0.95; white circles: BS&lt;75% and PP&lt;0.95.
Higher taxon names follow Frost et al. [13], with the exception of removal of Hoplophryne from Melanobatrachinae, and recognition of Ranixalidae.
