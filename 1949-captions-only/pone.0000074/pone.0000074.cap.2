                Figure 2.  Late Cretaceous vicariance in Microhylidae and Natatanura.(A) Molecular timetree (TK method, all calibration points except G [12]).
Horizontal colored bars and lines at internal nodes (Standard deviation and 95% credibility interval, respectively) indicate vicariance events reconstructed by DIVA-analyses, and interpreted as follows: orange: Australia &lt;–&gt; Indo-Madagascar; yellow: Africa &lt;–&gt; South America; blue: Africa &lt;–&gt; Indo-Madagascar; purple: Madagascar &lt;–&gt; India (Seychelles); green: S. America-Antarctica &lt;–&gt; Indo-Madagascar (the intervening Kerguelen Plateau being involved).
The latter splits in our timetree are interpreted as vicariance events between the Kerguelen plateau and Antarctica or Indo-Madagascar [12].
The branches denoting the latest colonization of Eurasia, as reconstructed by DIVA, are indicated by an asterisk.
Numbers at terminals correspond to taxon numbers in figure 1. (B) Late Cretaceous Gondwana, with indication of corresponding geological break-ups.
Abbreviations: AF = Africa, MA = Madagascar, IN = India, EU = Eurasia, SA = South America, AN = Antarctica, AU = Australia-New Guinea, KP = Kerguelen Plateau.
