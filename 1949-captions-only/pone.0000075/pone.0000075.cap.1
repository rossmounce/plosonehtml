                Figure 1.  Experimental design partitions genetic and purely-environmental components of variation.Females heterozygous for P582i (Sam1;Sam2;P582i/Sami; left) were crossed to males from each of 9 highly inbred (95% homozygous) RI line backgrounds (different colors) to create matched “clones” of Hsp90 mutant and control male progeny from the same vial and maternal environments and hybrid for Sam and each RI line background.
