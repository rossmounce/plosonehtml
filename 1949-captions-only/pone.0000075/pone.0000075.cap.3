                Figure 3.  Hsp90 controlled environmental variation specific to previously invariant or canalized traits.Comparison of mean-normalized components of purely-environmental variation (z-axis) across the RI line backgrounds (x-axis).
Developmental stability was calculated as the averaged (unsigned) deviations of left and right from the mean, i.e. (L+R)/2, within each individual (Ve within) or on the averaged (unsigned) deviations of each individual (L+R) from their clone means for each RI line genotype (Ve among).
There was generally no effect of Hsp90 allele (Sami, blue or P582i, yellow) on the variable traits, and a highly significant effect on either measure of Ve
                      for canalized bristle traits but not wing area, which was highly canalized independent of Hsp90 (Table 4).
