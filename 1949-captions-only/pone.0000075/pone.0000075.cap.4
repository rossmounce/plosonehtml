                Figure 4.  Hsp90-buffered variation contributed to predicted selection responses.Fold-increase in the predicted response to truncation, directional or stabilizing selection of the ‘populations’ of 9 RI line genotypes in the P582i mutant relative to equivalent ‘populations’ of genotypes in the Sami control flies (Table 5).
