<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>The positions of upper and lower thresholds were estimated for <em>P582i</em> and <em>Sami</em> populations, which differed by the presence of wild-type (<em>Sami</em>) or heterozygous mutant (<em>P582i</em>) levels of Hsp90 in otherwise nearly identical genetic backgrounds (N = 450 flies each).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>A consistent, but arbitrary, standard deviation (SD) scale was inferred from the frequency of abnormal flies in the P582i background, which had the highest frequencies of abnormal flies.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p>SC was canalized at 4 over a range of from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 SD. On the same scale, we estimate that the <em>P582i</em> mutation decreased the strength of proneural and inhibitory bristle development pathways, shifting signalling across the population &gt;2.5 SD to the left relative to fixed upper and lower thresholds.</p>
