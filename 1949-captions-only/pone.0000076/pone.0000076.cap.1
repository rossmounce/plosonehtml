                Figure 1.  Representative tests of penetrance, absolute and relative fitness.High (red) and low (blue) lines, genetically differentiated for dfe penetrance were not differentiated by tests of viability and fitness.
Controls (grey) were either Canton-S (CS) flies tested at the same time or published values for wild-type flies (WT; [21]).
Experiments showing the most extreme between line differences are displayed.
Error bars indicate the standard errors of the mean.
A. Penetrance of eye deformity in dfe lines and CS flies reared at 25Â°C.
B. Hatch rate of timed embryo collections measured at 36 hours post egg-laying.
C. Egg-to-adult survival measured as the number of adult flies emerging versus eggs laid.
D. Fractional survivial of dfe progeny in competition with CS flies co-cultured at high density.
