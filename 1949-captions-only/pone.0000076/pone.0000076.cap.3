                Figure 3.  Regression of early fecundity and viability onto penetrance in 1,432 recombinant isogenic lines.If genes for dfe had effects on viability and survival, a negative relationship would be expected, however penetrance was positively correlated with fitness in recombinant lines from HE1 and HE3.
