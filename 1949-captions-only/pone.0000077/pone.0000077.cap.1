                Figure 1.  elt-2(RNAi) animals are hypersusceptible to S. enterica-mediated killing and are colonized by E. coli.(A) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to S. enterica SL1344 (P&lt;0.0001).
60 nematodes were used for each condition. Results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.
(B) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were placed on FUdR containing plates with lawns of heat-killed E. coli OP50 (P = 0.0011).
20 nematodes were used for each condition. Results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.
(C) and (D) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control (C) or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA (D) were exposed to E. coli expressing DSred for 24 hours, and then visualized using a Leica TCS SL spectral confocal microscope (bar = 50 µm).
(E) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were transferred to a clean LB plate either immediately or after 24 hours exposure to E. coli OP50 (+24 hrs), where they were allowed to defecate for 2 hours.
Plates then were placed at 37°C overnight and colonies counted.
The combined data from 10 individual animals are shown, and data were normalized to the median colony count for the vector control at each timepoint.
