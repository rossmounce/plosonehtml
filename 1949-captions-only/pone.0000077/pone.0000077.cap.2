                Figure 2.  Expression of clec-67 is controlled by ELT-2.(A) Pclec-67::gfp nematodes were grown on E. coli OP50 and were visualized using a Leica MZ FLIII fluorescence stereomicroscope.
(B) Microarray (white) and qRT-PCR (light grey) comparing expression of clec-67 in wild-type nematodes grown on S. enterica SL1344 versus wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli OP50.
qRT-PCR comparing expression of clec-67 in wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control versus wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA (dark grey).
Results are the average of 3-7 independent experiments.
Error bars represent SEM.
(C) qRT-PCR comparing expression of a variety of intestinal housekeeping genes in wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control versus wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA.
Results are the average of 5 independent experiments.
Error bars represent SEM.
