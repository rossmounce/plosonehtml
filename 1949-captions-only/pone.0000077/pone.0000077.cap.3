                Figure 3.  elt-2(RNAi) animals are more susceptible than wild-type nematodes to a variety of pathogens.(A)Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to P. aeruginosa PA14 (P = 0.0001).
(B) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to E. faecalis OG1RF (P&lt;0.0001).
(C) Wild-type nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to C. neoformans H99 (P&lt;0.0001).
60â€“120 nematodes were used for each condition.
Results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.
