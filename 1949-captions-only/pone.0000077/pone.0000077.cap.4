                Figure 4.  The daf-2(e1370) mutation rescues the increased susceptibility to pathogens phenotype of elt-2(RNAi) animals.(A) Wild-type and daf2(e1370) nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to S. enterica SL1344.
Significant differences were found when wild-type was compared to daf-2(e1370) (P&lt;0.0001), when elt-2(RNAi) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P&lt;0.0001), and when daf-2(e1370) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P&lt;0.0001).
(B) Wild-type and daf2(e1370) nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to E. faecalis OG1RF.
Significant differences were found when wild-type was compared to daf-2(e1370) (P = 0.0056), when elt-2(RNAi) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P&lt;0.0001), and when daf-2(e1370) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P&lt;0.0001).
(C) Wild-type and daf2(e1370) nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing elt-2 double-stranded RNA were exposed to C. neoformans H99 (P&lt;0.0001).
Significant differences were found when wild-type was compared to daf-2(e1370) (P = 0.0174) and when elt-2(RNAi) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P&lt;0.0001).
No significant difference was found when daf-2(e1370) was compared to daf-2(e1370);elt-2(RNAi) (P = 0.1666).
(D) Wild-type and daf2(e1370) nematodes grown on E. coli carrying a vector control or on E. coli expressing daf-16 double-stranded RNA were exposed to C. neoformans H99.
