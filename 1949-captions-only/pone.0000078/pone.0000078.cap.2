                Figure 2.  Beta-diversity of intertidal vegetation species.The solid symbols represent the probability of occurrence of species i and j at two sites separated by a distance r as computed from the vegetation distributions of Figure 1.
The solid lines are plots of eqs. (1) from the model fitted on observations.
Panel a) refers to the case in which i = j, (conspecific sites).
In panel b), referring to the case iâ‰ j, only one beta-diversity curve involving soil was indicated for clarity, the remaining ones being similar.
