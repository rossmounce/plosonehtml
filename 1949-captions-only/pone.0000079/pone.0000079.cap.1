                Figure 1.  Isolation of Stem Cells from Root Apical Papilla (SCAP).(A) Human apical papilla tissue was positive for STRO-1, an early mesenchymal progenitor marker, staining by immunofluorescence (arrows).
(B) Single colonies were formed after human SCAP were plated at a low density (5×103/T25 flask) and cultured for 10 days.
(C) When human SCAP were cultured in odontogenic/osteogenic inductive conditions containing L-ascorbate-2-phosphate, dexamethasone, and inorganic phosphate for 4 weeks, mineralized nodules were found by Alizarin red S staining.
(D) Cultured human SCAP formed Oil red O positive lipid clusters following 5 weeks of adipogenic induction in the presence of 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 µM hydrocortisone, 60 µM indomethacin, and 10 µg/ml insulin.
(E) Eight weeks after transplantation in immunocompromised mice, human SCAP differentiated into odontoblasts (arrows) that formed dentin (D) on the surfaces of a hydroxyapatite tricalcium (HA) carrier.
(F) Immunohistochemical staining showed that human SCAP differentiated into odontoblasts (arrows) that were positive for anti-human specific mitochondria antibody staining.
(G) Immunohistochemical staining showed that human SCAP-generated dentin (D) was positive for anti-DSP antibody staining (arrows).
(H) Pre-immunoserum negative control of human SCAP transplant.
