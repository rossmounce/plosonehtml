<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig2.caption1.p2"></a><p>(<strong>B</strong>) Flow cytometric analysis showed that <em>ex vivo</em> expanded SCAP contained approximately 7.5% CD24-positive cells, but DPSCs exhibited 0.5% positive staining for CD 24.</p>
