                Figure 2.  Characterization of human SCAP in comparison with DPSCs.(A) Western blot analysis to confirm protein expression of genes identified in microarray studies showed greater abundance of survivin in SCAP than in DPSCs, with similar levels of DSP and Cbfa1/Runx2.
(B) Flow cytometric analysis showed that ex vivo expanded SCAP contained approximately 7.5% CD24-positive cells, but DPSCs exhibited 0.5% positive staining for CD 24.
(C) The proliferation rates of SCAP and DPSCs, derived from the same tooth, were assessed by co-culture with BrdU for 6 hours.
The number of BrdU-positive cells was presented as a percentage of the total number of cells counted from five replicate cultures.
SCAP showed a significantly higher proliferation rate in comparison with DPSCs (*
                     P = 0.0042).
(D) Single colony-derived SCAP were able to proliferate to over 70 population doublings, which was significantly higher than DPSCs (*
                     P = 0.0192).
