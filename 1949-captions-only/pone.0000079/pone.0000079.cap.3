                Figure 3.  Surface Molecule Characterization of human SCAP.(A) Flow cytometric analysis of cultured SCAP at passage 1 revealed expression of STRO-1 (18.12%), CD146 (72.3%), CD24 (7.56%), CD166 (93.74%), CD73 (94.14%), CD90 (95.54%), CD105 (9.23%), CD106 (32.7%), CD29 (88.1%) and ALP (11.43%), but was negative for surface molecules CD18, CD14, CD34, CD45, and CD 150.
(B) After 2 weeks osteo-induction in vitro with L-ascorbate-2-phosphate, dexamethasone, and inorganic phosphate, SCAP differentiated into odontoblasts with a decrease in CD24 expression from 7.56% to 0.22%.
In contrast, ALP expression increased significantly from 11.43% to 86.59%.
