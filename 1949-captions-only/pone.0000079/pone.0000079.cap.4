                Figure 4.  Comined human SCAP/PDLSC-mediated tissue regeneration.(A) On the outside of the HA/TCP carrier (HA), PDLSCs can form structures resembling Sharpey's fibers (arrows) connecting with newly formed cementum (C) on the surface of HA/TCP particles (HA).
(B) Immunohistochemical staining showed that SCAP/PDLSC-generated tissues were positive for human specific mitochondria antibody staining (arrows).
