                Figure 5.  Swine SCAP/PDLSC-mediated root/periodontal structure as an artificial crown support for the restoration of tooth function in swine.(A) Extracted minipig lower incisor and root-shaped HA/TCP carrier loaded with SCAP.
(B) Gelfoam containing 10Ã—106 PDLSCs (open arrow) was used to cover the HA/SCAP (black arrow) and implanted into the lower incisor socket (open triangle).
(C) HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSCs were implanted into a newly extracted incisor socket.
A post channel was pre-created inside the root shape HA carrier (arrow).
(D) The post channel was sealed with a temporary filling for affixing a porcelain crown in the next step.
(E) The HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSC implant was sutured for 3 months.
(F) The HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSC implant (arrow) was re-exposed and the temporary filling was removed to expose the post channel.
(G) A pre-made porcelain crown was cemented to the HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSC structure.
