                Figure 1.  Genomic organization and haplotype analysis in the bovine UCN3 gene.Noncoding exon 1, partial non-conding exon 2 and 3â€²untranslated region are marked by white boxes and coding exon 2 by a black box.
Pairwise linkage disequilibrium relationship for 12 mutations is illustrated based on r2 measurements.
The mutation g.8272A&gt;B represents AAFC03043460.1:g.8272-8281AATAATAAAT&gt;GGAGC.
