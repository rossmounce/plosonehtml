                Figure 3.  Nucleotide sequence of the proximal promoter region of the bovine UCN3 gene.Primer and partial non-coding exon 1 sequences are shadowed by pink and bright green color, respectively.
The putative transcription start site is numbered as +1.
Four polymorphic sites that were associated with SFD are bold and shadowed by turquoise color.
Potential transcription regulatory binding sites for TFCP2, NFAT5, NKX3-1, FOXD1, ISL1, DBP, CART1, POU4F1, ARID3A and MSX1/MSX2 are associated with haplotype CTAT, while only binding sites for BAPX1 and EGR2 are linked to haplotype TCGA.
