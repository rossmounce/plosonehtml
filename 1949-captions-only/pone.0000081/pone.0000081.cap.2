                Figure 2.  Genotypes of two Andaman Islanders using a panel of 20 informative SNPs.Each line represents the four systems of G, A, C, and T, in descending order.
SNPs are named by their position relative to the Cambridge Reference Sequence and are separated by variation in electrophoretic mobility, which is determined by the length of the SBE primer.
The segregation of the two samples at all lineage defining sites, for M31a1 and M32 respectively, demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of genotyping using this methodology.
