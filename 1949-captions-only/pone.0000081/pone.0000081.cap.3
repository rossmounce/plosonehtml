                Figure 3.  The results from a Snapshot assay of an M32 sample that has been deliberately contaminated with a modern European DNA extract.Alleles at np15754 and 3817 on the G line are from the contaminant DNA, whilst those on the A system represent the M32 sample.
The level of the contaminant increases, as a proportion of the total mix, with each of the descending lines shown within the oval.
The relative amounts of contaminant are 4%, 8% and 20% of the effective copy number (assessed by quantitative PCR) prior to mixing of the two extracts to seed the multiplex.
