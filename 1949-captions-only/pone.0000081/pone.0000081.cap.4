                Figure 4.  Maximum parsimony tree of mtDNA lineages M31 and M32 obtained by multiplexed genotyping, demonstrating the fine structure apportioned to these lineages [Ra = Rajbanshi; Lo = Lodha; La = Lambadi; Ch = Chenchu; GA = Greater Andamanese; On = Onge; J = Jarawa].The definitions of the Andaman-specific M31a1 and M32 lineages are revised to include additional control region SNPs resulting from the cloned sequences of the historic samples.
The Indian variant found amongst the Lodha, Chenchu and Lambadi develops the inter-regional structure of M31 and allows for the settlement of the Andaman archipelago substantially after the last successful migrations Out of Africa by modern humans.
These sequences contribute a deletion at np249 on the trunk of M31a1 and the motif of 143-195-207 on the stem of M32, contra to the tree of Thangaraj et al.[23], which did not report the deletion and the three M32 SNPs never occurred together in their five samples.
The original data also reported a transition at np200 on all four of their M31 samples, but in the historic data it is only found in a single Onge sample.
