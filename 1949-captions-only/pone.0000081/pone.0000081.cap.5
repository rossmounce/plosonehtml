                Figure 5.  Full median network depicting the conflicts between the data sets of this study and that of Thangaraj et al.[23] in the coding region Nodes A-K represent distinct haplotypes. A-G correspond to our hapolotypes assigned to M31a1b1, M31a1b*, M31a1*, M31a1a, M32*, M31a* and M32a1, respectively, whilst H-K are from Thangaraj et al[23].
The node marked “Root” is the root of haplogroup M and ticks on the network indicate mutations, the most important of which are shown by their position; the long internal branches are shown compressed.
The diagram summarizes all most parsimonious reconstructions of mutations on a tree.
Note how our data can be explained (bold) by a single homoplasy at position 8108.
However to attach H, I and J to the bold tree would require a further four recurrent mutations to be introduced.
