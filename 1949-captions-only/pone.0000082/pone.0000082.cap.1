                Figure 1.  A) Summary of RB mutants.The amino acid numbering is that of the human retinoblastoma protein.
Two shaded boxes represent the A and B domains; I, the insert region; N, the region N-terminal to the A domain; C, the region C-terminal to the B domain.
B) GST pull-down assay.
The RB-deficient MDA-MB468 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding GFP, RB, RB-K, RB-N or RB-KN, whole cell lysates were incubated with purified GST-E2F1 or GST-E7 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose.
The bound fractions were solubilized, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and reacted with an affinity-purified anti-RB.
C) Reciprocal GST pull-down assay.
Lysates from SAOS-2-tet-E2F1 cells [21] were immunoblotted with anti-E2F1 to demonstrate the induced expression of E2F1 protein (upper panel).
Lysates from induced and non-induced cells were incubated with GST-RB or GST-RB-K fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound fraction analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-E2F1 (lower panel).
