                Figure 2.  A) Transcription repression.The Cyclin A-Luc reporter plasmid contains a firefly luciferase expression cassette preceded with a fragment from the human Cyclin A promoter containing E2F-binding site [24].
The reporter was transfected into SAOS-2 cells with the indicated RB expression plasmid and the control Renilla luciferase reporter.
The normalized firefly luciferase activity from vector co-transfected cells was set at 100%.
B) GST pull-down assay.
Lysates from 293T cells expressing HA-tagged E2F1 and DP1 were incubated with the indicated GST-RB and GST-E7 proteins immobilized on glutathione Sepharose.
The HA-E2F1 in the bound fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (α-HA).
C) Co-immunoprecipitation. The RB-deficient C33A cells were co-transfected with HA-E2F1, DP1 and the indicated RB expression plasmids.
Whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-RB antibody (α-RB), and the co-immunoprecipitated E2F1 examined by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (α-HA).
