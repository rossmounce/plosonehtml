                Figure 3.  A) BrdU incorporation.MDA-MB468 cells were infected with the indicated recombinant adenoviruses encoding each of the indicated proteins.
Infected cells were allowed to incorporate BrdU over a period of 14 hours before they were fixed and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibody against BrdU.
The fraction of BrdU-positive cells in each sample was measured by flow cytometry (FACS).
The levels of BrdU incorporation in GFP-virus and RB-KN-virus infected cells were statistically similar by student t-test (*) from three independent experiments.
Representative FACS profiles with the BrdU-positive gates shown are displayed to the right of the histogram.
B) Flat cell formation. SAOS-2 cells transfected with plasmids expressing neomycin resistance and each of the indicated RB proteins were cultured in G418 for two weeks.
The giant flat cells were stained with crystal violet and their numbers counted under a dissection microscope.
The number of flat cells induced by RB in each of four independent experiments was set at 100%.
