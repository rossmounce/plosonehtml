                Figure 4.  A) Etoposide-induced DNA fragmentation in MDA-MB468 cells.Cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the indicated proteins.
Infected cells were treated with 50 µM etoposide or vehicle control for 24 hr, fixed, stained with propidium iodide and DNA fragmentation (sub-G1 DNA content) measured by FACS.
B) Etoposide-induced DNA fragmentation in SAOS-2 cells.
The same experiment as in (A) except the duration of drug treatment was for 48 hours.
C) Etoposide-induced cytochrome c release.
MDA-MB468 cells infected with the indicated recombinant adenovirus treated with 50 µM etoposide or vehicle control.
At 9 hours after drug addition, cells were homogenized and the mitochondria were separated from the cytosolic fraction by centrifugation.
The levels of cytochrome c in the post-mitochondrial supernatants were determined by immunoblotting.
