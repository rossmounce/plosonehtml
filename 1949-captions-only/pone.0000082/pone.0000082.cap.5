                Figure 5.  A) RB phosphorylation by Cdk2/Cyclin E in SAOS-2 cells.Cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing RB or RB-KN, in the absence or presence of co-infection with recombinant adenovirus expressing Cdk2 and Cyclin E.
The electrophoresis mobility of RB was examined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-RB.
B) Representative FACS profiles. SAOS-2 cells infected with the indicated recombinant adenoviruses were treated with 50 ÂµM etoposide, harvested 48 hours later, fixed, stained with propidium iodide and the DNA content analyzed by FACS.
The gate for sub-G1 DNA fraction is shown in each profile.
C) Summary of DNA fragmentation results.
The sub-G1 DNA content was determined by FACS analysis as illustrated in panel B.
The values are mean and standard errors from three independent experiments.
