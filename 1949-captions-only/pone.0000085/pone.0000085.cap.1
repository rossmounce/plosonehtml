                Figure 1.  Distribution of gene gain and loss among mammalian lineages. Numbers in parentheses report number of genes gained or lost on each branch.
Pie charts near branches show the proportion of families that expanded (green), contracted (red), or did not change (blue).
The large pie chart shows the proportion of all families that change (orange), or remain constant (blue) across all lineages.
Changes along long branches and on the ingroup branch may represent underestimates due to multiple gains and losses within individual families and or lack of phylogenetic resolution.
