                Figure 2.  Rapidly evolving gene families in mammals.Horizontal bars indicate the relative rates of change among taxa for each family (where rate is the change in number of genes per million years).
The top bar indicates the hypothetical case where each lineage has an equal evolutionary rate.
Bars are partitioned by the color codes assigned to the taxon names at the far right.
Boxes immediately right of each bar indicate whether changes in that family are expansions (+) or contractions (âˆ’) in each taxon.
Each column of boxes represents a single taxon, color coded in the same order as the bars.
Vertical bars on the right span families that were found to be least likely in the same lineage under the random model of gene gain and loss.
Families with ambiguous or unknown function are left out of the figure to improve legibility.
The complete statistical results are presented in Table S7.
