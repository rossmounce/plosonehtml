                Figure 1.  Event-related potentials of the Ne/ERN and CRN.The Ne/ERN (false responses) and CRN (correct responses) for HD and controls at electrode FCz (top) and at Fz (bottom).
The x-axis denotes time in milliseconds (ms).
The y-axis denotes voltage in ÂµV.
The bar plots denote significant differences in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the Ne/ERN between the groups for the electrodes FCz (left) and Fz (right).
