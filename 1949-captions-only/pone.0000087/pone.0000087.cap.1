                Figure 1.  Combination therapy of Etanercept with mycobacterial heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) 180-188 led to significant reduction of Adjuvant Arthritis (AA).Arthritis was induced on day 0 with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA).
On day 9, rats were randomly divided into five treatment groups: three doses of Etanercept s.c. on day 9, 11, 13 (equivalent to a full course of Etanercept treatment); one dose of Etanercept on day 9; four doses of mycobacterial HSP60 peptide 180-188 on day 10, 13, 16, 19; combination treatment of one dose of Etanercept s.c. on day 9 followed by 180-188 nasally on day 10, 13, 16, 19; or no treatment (PBS).
Arthritis scores were assessed every other day from day 8 onward.
N = 15â€“18 rats per treatment group. Shown are mean arthritis scores.
