                Figure 2.  Combination therapy as well as a full course of Etanercept treatment led to reduction of histological damage in the ankle joints.Joints were harvested on day 23 after the induction of arthritis.
Formalin-fixed tissues were decalcified, and glass slides stained with H&amp;E were prepared.
Submitted tissue sections were examined by light microscopy and scored for severity of inflammation of the synovium, pannus formation, cartilage damage, bone marrow inflammation and periostal proliferation, with a maximum score of 4 per parameter.
N = 3–4 per treatment group.
H&amp;E staining is shown of one rat per treatment, representative for the whole treatment group.
A: Combination therapy; B: Etanercept 1×; C: Peptide Mt. 180-188 4× monotherapy; D: No treatment; E: Etanercept 3×.
