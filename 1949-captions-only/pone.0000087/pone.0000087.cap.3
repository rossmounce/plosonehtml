                Figure 3.  The combination therapy of Etanercept and HSP60 180-188 led to an antigen specific increase of IL-10 and IL-4 production and up regulation of CTLA-4 expression in CD4+ T cells in draining Mandibular Lymphnodes (MLN).MLN were harvested on day 23 after the induction of arthritis.
Cells were cultured for 72 hours with medium or antigen.
Intracellular production of IL-4, IL-10, and expression of CTLA-4 were measured by FACS.
Depicted are Mean Fluorescence Indexes (MFI) of MLN cells cultured with mycobacterial HSP60 peptide 180-188, of cells gated on CD4.
Results are representative of one experiment.
