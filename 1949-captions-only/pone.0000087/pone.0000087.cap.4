                Figure 4.  Combination Therapy led to an increase in FOXP3 and IL-10 gene transcription in CD4+CD25+ cells, whereas it also led to and increase in IL-10 transcription in CD4+CD25− cells.TNFα transcription was abolished by the combination therapy as well as by a full course of Etanercept treatment.
Results are expressed as the induction index (marker/housekeeping gene GAPDH) of HSP60 peptide 180-188 stimulation subtracted by media alone as measured by Real Time Quantitative PCR.
IL-10 production Combination therapy vs. Etanercept treatment p = 0.002.
N = 2–4 per treatment.
