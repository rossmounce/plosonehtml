                Figure 5.  Adoptive Transfer of Mandibular Lymphnode (MLN) T cells from Combination Therapy treated animals led to significant reduction of Adjuvant Arthritis (AA) in diseased animals, measured as Mean Arthritis Score as well as percentage of Disease Amelioration.
                     A. 
                     Adoptive Transfer of T cells from Combination Therapy groups. Adoptive Transfer Groups received 11×106 Inguinal Lymphnode (ILN) cells, 13×106 MLN cells, or 11×106 spleen cells. Data represent Mean±SD. Disease induction and scoring was performed as described in the legend to Figure 1.

                     B. 
                     Percentage of Clinical Amelioration for each treatment group in AA rats. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of each individual treatment group was used to score the Clinical Amelioration (CA) of the distinct treatment groups. AUC was calculated using the curves originated by scoring the disease for the different treatment groups and plotted as percentage of CA with respect to the non-treated group. The non-treated group was considered as having an average percentage of disease = 100%. Formula is as follows: CA = 100 - %AUC.
