                Figure 4.  Gene expression indexes computed using all probes, all core probes, and selected core probes.(A) Gene expression indexes of transcript cluster 2899110 (HFE) are computed using all probes (black circles), all core probes (red triangles) and selected probes (green rectangles).
Probe selection increases the gene expression indexes computed for all the samples.
The relative expression levels in different tissues remain unaltered.
(B) Gene expression indexes of transcript cluster 3833500 (SPTBN4, a gene known to be overexpressed in brain and cerebellum).
Probe selection strengthens the pattern of overexpression in cerebellum (sample #4, #5 and #6).
