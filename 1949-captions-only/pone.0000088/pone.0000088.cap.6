                Figure 6.  The impact of gene expression levels on probe selection.We grouped 17056 transcript clusters into ten distinct bins according to the height where we cut the clustering dendrogram (h_final).
For each transcript cluster, we calculated its peak gene expression index in the 11 tissues using selected probes.
Then we took an average for each bin.
The values of tree cutoff (X-axis) were negatively correlated with average peak gene expression levels in the 11 tissues (Y-axis).
