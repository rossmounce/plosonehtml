                Figure 1.  Examination of fine motor performanceA commercial test-series was used to measure the fine motor performance of both hands.
The “steadiness” task describes the ability to maintain prescribed arm-hand positions (a).
“Line tracing” describes the ability to fulfil precise arm-hand movements (b).
“Aiming” describes the ability to accomplish fast movements directed at small targets (c).
Finally, “tapping” describes the ability to perform very fast, repetitive hand movements (d).
