                Figure 2.  Age-related change of performance in fine motor tasksGroup data illustrating right and left hand performance (±SEM) in “steadiness”, “line tracing”, “aiming” and “tapping” tasks.
Linear Pearson's correlations revealed a significant influence of age on almost all parameters: steadiness (number of errors, a), line tracing (number of errors, b, total time right hand, c), aiming (total time, d) and tapping (number of hits, f) (p≤0.001).
Only for line tracing (total time for the left hand, c), and aiming (number of errors, e) were a lack of age related influences found (p≥0.069).
