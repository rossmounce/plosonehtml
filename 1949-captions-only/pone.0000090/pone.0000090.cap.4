                Figure 4.  Changing hand use over the lifespanIllustration of age-dependent changes in the laterality indices (±SEM) obtained from acceleration measurements used to objectively assess the frequency of hand use (+1 for right hand superiority to –1 for left hand superiority) for all subjects tested (n = 36).
There is a significant linear correlation of individual laterality indices with age (Pearson, r = −0.447, p = 0.007) indicative of a loss of right (dominant) hand advantage with age.
