                Figure 5.  Contradictory results of questionnaires and practical tasksThree dimensional plot illustrating the age-dependence of the sensitivity of the EHI-scores obtained from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, and the laterality indices averaged over all motor tasks and parameters (laterality of motor performance) for the 4 age groups investigated.
While subjects of all age groups are characterized by approximately the same handedness score (EHI â‰¥ 70), there is a distinct reduction in laterality, indicating that the age-related loss of dominant hand advantage remains largely unrealized by the subjects.
