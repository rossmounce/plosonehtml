Overview of the method. In short, a defined number of cells was harvested and lysed (steps 1 and 2). Serial dilutions of the cell lysate (step 3) were used as templates in quantitative Real Time PCR assays (step 4). Quantitation was performed by comparison with an external and an internal standard curve (<a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). B. Selected real time PCR results. The fluorescence intensity curves from four standard dilutions (solid lines) and three sample dilutions (broken lines) are shown. In both cases serial tenfold dilutions of the templates were used. Note the identical slope of all curves and the equidistance of the curves of a dilution series, which is very close to the theoretical offset of 3.32 cycles per tenfold dilution. In addition to the selected reactions shown here, each experiment included more standards and more sample dilutions (filling the gap between tenfold dilutions) as well as a sample dilutions including a dilutions series of the standard added as internal control of PCR efficiency. C. A standard curve including nine standard concentrations distributed over three orders of magnitude. D. Average genome copy number values of three independent cultures and their standard deviation. E. Growth phase-dependent regulation of ploidy of H. salinarum. E is a graphical representation of the results tabulated in D.</p>
