                Figure 3. H. salinarum was grown by aerobic respiration at 42oC and 30 oC and by arginine fermentation at 42oC. The doubling times were 4 hours, 8 hours and 8 hours, respectively. For each condition three independent cultures were used. Aliquots representing early exponential phase (2–3×108 cells/ml), mid-exponential phase (4–5×108 cells/ml), late exponential phase (8–9×108 cells/ml) and early stationary phase (1–2×109 cells/ml) were used to determine the genome copy number using the Real Time PCR method. Average values of the three biological replicates and their standard deviation are shown.
