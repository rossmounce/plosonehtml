                Figure 5. Determination of genome copy number using the agarose block method. Different aliquots from one culture were used to inoculate several new cultures that were grown overnight. Throughouht the next day aliquots were withdrawn, the cell density was determined with a counting chamber and the ploidy with the agarose block method. For each aliquot, the cell density was plotted against the genome copy number, and a trend line was calculated. B. Determination of the genome copy number using the Real Time PCR method. Three independent cultures were used to determine the genome copy number. A selected growth curve, the average ploidy values and their standard deviation are shown.
