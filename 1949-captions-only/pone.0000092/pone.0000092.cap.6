The forward light scatter as a measure of cell size is plotted against the fluorescence of the DNA-specific dye acridine orange as a measure of the DNA content. Aliquots representing early and middle exponential phase and early stationary phase (top to bottom) were analyzed, and the optical densities are indicated. B. The fluorescence as a measure of DNA content is plotted against the fraction of the population exhibiting a specific fluorescence. The three curves from left to right represent the three aliquots shown in A from top to bottom.</p>
