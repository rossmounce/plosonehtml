                Figure 1. Chronic smoke exposure induces toxicity and changes associated with cellular transformation. A: Toxicity caused by smoke exposure. Shown are cultured BEAS-2B cells after 0, 4 and 8 days of growth in medium containing smoke extract. B: Proliferation assay on cell lines cultured for 1–5 days, derived from CSE-exposed cells at 4 time points (0,3,7 and 8 days). Error bars represent±s.e.m. *P&lt;0.001. C: Cell-substrate adhesion assays on plastic, placental collagen and fibronectin using cultured BEAS-2B cells after the specified time point in days of growth in medium containing smoke extract. Assays were analyzed after 60 minutes in culture. Error bars represent s.e.m. n = 4 *P&lt;0.001. D: Cell migration assays using established cell lines after 24 h in culture. Error bars represent±s.e.m. n = 4 *P&lt;0.001. E: Actin cytoskeleton of cell lines B0 and B8 imaged by fluorescent microscopy using Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin. Scale bars represent 20 µm.
