Shown are cultured BEAS-2B cells after 0, 4 and 8 days of growth in medium containing smoke extract. <strong>B:</strong> Proliferation assay on cell lines cultured for 1–5 days, derived from CSE-exposed cells at 4 time points (0,3,7 and 8 days). Error bars represent±s.e.m. *P&lt;0.001. <strong>C:</strong> Cell-substrate adhesion assays on plastic, placental collagen and fibronectin using cultured BEAS-2B cells after the specified time point in days of growth in medium containing smoke extract. Assays were analyzed after 60 minutes in culture. Error bars represent s.e.m. n = 4 *P&lt;0.001. <strong>D:</strong> Cell migration assays using established cell lines after 24 h in culture. Error bars represent±s.e.m. n = 4 *P&lt;0.001. <strong>E:</strong> Actin cytoskeleton of cell lines B0 and B8 imaged by fluorescent microscopy using Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin. Scale bars represent 20 µm.</p>
