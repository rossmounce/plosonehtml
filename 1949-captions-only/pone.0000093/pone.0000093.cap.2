                Figure 2. Chronic smoke exposure induces growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. A: Anchorage independence was assayed by the ability of CSE-exposed cells to grow in soft agar. B0 or B8 cells (1×103) were grown in soft agar for 15 days before photography. Quantification of colonies is shown on the right. Results are representative of 5 experiments. B: Tumor formation in nude mice, 4 weeks after inoculation with B0 or B8 cells. Arrows indicate large tumor masses formed in mice injected with B8 cells. C: Section of a representative tumor from a mouse inoculated with B8 cells stained with H and E. D: Images of soft agar assays using HBE cells after no smoke exposure (P0) or recovered HBE cells after 8 days of CSE exposure (P8). Quantification of colonies is shown on the right. Results are representative of 5 experiments. E: Tumor formation in nude mice, 4 weeks after inoculation with P0 and P8 cells. Arrows indicate large tumor masses formed in mice injected with P8 cells. F: Section of a representative tumor from a mouse inoculated with P8 cells stained with H and E. Scale bars represent 50 µm.
