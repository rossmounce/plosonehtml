B0 or B8 cells (1×10<sup>3</sup>) were grown in soft agar for 15 days before photography. Quantification of colonies is shown on the right. Results are representative of 5 experiments. <strong>B:</strong> Tumor formation in nude mice, 4 weeks after inoculation with B0 or B8 cells. Arrows indicate large tumor masses formed in mice injected with B8 cells. <strong>C:</strong> Section of a representative tumor from a mouse inoculated with B8 cells stained with H and E. <strong>D:</strong> Images of soft agar assays using HBE cells after no smoke exposure (P0) or recovered HBE cells after 8 days of CSE exposure (P8). Quantification of colonies is shown on the right. Results are representative of 5 experiments. <strong>E:</strong> Tumor formation in nude mice, 4 weeks after inoculation with P0 and P8 cells. Arrows indicate large tumor masses formed in mice injected with P8 cells. <strong>F:</strong> Section of a representative tumor from a mouse inoculated with P8 cells stained with H and E. Scale bars represent 50 µm. </p>
