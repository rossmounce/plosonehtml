                Figure 3. Chronic smoke exposure induces the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways A: Wnt signaling assay of smoke exposed Beas-2b cell populations after transfection with TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH luciferase reporter constructs. B: Beas-2b cells were transfected with Gli-TK or TK alone to assay Hh signaling. C: Notch signaling assay in Beas-2b cells using HES luciferase reporter. D, E and F: Same as in A, B and C, using HBE cell populations. Error bars representÂ±s.e.m. n = 6 *P&lt;0.001.
