                Figure 4. Wnt and Hedgehog signaling are linked to phenotypic changes induced by chronic smoke exposure. A: Immunostaining shows increased levels of β-catenin (green) in the nucleus of B8 cells compared to B0 cells and B: in the nucleus of P8 cells as compared to P0. C: Immunostaining shows increased expression of Gli (red) in the nucleus of B8 cells compared to B0 cells and D: in P8 cells as compared to P0. Scale bar represents 20 µm.
