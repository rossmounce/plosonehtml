                Figure 5. Inhibitors of Hh and Wnt signaling blocked anchorage-independent growth and cell hyperproliferation of CSE exposed cells. A: The ability of chronic smoke exposed cells (B8), or B: (P8), to grow in soft agar for 15 days was assayed after treatment with tomatidine, cyclopamine, sulindac, NS398, GSI or vehicle control. Quantification of colonies is shown on the right. Results are representative of 5 experiments. C: B0 and B8 cells in culture after treatment with tomatidine, cyclopamine, sulindac or vehicle control.
