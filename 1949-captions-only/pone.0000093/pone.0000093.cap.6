                Figure 6. Inhibition of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling reduces tumor size in nude mice A: Effect of Wnt and Hh inhibitors on Wnt signaling in B0 vs. B8 cells using TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH luciferase reporter constructs. B: Effect of Wnt and Hh inhibitors on Hh signaling in B0 vs. B8 cells transfected with Gli-TK or TK alone. C: Representative tumors excised from mice after no treatment (Con) or after 15 days of treatment with drugs as indicated. Graphs show comparison of tumor volume (cm3) and weight (gm). Veh is vehicle alone. Error bars representÂ±s.e.m. n = 5 *P&lt;0.001. D: H and E staining of representative tumors formed in mice injected with B8 cells and treated with drugs as indicated.
