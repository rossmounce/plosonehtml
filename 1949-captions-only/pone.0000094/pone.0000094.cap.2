(a, b) initial model. (c, d) second model. (e, f) third model. (a, c, e) network graphic representation. The green nodes represent gene expression clusters. Representative genes of each cluster are shown in the box below each node. ESR: environmental stress response cluster. energy: glucose metabolism cluster. oxidative stress: the application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or menadione. Nitric oxide: the duration of NOÂ· exposure. galactose: galactose utilization. diauxic shift: shift between anaerobic growth and aerobic respiration. Nodes with missing values are colored in gray. The CPD table shows the conditional probability distribution of Fzf1p activity. The red edges represent novel predictions from the first network model. (b, d, f) edge confidence score histogram. The dot-filled columns represent edges excluded from a model by structural constraints.</p>
