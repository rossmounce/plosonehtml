                Figure 3. The change of gene expression in Fzf1p response clusters, FZF1 and galactose utilization genes in response to galactose. (a) Wild type and gal promoter driven FZF1 over-expression strains in response to the change from glucose to galactose (experiment E2). (b) Wild type and fzf1Δ strains in response to the change from glucose to galactose (experiment E3). (c) Wild type and fzf1Δ strains in response to the change from raffinose to galactose (experiment E4). Color unit is fold change of gene expression. Gene expression too low to be detected is colored in blue.
