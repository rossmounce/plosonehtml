(a) Wild type and gal promoter driven <em>FZF1</em> over-expression strains in response to the change from glucose to galactose (experiment E2). (b) Wild type and <em>fzf1</em>Δ strains in response to the change from glucose to galactose (experiment E3). (c) Wild type and <em>fzf1</em>Δ strains in response to the change from raffinose to galactose (experiment E4). Color unit is fold change of gene expression. Gene expression too low to be detected is colored in blue.</p>
