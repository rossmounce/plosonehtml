                Figure 1. Primers, markers and key sites on H5N1 influenza A hemagglutinin gene. A region of 768 bases of cDNA of the hemagglutinin gene of nine strains of H5N1 was assayed to obtain sequence information for three key biologically significant sites (glycosylation, receptor specificity, and HA1/HA2 cleavage; (sites indicated in red)). Two markers (green) distinguish clades of H5N1. Three additional polymorphic sites (yellow) provide unambiguous strain identification. The PCR primers used to bracket this region are indicated in purple; internal primers are blue.
