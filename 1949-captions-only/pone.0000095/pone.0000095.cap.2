                Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) genes from highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses used in this study. Phylogenetic trees were inferred from nucleotide sequences by the neighbor joining method in the MEGA program. Horizontal distances are proportional to the number of nucleotide changes between the viruses. HA clade determinations are shown on the right.
