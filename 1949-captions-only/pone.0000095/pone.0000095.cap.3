                Figure 3. Amplicon DNA yield from PCR with different combinations of biotinylated primers. All PCR products were Sanger-sequenced to confirm the identity of the sample. A) The nine H5N1 samples amplified with a biotinylated forward primer (B-F-H5N1-1) and nonbiotinylated reverse primer (R-H5N1-2). From left to right, the samples are A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (AF144305), A/Hong Kong/156/97 (AF036356), A/Hong Kong/483/97 (AF046097), A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (AY575869), A/chicken/Korea/ES/03 (AY676035), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine candidate with deletion of polybasic cleavage site (AY651334), A/Vietnam/JP14/2005 (ISDN117778), A/Vietnam/HN30408/2005 (ISDN119678), A/Indonesia/5/05 (ISDN125873). B) The H5N1 PCR products amplified with a biotinylated reverse primer (B-R-H5N1-3) and a nonbiotinylated forward primer (F-H5N1-4). Samples are in the order stated for part (A).
