                Figure 4. Panels Aâ€“I: Pyrograms obtained by pyrosequencing of sample A/Vietnam/HN30408/2005 with the HS 96 system. Peaks above a given nucleotide sample indicate nucleotide incorporation (with height proportional to number of consecutive incorporation events). Initial pyrosequencing was performed with systematic nucleotide dispensation for de novo sequencing (pre-programmed dispensation runs can also be performed). Panel J: Map of the HA sequence of A/Vietnam/HN30408/2005 obtained by Sanger sequencing; pyrosequencing data is overlaid and color-coded to show correlation between the sequence data obtained by the two methods. Reverse-primed pyrosequencing results should be read as reverse complements. For clarity, primers and biologically significant sequence segments are colored to correspond to the sequence map presented in Figure 1.
