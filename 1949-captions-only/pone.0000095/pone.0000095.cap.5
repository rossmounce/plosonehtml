Comparison of pyrosequencing results obtained using the <em>de novo</em> (top) and consensus pre-programmed (bottom) sequencing methods for site 3 (a clade marker) in sample A1 (goose/Guangdong/1/96). Both methods give the sequence <strong>GACAAAGCTCTATCAAAAC</strong> for our laboratory stock. In contrast the GenBank sequence (accession # AF144305) reads <strong>GACAAAGCTATATCAAAAC. Database information was found to be based off wild-type sequence information, while the sample we analyzed was obtained via reverse genetics.</strong> A longer read length is obtained via the consensus pre-programmed dispensation method (22 versus 12 nucleotides).</p>
