                Figure 5. A representative pyrogram illustration. Comparison of pyrosequencing results obtained using the de novo (top) and consensus pre-programmed (bottom) sequencing methods for site 3 (a clade marker) in sample A1 (goose/Guangdong/1/96). Both methods give the sequence GACAAAGCTCTATCAAAAC for our laboratory stock. In contrast the GenBank sequence (accession # AF144305) reads GACAAAGCTATATCAAAAC. Database information was found to be based off wild-type sequence information, while the sample we analyzed was obtained via reverse genetics. A longer read length is obtained via the consensus pre-programmed dispensation method (22 versus 12 nucleotides).
