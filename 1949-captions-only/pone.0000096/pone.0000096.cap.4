                Figure 4.  Emergence of Local Optima in the Landscape.Each Gaussian-like curve represents the fraction of local optima in the r-th order,  (r = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Each dashed line represents the relative fitness where the mutation-selection-random drift balance sets in with all conceivable d-fold point mutants of N
