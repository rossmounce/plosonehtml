                Figure 5.  Semi-quantitative Fitness Landscape Plotted from the Experimental Data.The number of sequences decreases with increasing relative fitness. There are many local peaks at fitness values of â‰¥0.4. Note that the landscape is not shown over a fitness of 0.6 due to the low frequency of the sequence.
