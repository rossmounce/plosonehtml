Total 38 genes from four enriched pathways and 132 lipids were included in the analysis as variables. Data was autoscaled prior to multivariate analysis. Three latent variables were used in the model (<em>Q</em>
                     <sup>2</sup> = 0.50). The labels are patient ID numbers. (A) The PLS/DA score plot reveals treatment-specific differences between the treatments are observed in molecular profiles after intervention. (B) Loadings for the first two latent variables reveal plasma lipid classes and muscle pathways associated with specific interventions. LPC is shorthand for lysophosphatidylcholine (for example GPCho(18:0/0:0)).</p>
