                Figure 3.  Regression of plasma lipid data on arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5AP) muscle gene expression profile using the lasso method.25 lipid variables were chosen to build the regression model. (A) ALOX5AP expression values as predicted by the model. (B) Regression coefficients for the lipid species selected by lasso.
