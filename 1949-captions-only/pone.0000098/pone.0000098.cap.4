                Figure 4.  Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. The cluster shown represents 3,117 genes. Each row represents a gene, whereas each column corresponds to a tissue sample. The relative abundance of the gene in the tissue correlates with color intensity (red, induced; green, repressed; black, no change). On the dendogram, post-treated clinical samples clustered together.
