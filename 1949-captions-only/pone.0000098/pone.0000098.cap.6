                Figure 6.  Gene expression by RT-PCR. RT-PCR of NDUFA13 and DAPPER genes in biopsies from the primary tumor showing that these genes were reactivated after treatment. This corresponds to one of the three patients whose biopsy (only post-treatment) was analyzed by microarray and showed over-expression of these genes.
