                Figure 1.  ANTXR2 MIDAS metal ion bound by PA D683.Close-up view of the PA-ANTXR2 generated with Molscript (PDB # ITZN) [7]. The PA backbone is colored light blue with the D683 residue shown in cyan. The chelate Mg2+ ion is colored purple, the ANTXR2 Thr118 and Asp50 residues (mutated in this report) are shown in green with the other MIDAS residues represented in orange. Water molecules and oxygen atoms are represented by large and small red balls, respectively.
