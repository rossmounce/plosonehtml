                Figure 2.  The cell surface T118A mutant ANTXR2 receptor binds PA.(A) Flow cytometric analysis of PA binding to CHO-R1.1 cells and CHO-R1.1 cells engineered to express WT or mutant ANTXR2-EGFP fusion proteins. The cells were incubated with PA and then with a PA-specific antibody followed by an APC-labeled secondary antibody.
