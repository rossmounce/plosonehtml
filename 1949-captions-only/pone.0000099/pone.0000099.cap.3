                Figure 3.  Soluble ANTXR2T118A inhibits intoxication of cells.WT and mutant sANTXR2 proteins were added in increasing amounts to measure their relative abilities to block CHO-K1 cell intoxication with PA (10−8 M) and LFN-DTA (10−10 M). Cell viability was subsequently measured using the WST-1 assay and is represented as the percentage of that seen with cells incubated with LFN-DTA alone (100% viable).
