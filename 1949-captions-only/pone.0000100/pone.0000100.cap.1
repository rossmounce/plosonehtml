The examples illustrated are for a 32 Hz and a 40 Hz vibration, with ΔA = −6.6% and +20%. <strong>Below</strong>: The six graphs plot the frequency discrimination thresholds (in Hz) for 6 different subjects as a function of ΔA. Each black point is the average threshold measured by two independently run adaptive staircases. Each graph includes the line-of-best-fit and the R<sup>2</sup> for that regression line.</p>
