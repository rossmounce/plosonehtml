                Figure 2. 
                     Top: Illustration of two sinusoidal vibrations with different frequency but equal rms velocity (proportional to AÃ—f). Below: Results of Experiment 2 (vertical bars represent within-subject SEM). Subjects' thresholds for frequency discrimination were higher when comparing two vibrations with matched velocity than for vibrations with matched amplitude (and thus different velocity). This greater difficulty in discriminating matched-velocity vibrations did not vary systematically as the retention interval increased.
