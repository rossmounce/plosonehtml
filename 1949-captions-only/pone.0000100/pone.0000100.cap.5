The vibrations all had fixed amplitude. Frequency discrimination was worse (thresholds increased) if the vibrations were noisy or were presented to opposite fingers, and these two effects combined additively in that the subjects' thresholds were close to that computed to arise from the effects of noise and matched velocity combined independently.</p>
