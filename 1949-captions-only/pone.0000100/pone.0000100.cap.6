The vibrations all had matched rms velocity. Frequency discrimination was worse (thresholds increased) if the vibrations were noisy or were presented to opposite fingers, but these two effects combined sub-additively, in that the effect of noise was smaller when subjects were comparing vibrations on opposite fingers than when subjects compared vibrations on the same finger.</p>
