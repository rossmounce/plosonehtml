                Figure 6. Results of Experiment 6 in which subjects compared two periodic or two noisy vibrations that were presented to either the same index finger or to opposite index fingers (vertical bars represent within-subject SEM). The vibrations all had matched rms velocity. Frequency discrimination was worse (thresholds increased) if the vibrations were noisy or were presented to opposite fingers, but these two effects combined sub-additively, in that the effect of noise was smaller when subjects were comparing vibrations on opposite fingers than when subjects compared vibrations on the same finger.
