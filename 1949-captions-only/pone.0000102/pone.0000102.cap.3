                Figure 3. Polyfunctional CD8+ T cell immune responses to the HIV-1 Gag peptide pool were detected by cytokine flow cytometry. Responses were measured in the cord blood of unexposed neonates (CB-UNEX; n = 4), HIV-1-exposed uninfected neonates (CB-EU; n = 6), and in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-exposed-uninfected infants (PB-EU 7 mo; n = 9) and young children (PB-EU 20 mo; n = 7), and in HIV-1-infected infants (PB-INF 7 mo; n = 5) and young children (PB-INF 25 mo; n = 5). Each group is represented by a different symbol.
