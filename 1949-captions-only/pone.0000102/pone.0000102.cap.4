                Figure 4.  Augmented CD8+ HIV-1 immune responses to Gag peptide pools in exposed uninfected neonatal cord blood upon the removal of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. A) IFN-gamma production by undepleted whole cord blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived CD8+ T-cells (open white symbols) and CD25-depleted MNCs derived CD8+ T-cells (closed black symbols) is depicted. B) Flow cytometry plots from an exposed uninfected neonate (Patient 30) representing HIV-1-Gag-induced IFN- gamma production in non-CD25-depleted CBMC derived CD8+ T-cells and CD25-depleted CBMC derived CD8+ T-cells.
