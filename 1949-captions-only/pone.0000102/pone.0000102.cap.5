                Figure 5. Augmented CD4+ HIV-1 immune responses to Gag peptide pools in exposed uninfected neonatal cord blood upon the removal of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. A) IL-2 production by undepleted whole cord blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived CD4+ T-cells (open white symbols) and CD25-depleted MNCs derived CD4+ T-cells (closed black symbols) is depicted. B) Flow cytometry plots from an exposed uninfected neonate (Patient 63) representing HIV-1 Gag induced IL-2 production in undepleted whole CBMC derived CD4+ T-cells and CD25-depleted CBMC derived CD4+ T-cells.
