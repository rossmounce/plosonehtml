Traces in <a href="#pone-0000103-g003">figure 3</a> indicate the average prediction error, δ<em>(t)</em>, across subjects for two different tasks. Neural activity corresponding to prediction errors that were generated from independently fitting reinforcement model to our 2 different tasks (MS → RO and FR → PR) using two different methods (softmax and ε-greey) was identified though general linear model (GLM) analyses. Peak activities for left and right striatum are located at MNI [−12, 8, 8] and [24, 12, −4] for MS→RO task and [−16, 8, −4] and [12, 8, 0] for FR→PR task using softmax method. Activity in ventral striatum correlates with the magnitude of prediction errors in the exploitation periods of both tasks (red: p&lt;0.001; yellow: p&lt;0.005, uncorrected).</p>
