(B) Relative BOLD signal changes of IFG in four different sub-tasks are estimated by general linear model (GLM). Activities at the onsets of reward structure MS, RO, FR are significantly bigger than zero (p&lt;0.001, one sample t-test). (C) BOLD signal changes were further confirmed by a region of interest (ROI) analysis in the four sub-tasks. These periods correspond to initially learning the reward structure of the tasks (blue) and adapting to changes in reward structure in the middle of the MSâ†’RO task (red). Qualitatively equivalent results were also obtained for the anterior insula.</p>
