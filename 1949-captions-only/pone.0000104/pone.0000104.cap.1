(B) AMOD software was developed to standardize and increase the efficiency of the MO design process to allow more rapid screening. (C) A MO database, MODB, was developed to manage, share, and data mine all MO design and outcome information. (D) Following MO synthesis and distribution to the participating labs, MOs were investigated using a variety of assays in zebrafish embryos that allowed functional annotation of 18/150 of the putative CTT proteins investigated. Results of investigations were recorded in MODB for data mining. AMOD software was used to design a second sequence-independent MO to assess specificity of the initial MO tested.</p>
