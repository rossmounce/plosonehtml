                Figure 1.  Schematic of overall MO screen. (A) A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to determine the subset of N-terminally complete CTT homologs representing the testable putative proteins of the zebrafish secretome. (B) AMOD software was developed to standardize and increase the efficiency of the MO design process to allow more rapid screening. (C) A MO database, MODB, was developed to manage, share, and data mine all MO design and outcome information. (D) Following MO synthesis and distribution to the participating labs, MOs were investigated using a variety of assays in zebrafish embryos that allowed functional annotation of 18/150 of the putative CTT proteins investigated. Results of investigations were recorded in MODB for data mining. AMOD software was used to design a second sequence-independent MO to assess specificity of the initial MO tested.
