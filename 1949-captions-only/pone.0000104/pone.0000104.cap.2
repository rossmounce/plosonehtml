                Figure 2.  Selection of candidate genes for MO targeting.(A) Co-translationally translocated vertebrate protein sequences (CTT Proteins) were identified using an in silico prediction pipeline to create the reference CTT protein sequence sets. (B) Zebrafish Tentative Consequence (TC) sequences were compared to the reference protein sequence sets using BLASTX. Zebrafish TC sequences possessing highly homologous regions located near the reference protein sequence N-termini and possessing clear translational initiation sites were selected for further analysis. (C) The corresponding zebrafish TC peptides were then analyzed by the in silico prediction pipeline and sequences possessing a signal peptide selected for morpholino design. (D) E.g. zebrafish sequence SP1991 was selected on the basis of its strong homology to the N-terminus of reference protein gi_14768182. Analysis identified a strong translation initiation site near the 5â€² end of the SP1991 nucleotide sequence and in silico predictions identified a clear signal peptide near the N-terminus of the translated peptide.
