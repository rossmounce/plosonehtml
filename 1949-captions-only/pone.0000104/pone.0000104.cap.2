(B) Zebrafish Tentative Consequence (TC) sequences were compared to the reference protein sequence sets using BLASTX. Zebrafish TC sequences possessing highly homologous regions located near the reference protein sequence N-termini and possessing clear translational initiation sites were selected for further analysis. (C) The corresponding zebrafish TC peptides were then analyzed by the <em>in silico</em> prediction pipeline and sequences possessing a signal peptide selected for morpholino design. (D) E.g. zebrafish sequence SP1991 was selected on the basis of its strong homology to the N-terminus of reference protein gi_14768182. Analysis identified a strong translation initiation site near the 5â€² end of the SP1991 nucleotide sequence and <em>in silico</em> predictions identified a clear signal peptide near the N-terminus of the translated peptide.</p>
