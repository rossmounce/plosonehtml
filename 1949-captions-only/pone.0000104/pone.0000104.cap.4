At 24 hpf, a fluorescent fatty acid (BODIPY-C12) was injected into the yolk. (A) 48 hpf embryo injected with BODIPY-C12 at 24 hpf. Embryos were then kept in the dark until 72 hpf when they were scored for morphologic phenotype. Embryos (4/tube) were homogenized in 50% methanol and extracted TLC plates were then scanned to reveal triacylglycerol (TG), diacylglycerol (DG), initial substrate (C12) and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)). Fluorescent intensities were quantified and the total fluorescence of all lipids was determined. (B) For each MO injected, data were expressed as a percent of total lipids and compared to a phenol red control to obtain the percent of control (C) A second experiment comparing BODIPY-C12 incorporation in control and Apo2c MO injected embryos. A given experiment represents a mean of at least three individual lipid extracts with 4 embryos each. * p&lt;0.05 (D) Syntenic analysis indicates that the zebrafish EST sequence with homology to Apoc2, is the fish ortholog of that gene. (E,F) Morphology of embryos injected with apoC2 MO. Arrowheads indicate enlarged yolk.</p>
