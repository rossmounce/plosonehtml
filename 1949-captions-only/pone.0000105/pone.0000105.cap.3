                Figure 3. Distribution of flowering time among 96 Kas-1Ã—Col-gl1 RILs. Flowering time was measured as days until flowering in Sweden (upper) and Spain (lower) across two replicated blocks. The means and standard deviations of parents (Col-gl1 and Kas-1) are shown by arrows and lines, respectively.
