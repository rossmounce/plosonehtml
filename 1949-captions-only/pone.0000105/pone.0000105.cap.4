Analysis of posterior probabilities was based on Bayes model and the interval at each point represented 2-cM scanning resolution. Solid lines show block 1 and dashed lines show block 2 each modeled separately. The dotted green horizontal line corresponds to 1% false discovery rate (FDR) set by 400 permutations. The multigene model averaged Bayesian QTL model fits 1 to 10 genes models. The relative weight of each model is shown (see R/bQTL package and supplementary data for a more detailed explanation).</p>
