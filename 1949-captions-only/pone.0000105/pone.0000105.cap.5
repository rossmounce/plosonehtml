                Figure 5. Main effects, Genotype×Environment, and Epistasis. Effects described below are illustrated by the arrows in each panel A) Modeling the main effect of FRI shows the large floral repressing effect of the Kas FRI allele. B) Modeling the environmental interaction shows that Kas FRI has less of an effect in the cooler Sweden conditions. C) Including the interaction term for FLM×FRI reveals that in the Col fri background Kas FLM promote flowering while in the Kas FRI background Kas FLM has little effect. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals estimated from the standard residual of each model across 1123 plants in the experiment. Abbreviations: Sp (Spain), Sw (Sweden), C (Col), K (Kas).
