Effects described below are illustrated by the arrows in each panel A) Modeling the main effect of <em>FRI</em> shows the large floral repressing effect of the Kas <em>FRI</em> allele. B) Modeling the environmental interaction shows that Kas <em>FRI</em> has less of an effect in the cooler Sweden conditions. C) Including the interaction term for <em>FLM</em>×<em>FRI</em> reveals that in the Col <em>fri</em> background Kas <em>FLM</em> promote flowering while in the Kas <em>FRI</em> background Kas <em>FLM</em> has little effect. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals estimated from the standard residual of each model across 1123 plants in the experiment. Abbreviations: Sp (Spain), Sw (Sweden), C (Col), K (Kas).</p>
