A: In the absence of the activating drug dexamethasone, the Slug MO phenotype, i.e. suppression of <em>Xbra</em> expression in stage 11 embryos (A)(arrow) and suppression of <em>Sox9</em> expression in stage 16 embryos (D), was unaltered. When embryos were treated with dexamethasone (20 ÂµM) beginning at stage 8, there as an essentially complete rescue of <em>Xbra</em> (B,C) and <em>Sox9</em> expression (E,H). Treatment of embryos with dexamethasone at stage 11 (early gastrulation) was also effective at rescuing <em>Sox9</em> expression (F,H), while addition of dexamethasone at stage 13 (late gastrulation/early neurulation) produced at most a partial and inefficient rescue of <em>Sox9</em> expression (G,H).</p>
