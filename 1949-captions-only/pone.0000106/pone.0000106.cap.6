G: Treatment of early embryos with AKBA (50 µM from the 4-cell stage on) lead to a decrease in <em>Xbra</em> staining (control and AKBA-treated embryos marked). Injection of RNA encoding IκBsa (H,I) or RelAΔSP (J–L) had effects similar to that seen in Slug MO injected embryos; that is, both induced the reduction of Xbra (H,J), Apod (K) and Sox9 (I,L) RNA staining. AKBA treatment had no reproducible effect on <em>Sox9</em> expression (data not shown). Arrows mark affected regions.</p>
