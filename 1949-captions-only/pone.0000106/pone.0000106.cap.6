                Figure 6.  NF-κB regulation of mesodermal and neural markers:The Slug MO induced loss of Xbra (A,B), Apod (C,D) and Sox9 (E,F) expression was rescued by injection of RelA RNA (600 pg/embryo)(A, C, E-Slug MO alone, B, D, F-Slug MO+RelA RNA). G: Treatment of early embryos with AKBA (50 µM from the 4-cell stage on) lead to a decrease in Xbra staining (control and AKBA-treated embryos marked). Injection of RNA encoding IκBsa (H,I) or RelAΔSP (J–L) had effects similar to that seen in Slug MO injected embryos; that is, both induced the reduction of Xbra (H,J), Apod (K) and Sox9 (I,L) RNA staining. AKBA treatment had no reproducible effect on Sox9 expression (data not shown). Arrows mark affected regions.
