                Figure 7.  NF-κB's regulatory targets:A: In animal caps, RelA lead to an increase in Slug RNA levels, while RelAΔSP produced a decrease. When activated by dexamethasone (+Dex), the hormone-regulated form of RelA, GR-RelA (600 pg RNA/embryo), induced a similar increase in the levels of Slug RNA, as well as Snail, Sox9 (B), and Bcl-xL (C) RNAs compared to animal caps from GR-RelA injected embryos not exposed to dexamethasone. Similar effects were seen in the presence of emetine (+Dex+Eme,), while emetine alone (+Eme) had little effect on any of measured RNA levels. Error bars in reflect standard deviation from the mean of multiple experiments.
