B: Animal caps were prepared from embryos injected with either untagged or mycGFP-Slug RNAs; both produced a similar increase in Sox9 RNA levels. C: Animal caps, from embryos injected with either mt-GFP or mycGFP-Slug RNAs, were analyzed when control embryos reached stage 11 or stage 16; at stage 11 mycGFP-Slug induced an increase in Sox9 RNA levels, which returned to baseline by stage 16. No change in Sox9 RNA levels were observed at either stage in animal caps expressing mt-GFP. In GR-Slug injected caps, levels of Bcl-xL (D), Sox9 (E), RelA, Rel2 and Rel3 (F), and caspase-9, -3 and -6 (G) RNAs were increased in response to dexamethasone; with the sole exception of caspase-9, these increases were blocked by emetine. In all panels, error bars reflect standard deviation from the mean of multiple experiments.</p>
