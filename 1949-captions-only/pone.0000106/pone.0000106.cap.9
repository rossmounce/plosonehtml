                Figure 9.  Bcl-xL-Slug-NF-κB network:This diagram focuses on the regulatory interactions uncovered in the course of our studies (see text for caveats associated with the identification of direct interactions). Protein names are underlined, gene names are in italics. Bcl-xL appears to activate NF-κB through effects on IκK activity and IκB stability. NF-κB acts directly to regulate Slug, Snail, RelA, and Rel3 levels; NF-κB regulation of the expression of its inhibitor IκB is based on data from mammalian systems. Caspase-9 was the only direct target of Slug identified in our studies; indirect interactions are indicated by dotted lines.
