Protein names are underlined, gene names are in italics. Bcl-xL appears to activate NF-κB through effects on IκK activity and IκB stability. NF-κB acts directly to regulate Slug, Snail, RelA, and Rel3 levels; NF-κB regulation of the expression of its inhibitor IκB is based on data from mammalian systems. <em>Caspase-9</em> was the only direct target of Slug identified in our studies; indirect interactions are indicated by dotted lines.</p>
