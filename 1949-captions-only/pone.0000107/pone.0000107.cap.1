                Figure 1.  Changes in mitochondrial constituents during the cell cycle.Synchronized C9 cells (A–C) were recovered at the indicated time intervals and the relative cellular content of mtDNA (A) and proteins (B–C) determined. No significant changes in the cellular abundance of the mitochondrial 12S gene are observed. However, the cellular content of β-F1-ATPase, Hsp60 and cyclin B1 showed a significant increase at 4 h after release from the metabolic arrest. Representative experiments are shown (A–C). * and **, P&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.005 when compared with 0–2 h. D, The fluorescence intensity of the NAO probe was used to determine changes on mitochondrial mass during the cell cycle of non-synchronized C9 cells. The results shown are the means±SEM of three experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with cells in G0/G1.
