No significant changes in the cellular abundance of the mitochondrial 12S gene are observed. However, the cellular content of β-F1-ATPase, Hsp60 and cyclin B1 showed a significant increase at 4 h after release from the metabolic arrest. Representative experiments are shown (<strong>A–C</strong>). * and **, P&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.005 when compared with 0–2 h. <strong>D</strong>, The fluorescence intensity of the NAO probe was used to determine changes on mitochondrial mass during the cell cycle of non-synchronized C9 cells. The results shown are the means±SEM of three experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with cells in G0/G1.</p>
