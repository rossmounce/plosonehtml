Open bars, G0/G1; grey bars, S and black bars, G2/M. The results shown are the means±SEM of four experiments. * and <sup>#</sup>, P&lt; 0.05 when compared with cells in G0/G1 and S, respectively. <strong>B</strong>, C9 cells were sorted by flow cytometry according to their DNA content and the protein extracts fractionated and blotted with the indicated antibodies. The two bands shown under each condition are from two independent experiments. The results shown in the graph are the means±SEM of three experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with cells in S phase. <strong>C</strong>, Synchronized C9 cells were recovered at the indicated time intervals and the relative cellular content of β-F1-ATPase mRNA determined by Northern-blot analysis. The mitochondrial encoded ATPase 6–8 mRNA and 12S rRNA and the nuclear encoded 18S rRNA were also determined. The results shown are the means±SEM of four experiments. <strong>D</strong>, FACS determination of the mitochondrial membrane potential (<em>ΔΨ</em>m) in C9 cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. The results shown are the means±SEM of three experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with cells in G0/G1.</p>
