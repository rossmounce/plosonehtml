Upper panel, green gfp fluorescence; middle panel, red β-F1-ATPase immunostaining; lower panel, yellow merged image. <strong>C,</strong> Specific immunogold labeling (10 nm gold) of BHK mitochondria (m). Note the lack of gold labeling of other structures in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus (n) of the cell. <strong>D</strong>, Western blots of C9 (lane 1) and BHK cells (lanes 2–4) transfected with the pβGFP3′β construct. Fractionated proteins from the cellular extracts were probed with anti-gfp and anti-tubulin, the later as loading control. The migration of the pβ-gfp chimera is also indicated. In lane 3, BHK cells have been previously treated with FCCP (4 µM) plus oligomycin (2 µM) for 1 hour. Note the accumulation of pβ-gfp. In lane 4, BHK cells treated as in lane 3 were washed for 40 minutes before fractionation. Note the processing of pβ-gfp to mature gfp.</p>
