                Figure 3.  The presequence of β-F1-ATPase precursor targets gfp to mitochondria.The expression of gfp in C9 (A,B) and BHK (C) cells was assessed by fluorescence (A), immunofluorescence (B) and immunoelectron (C) microscopy. A, Illustrates by phase contrast (upper panel) and immunofluorescence (lower panel) the same low magnification field of C9-pβGFP3′β cells. B, C9-pβGFP3′β cells analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-β-F1-ATPase antibody at 63× magnification. Upper panel, green gfp fluorescence; middle panel, red β-F1-ATPase immunostaining; lower panel, yellow merged image. C, Specific immunogold labeling (10 nm gold) of BHK mitochondria (m). Note the lack of gold labeling of other structures in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus (n) of the cell. D, Western blots of C9 (lane 1) and BHK cells (lanes 2–4) transfected with the pβGFP3′β construct. Fractionated proteins from the cellular extracts were probed with anti-gfp and anti-tubulin, the later as loading control. The migration of the pβ-gfp chimera is also indicated. In lane 3, BHK cells have been previously treated with FCCP (4 µM) plus oligomycin (2 µM) for 1 hour. Note the accumulation of pβ-gfp. In lane 4, BHK cells treated as in lane 3 were washed for 40 minutes before fractionation. Note the processing of pβ-gfp to mature gfp.
