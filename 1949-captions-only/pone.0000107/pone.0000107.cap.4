                Figure 4.  The 3′UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA controls the accumulation of the protein at G2/M.Synchronized C9-pβGFP3′β cells (A,B) were recovered at the indicated time intervals and the relative cellular content of gfp protein (gfp/tubulin ratio) (A) and gfp mRNA (gfp/12S ratio) (B) determined. The results shown are the means±SEM of three (A) and four (B) experiments. A significant accumulation of gfp protein was observed at four h after release from the metabolic arrest. *, P&lt;0.0005 when compared with 0–2 h. No significant changes in the cellular abundance of gfp mRNA was observed during cellular proliferation. C, The upper panel shows a merged image of the immunofluorescence microscopy of C9-pβGFPTfam cells that illustrates the co-localization of gfp and β-F1-ATPase, thus revealing the efficient targeting of gfp to mitochondria in this cellular clone (for other details see Fig. 3B). The lower panel shows the western blots of fractionated proteins from cellular extracts of parental C9 (C9), C9-pβGFP3′β (3′β) and C9-pβGFPTfam (Tfam) cells simultaneously probed with anti-gfp and anti-tubulin. D, Analysis of gfp expression in C9-pβGFP3′β (closed bars) and C9-pβGFP3′Tfam (open bars) cells in the different phases of the cell cycle by flow cytometry. The results shown are the means±SEM of four experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with C9-pβGFP3′β cells and #, P&lt;0.05 when compared S with G2/M in C9-pβGFP3′β cells.
