The results shown are the means±SEM of three (<strong>A</strong>) and four (<strong>B</strong>) experiments. A significant accumulation of gfp protein was observed at four h after release from the metabolic arrest. *, P&lt;0.0005 when compared with 0–2 h. No significant changes in the cellular abundance of gfp mRNA was observed during cellular proliferation. <strong>C,</strong> The upper panel shows a merged image of the immunofluorescence microscopy of C9-pβGFPTfam cells that illustrates the co-localization of gfp and β-F1-ATPase, thus revealing the efficient targeting of gfp to mitochondria in this cellular clone (for other details see <a href="#pone-0000107-g003">Fig. 3B</a>). The lower panel shows the western blots of fractionated proteins from cellular extracts of parental C9 (C9), C9-pβGFP3′β (3′β) and C9-pβGFPTfam (Tfam) cells simultaneously probed with anti-gfp and anti-tubulin. <strong>D</strong>, Analysis of gfp expression in C9-pβGFP3′β (closed bars) and C9-pβGFP3′Tfam (open bars) cells in the different phases of the cell cycle by flow cytometry. The results shown are the means±SEM of four experiments. *, P&lt;0.05 when compared with C9-pβGFP3′β cells and <sup>#</sup>, P&lt;0.05 when compared S with G2/M in C9-pβGFP3′β cells.</p>
