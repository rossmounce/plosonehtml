                Figure 5.  Morphological changes in the cellular mitochondrial network during mitosis.Synchronized mitochondria-tagged C9-pβGFP3′β cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy at four hours after release from the metabolic block. Typical morphologies of cells in interphase (a,f), prophase (b), metaphase (c,g), anaphase (d) and telophase (e,h) are shown at 60× magnification. The red fluorescence identifies the cytoskeletal proteins α-tubulin (a–e) and β-actin (f–h). The green fluorescence identifies mitochondria. The blue fluorescence reveals the stained nuclear DNA with the To-Pro probe.
