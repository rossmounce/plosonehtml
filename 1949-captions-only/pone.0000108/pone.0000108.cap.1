(A) Representative H/E (4×) and Masson (10×) stainings of lung sections of WT, <em>tnf<sup>−/−</sup>
                     </em> and <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> mice. Inflammatory infiltrates are evident in WT and <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> lungs at subpleural and peribronchial areas (open arrow) while fibrosis develops only in WT lungs (closed arrow). <em>tnf<sup>−/−</sup>
                     </em> mice show no signs of disease. (B) Total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding saline injections. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.</p>
