                Figure 1.  solTNF is necessary for BLM-induced PFWT and transgenic mice were injected intravenously with saline or BLM and sacrificed at indicated time points post injection. (A) Representative H/E (4×) and Masson (10×) stainings of lung sections of WT, tnf−/−
                      and tnftm/tm
                      mice. Inflammatory infiltrates are evident in WT and tnftm/tm
                      lungs at subpleural and peribronchial areas (open arrow) while fibrosis develops only in WT lungs (closed arrow). tnf−/−
                      mice show no signs of disease. (B) Total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding saline injections. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.
