                     <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> mice received either aerosolized recombinant hTNF (200 ng/ml) or saline prior to injection with BLM. 23 days post injection, mice were sacrificed for pathology evaluation. Parallel treatment with solTNF and BLM resulted in the development of fibrotic areas in the lungs of <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> mice. (A) Representative H/E (4×) and Masson (10×) stainings of lung sections. (B) Total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding saline injections. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.</p>
