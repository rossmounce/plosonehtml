BLM preferentially induces increased infiltration of lymphocytes and subsequent fibrosis only in the presence of solTNF. (A) Different cell populations in the lungs of WT mice expressed as a percentage of total cells. (B) Absolute lymphocyte and (C) macrophage numbers in the lungs of WT, <em>tnf<sup>−/−</sup>
                     </em> and <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> mice. (D) Absolute lymphocyte numbers in the lungs of <em>tnf<sup>tm/tm</sup>
                     </em> mice 23 days after treatment with hTNF and BLM. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.</p>
