                Figure 3.  solTNF-dependent lymphocyte infiltration into the lung correlates with BLM/PF developmentQualitative assessment of the inflammatory response elicited by BLM in WT and transgenic mice, revealed after differential cell counts of inflammatory cells in BALF. BLM preferentially induces increased infiltration of lymphocytes and subsequent fibrosis only in the presence of solTNF. (A) Different cell populations in the lungs of WT mice expressed as a percentage of total cells. (B) Absolute lymphocyte and (C) macrophage numbers in the lungs of WT, tnf−/−
                      and tnftm/tm
                      mice. (D) Absolute lymphocyte numbers in the lungs of tnftm/tm
                      mice 23 days after treatment with hTNF and BLM. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.
