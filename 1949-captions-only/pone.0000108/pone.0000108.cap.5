                Figure 5.  Non-hematopoietic expression of TNF is sufficient for BLM/PFBone marrow transfer experiments (outlined in Fig. S2) reveal that proper disease development occurs when TNF is produced from radio-resistant non-hematopoietic cells. (A) Representative H/E staining (4×). (B) Total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding saline injections. (D,E) Absolute numbers of infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes, respectively. Bars represent the mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.
