Control refers to immunostainings without the primary antibody. (B) Simultaneous detection of TNF expression and apoptosis in lung sections of WT mice 7 days post BLM injection. A large number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells (blue) exhibit marked TNF expression (in brown; indicated by solid arrow). Sections are counterstained with methyl green and photographed at a magnification of 40Ã—.</p>
