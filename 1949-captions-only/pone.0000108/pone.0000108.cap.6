                Figure 6.  TNF production from apoptosing epithelial cells(A) TNF is expressed from epithelial cells; Colocalization of TNF expression (in red) with an epithelial specific marker (SP C; in green) in lung sections of WT mice 7 days post BLM injection. Control refers to immunostainings without the primary antibody. (B) Simultaneous detection of TNF expression and apoptosis in lung sections of WT mice 7 days post BLM injection. A large number of TUNEL+ apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells (blue) exhibit marked TNF expression (in brown; indicated by solid arrow). Sections are counterstained with methyl green and photographed at a magnification of 40Ã—.
