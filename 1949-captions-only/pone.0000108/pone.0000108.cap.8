                Figure 8.  Redundant TNFR signaling in BLM/PFBLM was injected in tnfRI−/−
                      and tnfRII−/−
                      mice and disease progression monitored at the indicated time intervals. Both mouse strains developed inflammation and fibrosis as assessed with (A) representative H/E staining (4×), (B) total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections, (C) soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding saline injections. Bars represent mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.
