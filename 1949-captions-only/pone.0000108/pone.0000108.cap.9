                Figure 9.  Multiple cellular dependencies on TNFR signalingBone marrow transfer experiments (outlined in Fig. S2) reveal that proper disease development requires the presence of TNF receptors in both non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic cellular compartments. (A) Representative H/E staining (4×), (B) total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (D,E) Absolute numbers of infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes, respectively. Bars represent the mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.
