(A) Representative H/E staining (4×), (B) total inflammatory cell counts in BALF, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (C) Soluble collagen determination in lung extracts, expressed as a percentage over the corresponding saline injections. (D,E) Absolute numbers of infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes, respectively. Bars represent the mean values ±SD. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding t-test p values.</p>
