In a few phyla, significant number of CRs was not available. <strong><sup>a</sup></strong>These sequences were not used for analysis due to small sample size. <strong><sup>b</sup></strong>CRs from all the orders clubbed together and treated as one animal group ‘Insecta’. Phyla in which &lt;10% of the species harboring palindromes in their CRs are represented in light gray background and &gt;10% in dark gray background. The phylogenetic tree is only a schematic representation and is not according to distance</p>
