                Figure 1. Number of species analysed for the presence of palindromes and inverted repeats in CRs. In a few phyla, significant number of CRs was not available. aThese sequences were not used for analysis due to small sample size. bCRs from all the orders clubbed together and treated as one animal group ‘Insecta’. Phyla in which &lt;10% of the species harboring palindromes in their CRs are represented in light gray background and &gt;10% in dark gray background. The phylogenetic tree is only a schematic representation and is not according to distance
