                Figure 2. Schema of palindrome and inverted repeats mining, adapted in this study. Example of a typical palindrome and inverted repeat unit is given at the bottom. Bars with arrows represent CR sequences. In alignments where subject and query are same but reverse complements, were considered as palindromes. In alignments where subject and query are separated by a spacer region of &gt;13 bases, were considered as IRs.
