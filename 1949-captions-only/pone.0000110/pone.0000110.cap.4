Number of CRs is plotted against the number of palindromic DNA stretches they contain. Many CRs were having ≥2 stretches of palindromes in Lepidopterans. Dipteran CRs possess less number of palindromes when compared to Lepidopterans. (C) Distribution of palindrome lengths in dipteran (n = 82) and lepidopteran (n = 150) CRs. Palindromes falling to each class interval (20–30 to ≥100 bp) were grouped. Number of palindromes in each class was converted to percent values to compare the length distribution between Diptera and Lepidoptera. These percent values were plotted in graph against palindrome length class intervals. In Diptera, 38 of 50 CRs had palindromes whereas, 51 of 53 CRs analysed of Lepidoptera had palindromes.</p>
