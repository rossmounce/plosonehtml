                Figure 5. Distribution of number of palindromes per CR, plotted against AT content of CR (%). Majority of CRs with less than 85 percent AT content had no palindromes but most of the CRs with AT percent &gt;85 possessed palindromes. Trend is that as the AT content increased, occurrence of palindromes in CRs also increased. Number of CRs analysed was 393.
