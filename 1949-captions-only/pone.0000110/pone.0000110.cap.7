                Figure 7. Illustration of origin of replication of vertebrate (heavy strand, OH; light strand, OL) and insect (minor strand, ON; major strand, OJ) mtDNA. In vertebrates, the synthesis of L-strand is initiated from the OL, only when the synthesis of H-strand reaches OL, which is located about two third of the distance from OH. In insects, the replication origin for major strand (OJ) is located 97% of the genomic distance away from the replication origin for minor strand (ON), that is, within the CR.
