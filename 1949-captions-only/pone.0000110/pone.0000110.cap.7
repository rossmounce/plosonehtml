In vertebrates, the synthesis of L-strand is initiated from the O<sub>L</sub>, only when the synthesis of H-strand reaches O<sub>L</sub>, which is located about two third of the distance from O<sub>H</sub>. In insects, the replication origin for major strand (O<sub>J</sub>) is located 97% of the genomic distance away from the replication origin for minor strand (O<sub>N</sub>), that is, within the CR.</p>
