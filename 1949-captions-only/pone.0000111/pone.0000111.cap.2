                Figure 2. Effect of an antioxidant on aggregation. A) Comparison between the intensity-weighted size distributions obtained in the absence and in the presence of DTT. B) Time course of light scattered intensity at 90° angle upon addition of DTT to fresh protein samples. GST, GST-Q22 and GST-Q41 are shown using black, red and green lines, respectively. The measurements shown were carried out at 20°C using 20 µM samples.
