                Figure 3. Effect of temperature on aggregation. A) Light scattered intensity at 90Â° angle registered during the temperature scan. Data relative to different proteins are normalized by dividing for the respective initial values of scattered intensity. B) Weight-average radius of the largest species, as obtained by CONTIN analysis [38], followed during the temperature scan.
