                Figure 4. Analysis of the species size during the temperature scan. A) Contour plots of intensity-weighted size distribution during the temperature scan. B) Size ratio of large to small species, R2/R1, plotted versus the ratio of their relative light scattering contribution, A2/A1 during the temperature scan. The corresponding temperatures are indicated. C) Weight-averaged radius of the largest species, as obtained by CONTIN analysis [38], in the course of temperature scan.
