The signal changes, monitored at 222 nm, arise from both protein aggregation and the associated conformational transition. The curves were normalized to the intensity of GST for comparison purposes. Protein concentration was 4 µM in all samples. <strong>B)</strong> Contour plots of intensity-weighted size distribution of samples quenched at 37°C. <strong>C)</strong> Time course of light scattered intensity at 90° angle of samples quenched at 37°C.</p>
