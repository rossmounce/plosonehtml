(A) Karyotypic variation involving the X and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome as a consequence of the X-4 fusion. Frequency of the X-4 fusion determines the relative prevalence of each karyotype. Female karyotypes are expected to occur according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on a single locus with two alleles, and male karyotypes occur in proportion to the frequencies of the two arrangements of the X. (B) Idealized arrangement of Chromosome 4 during meiosis in a heterokaryotypic female having both X chromosome arrangements. Positions of the loci used in the analyses are indicated relative to the euchromatic subdivisions of Chromosome 4. Sequenced regions are underlined. An inversion of the X chromosome (<em>In(X)c</em>) discriminates the two lines used in the linkage analysis, and a box demarcates its approximate position.</p>
