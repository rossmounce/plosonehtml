                Figure 2.  Nucleotide diversity on unfused Chromosome 4.(A) Average pairwise silent diversity across populations. Samples are arranged with FP, which has the lowest frequency of the X-4 fusion, on the left and SB, which has the highest observed frequency of the X-4 fusion, on the right. No significant heterogeneity is evident among populations. (B) Pattern of sequence diversity along Chromosome 4. Loci are arranged with the centromere to the left and telomere to the right. Average pairwise silent diversity for each sample is plotted to show heterogeneity among loci and the lack of an overall pattern relative to the centromere. (C) Standardized diversity in northern populations. Total pairwise diversity in each northern sample relative to FP is plotted for each locus. A significant relationship between chromosomal position and relative diversity is indicated by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs = −0.78, 95% CI: −0.94, −0.40).
