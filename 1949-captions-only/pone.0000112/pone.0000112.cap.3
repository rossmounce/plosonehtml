                Figure 3.  Relationship between mean standardized diversity in northern populations and recombination with the centromere.Filled circles represent mean standardized diversity within the three northern samples (mean HI, IR, SB/FP) plotted in relation to estimated linkage with the centromere on a log scale. A significant (p&lt;0.01) linear relationship is described by the plotted line, y = 0.692âˆ’0.271x, fitted on the log transformed recombinant fraction (R). For comparison, unfilled circles are plotted for mean diversity within the three northern samples standardized using a different southern sample [LP from ref. 24].
