A significant (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) linear relationship is described by the plotted line, <em>y</em> = 0.692âˆ’0.271<em>x</em>, fitted on the <em>log</em> transformed recombinant fraction (<em>R</em>). For comparison, unfilled circles are plotted for mean diversity within the three northern samples standardized using a different southern sample [LP from ref. 24].</p>
