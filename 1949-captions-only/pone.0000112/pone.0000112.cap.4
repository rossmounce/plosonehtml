                Figure 4.  Sexually antagonistic alleles on Chromosome 4.Equilibrium frequencies of a sexually antagonistic allele (A2) on the unfused arrangement are plotted for populations segregating the X-4 fusion arrangement. Loci representing a variety of different linkage relationships (R) with the centromere are illustrated. Frequency of the X-4 fusion was held constant in the simulations. Results are shown for a completely dominant antagonistic allele with a selection coefficient of 0.001 and fitness effects of opposite sign between males and females. The antagonistic allele increases male fitness and decreases female fitness.
