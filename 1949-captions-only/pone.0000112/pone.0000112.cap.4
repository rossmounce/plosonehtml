Loci representing a variety of different linkage relationships (<em>R</em>) with the centromere are illustrated. Frequency of the X-4 fusion was held constant in the simulations. Results are shown for a completely dominant antagonistic allele with a selection coefficient of 0.001 and fitness effects of opposite sign between males and females. The antagonistic allele increases male fitness and decreases female fitness.</p>
