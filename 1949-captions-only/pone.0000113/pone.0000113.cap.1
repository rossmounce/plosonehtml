The proportion of matching protein pairs, in which both proteins have or lack a signal peptide, was calculated for each pair of organisms (gray columns). For comparison, the expected proportions (black columns), is calculated under the assumption that signal peptide is not conserved between homologs, using the prevalence of proteins having signal peptides in each organism.</p>
