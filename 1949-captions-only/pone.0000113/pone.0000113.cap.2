                Figure 2.  Alignment independence of the Fhom Estimator.
                  HomoloGene homologous protein pairs were divided into five groups according to the identity level of their alignment. The organisms used are human, mouse, fruit fly and C. elegans. The figure reveals that the fraction of homologs estimation (Fhom) is applicable for both closely-related and distantly-related protein pairs.
