                Figure 3.  Robustness of the Fhom Estimator.
                  
                     Fhom was estimated to be 94% for HomoloGene human/mouse pairs. Next, random protein pairs were added according to the original signal peptide prevalence of these organisms. A linear regression curve and the coefficient of determination (R2) confirm that the Fhom Estimator has a wide dynamic range, and is robust to variation in signal-to-noise ratio.
