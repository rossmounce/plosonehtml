                     <em>Fhom</em> was estimated to be 94% for HomoloGene human/mouse pairs. Next, random protein pairs were added according to the original signal peptide prevalence of these organisms. A linear regression curve and the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) confirm that the <em>Fhom Estimator</em> has a wide dynamic range, and is robust to variation in signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
