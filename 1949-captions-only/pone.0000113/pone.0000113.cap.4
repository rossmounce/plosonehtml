Both alignment sets were used separately for the sample size simulation. Each set of pairs was divided into the observed subgroups. The proportions of the observed subgroups were used for simulating observed distributions of 9 different sample sizes ranging from 10,000 to 75. Each simulation was repeated 1000 times, and the average <em>Fhom, Fhom</em> standard deviation, and the average size of the scaling subgroup were taken. The power regression curves of the 52% homologs (lower left curve) and the 10% homologs (upper right curve) describe the correlation between the mean size of the scaling subgroup and the standard deviation of <em>Fhom</em>, with high coefficients of determination.</p>
