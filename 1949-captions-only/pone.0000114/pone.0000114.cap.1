A summary of toxicology and drug abuse history for each case in the clustering dendrogram indicated cocaine use in a majority of cases, while presence of alcohol in Group I, and opioids and phencyclidine in Group II might underlie differences in Group I and II individuals. Group III cases differed markedly from other cases, which may be related to the absence or low levels of abused drug in most cases, a history of alcohol dependence, or to underlying medical conditions. Insufficient specimen for quantitative analysis of a positive hair test screening is indicated by a parenthesis around the substance name, units are ng/mg, except for cTHC (pg/mg). Abbreviations: 6AM – 6-acetyl morphine, AEME – anhydroecgonine methyl ester, BE - benzoylecgonine, CE – cocaethylene, COC – cocaine, COD - codeine, cTHC – 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol, EEE – ecgonine ethyl ester, EME – ecgonine methyl ester, EtOH – alcohol, g% - g/dL, MDMA – N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (Ecstasy), MOR – morphine, MTD – methadone, N/A – not available, OXYC – oxycodone, PCP – phencyclidine, THC – delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.</p>
