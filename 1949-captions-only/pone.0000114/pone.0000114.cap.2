                     <em>A.</em> Eighty-nine transcripts were regulated in all three groups defined by global expression profiles. All of these were regulated in the same direction (increased or decreased) for Group I (DA1–18) and Group II (DA19–34), and in the opposite direction for Group III (DA35–42) cases. In all, 201/202 transcripts shared between Group I and Group II were regulated in the same direction. For Group III, 91/115 transcripts shared with Group I and 79/81 transcripts shared with Group II were regulated in the opposite direction. These data highlight the similarities of Group I and Group II, and the marked differences in Group III cases. Each cluster of three arrows indicates the direction of change in Groups I, II and III, respectively. Increased expression is indicated by ↑, a decrease by ↓, while → indicates no significant change. <em>B.</em> Cases with a drug abuse history and positive cocaine, phencyclidine or cannabinoid toxicology in blood, brain or urine were grouped into COC+, PCP+ and THC+ groups, respectively. While there were significant transcriptional differences between these groups, a total of 160 transcripts (≈2% of all transcripts) were shared for the three groups. Note that a much smaller number of transcripts were identified for the THC+ group (264 increased, 424 decreased) than for the COC+ (982 increased, 699 decreased) and PCP+ (911 increased, 1021 decreased) groups. Increased expression is indicated by ↑, decreased expression by ↓.</p>
