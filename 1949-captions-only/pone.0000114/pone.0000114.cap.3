Numbers on the x-axis represents either the microarray-derived fold change (FC, lighter blue, green or orange bars) for each drug abuse case compared to the four best-matched control cases or the QPCR ratio (QPCR, darker blue, green or orange bars), while numbers on the y-axis represent the drug abuse case examined. QPCR validated 32/38 (84%) of the microarray data, which was performed using separate sets of brain dissections and RNA extractions from each drug abuse case and the four individual best-matched controls.</p>
