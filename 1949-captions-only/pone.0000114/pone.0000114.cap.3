                Figure 3.  Validation of microarray data by quantitative PCR (QPCR).Three representatives of consistently changed functional groups (Table 3) were examined by QPCR: calmodulin 2 (CALM2, blue bars), apolipoprotein 2 (APOL2, green bars), and semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B, orange bars). Numbers on the x-axis represents either the microarray-derived fold change (FC, lighter blue, green or orange bars) for each drug abuse case compared to the four best-matched control cases or the QPCR ratio (QPCR, darker blue, green or orange bars), while numbers on the y-axis represent the drug abuse case examined. QPCR validated 32/38 (84%) of the microarray data, which was performed using separate sets of brain dissections and RNA extractions from each drug abuse case and the four individual best-matched controls.
