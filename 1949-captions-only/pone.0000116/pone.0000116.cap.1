                Figure 1.  Analysis of miRNA binding sites in VEGF.(A) The map of miRNA binding sites in the VEGF 3′-UTR in accordance with Table S1. Three bioinformatics algorithms, RNAhybrid, miRanda, and FindTar, were used to predict miRNA binding sites in the VEGF 3′-UTR. A binding site map of the VEGF 3′-UTR was generated with the putative binding sites predicted by at least two bioinformatics algorithms. Subsequently, two miRNA binding site-condense regions (MBSCR) were uncovered, that is, 160–195nt and 820–860nt MBSCR. (B) A common miRNA binding site located in 160–185nt shared by 12 miRNAs. (C) The miRNAs that share this common miRNA binding site belong to four different miRNA clusters. (D) The seed region of this common miRNA binding site is highly conserved among mammals. (E) RNAcofold was used to analyze the secondary structure of the common miRNA binding site and its flank regions in the VEGF 3′-UTR. The common binding site is located in an unstable region with a multi-branching loop-like RNA structure.
