                Figure 2.  VEGF and miRNA expression in CNE cells.Cell lysate and culture medium from DFOM-induced CNE cells were collected. RT-PCR (A) and ELISA (B) assays were performed to determine VEGF expression at the mRNA and protein levels. CNE cells without DFOM treatment were used as a control. The mirVanaâ„¢ miRNA Detection procedure was used to validate miRNA chip data. miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a, and miR-20b were down-regulated in hypoxia induced CNE cells (C). I: induced, N: non-induced.
