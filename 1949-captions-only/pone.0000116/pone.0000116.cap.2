RT-PCR (A) and ELISA (B) assays were performed to determine VEGF expression at the mRNA and protein levels. CNE cells without DFOM treatment were used as a control. The <em>mir</em>Vanaâ„¢ miRNA Detection procedure was used to validate miRNA chip data. <em>miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a</em>, and <em>miR-20b</em> were down-regulated in hypoxia induced CNE cells (C). I: induced, N: non-induced.</p>
