The effect of <em>miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a</em>, and <em>miR-20b</em> on VEGF expression was tested in CNE cells by transfection of the cells with siRNA duplexes homologous in sequence to the miRNAs. ELISA was used to detect VEGF expression levels. The controls consist of one positive control: VEGF-siRNA (PC), and four negative controls: <em>miR-224</em>, mutated <em>miR-16</em>, and <em>miR-20a</em> (<em>miR-16M, miR-20aM</em>), and a random sequence (NC). (B) Transfection of miRNA inhibitors in hypoxia non-induced CNE cells. CNE cells were transfected with inhibitors of<em> miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a</em>, and <em>miR-20b</em>. siRNA against VEGF was used as positive control. ELISA was used to detect the change in VEGF expression levels after endogenous <em>miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a</em>, and <em>miR-20b</em> were inhibited. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.
