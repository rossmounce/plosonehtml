                Figure 3.  Validation of the repressive effect of putative miRNA regulators on VEGF expression in CNE cells.(A) Transient overexpression of miRNAs in hypoxia-induced CNE cells. The effect of miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a, and miR-20b on VEGF expression was tested in CNE cells by transfection of the cells with siRNA duplexes homologous in sequence to the miRNAs. ELISA was used to detect VEGF expression levels. The controls consist of one positive control: VEGF-siRNA (PC), and four negative controls: miR-224, mutated miR-16, and miR-20a (miR-16M, miR-20aM), and a random sequence (NC). (B) Transfection of miRNA inhibitors in hypoxia non-induced CNE cells. CNE cells were transfected with inhibitors of miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a, and miR-20b. siRNA against VEGF was used as positive control. ELISA was used to detect the change in VEGF expression levels after endogenous miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a, and miR-20b were inhibited. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01. NC: negative control; PC: positive control.
