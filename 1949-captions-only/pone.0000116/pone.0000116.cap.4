COS-7 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector and an miRNA which has a putative binding site in either Construct I (A) or Construct II (B). Luciferase activity was measured to determine the effects of these miRNAs on luciferase translation. In addition to a random sequence (NC), <em>miR-29, miR-150</em>, and <em>miR-383</em> which have putative binding sites in the 3′-UTR of VEGF but not on Construct I or II, as predicted by all of the algorithms, were employed as negative controls. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.</p>
