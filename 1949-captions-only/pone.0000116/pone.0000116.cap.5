An unrelated random sequence was used as a negative control (NC). A specific sequence targeting VEGF (functioning as siRNA) was used as a positive control (PC). Culture medium was collected 30h after transfection. Repression of VEGF expression was detected by ELISA. (B) miRNA binding site locations of <em>miR-378, miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d</em>, and <em>miR-373</em> in the VEGF 3â€²-UTR fragment of Construct II. (C) COS-7 cells were co-transfected with (1) Construct II and <em>miR-378, miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d</em>, or <em>miR-373</em>; (2) Construct II and <em>miR-378</em> plus either <em>miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d</em>, or <em>miR-373</em>. Luciferase activity was measured to investigate the effects of different combinations of miRNAs. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.</p>
