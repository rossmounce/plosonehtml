                Figure 5.  Effects of different combinations of miRNAs on VEGF expression.(A) CNE cells were transfected or co-transfected with miR-20a and miR-106b, which share the same binding site, or with miR-20a and miR-361, which target different binding sites. An unrelated random sequence was used as a negative control (NC). A specific sequence targeting VEGF (functioning as siRNA) was used as a positive control (PC). Culture medium was collected 30h after transfection. Repression of VEGF expression was detected by ELISA. (B) miRNA binding site locations of miR-378, miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d, and miR-373 in the VEGF 3â€²-UTR fragment of Construct II. (C) COS-7 cells were co-transfected with (1) Construct II and miR-378, miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d, or miR-373; (2) Construct II and miR-378 plus either miR-125a, miR-93, miR-302d, or miR-373. Luciferase activity was measured to investigate the effects of different combinations of miRNAs. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.
