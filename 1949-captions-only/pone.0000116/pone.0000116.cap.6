                Figure 6.  Co-regulation of miRNAs to angiogenic factors.CNE cells were induced with or without DFOM (6–1), transfected with miR-15b, miR-16, miR-20a, or miR-20b (6–2) and transfected with Construct I or Construct II (6–3). Cell lysate was collected, and the expression of angiogenic factors uPAR (A), COX2 (B), c-MET (C), and PTN (D) were determined by Western Blotting.
