                Figure 1. Schematic of the Experimental Setup Two pairs of fry – one in each compartment ‘A’ – were placed on either side of the visual stimulus tank (B). During trials with visual stimuli, the opaque dividers (thick black lines) were removed, and fry could see either a single large cichlid – in PV and PCV trials – or two adult conspecifics – in CV and CCV trials. In trials involving chemical stimuli, stimulus water was dripped into one end of the fry tanks (represented by the black point).
