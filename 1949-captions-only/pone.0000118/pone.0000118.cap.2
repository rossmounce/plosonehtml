The mean distance between fry during the acclimatization period (A) was intermediate between the mean inter-fry distances during conspecific and predator stimuli trials. Bars and whiskers represent the meanÂ±SE. Means with different letters above them are significantly different (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05).</p>
