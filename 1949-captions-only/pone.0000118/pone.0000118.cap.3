                Figure 3. Comparisons of Mean Distances from Visual Stimuli This figure shows that fry (1) stayed further away from predators than they did from adult conspecifics, and (2) were most attracted to adult conspecifics when they could see and smell them (in conspecific chemical visual trials (CCV)). Bars and whiskers represent the meanÂ±SE. Means with different letters above them are significantly different (p&lt;0.05; asterisk: p&lt;0.01).
