                Figure 5. Images of neural stem cells in differentiation assays. a–d) Differentiating adult mouse neural stem cells cultured for 7 days in vitro on (a) 1% Matrigel, (b) RADA16 peptide scaffold; (c) RADA16-BMHP1 and (d) RADA16-BMHP2, 1% peptide scaffolds were examined with staining assays for DAPI (cell nuclei in blue), β-Tubulin+ (neurons in red), and Nestin+ (neural progenitors in green). β-Tubulin+ cells on BMHP1 and BMHP2 showed increased branching in comparison with RADA16 scaffold. These appearances are comparable with neurons on Matrigel coated wells. Nestin+ and β-Tubulin+ signals show negligible cross-reaction (MERGE images).
