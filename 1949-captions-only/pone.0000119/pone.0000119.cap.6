The adult mouse neural stem cells were stained with various markers 7 days after culturing on Matrigel (positive control), RADA16, RADA16-BMHP1 and RADA16-BMHP2 peptide scaffolds. Values are expressed as averages±STD. a) % Nestin<sup>+</sup> progenitor cell was reduced on the cultures of Matrigel, RADA16-BMHP1 and RADA16-BMHP2 peptide scaffolds, suggesting cell differentiation. b) % β-Tubulin<sup>+</sup> cell was similar for Matrigel culture, RADA16-BMHP1 and RADA16-BMHP2 peptide scaffolds, suggesting neuronal differentiation. c) % GFAP<sup>+</sup> cell was slightly higher in Matrigel culture, RADA16-BMHP1 and RADA16-BMHP2 peptide scaffolds, suggesting the ability of glial cells to adapt to a wide range of substrates.</p>
