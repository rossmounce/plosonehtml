                     <strong>(A) Schematic drawing comparing the molecular architecture of human MEGF10 and CED-1.</strong> MEGF10 and CED-1 share a highly similar structural pattern. Structural predictions are based on sequence analysis by the Geneworks software and on the SMART website (<a href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/show_motifs.pl">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/sh​ow_motifs.pl</a>). The cysteine-rich domains in both proteins were analyzed in term of sequential conservation of EGF-like domains, either 6-Cys EGF-like domains (white pentagons) or laminin-type EGF-like domains (gray pentagons). The Emilin domains <a href="#pone.0000120-Callebaut1">[20]</a> (EMI rectangles), the predicted transmembrane segments (white rectangles) and the NPxY motif (black crosses) implicated in the molecular interactions with GULP/CED-6, are also indicated. For comparison a schematic illustration of the predicted structure of LRP-1 is shown; low density lipoprotein receptor domains are indicated by hexagons, in brackets is indicated the number of repetitions. <strong>(B) MEGF10 expression pattern.</strong> Northern blot analysis of MEGF10 transcript (M10: 7.3 Kb) in RNA samples prepared from adult mouse tissues (H: Heart, A: Adrenals, K: Kidney, Li: Liver, B: Brain, U: Uterus, Lu: Lung), whole mouse embryos (Embryonic day 7, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15) and a panel of cell lines (Neuro 2a – mouse neuroblastoma, HepG2 – human hepatoma, P388D1, Raw 264.7 and U937 – mouse and human macrophages respectively). Membranes were simultaneously hybridized with an actin probe as a quantitation control.</p>
