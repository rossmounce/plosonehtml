                Figure 3.  ABCA1 and MEGF10 cooperation during engulfment.
                     (A) Positive cooperation between engulfment receptors. Phagocytosis assays were performed on HeLa cells transfected with the indicated molecules. Phagocytic Indexes (PI)±SEM, and number of independent experiments (n) are as follows : Mock: Mock transfected cells PI = 0.46±0.06, n = 11, CD36 PI = 2.83±0.19, n = 6, LRP: LRP1 PI = 1.75±0.06, n = 4, A1: ABCA1 PI = 2.87±0.11, n = 13, M10: MEGF10 PI = 3.15±0.12, n = 11, A1+M10: ABCA1+MEGF10 PI = 4.00±0.14, n = 11, M10+CD36: MEGF10+CD36 PI = 4.22±0.04, n = 3, A1+CD36: ABCA1+CD36 PI = 3.16±0.30, n = 6, A1+LRP: ABCA1+LRP1 PI = 2.82±0.14, n = 2. Coexpressions of receptors were performed by transfection of equal quantities of plasmid cDNA of each species. ECFP or EYFP fusion proteins were used and visualized by confocal microscopy. (B) The inactive ABCA1MM mutant hampers the ability of MEGF10 to promote engulfment. Coexpression of MEGF10 and ABCA1MM (A1MM+M10) reverts the phagocytic index to background levels. The reversion is specific since the coexpression of MEGF10 with ABCA7 (A7) or its inactive mutant (A7MM) is devoid of significant effect on the phagocytic index. Phagocytosis assays were performed on HeLa cells transfected with the indicated molecules. A1MM+M10: ABCA1MM+MEGF10 PI = 1.09±0.10, n = 7, A1MM: ABCA1MM PI = 0.71±0.05, n = 13, A7: ABCA7 PI = 2.90±0.26, n = 7, A7+M10: ABCA7+MEGF10 PI = 3.57±0.37, n = 5, A7MM+M10: ABCA7MM+MEGF10 PI = 2.28±0.27, n = 7, A7MM: ABCA7MM PI = 1.1±0.15, n = 5. ECFP or EYFP fusion proteins were used and visualized by confocal microscopy. (C) ABCA1MM does not affect the trafficking of MEGF10 to the cell surface. Western blot of lysates from cells expressing MEGF10 and ABCA1 or its inactive mutant ABCA1MM were probed with an anti-GFP antibody (upper panel) and compared to blots of biotinylated proteins (lower panel). Mock transfected cells are compared to cells transfected with ABCA1 EYFP (A1), ABCA1MM EYFP (A1MM), MEGF10 ECFP (M10), or the indicated combinations. (D) Molecular competition between wild type and mutant transporter underlies the ABCA1MM effect. ABCA1MM expression levels titrate the ABCA1/MEGF10 cooperation during engulfment. Various ratios of ABCA1/ABCA1MM cDNA (5/0; 4/1; 2.5/2.5; 1/4 and 0/5 from the left to the right) were cotransfected with fixed amounts of MEGF10 and phagocytic assays performed on transfected cells. The phagocytic index is expressed as average of 3 independent experiments±SEM. Values are from the left to the right: MEGF10: 2.81±0.10; 3.99±0.31; 3.03±0.16; 2.00±0.26; 1.02±0.09; 0.89±0.09.
