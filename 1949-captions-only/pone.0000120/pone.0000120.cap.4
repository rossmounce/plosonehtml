                     <strong>(A) MEGF10 and ABCA1 distribute differentially during engulfment.</strong> X-Y confocal sections of transfected HeLa cells evidence that during the engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes (7-AAD in pseudo color blue) MEGF10 (M10: MEGF10 ECFP in green) is recruited at the bottom of the forming phagocytic cup (arrows) while ABCA1 stays at its edges (A1: ABCA1 EYFP in red). X-Z sections of the regions highlighted by the red line confirm the spatial distribution of MEGF10 in the core of the phagocytic cup. <strong>(B) Molecular proximity between ABCA1 and MEGF10 assessed by FRET.</strong> Imaging FRET analysis of cells expressing simultaneously ABCA1 EYFP and MEGF10 ECFP indicates that the C terminal tailpieces lie at a distance of &lt;100 Å. Transfer efficiency is insensitive to acceptor intensity (YFP RFI – left panel) but sensitive to acceptor: donor ratios (right panel). <strong>(C) MEGF10 hampers the oligomerization of ABCA1.</strong> Native PAGE profile of lysates of HeLa cells transfected with equivalent amounts of MEGF10 and either ABCA1 (A1 upper panel) or its mutant ABCA1MM (MM lower panel). The immunodetection with anti-GFP and anti-ABCA1 antibodies reveals no evidence of comigration of the two proteins in a single complex in the case of transfection with the wild type functional transporter. However the presence of MEGF10 greatly destabilises the pattern of oligomerization linked to the expression of ABCA1MM. <strong>(D) Titration of the transdominant negative effect of ABCA1MM on MEGF10.</strong> Cells were transfected with various ratios of ABCA1MM and MEGF10 as shown by the SDS-PAGE pattern (lower panel) and analyzed by phagocytic assays and native PAGE (not shown). Increased ratios of MEGF10 over ABCA1MM lead to increased destabilization of ABCA1MM complexes (not shown) and rescue of phagocytic competence. Phagocytic indexes (averaged from 3 independent experiments)±SEM are from the left to the right: 0.66±0.16, 1.04±0.11, 1.23±0.27, 1.75±0.02, 2.47±0.19, 2.82±0.13, 3.14±0.30.</p>
