A–C Third instar leg imaginal disc. B Lbe expression can be seen in subsets of Twi myoblasts, associated with regions of the leg disc that develop into different segments of the adult leg. Arrows in B, E show a group of myoblasts that give rise to dorsal femur muscle, tilm. The arrowheads in B, E point to precursors of ventral femur muscle, tidm. D–F″ 0 hr APF leg imaginal disc. Myoblasts are regionalised at this stage and are seen at future muscle-forming sites in adult tibia tadm, talm, femur tidm, tilm, trocanter Tr, coxa Co. Lbe is expressed in almost all Twist myoblast subsets at specific sites along the proximal-distal axis in the leg disc proper. Most proximal cells including the dorsal proximal myoblasts asterisks in C, F are devoid of Lbe expression. F′, F″ Two different views of a 3D reconstruction see also <a href="#pone.0000122.s003">Video 1S</a> of the disc presented in F showing spatial distribution of different groups of leg myoblasts. G The schematic of F showing positions of Lbe-positive myoblasts within the leg segments. Lbe is also expressed in leg disc epithelium in the ventral region black asterisks in B, E and the long tendon yellow arrow in E.
