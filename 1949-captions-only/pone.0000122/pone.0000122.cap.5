A–C Wild type leg disc stained for Lbe and Vestigial Vg. Lbe positive myoblasts are seen in leg disc proper B and green in merge C, while the myoblasts associated with the dorsal proximal region corresponding to the ventral thorax express Vg A and red in merge C. Vg myoblasts are devoid of Lbe asterisk in B. A Yellow arrowhead shows myoblasts expressing high levels of Vg and white arrowhead those expressing Vg at lower levels. D–F Leg disc, in which a dominant-negative TCF has been expressed in the myoblasts. Myoblasts are present as shown by anti-Twist antibody staining D and blue in merge F, but Lbe expression in myoblasts is lost asterisks in E and green in F. G–I Leg disc, in which activated Armadillo Arm transgene has been expressed in the myoblasts. Lbe is ectopically expressed in dorsal proximal myoblasts arrow in H and green in merge I, normally devoid of Lbe. Myoblasts are visualised with anti-Twi antibody G and blue in I. J–J′ show adult muscle phenotypes in the femur region induced by 1151-Gal4-driven forced expression of a dominant-negative TCF. Ventral muscles tidm are partially lost asterisks in J or completely lost asterisks in J′ and dorsal muscles tilm are severely affected. Muscles are visualised using MHC-tauGFP. Anterior views from the 3D reconstructions of confocal scans. K A schematic showing position of Lbe-expressing dorsal tilm and ventral tidm precursors of femur muscles green areas with respect to epithelial Wg expression domain violet triangle. The dorsal tilm myoblasts, located comparatively far from the Wg domain, receive a lower level of Wg morphogen long thin arrow than ventrally located tidm myoblasts short thick arrow.</p>
