C, D Notum part of third instar wing imaginal discs stained for Vg green and for Cut red. In the wild type A, C Vg is expressed in a subset of leg disc myoblasts associated with the dorsal proximal region and in wing disc myoblasts known to give rise to thoracic flight muscles. In discs ectopically expressing Lbe in all myoblasts Vg is repressed asterisks in B and D. E, F Indirect flight muscles IFMs in the adult thorax viewed under polarised light. In the wild type hemithorax E, there are six DLMs and three sets of DVMs out of focus. F Ectopic expression of Lbe in myoblasts leads to disruption of IFMs; DLMs are lost asterisks while DVMs are severely reduced arrow.</p>
