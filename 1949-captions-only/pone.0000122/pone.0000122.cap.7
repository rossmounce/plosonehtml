A–D A third instar leg disc showing coexpression of FGF receptor Heartless and the downstream target of Htl signalling, Dof in Lbe-positive myoblasts see outlined area and myoblasts indicated by arrows. E–L Progressive activation of Duf expression in Lbe myoblasts with active FGF signalling. In third instar leg discs E–H Duf is co-expressed with Lbe and Dof in dorsal femur myoblasts outlined area but not present in the ventral myoblasts arrows. At 3 hr-APF I–L in addition to dorsal myoblasts outlined area Duf is progressively activated in ventral Lbe- and Dof-positive leg myoblasts within the femur, tibia arrows in J and coxa yellow arrow in J segments. All leg disc myoblasts showing Lbe expression have active FGF signalling, shown by expression of Dof D, H, L. Arrowhead in L points to Lbe expressing long tendon.</p>
