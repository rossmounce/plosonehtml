                Figure 4. Validation of the major QTLs for partial resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 with heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs). A HIF 102 segregates around MSAT2-38 and HIF 200 segregates for a region of chromosome II around markers MSAT2-5 and MSAT2-38. HIF 214 segregates for a region of chromosome V around MSAT5-14 and NGA139 and HIF 400 segregates around MSAT5-14, NGA139 and MSAT5-22. Regions for which the HIFs segregate are indicated in hatched boxes and the white regions of the chromosomes represent a mix of both parental genomes Bay-0 and Shahdara. B and C 
                     In planta bacterial growth in HIFs fixed for the Bay (grey bar) or Sha (black bar) allele of PRP-Ps1 (B) or PRP-Ps2 (C). Each value is the average of measurement of in planta bacterial growth in at least 8 plants (means and standard errors) from one experiment. Three independent experiments were performed and showed similar results. Asterisks show significant difference in partial resistance (P&lt;0.05).
