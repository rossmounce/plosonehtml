HIF 214 segregates for a region of chromosome V around MSAT5-14 and NGA139 and HIF 400 segregates around MSAT5-14, NGA139 and MSAT5-22. Regions for which the HIFs segregate are indicated in hatched boxes and the white regions of the chromosomes represent a mix of both parental genomes Bay-0 and Shahdara. <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> 
                     <em>In planta</em> bacterial growth in HIFs fixed for the Bay (grey bar) or Sha (black bar) allele of <em>PRP-Ps1</em> (<strong>B</strong>) or <em>PRP-Ps2</em> (<strong>C</strong>). Each value is the average of measurement of <em>in planta</em> bacterial growth in at least 8 plants (means and standard errors) from one experiment. Three independent experiments were performed and showed similar results. Asterisks show significant difference in partial resistance (P&lt;0.05).</p>
