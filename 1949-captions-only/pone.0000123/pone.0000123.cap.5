                Figure 5. Expression analysis of the defense marker genes PR1 (A), ICS (B) and PR5 (C) in HIFs and parental accessions. The transcript levels were determined by Q-RT-PCR with cDNA generated from leaves before (grey) and after (black) inoculation with Pst DC3000 at 5.105 cfu/mL. The expression value of the individual genes was normalized by using the expression level of Î²-Tubulin4 as an internal standard. Mean mRNA levels of three plants are shown with corresponding standard errors. Similar results were obtained from two biological experiments.
