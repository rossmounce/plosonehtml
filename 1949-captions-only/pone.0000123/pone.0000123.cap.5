The transcript levels were determined by Q-RT-PCR with cDNA generated from leaves before (grey) and after (black) inoculation with <em>Pst</em> DC3000 at 5.10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL. The expression value of the individual genes was normalized by using the expression level of <em>Î²-Tubulin4</em> as an internal standard. Mean mRNA levels of three plants are shown with corresponding standard errors. Similar results were obtained from two biological experiments.</p>
