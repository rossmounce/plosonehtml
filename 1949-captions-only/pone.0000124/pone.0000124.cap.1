                Figure 1.  IL-7 levels in cell culture medium and serum.IL-7 levels in cancer patients with/without bone metastases and in healthy controls were analysed by ELISA. At day 5, supernatants of patients' PBMC cultures and monocyte plus T and B cell co-colture had IL-7 levels higher than healthy controls (A). Bone metastatic patients had significantly higher serum levels of IL-7 compared to patients without bone metastasis and healthy controls (B). Samples were assayed in duplicate and data were expressed as mean values.
