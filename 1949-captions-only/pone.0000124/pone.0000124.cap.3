                Figure 3.  Effect of IL-7 on osteoclastogenesis in vitro.
                  TRAP+ multinucleated cells were identified as OCs at the end of culture in both bone metastatic patients (line A) and healthy controls (line B). PBMC cultures were plated and stimulated with IL-7 (0,5–1–2,5–10–15 ng/ml). The osteoclastogenesis significantly increased at 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7 compared to the unstimulated condition (C). The anti-IL-7 antibody added in cell culture determined a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous osteoclastogenesis in bone metastatic patients (D). Multinucleated/TRAP positive cells, derived both from culture with and without IL-7, expressed also αVβ3 
                     (E).
