PBMC cultures were plated and stimulated with IL-7 (0,5–1–2,5–10–15 ng/ml). The osteoclastogenesis significantly increased at 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7 compared to the unstimulated condition <strong>(C)</strong>. The anti-IL-7 antibody added in cell culture determined a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous osteoclastogenesis in bone metastatic patients <strong>(D)</strong>. Multinucleated/TRAP positive cells, derived both from culture with and without IL-7, expressed also α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub>
