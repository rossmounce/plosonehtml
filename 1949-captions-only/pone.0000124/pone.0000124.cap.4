                Figure 4.  IL-7 stimulates osteoclastogenesis in co-coltures of monocytes and T or B cells.The different subpopulations were isolated from PBMCs and co-coltures of monocytes and T or B cells (M+T; M+B) were made. By adding 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7 in co-coltures we observed an increase in osteoclastogenesis, which was statistically significant for T cells (A) and not for B cells (B). At 15 ng/ml of IL-7, there were not significant effects in both the co-coltures.
