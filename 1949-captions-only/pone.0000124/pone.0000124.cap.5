                Figure 5.  IL-7 increases OC bone resorbing activity.PBMC resorption activity with/without IL-7 were showed for bone metastatic patients (line A) and healthy controls (line B). The basal resorbing activity of OCs derived from patients was significantly higher compared to healthy controls, #
                     p≤0,0001 (C). The percentage of resorption area was significantly increased with 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7, both in patients and in healthy controls, *p≤0,002 (C). At 15 ng/ml IL-7 did not elicit a significant variation of resorption area. The data represent the means±SE from ten independent experiments.
