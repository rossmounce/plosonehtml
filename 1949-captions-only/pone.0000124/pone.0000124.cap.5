The basal resorbing activity of OCs derived from patients was significantly higher compared to healthy controls, <sup>#</sup>
                     <em>p</em>≤0,0001 <strong>(C)</strong>. The percentage of resorption area was significantly increased with 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7, both in patients and in healthy controls, *<em>p</em>≤0,002 <strong>(C)</strong>. At 15 ng/ml IL-7 did not elicit a significant variation of resorption area. The data represent the means±SE from ten independent experiments.</p>
