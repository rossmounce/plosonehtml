                Figure 6.  IL-7 up-regulates TNF-α production in cell culture media.PBMC and monocytes plus T or B cells were cultured in absence or presence of IL-7. Supernatants were collected at days 5 and 10 to dose TNF-α. PBMCs showed the same TNF-α basal level, which increased at 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7 and reached the maximum value at 15 ng/ml, (A). Monocytes plus T cells (M+T) (B) and monocytes plus B cells (M+B) (C) had a TNF-α basal level higher at day 10 than at day 5, but both supernatants showed the peak value at 2,5 ng/ml of IL-7, and remained roughly costant at 15 ng/ml. The data were means±SE of 25 supernatants collected at day 5 and 10 for both patients and healthy controls.
