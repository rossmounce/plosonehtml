                Figure 7.  Effect of anti-TNF-α and OPG on IL-7-induced osteoclastogenesis.The addition of both OPG and anti-TNF-α caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-7-induced osteoclastogenesis. The anti-TNF-α antibody caused a strong osteoclastogenesis inhibition, about 90% (A) while OPG caused a 50% inhibition (B).
