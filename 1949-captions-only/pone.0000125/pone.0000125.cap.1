<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a><p>A similar pattern of heterozygote advantage is observed in another closely related member of theTGFβ superfamily <em>GDF9</em> 
            <a href="#pone.0000125-Dong1">[10]</a>. Like <em>BMP15</em>, the autosomal <em>GDF9</em> has an essential role in controlling follicular growth via its influence on granulosa cell function <a href="#pone.0000125-Hanrahan1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000125-Dong1">[10]</a>. An absence of <em>GDF9</em> also blocks follicular growth in homozygotes, resulting in sterility, while inactivation of only one copy of <em>GDF9</em> again increases ovulation rate <a href="#pone.0000125-Hanrahan1">[7]</a>, conferring a fecundity advantage to the heterozygote (<a href="#pone-0000125-t001">Table 1</a>

<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec1.p6"></a><p>Despite being very compelling examples of heterozygote advantage, the overdominant nature of these fertility polymorphisms is not widely recognised. One of the hurdles to these becoming a more widely known example of heterozygote advantage is the absence of data on the equilibrium solution for each of these polymorphisms and knowledge of their frequencies in a natural situation (see supporting text). However, using standard population genetic theory <a href="#pone.0000125-Hedrick1">[11]</a> the equilibrium solution can be readily calculated from data collected over many years on ovulation rates, litter size and lambing rates <a href="#pone.0000125-Davis1">[5]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000125-Hanrahan1">[7]</a>. Here we report the predicted fitness and equilibrium solution for each of these fecundity polymorphisms and show that these are expected to be amongst the most frequent and compelling examples of heterozygote advantage yet described.</p>

<div id="section2" class="section"><a id="s2" name="s2" toc="s2" title="Results and Discussion"></a><h3>Results and Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.p1"></a><p>The equilibrium solution for each fecundity polymorphism was calculated from data collected on ovulation rates, litter size, and lambing rates as described below. For the Inverdale mutation (<em>FecX<sup>I</sup>
            </em>) the estimated relative fitness of ewes (<em>w</em>), based on lambs alive at one day of age, of the homozygote wildtype (<em>++</em>), heterozygote (<em>+/−</em>) and mutant homozygote (<em>−/−</em>) are 0.87, 1 and 0 respectively, leading to a predicted equilibrium frequency for the <em>FecX<sup>I</sup>
            </em> allele (<em>q</em>) of 0.11 (<a href="#pone-0000125-t001">Table 1a</a>). Other mutations in <em>BMP15</em> and <em>GDF9</em> show similar relative fitnesses and equilibrium frequencies for the more limited litter size data (<a href="#pone-0000125-t002">Table 1b</a>), which are collectively amongst the highest yet described for a polymorphism maintained by heterozygote advantage. For comparison, the equilibrium frequency of the recessive sickle cell allele (Hb<sup>S</sup>) rarely exceeds 0.15 <a href="#pone.0000125-Williams1">[12]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2"></a><p>Heterozygote advantage as a concept holds considerable sway in evolutionary biology, but only a handful of examples have withstood close scrutiny (reviewed in <a href="#pone.0000125.s001">Table S1</a>). Of the 21 examples reported that invoke heterozygote advantage as an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism, compelling evidence for heterozygote advantage is lacking in nearly every instance (<a href="#pone.0000125.s001">Table S1</a>). The following information is required to unequivocally demonstrate heterozygote advantage: (i) the gene and mutant alleles under selection must be known; (ii) the relative fitness of each genotype must be known (with heterozygotes exhibiting the greatest relative fitness); (iii) the mechanism of selection must be understood i.e. we need to known why heterozygotes are fitter than homozygotes.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.p3"></a><p>Prior to the discovery of the sheep fecundity genes described here, perhaps only the classic example of heterozygote advantage, sickle cell anaemia, met these requirements. In African and Asian human populations where malaria is prevalent, fatalities in homozygotes for the sickle cell trait (Hb<sup>SS</sup>) are offset by the survival advantage of heterozygotes bearing one copy of the sickle cell allele (Hb<sup>S+</sup>) over the wildtype homozygotes (Hb<sup>++</sup>), when challenged with malaria <a href="#pone.0000125-Allison1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000125-Williams1">[12]</a>. Sickle cell anaemia is an excellent example of heterozygote advantage, but it has two principal shortcomings. First, the advantage to heterozygotes is conditional, only operating where malaria is prevalent <a href="#pone.0000125-Allison1">[1]</a>. Second, the heterozygote advantage arises because of the super-position of two opposite directional selection pressures (malaria and sickle-cell anaemia), so it is not really a true case of heterozygote advantage arising from the heterozygote having superior fitness for a specific trait.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.p4"></a><p>There are numerous other putative examples of heterozygote advantage that evoke contemporary and/or historical resistance to infectious disease to explain the relatively high frequency of otherwise deleterious alleles. Examples include the cystic fibrosis-causing alleles at the <em>CFTR</em> gene, the Gaucher Disease-causing allele at <em>GBA</em>, deafness-causing alleles at <em>GJB2</em> and polymorphism at the major histocompatability locus <em>MHC</em> (<a href="#pone.0000125.s001">Table S1</a>). However, in the majority of these cases genotype fitnesses remain undetermined, and very often the infectious disease driving selection is unknown. This missing information makes it difficult to distinguish between heterozygote advantage and alternative explanations including other forms of balancing selection, such as negative frequency dependence or spatially/temporally variable directional selection <a href="#pone.0000125-Kreitman1">[13]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.p5"></a><p>The fertility polymorphisms documented in <em>BMP15</em> and <em>GDF9</em> represent one of the best examples of heterozygote advantage yet described, with the genetic basis, fitness differentials and the mechanism of selection well understood <a href="#pone.0000125-Davis1">[5]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000125-Hanrahan1">[7]</a>. Crucially, in stark contrast to sickle cell anaemia, no external factor, such as disease <a href="#pone.0000125-Haldane1">[2]</a>, needs to be invoked to understand the fitness differentials among genotypes for these polymorphisms.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.p6"></a><p>There are of course still substantial issues unresolved for these polymorphisms too. Among the most important of these issues is the frequency of the polymorphism in the wild. At equilibrium our theoretical expectation, based on data from domesticated sheep, is that fertility alleles such as <em>FecX<sup>I</sup>
            </em> will occur at a frequency of 0.11–0.23 (<a href="#pone-0000125-t001">Table 1</a>
            <a href="#pone-0000125-t002"></a>). The obvious extension of this work then is to screen wild populations of sheep for these mutations to determine if they are present and if the frequencies match expectations. To date such an investigation has not been undertaken widely. One study of a small population of Soay sheep on the remote Islands of St Kilda found no evidence for any of the <em>BMP15</em> fertility polymorphisms described in <a href="#pone-0000125-t001">Table 1</a>
            <a href="#pone-0000125-t002"></a> (Gratten pers. comm.). However since this is an isolated population, subject to regular population crashes <a href="#pone.0000125-CluttonBrock1">[14]</a>, the absence of polymorphism in <em>BMP15</em> in this population may not be overly surprising and further studies in other wild sheep populations are warranted.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.p7"></a><p>Heterozygote advantage is commonly assumed to slow the rate of loss of genetic diversity by genetic drift. However, Robertson <a href="#pone.0000125-Robertson1">[15]</a> described scenarios where it can accelerate loss of diversity by drift, and provided solutions to the relative rate that heterozygote advantage accelerates or retards loss of diversity for populations of finite size. Extrapolating from <a href="#pone-0000125-t001">Table 1</a>
            <a href="#pone-0000125-t002"></a> of Robertson <a href="#pone.0000125-Robertson1">[15]</a>, and assuming that s<sub>1</sub> = 0.125, s<sub>2</sub> = 0.5 because selection is only in one sex, and q = 0.20, then heterozygote advantage at the loci described here would retard the effects of genetic drift 100-fold in a population with effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) 176 (retardation of loss would be greater in larger populations). In other words, the polymorphism is likely to be maintained in moderate or large sized populations.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.p8"></a><p>It may well transpire that the fertility polymorphisms described here are only relatively common in domesticated sheep as a consequence of selective breeding and that they do not actually confer an appreciable fitness advantage to heterozygotes in the wild, due perhaps to the existence of other genes under stronger selection that are in linkage or have epistatic effects on these fertility polymorphisms. One prominent example of a mutation maintained at high frequency by human mediated selection for the heterozygote is the Halothane mutation in pigs <a href="#pone.0000125-Fujii1">[16]</a>. The Halothane mutation occurs as a result of a missense mutation in a calcium release gene, the ryanodine receptor gene (<em>RYR1</em>), expressed in muscle. Heterozygous carriers show a higher lean content than homozygous wild type individuals, whereas the mutant homozygotes are highly susceptible to malignant hyperthermia <a href="#pone.0000125-Fujii1">[16]</a>. Selection for leanness in domesticated pigs created an overdominant situation maintaining the mutation at high frequency until a DNA based diagnostic became available that enabled the targeted culling of individuals bearing the Halothane mutation <a href="#pone.0000125-Fujii1">[16]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.p9"></a><p>It remains possible that the fertility polymorphisms in <em>BMP15</em> and <em>GDF9</em> are also maintained through selective breeding, but these mutations differ significantly from the Halothane mutation in that the heterozygotes clearly have a natural advantage in terms of fecundity over the wild type, with little demonstrable decrease in other fitness parameters for the heterozygote reported to date <a href="#pone.0000125-Davis1">[5]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000125-Hanrahan1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000125-Davis2">[17]</a>. However, an obvious possibility is that there is a trade off between birthing many lambs and their survival to weaning, particularly when environmental conditions are unfavourable. To explore this further we have examined data on the mean frequency of single and multiple births for carriers of the Inverdale mutation (FecX<sup>I</sup>) and for wildtype Romney sheep <a href="#pone.0000125-Amer1">[18]</a>. We have then estimated the relative fitness of each genotype using data on average survival rates to weaning, for lambs for each birth category, across environmental conditions that range from intensive farming to harsh hill country (<a href="#pone-0000125-t003">Table 2</a>
            <a href="#pone-0000125-t004"></a>) <a href="#pone.0000125-Amer1">[18]</a>. Due to an absence of data on the frequency of different litter sizes under different environmental conditions, we have made the conservative assumption that this is unaffected by environmental conditions.</p>
