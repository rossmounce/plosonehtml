(A) Fluorescent image of cultured chromaffin cells incubated with SFV-<em>egfp</em> or SFV <em>BoNT/C</em>-ires-<em>egfp</em>, and immunostained for syntaxin, showing a reduced syntaxin staining at the plasma membrane after BoNT/C expression. The syntaxin staining after BoNT/C was slightly overexposed to emphasize the persistence of cytosolic staining (as opposed to plasma membrane staining). Scale bars represent 2 Âµm. (B) Examples of amperometric recordings in control and BoNT/C infected chromaffin cells during stimulation with a 30 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution.</p>
