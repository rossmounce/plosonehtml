(A) Representative traces of mEPSC's in whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from control synapses showed frequent spontaneous miniature events, while syntaxin deleted synapses show a strong reduction of spontaneous release. (B) Frequency of spontaneous synaptic events. Numbers indicate meanÂ±SEM for control (n = 5) and BoNT/C infected (n = 4) neurons from N = 2 different animals (***p&lt;0.05, ANOVA and student's t-test). (C) Action potential triggered release is completely blocked by BoNT/C.</p>
