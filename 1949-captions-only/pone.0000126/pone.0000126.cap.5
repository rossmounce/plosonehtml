(A) Immunolocalization of syntaxin (blue) and Munc18-1 (red) in SFV-<em>egfp</em> or <em>BoNT/C</em>-ires-<em>egfp</em> infected chromaffin cells. Scale bars represent 2 µm. (B) Average pixel intensity of Munc18-1 expression obtained from line scans through a confocal section of a BoNT/C and EGFP expressing cell. Inset shows how line scans were made from <strong>a</strong> to <strong>b</strong> (C) Quantification of the Munc18-1 expression at the plasma membrane. Numbers indicate mean±SEM. from n = 22 cells and N = 3 animals (***p&lt;0.01, ANOVA and student's t-test, comparison to control).</p>
