                Figure 6. Deletion of syntaxin does not influence the intactness of the sub-membranous actin cytomatrix. Phalloidin-red staining of wild-type chromaffin cells infected with SFV-egfp, BoNT/C-ires-egfp, or munc18-1-ires-egfp. As a control Phalloidin-red staining of a munc18-1 deficient chromaffin cell expressing EGFP is also shown. Merged pictures are shown in the right column. Scale bars represent 2 Âµm. The data in the lower half of the figures are similar to data published before [24] and are shown here for comparison.
