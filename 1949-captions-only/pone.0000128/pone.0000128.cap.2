(A) Identification of the D-domain in cyclin D1 (Cyc D1). The illustration of full-length human Cyc D1 shows the region of the D-domain (A.A. 179-193) and the MAPK phosphorylation site Thr (T) 286 followed by proline (P) (solid bar and an arrow, respectively). The amino acid sequence of the D-domain within Cyc D1 is aligned with other known MAPK-docking sites of various ERK substrates. The doublet of basic (+) and nonpolar (ϕ) amino acids are conserved residues in the core D-domain motif L/I/V-X-L/I/V. Amino acid positions of the most 5′ residues of the D-domains are indicated with numbers in the left of each amino acid sequence respectively. (B, C) p42 ERK2 <em>in vitro</em> kinase assays for cyclin D1 (upper panels). (B) Wild type or T286A mutant recombinant GST- full length Cyc D1 protein was mixed with <sup>32</sup>P-ATP in the kinase assay reaction buffer in the presence or absence of purified ERK2. Reactions were performed at 30°C for 30 min and stopped by adding sample loading buffer. Samples were separated with SDS-PAGE and <sup>32</sup>P-uptake was detected by autoradiography. Immunoblotting (IB) analysis using antibodies to cyclin D1 is provided as a reference to show substrate amounts. (C) GST alone (lane 1), GST-C-terminal WT Cyc D1 fusion protein retaining the binding site of MAPK (amino acids 165-295, lane 2), T286A (lane 3) and a complete deletion of the D-domain ΔD, lane 4) were used. IB analysis using antibodies to GSTs provided as a reference to show substrate amounts. (D) Immunoprecipitation (IP) and IB analysis following ectopic expression of Flag-tagged ERK2 together with either HA-tagged WT or ΔD Cyc D1 in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. A Western blot for input controls (10% total lysates) is also shown. (E) Western blot analysis with Thr286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 (pCycD1 Thr286) and total Cyc D1 following transfection of various forms of HA-tagged Cyc D1 expression vectors in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. (F, G) <em>In vitro</em> ubiquitination assays using HeLa cell extracts Fraction II as a source of the enzymes necessary to conjugate ubiquitin to substrates and ATP. (F) GST-full length Cyc D1 WT, T286A, or ΔD were used for a reaction either with recombinant ERK2 (lanes 3–5) or without it (lanes 1–2). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a cyclin D1 antibody. ATP was added to all lanes, and no ubiquitin was added to lane 1. (G) GST-full length Cyc D1 WT was used with or without ubiquitin. After SDS-PAGE separation, immunobloting was performed with antibodies to cyclin D1 (lanes 1, 2) or ubiquitin (lanes 3, 4). (H, I) Pulse-chase analysis of cyclin D1 in HCT 116 cells after exposure to U0126. Exponentially growing HCT 116 cells were treated with DMSO or 10 µM U0126 for 30 min. (H) Cells were pulse-labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and were chased for the indicated times. Cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated and then analyzed with SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography was performed. (I) Levels of metabolically labeled-cyclin D1. (J) Western blot analysis with pCycD1 Thr286, total cyclin D1, phosphorylation specific ERK (pERK), and total ERK antibodies. (K) Cell cycle distributions are shown.</p>
