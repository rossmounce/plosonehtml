(A) Viable HCT 116 cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of FBXW8, CUL1, or CUL7 expression. siRNAs were transfected on days 0, 1, 2, and 4. Cells were collected as indicated, stained with trypan blue, and counted with a haemocytometer. (B) Western blot analysis with total and fractionated nuclear proteins. Protein blotting was performed with total cyclin D1 (Cyc D1), pCyc D1 Thr286, CDK1, Histone H1, and MEK1 antibodies. HCT 116 cells were treated with control siRNA (Cont) or FBXW8 siRNA (W8) for 48 hrs. Samples were then fractionated into nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins, or prepared as total cell lysates. The bottom panel shows a CDK1-associated Histone H1 <em>in vitro</em> kinase assay using nuclear protein. (C) Generation of cyclin D1 ecdysone-inducible (IND) system in HCT 116 cells. Ectopic expression of HA-tagged T286A was induced in by 10 µM Ponasterone A (Pon A). (D) Viable cells after T286A cyclin D1 induction. T286A IND HCT 116 cells were cultured in the presence of Pon A (T286A) or its absence, and control (Cont) or FBXW8 siRNA. (E) Colony formation assay. One hundred single T286A IND HCT 116 cells were cultured in the presence of Pon A (+) or its absence (−), and control siRNA (Cont) or FBXW8 siRNA. Cells were cultured for 2 weeks, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet containing 20% ethanol. (F) A model of cyclin D1 ubiquitination mediated by the complex containing FBXW8. FBXW8 recognizes cyclin D1 through a WD40 repeat motif in an ERK/MAPK-mediated Thr286 phosphorylation-dependent manner. SKP1 interacts with FBXW8 together with CUL1 or CUL7 via a domain in the N-terminus of FBXW8, called F-box. CUL1 or CUL7 recruits RBX1, which in turn conscripts E2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to add a multiubiquitin chain to cyclin D1.</p>
