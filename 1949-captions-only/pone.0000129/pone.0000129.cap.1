                Figure 1.  Characterization of the human Treg population.(A) CD4+CD25−, CD4+CD25int and CD4+CD25hi cells were identified as shown. CD4+CD25hi cells are those where CD25 expression was higher than that on the CD4− population. (B) FOXP3 expression within each population was assessed by intracellular staining. (C) Freshly isolated CD4+CD25− T cells (2×104 cells/well) were cultured alone (CD25-/low) or with CD4+CD25hi T cells at various ratios, and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. Proliferation was assessed by (3H)-thymidine incorporation. The results represent the average of triplicate wells with standard deviation, from a representative assay.
