CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells are those where CD25 expression was higher than that on the CD4<sup>−</sup> population. (B) FOXP3 expression within each population was assessed by intracellular staining. (C) Freshly isolated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells (2×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) were cultured alone (CD25-/low) or with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T cells at various ratios, and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. Proliferation was assessed by (<sup>3</sup>H)-thymidine incorporation. The results represent the average of triplicate wells with standard deviation, from a representative assay.</p>
