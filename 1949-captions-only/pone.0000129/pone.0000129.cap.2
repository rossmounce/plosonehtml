Using the gating strategy outlined in <a href="#pone-0000129-g001">Figure 1</a>, Treg were enumerated. (B) Mesenteric lymph node samples (LN) were collected from surgical specimens of 8 CRC and 7 IBD patients and stained and gated as above. The data show the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that were CD25<sup>hi</sup> in each sample. Each symbol represents one patient. The p values were calculated using an unpaired student's <em>t</em>-test.</p>
