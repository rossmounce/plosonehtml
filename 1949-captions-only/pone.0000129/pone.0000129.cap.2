                Figure 2.  CRC patients have increased numbers of Treg cells.(A) Freshly isolated PBMC from 12 CRC patients, 11 healthy age-matched controls and 22 IBD patients were stained with antibodies to CD4 and CD25. Using the gating strategy outlined in Figure 1, Treg were enumerated. (B) Mesenteric lymph node samples (LN) were collected from surgical specimens of 8 CRC and 7 IBD patients and stained and gated as above. The data show the percentage of CD4+ cells that were CD25hi in each sample. Each symbol represents one patient. The p values were calculated using an unpaired student's t-test.
