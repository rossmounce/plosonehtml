                Figure 3.  CRC patients are able to mount CD4+ T cell responses to the recall antigens PPD and HA.Whole PBMC from 11 age-matched controls and 14 CRC patients were assessed for responses to the antigens PPD and HA, measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT. Purified PBMC were added at 3.5×105 cells/well, and incubated for 18 hours in the presence of either 1 µg/ml PPD, 1 µg/ml HA or with no antigen. Wells were set up in duplicate. Fewer than 5 spot forming cells/106 PBMC was considered negative.
