(B) Whole PBMC and CD25<sup>hi</sup>-depleted PBMC from 11 age-matched controls (open bars) and 14 CRC patients (solid bars) were set up in parallel in an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay (3.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) with PPD (top graph), HA (middle graph) or 5T4 (lower graph). The number of responders is shown for each antigen. In each case, the percentage on the left is the frequency of responders that increased after Treg depletion (Increase), the percentage in the middle is the frequency of non-responders that had a response after depletion (New Response) and on the right the frequency of responders that showed a decrease or no change in response after Treg depletion (Decrease/NC). The 95% Confidence Interval for paired differences of proportions between patients and controls is −0.83 to −0.22 revealing a significant difference for 5T4 responses. (C) The 6 CRC patients with responses to 5T4 are shown in more detail. The bars represent the spot-forming cells/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC after subtraction of background spots, whole PBMC (light grey) and CD25<sup>hi</sup>-depleted PBMC (dark grey). Responses were observed only in CD25<sup>hi</sup>-depleted PBMC of patients 1–5, whilst a response was observed in both PBMC populations from patient 6. In all assays, wells were set up in duplicate.</p>
