Regression lines are based on probit/linear and logit/linear relationships respectively. Data points are weighted means from biological replicates±weighted SEM. The LC<sub>50</sub> of phosphine at 20°C for N2 is 732 ppm; and for DMDS is 1.24 ppm. Plates were counted as follows: 0 ppm phosphine and 0 ppm to 1.1 ppm DMDS, immediately after fumigation; 70 ppm phosphine and 1.2 ppm to 1.5 ppm DMDS, after 24 hours recovery; doses above 70 ppm phosphine and 1.5 ppm DMDS, after 48 hours recovery.</p>
