                Figure 4.  Diethyl Maleate Interaction with PhosphineMortality of wild-type (N2) C. elegans when exposed to diethyl maleate and two different doses of phosphine: 0 ppm (▴); and 70 ppm (•); at 20°C for 24 hours. Regressions lines are based on complementary log-log/log relationships, and data points are weighted means from biological replicates±weighted SEM. The LC50 of DEM in the absence of phosphine at 20°C for N2 is 5.98 mM; and with 70 ppm PH3 is 2.9 mM. All plates were counted after 24 hours recovery.
