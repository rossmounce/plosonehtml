Regressions lines are based on complementary log-log/log relationships, and data points are weighted means from biological replicates±weighted SEM. The LC<sub>50</sub> of DEM in the absence of phosphine at 20°C for N2 is 5.98 mM; and with 70 ppm PH<sub>3</sub> is 2.9 mM. All plates were counted after 24 hours recovery.</p>
