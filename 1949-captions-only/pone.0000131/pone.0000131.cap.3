The fraction of binucleated cells (mean, ±SE for approximately 200 cells) was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Expression of RLCE20E21-GFP rescues depletion of Rok, but not Rho1 or Citron. <strong>(B)</strong> Expression of phospho-mimic RLC rescues Rok depletion. S2 cells expressing RLC-GFP chimeras (green) and RFP-α-tubulin (red) were depleted of the Rok by RNAi treatment for five days, and timelapse fluorescence microscopy was used to film cells as they attempted to divide. RLCT20S21-GFP (Row 1) was not recruited to the equatorial cortex at anaphase and the cells did not contract. RLCE20E21-GFP (Row 2) was recruited to the equatorial cortex during mitosis and the cells contracted. The scale bar = 5 µm.</p>
