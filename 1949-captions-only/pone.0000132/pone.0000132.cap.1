                Figure 1.  Apparatus for virtual-prey testing.Spider (not to scale) at top of inclined metal ramp, oriented toward one of two side-by-side virtual mosquitoes. Virtual mosquitoes on small screen (projection screen, see enlarged inset in top right corner) positioned in front of higher end of ramp. Images pass from projector lens (connected to computer; main body of data projector and computer not shown) through second lens (for reducing image size) on to screen. Observer point of view: about 150 degrees from the direct light path from the projector through the projection screen; slightly behind the projection screen at a height of approximately 45 degrees. Inset: virtual mosquitoes in Anopheles resting posture (left) and in non-Anopheles resting posture (right).
