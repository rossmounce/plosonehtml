Upper and lower panels have different color scales and vertical scales. Overlain on an arbitrary scale in the lower panel is the predicted tidal height for the study area <a href="#pone.0000133-Mofjeld1">[44]</a>. The peak-to-peak tidal amplitude is ~2 m. Tidal variability is discernible between ~200â€“250 Hz for this choice of color scales. The very narrow peak at 360 Hz is associated with a nearby research vessel.</p>
