                Figure 4. Spectrogram showing the temporal evolution of Puffer's power spectrum, based on 10-minute average spectra. Upper and lower panels have different color scales and vertical scales. Overlain on an arbitrary scale in the lower panel is the predicted tidal height for the study area [44]. The peak-to-peak tidal amplitude is ~2 m. Tidal variability is discernible between ~200â€“250 Hz for this choice of color scales. The very narrow peak at 360 Hz is associated with a nearby research vessel.
