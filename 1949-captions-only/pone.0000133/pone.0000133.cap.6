                Figure 6. Phase lags of the maximal acoustic power output, relative to the M2 tidal component period of 12.42 h, for parts of the acoustic spectrum showing strong semi-diurnal periodicity (Figure 5). Phase lags cluster around 120Â°, or just over 4 h. Similar phase lags are predicted by numerical models of tidal loading on poroelastic hydrothermal convection systems [29].
