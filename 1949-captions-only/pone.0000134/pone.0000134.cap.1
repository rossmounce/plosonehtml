Lane 1 shows unprogrammed transcription extract. B) SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with coomassie blue indicating the amounts of recombinant Maf1 and Brf2 used in the <em>in vitro</em> transcription experiment described in A. C) Maf1 represses transcription from the U6 promoter <em>in vitro</em>. The lanes are as in A, except that the HeLa cell extract was programmed with the U6 promoter and that increasing amounts of GST rather than Brf2 were added as control. D) SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with coomassie blue indicating the amounts of recombinant Maf1 and GST used in the <em>in vitro</em> transcription experiment described in C. E) Maf1 associates with pol III in the transcription extract. <em>In vitro</em> transcription reactions containing either no (lane 2) or 400 ng (lane 3) of recombinant His-tagged Maf1 were incubated with Ni-NTA beads, and the beads were then washed several times with D100 buffer <a href="#pone.0000134-Dignam1">[40]</a>. The affinity-purified complex was analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-RPC1 or anti-His tag antibodies.</p>
