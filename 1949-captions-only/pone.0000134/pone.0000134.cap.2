                Figure 2.  Maf1 associates with pol III, the individual pol III subunits RPC1 and RPAC2, and Brf1.A) Association of endogenous Maf1 with pol III and Brf1. Whole cell extract derived from the HeLa cell line 9–8 [41] was used for immunoprecipitations with anti-Maf1 or anti-GAPDH (Abcam) antibodies. The beads were washed, bound material was then eluted by boiling and used for immunoblotting with an anti-RPC1 antibody (CS377) (upper panel), an anti-Brf1 antibody (CS146) (middle panel) or an anti-Maf1 antibody (SZ2793) (lower panel). Lane 1 shows 1/20 of the input material, lanes 2, 3, and 4 show 1/30 of the flow through, 1/30 of the last wash, and 1/5 of the eluted material, respectively. Quantification of the signal shows that 6% of the RPC1 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with Maf1. B) Association of Maf1 with individual pol III subunits. GST-Maf1 or just GST were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads. Pol III subunits were synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S] methionine, and incubated with GST-Maf1 or GST beads. The beads were washed extensively and the bound material was analysed by SDS–PAGE and autoradiography. The first lane (input) shows 1/10 of the in vitro translated material added to the beads. C) Association of Maf1 with RPC1 and RPAC2 is not mediated by RNA nor DNA. Before the binding reaction, GST, GST-Maf1, and in vitro translated RPC1 and RPAC2 were subjected to RNase A or DNase I treatment as indicated above the lanes. D and E) Association of Maf1 with TFIIIB components and SNAPc subunits, respectively. The experiments were performed as in B but with the in vitro translated proteins indicated. F) Pol III subunits and Brf1 associate with different Maf1 regions. On top, a schematic representation of full-length and truncated versions of human Maf1 are shown, with the A, B, and C conserved regions indicated. The experiment shown in the three bottom panels was performed as in B but with the GST fusion proteins indicated and in vitro translated GST, GST-Maf11-82, or GST-Maf11-142, as indicated.
