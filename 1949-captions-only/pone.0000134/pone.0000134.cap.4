                Figure 4.  Knock-down of endogenous Maf1 results in higher pol III transcription after stress.A) RT-qPCR analysis of Maf1 and GAPDH RNA before (black and blue bars, respectively), and after (grey and white bars, respectively) MMS treatment (1 mM MMS for 2 hours) in IMR-90Tert cells either left untransfected or transfected with siRNAs against Maf1 (#2 and #3), or control siRNA, as indicated on top of the panel. Total RNA was analyzed as in Figure 3A. B) Total RNA from exponentially growing IMR-90Tert cells either left untransfected or transfected with siRNAs against MAF1 (#2 and #3) or a control siRNA, as indicated on top of the panel, were either not treated (lanes 1, 2) or treated (lanes 3–10) with 1 mM MMS for 2 hours. Samples isolated 12 and 15 h after MMS removal are shown, as indicated (lanes 3–10). Equal amounts of total RNA (~100 ng/µl) were then resolved on a Bioanalyzer, showing the 18S ribosomal RNA in the top band and short RNAs concentrated in the bottom band. C) Exponentially growing IMR-C35 cells were transfected with siRNA #A2 and #3 against Maf1 or a control siRNA, and then treated or not with 1 mM MMS for 2 hours, as indicated above the lanes. Total RNA was isolated 12–15 hours after MMS removal and 10 µg analyzed by RNase T1 mapping to reveal the transcript derived from the pU6/RA.2+U6end-Dsred integrated construct. Lanes 1 shows a similar RNAse T1 assay performed with RNA from the parental IMR-90Tert cell line. U6-5′: signal corresponding to correctly initiated U6/RA.2+U6end RNA.
