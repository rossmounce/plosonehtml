Tagged Maf1 was visualized with an antibody directed against the HA tag. Lane 5 shows bacterially expressed Maf1, which was loaded on a non-adjacent lane of the same gel. B) Nuclear extract from IMR-90Tert cells transiently expressing HA-tagged Maf1 was prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors prior to immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified anti-RPC1 antibody. Tagged Maf1 was visualized with an antibody directed against the tag (Î±-HA antibody). Only the fastest migrating form of Maf1 bound to pol III. Arrows: phosphorylated Maf1. The negative control was a mock immunoprecipitation performed with protein A sepharose beads without antibody. Lane 1 shows 1/20 of the input material.</p>
