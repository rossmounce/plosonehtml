Samples were probed with an anti-Gag monoclonal antibody. The molecular weight markers are indicated on the right. (B) DCEK cells were transfected with the hLAMP/<em>gag</em> plasmid and stained with anti-Gag (red) or anti-MHC II (green) monoclonal antibodies. Digitally merged image shows co-localization of the hLAMP/<em>gag</em> chimera- and MHC II-containing compartments (yellow).</p>
