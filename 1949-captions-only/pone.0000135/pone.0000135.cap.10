                Figure 10.  Mapping of B-cell epitopes recognized by immunized macaques.Responses to 49 individual 20-aa Gag peptides overlapping by 10-aa comprising the HIV Gag sequence were measured by ELISA in sera collected at week 24. The results are shown as the average responses of the five macaques. The antibody activity in each of the five macaques was directed at 13 peptides, with dominant responses to 2 amino-terminal and 10 carboxy-terminal sequences.
