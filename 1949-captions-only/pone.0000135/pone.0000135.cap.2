                Figure 2.  Immune responses in mice.Mice were injected i.m. on days 1 and 21 with 50 µg of the indicated pITR plasmids encoding mouse or human LAMP or LAMP/gag chimeras. (A) Humoral responses. Blood samples were collected 7 days after the second immunization. Each titration curve indicates the OD450 of Gag-specific total IgG present in serial dilutions of pooled serum from individual groups of mice. (B) CD4+ immune responses. CD4+ IFN-γ+ secretion from splenocytes of mice injected twice with the indicated plasmids. Animals were sacrificed on day 28, and splenocytes were prepared for assay of CD4+ T-cell responses and incubated in the presence or absence of antigen. A representative experiment is shown. Data are Mean±SD after subtraction of the background control values. (C) CD8+ immune responses. On day 21, mice were injected i.p. with 107 PFU of rVV-gag-pol. Five days later, 10 µg of the H-2Kd-binding HIV-1 Gag peptide was injected i.v., and splenocytes were harvested after 2 h and analyzed ex vivo. Gag-specific CD8+ T-lymphocytes producing IFN-γ was quantified by flow cytometry and tetramer binding in the CD8+ splenic population. Cytolytic activity was also analyzed in a 4-h 51Cr release assay using P815 target cells pulsed with the H-2Kd-binding HIV-1 Gag peptide. The effector cells from the various groups of immunized mice were used as indicated. Nonspecific lysis (using unpulsed P815 target cells) was &lt;5% for all groups (not shown). A representative experiment is shown.
