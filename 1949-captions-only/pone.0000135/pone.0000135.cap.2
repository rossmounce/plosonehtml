(A) Humoral responses. Blood samples were collected 7 days after the second immunization. Each titration curve indicates the OD<sub>450</sub> of Gag-specific total IgG present in serial dilutions of pooled serum from individual groups of mice. (B) CD4<sup>+</sup> immune responses. CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> secretion from splenocytes of mice injected twice with the indicated plasmids. Animals were sacrificed on day 28, and splenocytes were prepared for assay of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and incubated in the presence or absence of antigen. A representative experiment is shown. Data are Mean±SD after subtraction of the background control values. (C) CD8<sup>+</sup> immune responses. On day 21, mice were injected i.p. with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of rVV-<em>gag-pol</em>. Five days later, 10 µg of the H-2Kd-binding HIV-1 Gag peptide was injected i.v., and splenocytes were harvested after 2 h and analyzed <em>ex vivo</em>. Gag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes producing IFN-γ was quantified by flow cytometry and tetramer binding in the CD8<sup>+</sup> splenic population. Cytolytic activity was also analyzed in a 4-h <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay using P815 target cells pulsed with the H-2Kd-binding HIV-1 Gag peptide. The effector cells from the various groups of immunized mice were used as indicated. Nonspecific lysis (using unpulsed P815 target cells) was &lt;5% for all groups (not shown). A representative experiment is shown.</p>
