Each time point represents the average number of cells activated in separate assays by rGag protein or Gag 15- or 20-aa peptides, performed at two laboratories in duplicate or triplicate. Each bar is the average number of cells activated in 8 to 20 ELISPOT wells+/−S.D. and represents the number of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells per 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs.</p>
