                Figure 4.  T-cell immune response of immunized macaques.IFN-γ ELISPOT assays were performed with PBMC samples from each of five Rhesus macaques immunized with 5 mg of hLAMP/gag DNA plasmid at weeks 0, 4, 14, 22 and 38. Each time point represents the average number of cells activated in separate assays by rGag protein or Gag 15- or 20-aa peptides, performed at two laboratories in duplicate or triplicate. Each bar is the average number of cells activated in 8 to 20 ELISPOT wells+/−S.D. and represents the number of IFN-γ+ cells per 106 PBMCs.
