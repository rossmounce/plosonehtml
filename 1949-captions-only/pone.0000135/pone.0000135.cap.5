                Figure 5.  Comparison of the T-cell responses of immunized macaques to Gag 15- and 20-aa peptide pools.Comparison of the average number of IFN-γ+ cells activated by Gag 15- and 20-aa peptide pools in the ELISPOT assays, using PBMCs from five individual Rhesus macaques after three DNA immunizations. Each bar represents the number of IFN-γ+ cells per 106 PBMCs.
