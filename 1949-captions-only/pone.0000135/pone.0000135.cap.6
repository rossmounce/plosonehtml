                Figure 6.  CD4+ T-cell immune responses of immunized macaques.ELISPOT assays show the average number of IFN-γ+ cells activated by recombinant Gag protein with CD8+-depleted PBMCs from five individual rhesus macaques after four DNA immunizations (at week 36). Each bar is the average count from duplicate wells+/−S.D. and represents the number of IFN-γ+ cells per 106 CD8+-depleted PBMCs.
