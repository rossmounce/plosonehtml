                Figure 7.  T-cell immune responses to twelve pools of ten 15-aa Gag peptides each.T-cell responses of PBMCs from immunized Rhesus macaques to 12 pools, each consisting of ten gag 15-aa peptides overlapping by 11-aa, were measured by use of ELISPOT assays at week 20 after three DNA immunizations. Each bar represents the frequency of IFN-Î³+ cells per 106 PBMCs.
