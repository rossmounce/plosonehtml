(A) Sera diluted 1:100 from individual macaques was assayed for total anti-Gag antibodies (IgG). (B) End-point titers were measured at week 24 after four DNA immunizations. The reported titers correspond to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that gave an OD value three times higher than that of the corresponding dilution of a non-immune serum.</p>
