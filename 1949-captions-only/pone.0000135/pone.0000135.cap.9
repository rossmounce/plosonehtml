                Figure 9.  IgA and IL-6 immune responses of hLAMP/gag immunized macaques.Gag-specific mucosal immune responses of immunized Rhesus macaques were quantitated by ELISA for IgA and IL-6. (A) Serum IgA levels of the individual macaques at different time-points. (B) IL-6 production of PBMCs from individual macaques stimulated at week 32 with recombinant Gag protein after four DNA immunizations. (C) IgA levels of external secretions of individual macaques.
