                Figure 1.  Structures of the lac-repressor tetramer complexed with DNA.(A) Crystallographic structure of the “v”-shaped LacR complexed with the symmetric operator sequence GAATTGTGAGCGCTCACAATT (PDF accession number 1LBG) [34], shown along the z axis. The α-carbon trace of each lac monomer is rendered in a separate color; DNA segments are shown in a space-filling representation. The three repressor domains are indicated: H, headpiece; C, core; T, tetramerization. The x axis is an approximate two-fold or dyad axis in the structure. (B) View of the complex shown in (A) along the x axis. Helical axes of the bound DNA segments project slightly (35°) out of the plane of the “v” structure, implying that a small degree of DNA writhe may be induced by LacR-mediated looping. (C) A hypothetical structure of LacR in its extended conformation. This model was generated from the “v”-shaped structure shown in (A) by increasing the interior angle from 60° to ~180°. The three semi-flexible joints modeling the elastic properties of the tetramer are indicated by vertical arrows. Note that an increase in the length of the LacR major axis from 20 bp to 25 bp occurs when the tetramer isomerizes from the “v-shaped” to the extended structure. (D) Simplified elastic model for LacR and a simulated 137-bp DNA loop mediated by the extended LacR structure. DNA base pairs are represented by rectangular slabs (red). Two sets of coordinate axes (green) represent the local coordinate frames embedded in the protein subunits (gold) that mediate DNA looping. The coupling of protein and DNA geometry is characterized by tilt, roll, and twist values for the DNA-protein, protein-protein, and protein-DNA interfaces. Three of these variables are shown here: the DNA-protein roll angle, φDP
                  ; the protein-protein twist angle, τPP
                  ; and the protein-DNA roll angle, φPD
                   (see Materials and Methods for details).
