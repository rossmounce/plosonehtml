                Figure 2.  Looped DNA conformations mediated by the v-shaped LacR tetramer structure for 179- and 163-bp DNAs.Three classes of loop conformations: (A) “wrap toward” (“WT”), (B), (C) “wrap away” (“WA”), and (D), (E) “loop beside” (“LB”), are shown along with their respective J factors and ΔGloop
                      values. At most two alternative loop topoisomers are found for small DNA loops such as those considered here; these correspond to underwound (−) and overwound (+) DNA conformations. The DNA-loop sizes 179 and 163 bp correspond to maxima and minima, respectively, in the DNA-length dependence of J for the “WA” or “WT” conformations (see Figure 3A). The 179-bp “WT” conformation shown in (A) is dominated by one planar topoisomer because of its in-phase LacR binding sites at this DNA length; however, there are two alternative 179-bp “WA” conformations, which are shown in (B). The two “WA” topoisomers for 163-bp DNA are essentially isoenergetic and shown in (C); note that the loop crossings differ in topological sign. In contrast, the “LB” conformations (D) and (E) have minimum and maximum J values at 179 and 163 bp, respectively. Only the 179-bp (−) “LB” topoisomer shown in (D) is populated to any appreciable extent at thermal equilibrium, whereas both (−) and (+) forms have similar free energies in the case of 163-bp “LB” loops.
