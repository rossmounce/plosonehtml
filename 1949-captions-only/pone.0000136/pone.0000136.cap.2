                     </em> values. At most two alternative loop topoisomers are found for small DNA loops such as those considered here; these correspond to underwound (−) and overwound (+) DNA conformations. The DNA-loop sizes 179 and 163 bp correspond to maxima and minima, respectively, in the DNA-length dependence of <em>J</em> for the “WA” or “WT” conformations (see <a href="#pone-0000136-g003">Figure 3A</a>). The 179-bp “WT” conformation shown in (A) is dominated by one planar topoisomer because of its in-phase LacR binding sites at this DNA length; however, there are two alternative 179-bp “WA” conformations, which are shown in (B). The two “WA” topoisomers for 163-bp DNA are essentially isoenergetic and shown in (C); note that the loop crossings differ in topological sign. In contrast, the “LB” conformations (D) and (E) have minimum and maximum <em>J</em> values at 179 and 163 bp, respectively. Only the 179-bp (−) “LB” topoisomer shown in (D) is populated to any appreciable extent at thermal equilibrium, whereas both (−) and (+) forms have similar free energies in the case of 163-bp “LB” loops.</p>
