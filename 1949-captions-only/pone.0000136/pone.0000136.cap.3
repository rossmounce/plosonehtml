                     </em> for the three classes of loop conformations mediated by the v-shaped <em>lac</em> repressor. Protein assemblies are taken to be rigid (i.e., DNA-protein, protein-protein, and protein-DNA flexibility parameters were all set to 0). (B) Length dependence of J factors and Δ<em>G<sub>loop</sub>

                     </em>). Taken together with (A), the J-factor length dependence shows that the extended LacR conformation dominates all of the v-shaped forms for loops smaller than 180 bp. (C) The dependence of <em>J</em> and Δ<em>G<sub>loop</sub>
                     </em> values on the interior angle between LacR domains is shown for three classes of 153-bp loops as the repressor structure opens from the v-shape (60°) to an extended form (180°). Protein assemblies were taken to be rigid, as in (A). WA and WT loops become degenerate at large angles, which can be seen from the identical J factors attained with the extended form of LacR. A small difference (~1.5k<sub>B</sub>
                     <em>T</em>) between the asymptotic Δ<em>G<sub>loop</sub>
                     </em> value for WA and WT conformations in (C) and the corresponding value on the SL curve in (B) is due to differences in protein flexibility and tetramer dimensions (dimer major-axis length of 25 bp in (B) versus 20 bp in (C)). Because of broken symmetry, LB loops adopt a highly strained conformation as the interior angle approaches 180°. For comparison, projections of 3-d conformations for LB loops with interior-angle values of 60° and 180° are shown as insets. Gaps in the curves indicate that no stable mechanical-equilibrium conformations were found for “LB” loops when the interior angle was between 146° and 156°, nor for “WT” loops having interior-angle values less than 98°. This behavior is characteristic of abrupt transitions between mechanical minima, usually when a loop bifurcates to either an over-twisted or under-twisted conformation. Without a stable mechanical-equilibrium conformation, the perturbation method employed in our statistical-mechanical theory cannot be applied.</p>
