                      for the three classes of loop conformations mediated by the v-shaped lac repressor. Protein assemblies are taken to be rigid (i.e., DNA-protein, protein-protein, and protein-DNA flexibility parameters were all set to 0). (B) Length dependence of J factors and ΔGloop
                      for the extended (SL) and LB conformations. Protein-flexibility parameters are given in parentheses as (σθ
