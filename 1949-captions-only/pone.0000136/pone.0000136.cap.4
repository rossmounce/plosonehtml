                     </em> and <em>K<sub>2</sub>
                     </em> are apparent dissociation constants. Assuming site “1” is the primary site near the promoter of the <em>lac</em> operon, its occupancy by LacR prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, blocking transcription of genes under its control. (B) Coupled equilbria involving different LacR-DNA complexes. Here <em>K<sub>c</sub>
