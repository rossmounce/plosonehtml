                Figure 4.  Chemical equilibria among LacR-operator association states assuming a single looped conformation for the LacR-DNA complex.(A) A LacR tetramer can bind to two cognate sites with different affinities, for which K1
                      and K2
                      are apparent dissociation constants. Assuming site “1” is the primary site near the promoter of the lac operon, its occupancy by LacR prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, blocking transcription of genes under its control. (B) Coupled equilbria involving different LacR-DNA complexes. Here Kc
                        (1)
                      and Kc
                        (2)
                      denote the unimolecular association constants associated with DNA looping and are related to K1, K2
                     , λ, and J by Equation 9 (see Materials and Methods).
