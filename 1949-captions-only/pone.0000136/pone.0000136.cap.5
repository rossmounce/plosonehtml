                Figure 5.  Best fit of the thermodynamic model to in-vivo repression data.Best-fit values of the adjustable parameters for all data sets are given in Table 1. (A) In-vivo repression data from Figure 3A of Müller et al. [5] and optimized fit to Equation 1. (B) In-vivo repression data of Becker et al. [19] for wild-type (“WT”) and HU-deletion (ΔHU) E. coli strains along with their respective optimized fits.
