                Figure 6.  J factor versus operator spacing under different intracellular conditions.The J values corresponding to wild-type, WT, or HU-deletion, ΔHU, E. coli strains were calculated using the respective best-fit parameters given in Table 1. J factors corresponding to LacR-mediated loops having normal DNA elasticity were computed using canonical parameters for DNA persistence length (150 bp) and torsional rigidity (2.4 10−19 erg cm), and a LacR flexibility parameter identical to that for the wild-type strain (19°). Calculations of the J factor for the case of a rigid extended LacR conformation used the same parameters as for the wild-type strain except for a protein-flexibility parameter set equal to 2.0°.
