                Figure 7.  Predicted repressor occupancy of the primary operator and loop yield as a function of operator spacing corresponding to the data of Becker et al. 
                     [19]. Upper panel: the proportion of the primary operator site (O2) bound by LacR for wild-type and HU-deletion strains computed from their respective best-fit parameters using formula 1âˆ’Eloop
                      (see Equation 13). The occupancy of the primary operator in the absence of the looping contribution is shown for reference (dashed line). Lower panel: the loop yield computed using Equation 10 for both wild-type and HU-deletion strains. J values used in these calculations are those given in Figure 6.
