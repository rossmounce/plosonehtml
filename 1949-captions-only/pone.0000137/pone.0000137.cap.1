                Figure 1.  Definition of directionally selective model neuron.A: Latency tuning: directional dependence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance peaks (left) and latencies (right). Symbols: Gray squares, excitatory conductance; white squares, inhibitory conductance; black circles, total synaptic conductance. B: Polar plot of directional selectivity of model neuron tested with discrete single deflections in one of eight possible directions (symbolically represented at bottom: solid line is 0° deflection). Responses are on a radial scale normalized to the preferred direction (PD, set to 0°) response (outer circle = 1). Symbols: Circles, gray line: synaptic responses (mean peak evoked synaptic potential per deflection). Squares, black line: spiking responses (mean evoked number of spikes per deflection, counted over a 20 ms window).
