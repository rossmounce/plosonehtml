                Figure 2.  Directional selectivity is sensitive to stimulus frequency.A: Plot of directional selectivity tested with 20 Hz random deflection sequence. Deflections occurred at exponentially distributed intervals (symbolically represented at bottom left: each vertical line is a deflection) and were across neighboring positions on a diamond spatial grid (bottom right). Thus, there was a “whisker displacement” from one position to a neighbor every 50 ms on average. Response scales and symbols as in Fig. 1B. B: Plot of directional selectivity tested with 200 Hz random deflection sequence. Except for frequency, all other parameters were as for A (symbols at bottom represent the faster sequence and the unchanged position grid). Directional selectivity was substantially weakened.
