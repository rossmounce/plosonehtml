Deflections occurred at exponentially distributed intervals (symbolically represented at bottom left: each vertical line is a deflection) and were across neighboring positions on a diamond spatial grid (bottom right). Thus, there was a “whisker displacement” from one position to a neighbor every 50 ms on average. Response scales and symbols as in <a href="#pone-0000137-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. <strong>B:</strong> Plot of directional selectivity tested with 200 Hz random deflection sequence. Except for frequency, all other parameters were as for <strong>A</strong> (symbols at bottom represent the faster sequence and the unchanged position grid). Directional selectivity was substantially weakened.</p>
