Selectivity index as a function of stimulus frequency assessed using two different integration time windows after each deflection (10 and 20 ms). <strong>B:</strong> Dependence on short-term synaptic plasticity. The selectivity index was evaluated for conditions differing in how synaptic depression properties were matched across excitatory and inhibitory conductances (ND: no depression, same model as in other figures; SBD, WBD and NBD defined in Results). <strong>C:</strong> Dependence on choice of grid geometry on which whisker deflections were defined (square: deflections on square grid; diamond: on diamond grid; random: random walk deflections; see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> for full explanation and <a href="#pone-0000137-g002">Fig. 2</a>, bottom, for schematic of diamond grid). In all cases, response selectivity was weakened at high frequencies. Error bars: standard error of mean across trials.</p>
