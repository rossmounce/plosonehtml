                Figure 3.  Robustness to changes in key model parameters.All panels represent the “Selectivity Index” (see Materials and Methods) computed on spiking responses. A: Dependence on time window for response estimation. Selectivity index as a function of stimulus frequency assessed using two different integration time windows after each deflection (10 and 20 ms). B: Dependence on short-term synaptic plasticity. The selectivity index was evaluated for conditions differing in how synaptic depression properties were matched across excitatory and inhibitory conductances (ND: no depression, same model as in other figures; SBD, WBD and NBD defined in Results). C: Dependence on choice of grid geometry on which whisker deflections were defined (square: deflections on square grid; diamond: on diamond grid; random: random walk deflections; see Materials and Methods for full explanation and Fig. 2, bottom, for schematic of diamond grid). In all cases, response selectivity was weakened at high frequencies. Error bars: standard error of mean across trials.
