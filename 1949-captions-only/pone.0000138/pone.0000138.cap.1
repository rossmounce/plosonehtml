NMDA was co-applied with 10 µM glycine, and dopamine was co-applied with 1 mM ascorbic acid within various time frames. Hippocampal slices were harvested in the course of the various time frames, snap frozen on dry ice, homogenized in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis of the different specimens. Antibodies against the phosphorylated ERK2 were directed to phosphorylation sites Thr183/Tyr185 (here and below). Each specimen comprised two hippocampal slices combined (i.e., 2 slices is n = 1) (this applies to all the following figure captions). A. NMDA was co-applied with glycine, each at a concentration of 10 µM (n = 6 for each time frame). B. NMDA was co-applied with glycine at concentrations of 100 and 10 µM respectively (n = 6 for each time frame). C. dopamine at a concentration 10 µM was co-applied with 1 mM ascorbic acid (n = 6 for each time frame). D. Dopamine at a concentration 100 µM was co-applied with 1 mM ascorbic acid (n = 6 for each time frame).</p>
