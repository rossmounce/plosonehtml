                Figure 2.  Time dependency of ERK2 activation following co-application of low doses of dopamine and NMDA.Western blot analysis of time dependency of ERK2 activation, as measured by the ratio of pERK2/ERK2, in response to co-application of dopamine and NMDA to hippocampal slices. Dopamine at 10 µM was co-applied with 1 mM ascorbic acid, 10 µM NMDA and 10 µM glycine for the different time frames (n = 6 for each time frame).
