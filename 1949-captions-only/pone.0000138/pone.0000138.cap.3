                Figure 3.  ERK2 but neither p38 nor JNK serves as a coincidence detector of dopamine and NMDA application.Western blot analysis of MAPKs activation, as measured by the ratio of phospho-MAPK/total MAPK, induced by 10 min application of either 10 µM NMDA with 10 µM glycine (n = 6), or of 10 µM dopamine with 1 mM ascorbic acid (n = 6), or co-application of 10 µM dopamine, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 10 µM NMDA and 10 µM glycine (n = 6), or control (n = 6). A. ERK2 activation; B. p38 activation. Antibodies against the phosphorylated p38 were directed to phosphorylation sites Thr180/Tyr182; C. JNK activation. Antibodies against the phosphorylated JNK were directed to phosphorylation sites Thr183/Tyr185.
