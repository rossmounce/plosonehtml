Western blot analysis of ERK2 activation, as measured by the ratio of pERK2/ERK2, induced by 10 min application of either 20 µM NMDA with 10 µM glycine with and without APV 40 µM (n = 4, each), or of 20 µM dopamine with 1 mM ascorbic acid with and without APV 40 µM (n = 4, each). Also shown are control (n = 4) and APV 40 µM applied alone for 30 minutes (n = 4). Each application of either dopamine or NMDA, when co-applied with APV, was pre-perfused with APV 40 µM alone for 30 minutes, prior to their co-application with APV. B. Western blot analysis of ERK2 activation, as measured by the ratio of pERK2/ERK2, induced by 10 min application of either 20 µM NMDA with 10 µM glycine with and without co-application of SCH23390 40 µM and eticlopride 60 µM (n = 4, each), or of 20 µM dopamine with 1 mM ascorbic acid with and without co-application of SCH23390 40 µM and eticlopride 60 µM (n = 4, each). Also shown are control (n = 4), and co-application of SCH23390 40 µM and eticlopride 60 µM for 30 minutes (n = 4). Each application of either dopamine or NMDA, when co-applied with SCH23390 and eticlopride, was pre-perfused with SCH23390 40 µM and eticlopride 60 µM for 30 minutes, prior to their co-application with these antagonists.</p>
