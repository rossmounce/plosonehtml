                Figure 5.  The effect of high and low doses of NMDA and dopamine on efficacy of Schaffer-collateral synapses.The effect of NMDA and dopamine on the efficacy of Schaffer-collateral synapses was determined. A. Strong NMDA stimulation (100 µM, 10 min) resulted in a robust and immediate depression of synaptic efficacy. After washout, synaptic efficacy returned to basal levels within 60 min of treatment (n = 21 slices). Grey bar indicates treatment. Inset illustrates representative traces 2 min before treatment, immediately after treatment and at the end of the experiment. B. Weak NMDA stimulation (10 µM, 10 min) resulted in a rapid depression of synaptic transmission that persisted for at least 120 min after treatment (n = 21 slices). C. Weak dopamine stimulation (10 µM, 10 min) resulted in a gradual potentiation of synaptic efficacy (n = 11 slices). The effect of weak dopamine stimulation was completely inhibited by the NMDA-R antagonist DL-APV (50 µM, n = 3 slices). D. Co-application of weak NMDA (10 µM) and dopamine (10 µM) resulted in a robust and immediate depression of synaptic efficacy. After washout, synaptic efficacy returned to basal levels within 60 min of treatment (n = 15 slices). Note the similarity with the effect of strong NMDA in panel A. E. The NMDA-R antagonist DL-APV (50 µM) completely inhibited the effect of co-application of weak NMDA (10 µM) and dopamine (10 µM) on synaptic efficacy (n = 4 slices). F. Summary statistics of the effect of treatments with neurotransmitters on Schaffer-collateral synaptic efficacy. ‘Baseline’ data were averaged over the first 20 min of recording where no treatment was administered. ‘Treatment’ data represent the average fEPSP during the 10 min where NMDA/Dopamine/APV were administered. ‘End of Experiment’ represents the average fEPSP from 130–140 min from the start of an experiment. No significant differences were observed between the experimental groups during the baseline. Significant differences across treatments were observed during treatment and at the end of experiment using pair-wise post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons. Asterisks indicate significant differences (* = p&lt;0.05, ** = p&lt;0.01, *** = p&lt;0.001). In all panels, error bars indicate SEM.
