                Figure 6.  Strong NMDA treatments do not alter paired-pulse facilitation.Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at an inter-stimulus interval of 50 msec was measured in slices (n = 7) before and after treatment with NMDA (100 ÂµM, 10 min). A. No significant differences were observed in PPF after treatment with NMDA (F13,6 = 1.3, p&lt;0.3). Grey bars indicate PPF before treatment with NMDA. Black bars indicate PPF after treatment with NMDA. B. Representative traces illustrating PPF.
