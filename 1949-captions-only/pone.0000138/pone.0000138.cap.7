Western blot analysis of synaptosomal GluR1 and β-actin content, induced by 10 min application of either NMDA 100 µM with 10 µM glycine (n = 4), or co-application of 10 µM dopamine, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 10 µM NMDA and 10 µM glycine (n = 4), or control (n = 4). Synaptosomal fraction was performed as mentioned previously in the methods. Relative quantification of synaptosomal GluR1 content was measured in relation to β-actin within the same blot. B. Synaptosomal fraction validation. Western blot comparison of synaptosomal enriched fraction, non-synaptosomal fraction and total homogenate with PSD-95, as a synaptosomal marker, and β-actin within the same blot.</p>
