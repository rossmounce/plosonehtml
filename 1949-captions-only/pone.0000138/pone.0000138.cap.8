B. shows that a weak input of fast neurotransmission (weak means small magnitude, too short duration, or non-optimal spacing) would lead to weak ERK1/2 activation, and would result in only short-term changes if any. C. shows that though the fast neurotransmission input is weak (as most ordinary daily physiological input is), the convergence of a slow neurotransmission (e.g., dopamine) upon the fast neurotransmission receptor induces GluR1 insertion and strong and fast ERK2 activation, thus gives it another meaning, and consequently causing long-term changes. The process is NMDA-R dependent and can be mediated via the activation of different types of AC's.</p>
