(A). Multiplicity of infection is depicted separately for each locus. For <em>Pfmsp1</em> block2, the figures derive from nested PCR analysis using family-specific primers and allele identification based on allelic family assignment and size polymorphism. For <em>Pfcrt</em> and <em>Pfdfhr-ts</em>, it is based on K76T and S108N genotypes determined by molecular beacons, respectively. Symbols used: (Red triangles): <em>Pfcrt</em> codon 76 genotype; (green squares): <em>Pfdhr-ts</em> codon 108 genotype, (blue open circles) <em>Pfmsp1</em> block2.</p>
