                Figure 3.  Temporal variation of the relative Pfdhfr-ts gene polymorphism in Dielmo during 1990â€“99.The 1.8 kb PCR fragment corresponding to the full length Pfdhfr-ts coding sequence was sequenced on both strands for a total of 204 isolates. The yearly distribution of the various genotypes is shown, using the colour code shown to the right of the figure. The alleles presenting synonymous mutations were omitted from the colour coding. The C59Y non-synonymous substitution was a TGT to TAT mutation. The synonymous mutations (CTA to TTA or CTC for codon 40, GGA to GGC for codon 241) are not depicted. No mutation was detected at codon 16 and 164, and no bolivia repeat type was observed. Overall there were 155 isolates with wild type coding sequence and 49 isolates with non synonymous mutations (76% and 24%, respectively). There were 15 (7.3%) single mutants [51I (0.5%), 59Y (1%), 108N (5.8%)], one (0.5%) 51I 108N double mutant and 33 (16.2%) 51I 59R 108N triple mutants.
