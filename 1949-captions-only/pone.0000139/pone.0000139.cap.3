The yearly distribution of the various genotypes is shown, using the colour code shown to the right of the figure. The alleles presenting synonymous mutations were omitted from the colour coding. The C59Y non-synonymous substitution was a TGT to TAT mutation. The synonymous mutations (CTA to TTA or CTC for codon 40, GGA to GGC for codon 241) are not depicted. No mutation was detected at codon 16 and 164, and no <em>bolivia</em> repeat type was observed. Overall there were 155 isolates with wild type coding sequence and 49 isolates with non synonymous mutations (76% and 24%, respectively). There were 15 (7.3%) single mutant<em>s</em> [51I (0.5%), 59Y (1%), 108N (5.8%)], one (0.5%) 51I 108N double mutant and 33 (16.2%) 51I 59R 108N triple mutants.</p>
