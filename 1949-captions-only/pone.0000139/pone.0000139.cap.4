                Figure 4.  Frequency distribution of Pfcrt intron 4 microsatellite types by codons 72â€“76 and 220 haplotype.247 isolates were typed (19, 23, 22, 33, 28, 22, 29, 17, 39 and 15 isolates in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively) for the intron 4 microsatellite by gene sequencing (see Materials and Methods). There were 31 CVIETS haplotypes and 216 wild type haplotypes. The haplotype codes are listed in Table S2.
