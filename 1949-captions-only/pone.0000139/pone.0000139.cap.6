                Figure 6.  Temporal distribution of CQ and SP drug pressure and drug resistance in Dielmo in 1990–9.The drug pressure is expressed as No of treatments/person/year (first graph) and as overall No of treatment courses administered per year (second graph). Panels A and B refer to CQ and SP, respectively. The prevalence of the Pfcrt mutant alleles was calculated from molecular beacon studies (N = 324) (see Figure 2), while the prevalence of the Pfdhfr-ts triple mutant was calculated from the full gene sequences available (N = 202) (see Figure 3). In vitro susceptibility assays were carried out in 1990–4 during the rainy season (N = 26) and from 1995 onwards for the last 2–3 months of the year, namely from 7/11/1995–26/12/1995 (N = 46) ; 6/01/1996–3/12/1996 (N = 59); 27/10/97–15/121997 (N = 26) ; 10/01/1998–15/11/1998 (N = 54) and 29/09/1999–08/11/1999 (N = 25). The proportion of interpretable CQ and pyrimethamine susceptibility tests was 68–81% and 72–81%, respectively, depending on the year. The prevalence of resistance is expressed as the percent of interpretable assays presenting a CI50 for CQ &gt;100 nM or a CI50 for pyrimethamine&gt;2000 nM. The occurrence of a second clinical malaria episode within 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of treatment was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. The bars correspond to the 95% confidence interval. The years before implementation of CQ and SP (1990–4) are grouped together.
 A. CQ pressure, Pfcrt 76T resistance mutation, CQ in vitro resistance and prevalence of clinical attacks following a CQ treatment
 B. SP pressure, Pfdhfr-ts triple mutant, pyrimethamine in vitro resistance and prevalence of clinical attacks following a SP treatment
