Panels A and B refer to CQ and SP, respectively. The prevalence of the <em>Pfcrt</em> mutant alleles was calculated from molecular beacon studies (N = 324) (see <a href="#pone-0000139-g002">Figure 2</a>), while the prevalence of the <em>Pfdhfr-ts</em> triple mutant was calculated from the full gene sequences available (N = 202) (see <a href="#pone-0000139-g003">Figure 3</a>). <em>In vitro</em> susceptibility assays were carried out in 1990–4 during the rainy season (N = 26) and from 1995 onwards for the last 2–3 months of the year, namely from 7/11/1995–26/12/1995 (N = 46) ; 6/01/1996–3/12/1996 (N = 59); 27/10/97–15/121997 (N = 26) ; 10/01/1998–15/11/1998 (N = 54) and 29/09/1999–08/11/1999 (N = 25). The proportion of interpretable CQ and pyrimethamine susceptibility tests was 68–81% and 72–81%, respectively, depending on the year. The prevalence of resistance is expressed as the percent of interpretable assays presenting a CI<sub>50</sub> for CQ &gt;100 nM or a CI<sub>50</sub> for pyrimethamine&gt;2000 nM. The occurrence of a second clinical malaria episode within 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of treatment was calculated as described in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. The bars correspond to the 95% confidence interval. The years before implementation of CQ and SP (1990–4) are grouped together.</p>
