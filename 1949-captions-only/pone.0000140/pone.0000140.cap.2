                Figure 2. RLI using (A) the original formulation; and (B) the new formulation for the same hypothetical set of 10 species as in Figure 1c and g. The dotted line represents the RLI that would be calculated if five Near Threatened species had been misclassified as Vulnerable in year 1 owing to poor knowledge, and if this error was not corrected until year 4. The original formulation produces an RLI that is substantially lower in value than reality because it propagates errors resulting from incomplete knowledge in earlier assessments. The new formulation does not suffer from this effect.
