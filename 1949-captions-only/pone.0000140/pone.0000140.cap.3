                Figure 3. RLIs using the original formulation (left-hand graphs) and the revised formulation (right-hand graphs) for (A–B) the world's birds (n = 9,824 non-Data Deficient species: 99.2% of all extant species) and (C–D) birds in different biogeographic realms. Under the revised formula, an RLI value of 1.0 equates to all species being categorised as Least Concern, and hence that none are expected to go extinct in the near future; an RLI value of zero indicates that all species have gone Extinct. In Figure 3A, the dotted line represents the RLI using the same original formula, but incorporating back-casting using the latest and best-informed evaluations. It results in a substantially higher value by 2004 because the original approach propagates errors resulting from incomplete knowledge in earlier assessments. By 2004, the difference is comparable to the size of the error bars calculated from estimates of the magnitude of the error introduced by delays in knowledge becoming available to assessors [13].
