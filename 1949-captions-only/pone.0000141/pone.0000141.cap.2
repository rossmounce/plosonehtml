                Figure 2.  Patterns of Intron Gain and Loss.(A) Likelihood results. (B) Parsimony results. Numbers of introns present in modern species (known) are in black. Numbers of introns present in ancestors (estimated) are in green. Numbers of gains and losses (estimated) are in red and blue, respectively. Branches that experienced &gt;1.5 gains per loss are shown in red and those that experienced &gt;1.5 losses per gain are in blue. Abbreviations are the same as in Figure 1.
