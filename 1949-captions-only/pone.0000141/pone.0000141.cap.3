                Figure 3.  Intron Gains and Losses Over Time.The numbers of intron gains and losses are divided into three periods of time: 0.5–0 Ga (black); 1.0–0.5 Ga (gray), and 1.5–1.0 Ga (white). The timescale is based on that of Hedges and colleagues [13], [14]. Ga, billion years ago; other abbreviations are the same as in Figure 1.
