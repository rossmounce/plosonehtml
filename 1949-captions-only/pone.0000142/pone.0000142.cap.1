                Figure 1.  A 2.8 kb fragment of the dpp enhancer is sufficient for activation and repression of dpp in the leg disc.A: Schematic representation of the dpp locus and the 6 enhancer fragments used in this study. The dpp transcription unit is centered around 86 kb (arrow). [Map coordinates (in kilobases) from [19], [52], [53]. The leg disc enhancer is located between 20–30 kb downstream of the dpp coding region. Filled stars represent dTCF-binding sites confirmed by footprinting, open stars are predicted sites and pentagons are BRK binding sites. Arrowheads indicate fusion to the ß galactosidase reporter gene. APRD refers to the 4 relevant domains A (region required for Activation), P (proximal TCF sites), R (repressor domain), D (distal TCF sites). B–E: 3rd instar leg imaginal discs with dorsal up and anterior to the left. B: Normal dpp mRNA expression detected by in situ hybridization. Bracket indicates ventral region, where dpp is repressed. C: A 10 kb dpp enhancer fragment (BS3.0) drives expression of lacZ in a stripe that recapitulates normal dpp expression including ventral repression (bracket). D: Expression driven by the 2.8 kb APRD dpp enhancer fragment mimics dpp mRNA and BS3.0 expression. Again, note ventral repression (bracket). E: Ventral repression is lost (bracket) in the 2.3 kb APR- fragment which has a 500 bp region of APRD that contains the distal cluster of dTCF binding sites (D) deleted. F: An 800 bp fragment (AP--, BS3.1) containing the proximal cluster of dTCF sites (P) is not sufficient for ventral repression (bracket). G: The AP-D fragment does not show ventral repression (bracket). Sequences in the 1.4 kb between the proximal and distal dTCF sites do not contain dTCF sites but are required for ventral repression.
