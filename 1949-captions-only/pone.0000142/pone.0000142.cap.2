                Figure 2.  The dpp enhancer responds to WG signalingA–D: 3rd instar leg imaginal discs. Dorsal is up, anterior is to the left. Expression of the 2.8 kb APRD reporter fragment is monitored by β-galactosidase activity. A: In wild type leg discs (mesothoracic shown), APRD&gt;LacZ expression is repressed in the ventral region (bracket). B: WG signaling is required for ventral repression. In a pair of everting prothoracic leg discs from a wgts
                      larva, ventral repression of APRD&gt;LacZ is lost after shifting to restrictive temperature (brackets). C: Expression of the APRD reporter is repressed ventrally in Hs&gt;Gal4; UAS&gt;DNdTCF animals reared at 18° (bracket). DNdTCF is a dominant negative form of dTCF that cannot bind ARM. These animals and their discs are small compared to their non DNdTCF bearing sibs even when maintained continuously at low temperature, presumably due to low level expression of Hs&gt;Gal4. However, these control animals maintained at low temperature do survive as viable, mophologically intact adults. D: When heat shocked in late third instar, repression is lost within 2.5 hours (bracket). At least 6 animals of each genotype were examined and all legs exhibited the same responses.
