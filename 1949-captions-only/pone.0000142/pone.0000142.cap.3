                Figure 3.  Identification of dTCF binding sites required for dpp ventral repressionA,B: dTCF binding sites in the dpp regulatory region from 109.4–112.8 kb were mapped by DNase I footprinting using dTCF protein as described in the methods section [22]. The approximate positions of the protected sites are indicated by stars. DNase I footprinting of the region containing the distal cluster (D) reveals 3 protected sites (sites 3, 4; 5) indicated by the bars in A and B. Similar footprints identified two sites in the proximal cluster (sites 1; 2 = P) and no footprints or gel shifts were detected in the A or R regions (not shown). Duplicate lanes represent independent reactions. Lanes 1; 7 are the GA sequencing ladder. All lanes utilize a 1:1 dilution of bacterial extract containing empty expression vector or protein expressing vector and the same concentration of DNaseI except lane 4. Lanes 2 and 6 are no protein controls. Lane 3 uses an extract expressing human LEF1 protein. Lanes 4 and 5 use an extract expressing dTCF with lane 4 containing a 3 times higher concentration of DNase. C–E: 3rd instar leg imaginal discs. Dorsal is up, anterior is to the left. dpp lacZ expression is monitored by immunofluorescence. C: The 2.8 kb APRD dpp enhancer fragment with all 5 dTCF sites intact is repressed ventrally (bracket). D: Mutation of all 5 dTCF sites (ApRd) eliminates ventral repression (bracket). E: Mutation of just the 3 distal dTCF sites (APRd) is sufficient to eliminate ventral repression (bracket).
