                Figure 4.  Simultaneous binding of BRK and dTCF is required for dpp repression.A–H: 3rd instar leg imaginal discs. Dorsal is up and Anterior is to the left. A–D: response of dpp reporters to dppblk GAL4 driven expression of WG. E–H: response of dpp reporters to dppblk GAL4 driven expression of BRK. A: Ectopic dorsal expression of wg represses APRD&gt;lacZ expression. B: Ectopic wg expression does not repress the APRD dpp reporter when all 5 of the dTCF binding sites are mutated (indicated by ApRd). C: WG expression does not repress the APRD dpp reporter when the BRK binding sites are mutated (APrD). D: WG expression does not repress the APRD dpp reporter when all the dTCF and BRK binding sites are mutated (Aprd). E: Ectopic dorsal expression of BRK represses APRD&gt;lacZ expression. F: Ectopic BRK expression does not repress the APRD dpp reporter when all 5 of the dTCF binding sites are mutated (ApRd). G: Ectopic BRK expression does repress the dpp reporter when the BRK sites are mutated, APrD H: Ectopic BRK expression does not repress the dpp reporter when all the dTCF and BRK binding sites are mutated, Aprd.
