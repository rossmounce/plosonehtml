SPR analysis shows BRK binding to the intact R domain (R). Mutation of BRK site 1 [<em>r(brk1)</em>] reduces binding incrementally, mutation of BRK site 2 [<em>r(brk2)</em>] reduces binding still further while mutation of both sites [<em>r(brk1,2)</em>] abolishes binding completely. The biophysical binding of BRK to its DNA sites correlates well with the biological responses caused by the same mutations. B: <em>dpp</em> expression is ventrally repressed in the intact APRD fragment (arrow). C: Mutation of both BRK sites leads to loss of repression and ventral expression of <em>dpp</em> (arrow). D: Mutation of a single BRK site leads to ventral expression of <em>dpp</em> (arrow).</p>
