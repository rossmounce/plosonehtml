                Figure 5.  BRK binding is required to suppress dpp expressionBRK binding sites are located in the R domain of APRD (filled pentagons). SPR analysis shows BRK binding to the intact R domain (R). Mutation of BRK site 1 [r(brk1)] reduces binding incrementally, mutation of BRK site 2 [r(brk2)] reduces binding still further while mutation of both sites [r(brk1,2)] abolishes binding completely. The biophysical binding of BRK to its DNA sites correlates well with the biological responses caused by the same mutations. B: dpp expression is ventrally repressed in the intact APRD fragment (arrow). C: Mutation of both BRK sites leads to loss of repression and ventral expression of dpp (arrow). D: Mutation of a single BRK site leads to ventral expression of dpp (arrow).
