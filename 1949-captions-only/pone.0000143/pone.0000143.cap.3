(A) The number of infected people successfully arriving and entering the community of an at-risk country (<em>K<sub>A</sub>
                     </em>) on each day following the identification of an outbreak of pandemic type strain influenza, assuming a source region population of 5 million, 400 intending travelers per day, <em>R</em> = 1.5, and three levels of symptomatic screening (solid line = nil, dashed line = 50% sensitivity with individual-based removal, dotted line = 50% sensitivity with flight-based quarantining). (B) Corresponding daily probability of initiation (<em>p<sub>d</sub>
                     </em>) as a function of time since pandemic identified. (C) Distribution of the delay time until the initiation (<em>D</em>
                     <sub>1</sub>) of an epidemic in an at-risk country by an infected traveler from a source region.</p>
