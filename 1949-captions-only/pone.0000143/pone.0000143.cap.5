(A) The effects of <em>R</em> on delay-distribution. (B) The effects of daily traveler number on the median delay for different values of <em>R</em>. (C) The effects of the time from symptom incubation until presentation and isolation (<em>t<sub>SP</sub>

(D) Additive effects of implementing 100% sensitive border screening (individual removal), the wearing of masks during transit, immediate presentation following symptom onset, and flight-based quarantining on the median delay, assuming 400 travelers per day attempting to depart the source region.</p>
