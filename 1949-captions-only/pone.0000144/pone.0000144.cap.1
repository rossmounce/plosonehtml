                Figure 1.  Example enzyme mechanisms for the reaction AB. The left panel illustrates the Michaelis-Menten scheme of Equation (8), in which enzyme binds to substrate A, forming a complex C. The product B reversibly dissociates from the complex C, forming unbound enzyme E. The right panel illustrates a more complex mechanism involving three enzyme states E1, E2, and E3. Enzyme kinetic theory assumes that the state transitions follow mass-action kinetics, as described by Equation (8) for the left panel and Equation (23) for the right panel.
