The product B reversibly dissociates from the complex C, forming unbound enzyme E. The right panel illustrates a more complex mechanism involving three enzyme states E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, and E<sub>3</sub>. Enzyme kinetic theory assumes that the state transitions follow mass-action kinetics, as described by Equation (8) for the left panel and Equation (23) for the right panel.</p>
