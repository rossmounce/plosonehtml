                Figure 1.  Mouse plasma cell tumor tissue culture (PCT-TC) signature and survival analysis of human cancer patients27 RNA samples from 17 solid mouse plasma cell tumors and 10 tissue cultured mouse PCT-TC cell lines (including Baf3, a pre-B cell line) were used for the generation of PCT-TC signature. A. Mouse plasma cell tumor tissue culture signature. 1162 genes showing significant differences in expression between solid PCTs and tissue-cultured PCTs were selected by SAM analysis at the 99-percentile confidence level with a 0.001 FDR. Bâ€“D. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of human cancer patients groups generated by unsupervised cluster analysis with mouse PCT-TC signature. B. Survival analysis of human mantle cell lymphoma patients group [12] generated by unsupervised cluster analysis with 694 orthologs of the mouse PCT-TC signature genes. C. Survival analysis of human liver cancer patients [13] generated by unsupervised cluster analysis with 971 orthologs of the mouse PCT-TC signature genes. D. Survival analysis of human breast cancer patients [2], [3], [15] generated by unsupervised cluster analysis with 470 orthologs of the mouse PCT-TC signature genes.
