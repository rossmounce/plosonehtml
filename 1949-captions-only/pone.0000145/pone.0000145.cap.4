                     <strong>A 1–6.</strong> Group B (with good prognosis) vs. the rest (Group A, with bad prognosis) (Predictor 1). <strong>B 1–6.</strong> Subgroup B1 (BEST prognosis) vs. the rest of all (predictor 2). <strong>C 1–6.</strong> Subgroup A2 (WORST prognosis) vs. the rest of all (predictor 3). The differences between groups were significant in log rank test, with p value indicated above each plot.</p>
