                Figure 4.  Kaplan-Meier plots of overall survival with NKI validation set predicted by six different prediction algorithms in 3 independent prediction models.
                     A 1–6. Group B (with good prognosis) vs. the rest (Group A, with bad prognosis) (Predictor 1). B 1–6. Subgroup B1 (BEST prognosis) vs. the rest of all (predictor 2). C 1–6. Subgroup A2 (WORST prognosis) vs. the rest of all (predictor 3). The differences between groups were significant in log rank test, with p value indicated above each plot.
