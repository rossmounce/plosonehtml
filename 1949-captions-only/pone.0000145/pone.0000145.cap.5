                Figure 5.  Defining four distinct survival subgroups of human breast cancer
                     A. Predicted outcomes in NKI test set (148 patients). Kaplan-Meier plot for the representative groups for 6 different prediction algorithms. If a sample was predicted to belong to the test class (black lines) 3 or more times in the 6 different prediction methods, it was assigned to that group. Otherwise that patient/sample remained in “rest of all” (red lines). There were no 3:3 ties for predictor 1. For predictors 2 and 3, ties were assigned to BEST and WORST, respectively. B. Predicted outcomes for combined NKI data sets (295 total patients). Kaplan Meier plots of overall survival of two independent groups identified with two independent analyses (unsupervised clustering in training data set and class prediction in validation set). C. Kaplan-Meier plot of four independent prognostic subtypes generated with the NKI data set. Four independent prognostic subtypes (BEST, GOOD, BAD, and WORST) are assigned as follows. Samples that fell into the Group B (good prognosis group) with predictor 1 (Good vs. Bad) but not assigned to the BEST prognosis group with predictor 2 (BEST vs. all the rest) were assigned to an intermediate group designated GOOD. Similarly, samples that did not fall into Group B (i.e., those that belonged to Group A, the bad prognosis group) with predictor 1 (Good vs. Bad) but not assigned to the WORST prognosis group in predictor 3 (WORST vs. all the rest) were assigned to an intermediate group designated BAD.
