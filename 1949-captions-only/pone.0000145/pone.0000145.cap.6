                Figure 6.  Prediction of breast cancer patients' outcomes based on a combination of gene expression and other criteriaThe outcome groups previously assigned in the literature based on various criteria (ER status [5], [9], pathological tumor grade [6], intrinsic-sub type [14], [17] and 70-gene signature [2], [3]) were reassessed and further stratified using our prediction system. A. Kaplan-Meier plot of ER-positive patients stratified by 3 independent prediction steps. Estrogen receptor-positive patients in the NKI data set were further stratified into the BEST prognosis group (69 patients, 4 deaths), GOOD prognosis group (106 patients, 23 deaths), BAD prognosis group (46 patients, 17 deaths) and WORST prognosis groups (5 patients, 1 death). B. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival analysis of ER-negative groups and 3 ER-positive groups that were further stratified by our 3-step prediction analysis. C. Kaplan-Meier plot for patients with grade II tumors after further stratification with 3 independent prediction steps. 28 patients were assigned to the BEST prognosis subtype, showing a 96% 15-year survival rate (27 out of 28 patients). The 5 patients assigned to the WORST prognosis subtype had only a 20% (1 of 5 patients) 15-year survival. D. Kaplan-Meier plot for intrinsic-sub type. Survival analysis of the complete set of NKI samples (295 patients) previously assigned 5 different breast cancer intrinsic-subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, ERBB2, Basal, and Normal Breast-like) by nearest centroid class prediction. E. Kaplan-Meier plot for patients with intrinsic-subtypes associated with bad prognosis (Basal, ERBB2+, and Luminal B) after further stratification with our 3-step prediction analysis. This predictor revealed 11 patients that fell into the BEST prognosis group (no deaths within 15 years). F. Kaplan-Meier plot for the cell types that could not be assigned (NA) based on correlation coefficients cutting threshold of 0.1. Samples previously not assigned (NA) to any of histological cell types were stratified using our prediction system, revealing subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. G. Kaplan-Meier plot for the poor prognosis group in the 70-gene-based prediction after further stratification with our 3-step prediction analysis.
