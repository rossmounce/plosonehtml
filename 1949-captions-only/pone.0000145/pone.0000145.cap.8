                     <strong>A.</strong> Gene clustering of 295 NKI samples using genes selected by one-way ANOVA class comparisons. A total of 3307 genes that showed significant expression differences (p&lt;1×10<sup>−8</sup>) in a one-way ANOVA analysis were selected. ER expression status and the histo-pathological grade of each tumor sample are shown in grey-scale bars beneath the colored BEST – WORST classification bar. The key to the grey-scale designations is found beneath the heat map. <strong>B.</strong> PathwayAssist<sup>TM</sup>–generated figure showing networks of transcription factors activated by EGF and showing significantly higher expression in tumors from patients in the WORST prognosis group (indicated by red color) compared to the BEST prognosis group. <strong>C.</strong> PathwayAssist<sup>TM</sup>–generated figure showing networks of genes activated by PTGS2 (COX2) and showing significantly lower expression in tumors from patients in the WORST prognosis group (indicated by green color) compared to the BEST prognosis group.</p>
