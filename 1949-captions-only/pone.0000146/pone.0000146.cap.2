                Figure 2. a Apoptosis of CD4+CD25+high T cells in clinical groups measured by YOPRO/7AAD stain combination. CD4+CD25+high T cells in recent-onset and in high at-risk subjects for developing T1D show significantly higher apoptosis levels: Kruskal-Wallis p&lt;0.0001; ANOVA F = 16.07 df 6, 78 p&lt;0.0001. Specifically, Control vs. recent-onset T1D p&lt;0.0001; age-matched control vs. recent-onset p&lt;0.0001; recent-onset T1D vs. long-standing T1D p&lt;0.0001; recent-onset T1D vs. low at-risk p&lt;0.0001; control vs. high at-risk p&lt;0.008; high at-risk vs. long-standing T1D p = 0.01.
b Apoptosis of CD4+CD25âˆ’ T cells measured by YOPRO/7AAD stain combination across studied clinical groups Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.25; ANOVA F = 0.59, df 6, 78, NS. Apoptotic cells are presented on y-axis as YOPRO1+ve.
