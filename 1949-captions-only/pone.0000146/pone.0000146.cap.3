Apoptotic cells are presented on y-axis as YOPRO1+ve. b CD4+CD25+<sup>high</sup> T cells apoptosis in the same subjects using intracellular staining of aaCas3. CD4+CD25+<sup>high</sup> T cells apoptosis from control subjects significantly differs from both recent-onset T1D and high at-risk subjects p = 0.0006 and p = 0.009, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between two apoptosis measurement methods in control and recent-onset T1D subjects is significant r = 0.59 and p = 0.0006. Apoptotic cells are presented on y-axis as aaCas3+ve.</p>
