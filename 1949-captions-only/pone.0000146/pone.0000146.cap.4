                Figure 4. CD4+CD25+high T cells apoptosis levels within FoxP3+ve and FoxP3-ve cell subpopulation across three clinical groups. FoxP3+ve CD4+CD25+high T cells show significantly higher apoptosis level intracellular staining of aaCas3 compared to FoxP3-ve CD4+CD25+high T cells in recent-onset T1D only Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.0066; recent-onset T1D CD4+CD25+high T cells FoxP3+ve vs. FoxP3-ve p = 0.01; FoxP3+ve CD4+CD25+high T cells control vs. FoxP3+ve CD4+CD25+high T cells recent-onset T1D p&lt;0.002. FoxP3-ve CD4+CD25+high T cells control vs. FoxP3-ve CD4+CD25+high T cells recent-onset T1D p = 0.01. Apoptotic cells are presented on y-axis as aaCas3+ve.
