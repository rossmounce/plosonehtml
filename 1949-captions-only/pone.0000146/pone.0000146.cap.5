Control subjects show statistically higher suppression compared to the other three groups recent-onset T1D, high at-risk and longstanding T1D subjects p = 0.0007, p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively. Standardized suppression assay was performed with 1Ã—10<sup>4</sup> responder T cells, 10<sup>4</sup> irradiated PBMCs 5000rad alone and in co-culture with CD4+CD25+<sup>high</sup> T cells in 1:10 ratio, stimulated with aCD3 coated beads 1ug/ml, 3 beads/per cell.</p>
