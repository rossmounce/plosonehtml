                Figure 2.  Gram's staining and molecular identification of Staphylococcus isolate.A. Gram's staining of the clinical Staphylococcus isolate. B. Identification of Staphylococcus subspecies by ITS-PCR analysis of ribosomal DNA in the isolates from natural EE (Lane 1) and experimental EE (Lane 2). C. Examination of exfoliative toxin gene of the Staphylococcus isolate by PCR. Lanes 1 through 5 represent the PCR products of Exh-A, Exh-B, Exh-C, Exh-D and 23s ribosomal DNA, respectively.
