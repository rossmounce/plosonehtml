                     A. Layer identification of proliferative zone on a haematoxylin and eosin, and alcian blue stained growing antler tip section. D, dermis; RM, reserve mesenchyme; PC, precartilage; TZ, transitional zone; C, cartilage. Rectangular box indicates position where tissue was sampled for immunohistochemical localization (Figure 1C). B. Northern blot analysis showing the distribution of NGF (top) and ß-actin (bottom) mRNA in the antler tip. Blots containing 5 µg of poly(A) RNA from each tissue were hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe. Lane 1) E17.5 mouse embryo; Lane 2) C; Lane 3) TZ; Lane 4) PC; Lane 5) RM; Lane 7) D. The positions of RNA size markers (in kb) are indicated (left). C. Immunohistochemical localization on a section of antler tip showing bundles of axons. Serial wax-embedded-sections were labeled with a fluorescent antibody against neurofilament. Fluorescent images have been overlaid onto corresponding bright field view. Axon bundles were not visible when primary antibody was omitted (original size, 10× magnification of original figure).
