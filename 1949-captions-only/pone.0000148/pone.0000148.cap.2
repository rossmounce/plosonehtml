The same method was used as for <a href="#pone-0000148-g001">Figure 1C</a>. Bar = 100 Âµm. A. Montage of a longitudinal section of central antler tip showing axon bundles. Bright field is on left. Corresponding fluorescence on the right showing individual axons in red mainly in the inner reserve mesenchyme (IR), not found in dermis (De), vascular layer (Vs) and outer reserve mesenchyme (OR). B. A bundle of axons was near a blood vessel in the side portion of an intact antler tip. C. Numerous fluorescent-labelled neurofilaments were observed in the reserve mesenchymal layer on the sections from the first two denervated antler tips. D. Positive stained neurofilaments were only sparsely encountered in the third denervated antler tip.</p>
