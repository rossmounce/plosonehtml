                Figure 1. Typical aspects of Baló's concentric sclerosis. (a) Original case of Baló; several anastomoses are located in the lower half of the lesion (from Baló (1928) Arch Neurol Psychiatr 19:242–264). (b) Lesion centered by a veinule showing ring fragmentation in a constrained area (from Hallervorden et al. 1933). (c) Lesion reproduced from Castaigne et al. (1984) Rev Neurol 140:479–487. (d) Progress of the pathologic process from a center located in a constrained area, showing formation of bands (from Behr (1950) Dtsch Z Nervenheilk 164:480–489). Loyez staining (myelin in black, destroyed areas in white); scale bars: 1 cm.
