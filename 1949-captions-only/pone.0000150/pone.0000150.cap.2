                Figure 2. Space laws from 12 measures made on the cases of Baló (1928) Arch Neurol Psychiatr 19:242–264 and Hallervorden et al. [2]. (a) Damaged (dashed line) and preserved (solid line) myelin. (b) Averaged successive positions of destroyed myelin bands (dashed), compared to the classical exponential space law for the Liesegang rings (solid line) obtained from a logarithmic regression; y-axis label in cms. The space law for concentric sclerosis is linear (correlation coefficient r
                     2 = 0,996). In all our mathematical models, the space law strongly depends on the shape of the activating front. As the biological nature of this front is unknown, selection between different scenarios (e.g. preconditioning model vs. local macrophage recruitment model) cannot be based on the space law. However the linear law for concentric sclerosis tends to indicate that an outer diffusing signal is unlikely.
