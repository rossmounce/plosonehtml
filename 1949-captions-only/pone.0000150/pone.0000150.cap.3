                Figure 3. Apparition of concentric patterns under the preconditioning model (1)-(2). The protection factor is given by Heaviside function P(φ) = (q−φ)+ with a given threshold q. (a) We have replaced the preconditioning equation (2) with φ = K*d, the kernel K being a stiff Hill function with a  range of action, . Other parameters are ε = 0,4 and q = 0,1. Interestingly the range of action of the potential φ is larger than in figure 5 whereas the size of the domain is considerably smaller. In fact, this range fully determines the width of the bands. (b) Same illustration with a degenerated potential . Destroyed oligodendrocytes are figured in black. The size of the domain is four times smaller than in figure 4 (axis labels in cms), whereas the action range is similar.
