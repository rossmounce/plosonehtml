Reduced parameters are ε˜ = 0,2, κ/λ = 4, χ˜ = 25 (a) and χ˜ = 8 (b). The pattern diameter is approximatively 4 cm (axis labels in <em>cm</em>s), and the final time is 24 h. These results fit the biological data (see <a href="#pone-0000150-t002">table 2</a>). Destroyed oligodendrocytes are figured in black. The white corners in (b) are boundary artifacts.</p>
