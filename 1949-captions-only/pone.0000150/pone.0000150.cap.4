                Figure 4. Transition between concentric patterns and plaques is driven by the structural parameter χ. Reduced parameters are ε˜ = 0,2, κ/λ = 4, χ˜ = 25 (a) and χ˜ = 8 (b). The pattern diameter is approximatively 4 cm (axis labels in cms), and the final time is 24 h. These results fit the biological data (see table 2). Destroyed oligodendrocytes are figured in black. The white corners in (b) are boundary artifacts.
