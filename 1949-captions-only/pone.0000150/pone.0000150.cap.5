                Figure 5. (a) Bifurcation diagram for fixed reduced parameter ε˜ = 0,1. Only two alternative patterns arise: concentric rings or plaques apparition. (b) Imposed white noise perturbation with relative standard deviation σ = 0,2 to the chemical diffusion coefficient ε˜ = 0,2. Other parameters are χ˜ = 25 and κ/λ = 5. (c) White noise perturbation with relative standard deviation σ = 0,1 to the damaging factor κ/λ = 5. We set ε˜ = 0,2 and χ˜ = 25. Destroyed oligodendrocytes are figured in black. The damaging factor is more sensible to perturbation that the chemical diffusion coefficient; increasing the standard deviation breaks the symmetry of the pattern, except around the origin. Anastomoses are noted in (c) far from the regions affected by the boundary effects.
