                Figure 1.  Role of histone kinases in Tat transactivation.(A) Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of Jurkat T cells containing an integrated HIV promoter in the absence or presence of Tat. Immunoprecipitations were performed with α-phospho-histone H3 antibodies (serine 10) followed by radioactive PCR with primers specific for the HIV LTR, the c-fos, or the β-globin genes. (B) Jurkat 1G5 cells containing an integrated HIV LTR luciferase construct were transiently transfected with Tat/FLAG (25 ng) and kinase-deficient (KD) kinase expression vectors (200 ng). (C) Western blot analysis of cellular lysates from 293 cells cotransfected with the indicated expression plasmids. (D) Transfection of CMV luciferase (25 ng) with the KD RSK2 expression plasmid (200 ng) in Jurkat cells. (E) Transfection of 5xUAS luciferase and Gal4-CDK9 (20 ng) with the KD RSK2 expression plasmid (200 ng) in Jurkat cells. Values are means±SEM of three experiments.
