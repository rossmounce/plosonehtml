                Figure 2.  Superinduction of Tat activity in CLS fibroblasts.(A) Western blot analysis of cellular extracts of fibroblasts from a patient with CLS and control human fibroblasts. (B) Nuclear microinjection of CLS fibroblasts with synthetic Tat (amino acids 1–72), the HIV LTR luciferase reporter, a CMV-GFP expression plasmid, and either the empty vector, an RSK2 expression construct, or a plasmid expressing kinase-deficient RSK2. Values are means±SEM of five experiments. (C) Coinjection of the 5xUAS luciferase reporter, a plasmid expressing the Gal4-VP16 transactivator and CMV-GFP with either the RSK2-expressing plasmid or the vector alone. Values are means±SEM of three experiments.
