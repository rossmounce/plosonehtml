                Figure 3.  Interaction of Tat and RSK2 in vivo and in vitro.
                  (A) Coimmunoprecipitation of RSK2 with Tat in nuclear extracts from Cos7 cells cotransfected with RSK2/HA and Tat/FLAG. One representative experiment of five is shown. (B) Coimmunoprecipitation of Tat with endogenous RSK2 in nuclear extracts from Cos7 cells transfected with Tat/FLAG. Immunoprecipitations were performed three times with α-RSK2 or α-CD71 antibodies as a control. (C) Coimmunoprecipitation of Tat with endogenous RSK2 in Jurkat T cells transduced with an HIV-based lentiviral vector expressing Tat/FLAG from the HIV LTR and in uninfected Jurkat T cells. One experiment of two is shown. (D) In vitro binding of GST-Tat (amino acids 1–86) or Tat mutants to full-length recombinant RSK2. Western blotting of RSK2 before (Input) and after GST binding is shown. One representative experiment of three is shown. (E) Coimmunoprecipitation of RSK2 with wild type Tat, but not with mutant TatF38A, in nuclear extracts of cotransfected Cos7 cells. Results were confirmed in three independent experiments.
