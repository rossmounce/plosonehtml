                Figure 4.  Transcriptional activity of TatF38A.(A) Transfection of indicated amounts of Tat- or TatF38A-expressing constructs in Jurkat 1G5 cells using the DEAE-dextran method. (B) Cotransfection of indicated amounts of Tat or TatF38A with the HIV LTR luciferase (200 ng) and wild type or kinase-deficient RSK2 (200 ng) in CLS cells. Values are meansÂ±SEM of five experiments for wild type and three experiments for mutant Tat.
