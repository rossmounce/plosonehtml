Increasing amounts of <em>in vitro</em> translated RSK2 were included in the binding reaction. (B) Kinase assay of endogenous RSK2 immunoprecipitated from Cos7 cells transfected with wild type Tat/FLAG, TatF38A/FLAG, or empty vector. Values are means±SEM of four experiments. (C) Western blotting of nuclear extracts isolated from Cos7 cells cotransfected with RSK2/HA and Tat/FLAG or with RSK2/HA and Tat F38A/FLAG constructs. Densitometric quantification of the phospho-S227-specific bands was performed using the NIH Image software. (D) Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the Jurkat T cell line A2, latently infected with an HIV-based lentiviral vector expressing Tat/FLAG from the HIV LTR after treatment with TNF-α. At indicated time points, cells were harvested and immunoprecipitations were performed in duplicate with α-phospho-S227 antibodies followed by PCR with primers specific for the HIV LTR or the c-fos gene.</p>
