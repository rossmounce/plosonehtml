                Figure 6.  Suppression of HIV transcription by FMK, a small-molecule inhibitor of RSK2.(A) Transient transfection of Jurkat 1G5 cells, containing an integrated HIV LTR luciferase construct, with Tat/FLAG (20 and 200 ng). Transfected cells were treated with indicated amounts of FMK or DMSO for 18 h. Values are mean±SEM of four experiments. (B) Cotransfection of Jurkat T cells with 5xUAS luciferase and Gal4-CDK9 (20 ng) and subsequent treatment with FMK at indicated concentrations. Values are means±SEM of four experiments. (C) GFP expression in Jurkat T cells infected with HIVNL4-3 containing the GFP open reading frame in place of the viral nef gene or with an HIV-based lentiviral vector expressing GFP from the heterologous EF-1α promoter. After overnight infection, cells were treated with FMK or DMSO for 36 h. Values are means±SEM of three experiments. *p = 0.002 (t test). (D) GFP expression in one representative experiment performed with HIV GFP or HIV (EF-1α) GFP virus.
