                Figure 1. Predictions using the cumulant generating function showing quarter yearly expected percentage values of transmitted resistance due to the Botswana's government treatment plan. The vertical bars represent the possible range of values due to the stochastic fluctuation contained in one standard deviation over the expected percentage. Here, we have assumed that the average progression time to AIDS for HIV infected patients that are treatment-naïve, treated drug-sensitive and drug-resistant are 10, 18 and 12 years respectively [23], [33]; however since our predictions are only for three years our results are robust with respect to this assumption. The untreated and treated drug-sensitive transmissibility coefficient per partnership were calculated, on the basis of the Botswana treatment regimen of a fixed combination of Zidovudine, Lamivudine, and Nevirapine or Efavirenz, to be 0.12 and 0.04 respectively [31], [34], [35] (see Mathematical Details S1 section 1.2 to see how the values of these parameter estimates were derived). The patient population has an average annual probability of developing drug resistance specified by the parameter r, and the transmissibility/fitness of drug-resistant strains is specified by the parameter βR (see Mathematical Details S1 section 1.2 to see how the values of these parameter estimates were derived). The six panels show predictions using the following parameter sets: (A) r−1 = 5 years, βR = 0.03 (B) r−1 = 3 years, βR = 0.03 (C) r−1 = 5 years, βR = 0.06 (D) r−1 = 3 year, βR = 0.06 (E) r−1 = 5 years, βR = 0.12 (F) r−1 = 3 years, βR = 0.12.
