                Figure 2. Empirical data from the Botswana's government treatment program are shown by the filled boxes. The aim of the Botswana ART program is to reach 85,000 patients by 2009 (black dashed line) [8]. The treatment used by our model uses the linear fit shown by the dashed gray line, this gives a constant per capita treatment rate of 0.050 per year.
