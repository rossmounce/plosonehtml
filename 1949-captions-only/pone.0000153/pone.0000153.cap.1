All sequences are aligned to the <em>Drosophila</em> Antennapedia homeodomain. Each <em>Nematostella</em> sequence is grouped with putative bilaterian homologs. The degree of statistical support (bootstrap proporation [BP] or posterior probability [PP]) for each of these homology assignments is indicated separately for the neighbor-joining (NJ), Bayesian (Bayes), and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. The average statistical support for each grouping is indicated in the far right column (NJ-BP+Bayes-PP+ML-BP/3). The dataset is available in Phylip format as <a href="#pone.0000153.s012">Figure S12</a>.</p>
