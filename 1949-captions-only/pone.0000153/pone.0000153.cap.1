                Figure 1. Alignment of homeodomains included in the phylogenetic analyses. All sequences are aligned to the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain. Each Nematostella sequence is grouped with putative bilaterian homologs. The degree of statistical support (bootstrap proporation [BP] or posterior probability [PP]) for each of these homology assignments is indicated separately for the neighbor-joining (NJ), Bayesian (Bayes), and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. The average statistical support for each grouping is indicated in the far right column (NJ-BP+Bayes-PP+ML-BP/3). The dataset is available in Phylip format as Figure S12.
