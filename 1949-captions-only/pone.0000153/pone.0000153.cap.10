The neighbor-joining and Bayesian phylogenies (<a href="#pone-0000153-g002">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#pone.0000153.s001">S1</a>) were pared to remove all bilaterian sequences. The strict consensus topology shown here depicts the relative relationships among <em>Nematostella</em> sequences. Each of the <em>Nematostella</em> Hox-related sequences is coded according to whether its expression is restricted along the primary (O/A) body axis or the secondary (directive) body axis (Y = yes; N = no). A yellow Y in the directive column signifies that the expression is bilateral (both sides of the directive axis), and a red Y indicates that the expression is unilateral. The character state found in the terminal taxon is indicated in the colored boxes. The internal nodes are shaded to indicate the character states found in hypothetical ancestors. For each gene, the spatial expression is depicted on a diagram of the juvenile polyp. In the case of Dlx, anthox6a and anthox1, the expression pattern that is depicted actually occurs earlier, in the larval stage, but it is represented on a diagram of the polyp to facilitate spatial comparisons with the other genes. The polyp is drawn in lateral view with the overlying ectoderm (dark gray) partially peeled away to reveal the underlying endoderm of the body column (light gray) and the lumen of the pharynx (white). The pharynx is drawn as though everted. Only one representative tentacle is shown. The mesoglea, a largely acellular layer of connective tissue that separates the endoderm from the ectoderm, is depicted as a thin black line. Gene expression is depicted as black shading in the endoderm or ectoderm. The major regions along the primary body axis are demarcated with dotted lines: Ph = pharynx; H = head; C = column; F = foot. Cross-sectional views through the body column (at the arrowheads) are shown for Gbx, anthox7, anthox8a, anthox8b, anthox6a, anthox1a, and NVHD065.</p>
