                Figure 2. Homeodomain phylogeny based on neighbor-joining. The cladogram is rooted using the dll sequences. Nematostella sequences are shown in red. Bilaterian sequences are shown in black. Bootstrap proportions are presented at each node. Open circles depict implied gene losses for Nematostella (red) and Branchiostoma (black). Closed circles depict implied lineage-specific gene duplications for Nematostella (red) and Branchiostoma (black). The dataset used in this analysis is available as Figure S12.
