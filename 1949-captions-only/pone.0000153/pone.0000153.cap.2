The cladogram is rooted using the dll sequences. <em>Nematostella</em> sequences are shown in red. Bilaterian sequences are shown in black. Bootstrap proportions are presented at each node. Open circles depict implied gene losses for <em>Nematostella</em> (red) and <em>Branchiostoma</em> (black). Closed circles depict implied lineage-specific gene duplications for <em>Nematostella</em> (red) and <em>Branchiostoma</em> (black). The dataset used in this analysis is available as <a href="#pone.0000153.s012">Figure S12</a>.</p>
