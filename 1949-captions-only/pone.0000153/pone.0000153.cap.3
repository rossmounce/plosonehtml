                Figure 3. Clusters of Hox-related homeobox genes in the Nematostella genome. Based on the current genomic assemblies, thirty ANTP class genes of Nematostella are distributed among seven homeobox clusters [52]. The location of the PRD class gene Dmbx is also shown. The arrangement of the Nematostella genes is shown in relation to the hypothesized "extended Hox cluster," that is presumed to have existed in the most recent common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes (gray box; [127], [128]). Horizontal lines connecting Nematostella genes indicate known genomic linkage. Double-arrows connect Nematostella homeodomains to their putative bilaterian homologs based on phylogenetic analyses of homeodomain sequences (Figure 1; supp figs. 1–2). Detailed diagrams of each of the eight Nematostella homeodomain clusters are presented in supplemental figures 3
