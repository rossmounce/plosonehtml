                Figure 5. Developmental Expression of Hox and ParaHox homologs in Nematostella. Gene expression was assayed throughout embryonic and larval development using in situ hybridization. All images are optical sections that permit visualization of the endodermal tissue layer. Panels A, J, M, P, S, and Y are transverse sections, but all other images are longitudinal sections with the future oral end of the animal facing left. The blastopore, which becomes the mouth, is indicated by an asterisk. Abbreviations are as follows: apical tuft (at); coelenterone (coe); bodywall ectoderm (ecbw); pharyngeal ectoderm (ecph); bodywall endoderm (enbw); pharyngeal endoderm (enph); mesentery (mes); pharynx (pha); tentacle (tn).
