                Figure 6. Mean statistical support for select phylogenetic groupings. The mean statistical support for hypothetical clades linking each of six Nematostella Hox/ParaHox lineages with potential homologs in the Bilateria is depicted graphically. The mean statistical support is the average of the neighbor-joining bootstrap proportion, the Bayesian posterior probability, and the maximum-likelihood bootstrap proportion. It is expressed as a percent of trees in which the given grouping was recovered. Individual Nematostella genes were grouped into lineages (for example, anthox1-anthox1a) when the mean statistical support for the clade uniting them exceeded the mean statistical support for any other competing relationship. The final column depicts the highest support obtained for any pairwise relationship with another cnidarian homeodomain.
