                Figure 7. Hox/ParaHox evolutionary scenarios. The phylogenies drawn here depict six mutually exclusive scenarios regarding the evolution of the Hox and ParaHox genes. Ten distinct Hox and ParaHox lineages are thought to have been present in the ancestral bilaterian (Hox1, Hox2, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5, Hox6–8, Hox9+, Cdx, Gsx, and Xlox). Five distinct Hox/ParaHox lineages are recognized for Nematostella. (Nematostella homeodomains that tend to cluster together in the phylogenetic analyses are grouped together here: anthox1/1a; anthox2/9; anthox6/6a; anthox7/8a/8b.) Assuming no gene loss in the Cnidaria, then the existence of five Hox/ParaHox lineages in Nematostella implies that the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor (CBA) could have possessed as few as one Hox/ParaHox gene (scenario A) or as many as five (scenario E). There is some indication that a central class Hox gene was lost in the Cnidaria [47], and that the CBA may have possessed six distinct Hox/ParaHox genes (scenario F). The ancestral Hox/ParaHox genes present in the CBA are indicated by solid squares. If a particular hypothetical clade is recovered on one or more of the phylogenetic analyses presented here, this is indicated above the relevant branch (NJ = neighbor-joining, Figure 2; Ba = Bayesian inference, Figure S1; ML = maximum- likelihood, Figure S2; φ = none). Below each branch, the average statistical support is indicated (NJ-bootstrap proportion+Bayes-posterior probability+ML-boostrap proportion/3). Each scenario implies a different number of lineage-specific gene losses.
