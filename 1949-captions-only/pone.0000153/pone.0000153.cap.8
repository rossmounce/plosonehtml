                Figure 8. Reconstruction of Hox2 evolution. Portions of the neighbor-joining tree, the maximum-likelihood tree, and the Bayesian tree are redrawn here. The neighbor-joining tree implies that anthox7, 8a, and 8b are direct descendants of the ancestral Hox2 gene in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. No gene loss is required. The maximum-likelihood tree implies that both a Hox2 precursor (square) and an anthox7/8a/8b precursor (circle) were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Hox2 was lost in the line leading to Nematostella, while anthox7/8a/8b ortholog was lost in the line leading to Bilateria. The Bayesian tree implies that a Hox2 precursor (square), a Hox1 parecursor (triangle), and an anthox6/6a precursor were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Hox2 was lost in the line leading to Nematostella, while anthox6/6a was lost in the line leading to Bilateria.
