                     <em>Mu</em> insertion into <em>EXPB1</em> and its effect on Zea m 1 content of pollen. (a) Cartoon showing the structure of <em>EXPB1</em> and location of the <em>Mu</em> insertion (exons denoted with boxes). Also indicated are the locations of primers used for PCR screening. (b) <em>Mu</em> is inserted near the intron border flanking the fourth exon. (c) Portion of a 2-D gel image of wild type (<em>EXPB1</em>) pollen protein showing the Zea m 1 isoforms, which were identified by immunoblotting. (d) Relative amount of total Zea m 1 protein extracted from pollen of <em>EXPB1/EXPB1</em> and <em>expb1/expb1</em> plants. (MeanÂ±SE; N = 2; t = 9.15; p = 0.035).</p>
