                Figure 1. A: The retroviral vector encoding VEGF (pLPCX.VEGF) used in the present study in the generation of HB1.F3, VEGF human neural stem cell line. B: Gene expression of cell type-specific markers as studied by RT-PCR in F3 and F3.VEGF human neural stem cell lines. Both F3 and F3.VEGF human neural stem cell lines express cell type specific markers NF-L, NF-M and NF-H, an astrocyte marker GFAP and VEGF, while they do not express MBP, a cell type marker of oligodendrocytes.
