Results from the ELISA assay for human VEGF indicate that the levels of VEGF in spent media from F3.VEGF cell line are 5 times over those of F3 cell line (E). Levels of VEGF production in brain sections isolated from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mice grafted with F3 or F3.VEGF human neural stem cells (F). VEGF levels are significantly higher in the F3.VEGF-transplanted mice 2 weeks and 8 weeks post-transplantation as compared with ICH mice grafted with F3 cell line. *: P&lt;0.001, **: P&lt;0.05</p>
