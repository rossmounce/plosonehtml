                Figure 3. Double immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrating β-gal+/VEGF+ F3 cells (A–C) and β-gal+/VEGF+ F3.VEGF cells (D–F) in the hemorrhage core borders 8 weeks post-transplantation. A markedly higher number of β-gal+/VEGF+ cells were found in the brain region grafted with F3.VEGF cells. Bar indicates 50 µm.
