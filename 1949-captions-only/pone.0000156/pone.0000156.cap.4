                Figure 4. Behavioral improvement demonstrated in mice with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) transplanted with F3 or F3.VEGF human neural stem cell lines. A: Rotarod test. F3.VEGF-transplanted group showed better performance than PBS controls or F3-transplanted group from 8 days on, and these benefits continued up to 8 weeks post-transplantation (P&lt;0.001). B: In the modified limb placement test, F3.VEGF-transplanted group showed better performance than PBS or F3-transplanted group (P&lt;0.001).
