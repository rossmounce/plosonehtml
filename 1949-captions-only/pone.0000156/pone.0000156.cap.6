A large number of LacZ+ F3.VEGF human neural stem cells were found to migrate to contralateral side of hemisphere via corpus callosum (A). Higher magnification of migrating F3.VEGF cells is also shown (B–D). LacZ+ F3.VEGF cells differentiate into neurons as shown by β-gal+/NF-L+ (E–G), β-gal+NF-H+ (H–J) and β-gal/MAP2 (K–M) and also into astrocytes as demonstrated by β-gal+/GFAP+ staining (N–P). Bar indicates 50 µm.</p>
