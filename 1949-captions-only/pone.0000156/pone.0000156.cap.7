                Figure 7. A promoted angiogenesis in hemorrhage lesion by transplanted F3 (A–C) and F3.VEGF (D–F) human NSCs was demonstrated by double immunofluorescence staining of human motochondria (HuMit, green) and von Willebrandt factor (vWF, red). Number of microvessels immunoreaction-positive for von Willebrandt factor is significantly increased in F3.VEGF group as compared with control F3 group. Bar indicates 50 µm. * P&lt;0.001
