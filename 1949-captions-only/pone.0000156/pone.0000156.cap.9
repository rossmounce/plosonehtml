                Figure 9. Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins, including proapoptotic proteins, (caspase 3 and Bax), antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL), and cell survival signal molecules (PI3-kinase p85, PI3 kinase p110 and Akt1) in ICH brains receiving transplantationof F3 and F3.VEGF human neural stem cells. A significantly decreased expression of caspase 3 and bax is found in ICH-F3.VEGF group at 2 and 8 weeks post-transplantation. In ICH animals receiving F3.VEGF grafts, the expression of antiapototic proteins and signal molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, PI3-K p85, PI3-K p110 and Akt1 is markedly increased.
