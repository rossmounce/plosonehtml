A significantly decreased expression of caspase 3 and bax is found in ICH-F3.VEGF group at 2 and 8 weeks post-transplantation. In ICH animals receiving F3.VEGF grafts, the expression of antiapototic proteins and signal molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, PI3-K p85, PI3-K p110 and Akt1 is markedly increased.</p>
