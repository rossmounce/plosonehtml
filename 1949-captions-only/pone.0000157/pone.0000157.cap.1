                Figure 1. Typical high-resolution 1H NMR spectrum of the brain extract from a Mecp2-deficient mouse (water-soluble metabolites). The entire spectral region of interest (upper left spectrum) as well as magnified subregions are shown. Creatinine (Crn) was not quantified since the weak singlet was not sufficiently separated from other peaks forming a broad hump between 3.01 and 3.06 ppm. Abbreviations: ac, acetate; ala, alanine; asp, aspartate; Cho, choline; Cr, creatine; GABA, Î³-aminobutyrate; gln, glutamine; glu, glutamate; gly, glycine; GPC, glycerophosphocholine; lac, lactate; myo-Ins, myo-inositol; NAA, N-acetylaspartate; NANA, N-acetylneuraminate; PC, phosphocholine; scyllo-Ins, scyllo-inositol; suc, succinate; tau, taurine.
