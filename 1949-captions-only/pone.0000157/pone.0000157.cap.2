                Figure 2. Typical high-resolution 31P NMR spectrum of the brain extract from a Mecp2-deficient mouse (phospholipids). The entire PL region (upper left spectrum) as well as magnified subregions are shown. Processing parameters were varied to highlight important spectral details. Abbreviations: AAPtdC, alkyl-acyl-phosphatidylcholine; AAPtdE, alkyl-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine; CL, cardiolipin; PLx,y, unassigned phospholipids; PtdI, phosphatidylinositol; PtdA, phosphatidic acid; PtdC, (diacyl)phosphatidylcholine; PtdCplasm, choline plasmalogen; PtdE, (diacyl)phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdEplasm, ethanolamine plasmalogen; PtdG, phosphatidylglycerol; PtdS, phosphatidylserine; SM, sphingomyelin.
