Bayesian consensus tree generated by a GTR invariant-sites plus Γ model applied to our concatenated dataset (69 long and 109 short sequences; see text for details). Posterior probability values ≥95% are shown. Species in blue reflect sequences that are 1050 bp in length, whereas those in black correspond to the 300 bp sequences. Grey branches indicate sequences with &gt;98% homology in their respective genomes. For species lacking whole genome sequencing projects, that is manatee, hyrax, golden mole, sloth, bat, among others, yellow is used to indicate pairs of sequences with &gt;98% homology. This yields a minimum estimate of the number of copies of potentially recently active L1 in these species. A species key shows the abbreviated names, scientific names and common names. The tree is broken into two sections. The inset shows which part of the tree is displayed.</p>
