Bayesian consensus tree generated by a GTR invariant-sites plus Γ model applied to our long (1050 bp) dataset that included 69 sequences. Posterior probability values ≥95% are shown. Grey branches indicate sequences with &gt;98% homology to other LINE-1 copies in their respective genomes. A species key shows the abbreviated names, scientific names and common names.</p>
