C4BP + sCD154 reduced apoptosis to control levels (p&lt;0.005) whereas C4BP had no effect on TDC induced apoptosis (81.5%+/−6.7). C4BP/sCD154 also had no effect on TDC mediated apoptosis (data not shown) Panel b and c show representative cytospins stained for fragmented DNA using ISEL. Panel d) Histogram summary of the effects of sCD154 and C4BP on Cholangiocyte proliferation. Primary human cholangiocytes were cultured in 24-well culture plates and simulated with either sCD154, C4BP or a mixture of both. Following incubation for 24 hours, the cells were fixed and proliferation assessed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 antigen. No significant difference was seen between the un-stimulated controls and treated samples, implying that sCD154, C4BP or the mixture had any effect on cholangiocyte proliferation. These data represent the mean of three different counted areas per well repeated for three different liver preparations.</p>
