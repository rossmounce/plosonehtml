                Figure 2. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) analysis â€“ This figure shows the sensogram for interactions between immobilised CD40, sCD154 (10 ug/ml) and C4BP (40 ug/ml). The human CD40 fusion protein was immobilised onto an activated CM5 chip and sCD154, C4BP or a mixture of both was flowed across the surface of the chip in various combinations allowing adequate time for both association and dissociation events. The chip was regenerated using between experiments using 2 M glycine. Any change in surface plasmon resonance due to binding of the soluble proteins to the immobilised CD40 was seen as a change in response units on the sensogram.
