                Figure 3. Biacore analysis â€“ Panel a) This figure shows the sensogram trace for the titration of C4BP binding across immobilised CD40. CD40 fusion protein was immobilised on an activated CM5 chip, to yield 2000, 500 and 100 response units on three separate channels. Soluble C4BP was then flowed across the surface of the chip at increasing concentrations. The chip was regenerated between the different concentrations using 2M glycine. No binding or dose-response was seen. The integrity of the CD40 was confirmed by the determining the ability of the receptor to subsequently bind sCD154. Panel b) This figure shows the sensogram for sCD154 binding to immobilised C4BP. C4BP was immobilised on an activated CM5 research grade chip. sCD154 was then flowed across the chip at increasing concentrations up to 10 ug/ml. The chip was regenerated between concentrations using 2 M glycine. Dose dependent binding of sCD154 was observed across the concentration range. No binding was observed with an irrelevant fusion protein (data not shown).
