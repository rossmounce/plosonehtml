C4BP and sCD154 were incubated together at 37Â°C for 1 hour. After this time the solution was eluted on a Sepacryl-300 with 100 ul fractions collected up to a final eluted volume of 20 ml, which encompassed void volume through to the lower limit of the fractionation range ( Dextran blue to cytochrome C). Fractions were assayed for the presence of sCD154 using a commercially available ELISA kit.</p>
