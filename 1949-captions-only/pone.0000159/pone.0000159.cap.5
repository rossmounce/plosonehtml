                Figure 5. Representative Western blots showing NFkB, c-Fos and c-Jun and pSTAT 3 levels in response to CD154/C4BP stimulation. Aliquots of nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts as appropriate (40 ug protein) from cultured and stimulated primary human cholangiocytes were probed for NFkB (panel I); c-Fos and c-Jun(panel II) or pSTAT3 content. Blots were stripped and re-probed for beta-actin which allowed for normalisation of data for variations in protein loading.
