Changes in levels were assessed by densitometric analysis. These data show that the CD154/C4BP complex had no significant influence upon levels of NFkB or c-Jun, but did decrease levels of c-Fos at 24 hours compared with either unstimulated 24 hour control or the stimulated level observed at 4 hours. *p&lt;0.05 a p&lt;0.05These data show that stimulation of cells with CD154/C4BP complex resulted in a lower level of pSTAT3 which was sustained at 24 hours. *p&lt;0.05 c.f. time point matched untreated control a p&lt;0.05 c.f. treatment matched 4 hour time point.</p>
