This figure shows three representative sections of liver tissue stained for C4BP. Panel a shows normal liver tissue which is predominantly negative. Panel b shows PSC liver tissue showing the presence of strongly staining inflammatory cells surrounding the portal tract and within the sinusoids. Panel c shows hepatic tumour tissue taken from a hepatic resection for secondary liver cancer (colorectal hepatic metastasis) where very strong staining was observed in the tumour tissue and the inflammatory infiltrate at the tumour margin.</p>
