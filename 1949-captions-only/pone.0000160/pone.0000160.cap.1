                Figure 1. Influence of increasing the number of loci sampled per individual on the coalescent estimates of θ (0.1, 0.01, 0.001): (A) improvement in accuracy (mean2/variance), loci sampled are 1 kb in length; (B) improvement in squared coefficient of variation ((standard deviation/mean)2), loci sampled are 1 kb in length; (C) accuracy, loci sampled are 5 kb in length, θ = 0.001 (see text); (D) squared coefficient of variation, loci are 5 kb in length (see text).
