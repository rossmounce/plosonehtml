                Figure 1. Shown is a bar graph of the cumulative GI data evaluating MAP ATCC 19698. Each drug dilution was studied in duplicate. Error bars are SD. There are three control inoculations, labeled on the abscissa as “0, 00 &amp; 000. The left hand “0” had an equal number of CFU's as in each drug studied. “00”  =  10 &amp; “000”  =  100 fold dilutions. In each control the maximum concentration of diluent used for each agent (methanol for Clarithromycin, water for ampicillin and NaOH for methotrexate and 6-MP) was added. Clarithromycin is most effective and ampicillin is the least effective at decreasing MAP growth. Both methotrexate and 6-MP are as effective as clarithromycin in MAP %−ΔcGI at a dose of 4 µg/ml.
