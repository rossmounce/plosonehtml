Each drug dilution was studied in duplicate. Error bars are SD. There are three control inoculations, labeled on the abscissa as “0, 00 &amp; 000. The left hand “0” had an equal number of CFU's as in each drug studied. “00”  =  10 &amp; “000”  =  100 fold dilutions. In each control the maximum concentration of diluent used for each agent (methanol for Clarithromycin, water for ampicillin and NaOH for methotrexate and 6-MP) was added. Clarithromycin is most effective and ampicillin is the least effective at decreasing MAP growth. Both methotrexate and 6-MP are as effective as clarithromycin in MAP %−<em>Δ</em>cGI at a dose of 4 µg/ml.</p>
