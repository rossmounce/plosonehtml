                Figure 2. A composite graph of the four bacterial strains studied. “0” is diluent control with an equal CFU inoculum and “00” is a 1:10 dilution of the water control inoculum. Drug concentrations are indicated on the abscissa. For each isolate, drug dose was studied in singlicate. For all four bacteria, clarithromycin has achieved maximal inhibition by 1 µg/ml. For MAP ATCC 19698, replicating data presented in Figure 1, both methotrexate and 6-MP %−ΔGI is the same as for clarithromycin by 4 µg/ml. Note that with the other MAP isolate (Dominic) and both M. avium isolates, methotrexate is more effective at a lower dose than is 6-MP. The lower cumulative GI (seen on the ordinate) for the M. avium isolates is ascribable to their more rapid growth and earlier reaching the off scale BACTEC GI values of “999.”
