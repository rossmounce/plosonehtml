Drug concentrations are indicated on the abscissa. For each isolate, drug dose was studied in singlicate. For all four bacteria, clarithromycin has achieved maximal inhibition by 1 µg/ml. For MAP ATCC 19698, replicating data presented in <a href="#pone-0000161-g001">Figure 1</a>, both methotrexate and 6-MP %−<em>Δ</em>GI is the same as for clarithromycin by 4 µg/ml. Note that with the other MAP isolate (Dominic) and both <em>M. avium</em> isolates, methotrexate is more effective at a lower dose than is 6-MP. The lower cumulative GI (seen on the ordinate) for the <em>M. avium</em> isolates is ascribable to their more rapid growth and earlier reaching the off scale BACTEC GI values of “999.”</p>
