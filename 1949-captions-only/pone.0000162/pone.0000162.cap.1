                Figure 1.  Recombination analysis of SSR activity on stably transfected ES cells.(A) Schematic diagram of SSR reporter assay system. A ΦC31 β-galactosidase reporter ES cell line was constructed at the ROSA26 locus [14], except that the stop cassette was flanked by minimal 35 bp attB and 39 bp attP target DNA recognition sites[10]. These ES cells were used to generate a ΦC31 reporter mouse strain. (B) ES reporter cell lines for Cre [14], FLP [16], and ΦC31 (described within) were stably co-transfected with linearized SSR and PGKHygromycin. SSR-mediated recombination activity was assessed on hygromycin-resistant ES cell colonies by X-gal (Cre and ΦC31) and AP staining (FLP). Variable degrees of recombination were observed in colonies, as judged by the percentage of cells reacting with X-Gal; representative ES cell colonies are shown. N.D.- not detected.
