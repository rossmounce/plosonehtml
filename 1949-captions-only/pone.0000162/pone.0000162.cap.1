A ΦC31 β-galactosidase reporter ES cell line was constructed at the ROSA26 locus <a href="#pone.0000162-Soriano1">[14]</a>, except that the stop cassette was flanked by minimal 35 bp attB and 39 bp attP target DNA recognition sites<a href="#pone.0000162-Groth1">[10]</a>. These ES cells were used to generate a ΦC31 reporter mouse strain. (B) ES reporter cell lines for Cre <a href="#pone.0000162-Soriano1">[14]</a>, FLP <a href="#pone.0000162-Awatramani1">[16]</a>, and ΦC31 (described within) were stably co-transfected with linearized SSR and PGKHygromycin. SSR-mediated recombination activity was assessed on hygromycin-resistant ES cell colonies by X-gal (Cre and ΦC31) and AP staining (FLP). Variable degrees of recombination were observed in colonies, as judged by the percentage of cells reacting with X-Gal; representative ES cell colonies are shown. N.D.- not detected.</p>
