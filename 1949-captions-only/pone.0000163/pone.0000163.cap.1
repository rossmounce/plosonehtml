The experiments were performed in quintuplicate measurements. 1a. Cell dispensing with sciFlexarrayer robot arrayer. 1b Zoom on the assembled mosaic of images corresponding to A10 clone after 6 h exposure to ten doses of Arsenate in quintuplicate (columns); the Hsp induction is monitored by the green EGFP signal, cell nucleus is stained in blue by Hoechst and cell cytoplasm is stained in red by Phalloïdin. 1c: Heterogeneity in cell response is illustrated by an example of Hsp response to 5 10<sup>−5</sup> M Arsenate exposure. Scale bar represents 500 µm. Fully automated image capture with a 10× objective and dedicated image analysis were performed using the same detection protocols by IMSTAR Pathfinder™ Cellscan system. All cells were individually segmented (contour highlighted in white) to extract information (signal intensity, morphology) on every single cell within each drop.</p>
