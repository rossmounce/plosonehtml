A sample image among the quintuplicate experiments is shown for the control and four toxic concentrations around the maximum EGFP induction zone (orange). 2b. After cell detection and cell counting cell viability is plotted versus the log scale of toxic dose with 0M control plotted as 10<sup>−7</sup> M data point. The error bars correspond to the STD of the five replicate independent experiments and are illustrating the variability of the measure. The values for IC50 (cell number) calculated by linear regression on the linear phases of the curves of two independent experiments are displayed below the graphs.</p>
