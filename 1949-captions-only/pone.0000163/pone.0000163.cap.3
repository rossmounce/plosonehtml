Roundness ( = R<sup>2</sup> п/area); 3d. EGFP-Gray Level (GL) intensity. At doses greater than 100 µM, too few cells remained to be considered for statistic analysis (grey shading). As on <a href="#pone-0000163-g002">figure 2</a> the concentration of the chemicals on x-axis is plotted in log scale and the 0 M control has been replaced by 10<sup>−7</sup> M value. For each parameter the values for IC50parameter were calculated by linear regression on the linear phases of the curves of two independent experiments and are displayed below the graphs when applicable (significant response to toxic insult, NA not applicable otherwise).</p>
