Area; 4b. Shape Index; 4c. Roundness) were examined versus the distribution of the EGFP Grey Level intensity in <em>hsp22</em>-HepG2 bioassay cells treated with 0, 20 µM and 50 µM Arsenate. All detected cells within the five independent experiments are aggregated. In the absence of toxic (0 M; red points) around 500 detected cells indicate that cell bodies are spanned over a wide range of size, and present diverse morphologies including irregular and multi-poded (High shape index). In the presence of increasing concentration of the toxic (20 µM, orange triangles; 50 µM, green crosses), the cells tend to get smaller and to present a smaller shape index, thus a simpler morphology.</p>
