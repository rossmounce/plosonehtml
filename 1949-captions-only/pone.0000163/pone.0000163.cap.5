                Figure 5.  High Content KS curves analysis.The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) score has been calculated comparing the population distribution of all the cells at the tested Arsenate concentrations to the population distribution of all the cells in the 0 M control. KS test is independent on sample size and value scale. KS test does not presuppose any hypothesis on parameter distribution such as Normality. KS increases as the difference in distribution between the two compared populations increases (identical = 0; maximum difference = 1). KS curves have been plotted as dose-response with Arsenate dose in log scale on the x-axis. On the y-axis, the KS scores for different parameters are displayed as fitted curves. Differences are considered significant as KS is greater than 0.2 threshold and p values are indicated by stars (* = p&lt;0.005, ** = p&lt;0.00005, *** = p&lt;0.0000005).
