                Figure 2.  Binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the p16INK4a promotor.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) was performed using nuclear extracts (NE) from young (Y) or senescent (S) 2BS cells and radiolabeled oligo I (A) or oligo II (B). Competition was performed in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the cold synthetic oligos (Comp) as indicated. The major specific complexes are indicated as a, b and c. The presence of Sp1 and Sp3 in the DNA-protein complexes was monitored by the disappearance of the retarded bands in the presence of antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 (supershift).
