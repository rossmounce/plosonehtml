Competition was performed in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the cold synthetic oligos (Comp) as indicated. The major specific complexes are indicated as a, b and c. The presence of Sp1 and Sp3 in the DNA-protein complexes was monitored by the disappearance of the retarded bands in the presence of antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 (supershift).</p>
