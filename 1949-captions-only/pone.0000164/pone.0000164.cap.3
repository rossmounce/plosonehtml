                Figure 3.  Sp1/Sp3 bound to the GC boxes containing region in the p16INK4a gene promoter in 2BS cells.A and B. ChIPs assays of young (Y: PD27) and senescent (S: PD60) 2BS cells using antibodies against Sp1 (A) or Sp3 (B), antibody against Î²-actin was used as irrelevant control (Nc). (C) Senescent (S: PD60) 2BS cells were treated with MTR in the dosage indicated, 24 hours later, cells were harvested and subjected to ChIP assays. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
