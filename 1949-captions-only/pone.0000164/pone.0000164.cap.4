                Figure 4.  Effect of Sp1 and Sp3 on p16INK4a promoter activity.The reporter construct pGL3-620 was co-transfected with pCMV-Sp1 or/and pCMV-Sp3 or control vector along with pRL-CMV in young (A) and senescent (B) 2BS cells. Luciferase assays were performed and normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity. The meanÂ±S.E. from three independent experiments was used to express the relative luciferase activity.
