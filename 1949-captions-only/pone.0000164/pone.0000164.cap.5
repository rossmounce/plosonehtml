                Figure 5.  Effect of MTR on the transcriptional activity of the p16INK4a gene promoter.Young (A) and senescent (B) 2BS cells were transfected with pGL3-620. 24 hours after transfection, cells were exposed to different dosage of MTR (M-A) as indicated for 24 more hours and subjected to luciferase activity assays. The data represent the meansÂ±S.E. of five independent experiments.
