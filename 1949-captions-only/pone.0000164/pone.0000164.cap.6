                Figure 6.  Expressions of p16INK4a mRNA and protein are inhibited by MTR treatment.Young (Y) and senescent (S) 2BS cells were either treated with 100 nM MTR (MTR) for 24 hr or left untreated, total RNA and protein were prepared and subjected to analyze the expression of indicated genes by Northern blotting (A) and Western blotting (B), respectively.
