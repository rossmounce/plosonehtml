                Figure 9.  Influence of Sp1 levels on SA-β-Gal activity.2BS/pCMV (A), 2BS/ pCMV-Sp1 (B), 2BS/pSliencer (C), 2BS/si-Sp1 (D), (all above at PD 40), untransfected young (PD 27) (E), middle-aged (PD 48) (F), and senescent (PD 56) (G) 2BS cells were cultured and then stained to assess SA-β-Gal activity.
