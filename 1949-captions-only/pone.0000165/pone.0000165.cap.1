                Figure 1.  Deterministic prediction of the parameter ranges where epidemic enhancement may be observed.The range of parameter values (grey) for a population size of N = 50,000 and the initial condition (S0,I0
                     ) = (N−1, 1) which demonstrate the behavior of an initial epidemic which dies out (there exists t&gt;0 such that It&lt;1) followed by persistence upon reintroduction (I*&gt;1), depending on the level of population turnover between pathogen extinction and reintroduction. R0
                      is the basic reproductive number of the pathogen in a naïve host population; ρ is the duration of infectiousness relative to the average duration of immunity. Stars represent parameter values taken from the literature for a variety of common and emerging infectious diseases. Note that the x-axis is shown on a log scale. Parameter values used, estimated ranges of parameter values, and references are given in Table S1.
