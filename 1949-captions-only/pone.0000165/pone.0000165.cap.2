Black spaces show where enhancement occurs; that is, &gt;15% of epidemics in partially immune population are longer (top row) or larger (bottom row) than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of epidemics in a naïve population. Grey spaces show the area where 5–15% of the epidemics in the partially immune population are longer or larger than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of epidemics in a naive population (so vaccination has little or no effect in either direction). The simulation was run 500 times for introduction into a naïve population for each set of parameter values, and these runs were used to determine the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile for epidemic duration and size; the pathogen was considered to persist if it remained in the population for ≥300 disease generations. The simulation was then run 500 times for each of the levels of initial population immunity (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%) in the portion of parameter space for which the pathogen did not persist in the naïve population. The total population size is <em>N</em> = 50,000.</p>
