                Figure 3.  Enhancement of epidemic duration for diseases in human populations.Epidemic duration in a population of N = 50,000 individuals for a variety of human pathogens as a function of population immunity at introduction. Solid lines show the median duration in disease generations for 1,000 simulation runs at each level of initial population immunity; dashed lines show quartiles. Each pathogen shows some level of enhancement of epidemic duration with increased immunity except pertussis. Enhancement of epidemic size is not observed for these pathogens for N = 50,000.
