Solid lines show the median duration in disease generations for 1,000 simulation runs at each level of initial population immunity; dashed lines show quartiles. Each pathogen shows some level of enhancement of epidemic duration with increased immunity except pertussis. Enhancement of epidemic size is not observed for these pathogens for <em>N</em> = 50,000.</p>
