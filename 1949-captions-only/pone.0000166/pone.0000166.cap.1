                Figure 1.  Brain imaging of the rejection process in patient 3 and its reversion under treatment.Magnetic resonance imaging and metabolic activity using 18F-deoxyglucose before surgery (T0), during the rejection process (T1) and after 6 months of reinstated immunosuppressive treatment (T2) are shown separately (upper and middle panel, respectively), then co-registered (lower panel). The white arrow indicates the right striatum. The false colour scale shows levels of metabolic activities from lowest (min) to highest (max).
