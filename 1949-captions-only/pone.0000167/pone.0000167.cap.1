                Figure 1.  Anxiety-like behavior in GluR5−/− mice. (A) GluR5−/− mice (n = 17) spent significantly less time in the open arms of the EPM compared to wild-type mice (n = 10). (B) The total number of arm entries (open+closed) was decreased in GluR5−/− mice but there was no difference in closed arm entries (C) between genotypes. (D) From left to right: Diagram of the EPM, filled boxes = closed arms, open boxes = open arms; representative traces showing the movement of wild-type and GluR5−/− mice in the EPM for 5 mins. (E) GluR5−/− mice (n = 8) spent significantly less time in the light half of the chamber compared to wild-type mice (n = 6). (F) No significant difference was detected in the distance traveled in the open field. * P&lt;0.05. (G) While open arm exploration was not affected by 1 mg/kg ATPA (n = 5), 5.0 mg/kg (n = 7) and 10.0 mg/kg (n = 10) ATPA significantly increased the time spent in the open arms compared to mice receiving saline (n = 9). (H) There was no difference in the number of total arm entries across treatment groups.
