Pharmacological inhibition of GluR5 receptors in the amygdala affected behavioral anxiety.(A) Mice injected with LY382884 (n = 7, 4 µg/µl) spent significantly less time in the open arms of the EPM compared to vehicle injected mice (n = 8). (B) There was no difference in the number of total arm entries between groups. (C) Cannula tip placement in mice injected with Vehicle (blue circles) or LY382884 (red squares) in the BLA.
