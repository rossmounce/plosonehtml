(B and C) Nissl-stained coronal section through the BLA of representative wild-type (B) and GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> (C) mice. No obvious anatomical differences between these two strains were detected. (D and E) ATPA (3 µM)-induced current in interneurons (n = 5) is significantly larger than that observed in pyramidal neurons (n = 6). (F) Interneurons were identified by their morphology and firing properties. Lucifer yellow (0.1%) was loaded through the patch pipette and confocal images were obtained after recording. A representative interneuron is shown in the inset (scale bar, 20 µM). When injected with current steps that ranged from −100 pA to 100 pA within 400 ms, interneurons showed fast spiking properties (top trace). In the same neuron, bath application of ATPA (3 µM) induced neuronal depolarization and firing of the interneuron (lower trace). Resting membrane potential for this neuron is −52.3 mV and holding current is 18.5 pA. (G) Pyramidal neurons showed different firing properties from those observed in interneurons after current injection (top trace; representative shown in the inset, scale bar, 20 µM). In the same neuron, bath-application of ATPA (3 µM) induced hyperpolarization and reduced the neuronal firing (lower trace). Resting membrane potential for this neuron was −66.6 mV and the holding current was 66.9 pA. (H) Pooled data showed that ATPA (3 µM) increased firing rate of interneurons (n = 6) while decreased that of pyramidal neurons (n = 5). Bath application of picrotoxin (100 µM) completely blocked the effect of ATPA in pyramidal neurons but not in interneurons. (I) Bath application of picrotoxin (100 µM) completely abolished the hyperpolarization in pyramidal neurons (n = 5) but not depolarization in interneurons (n = 5) induced by ATPA (3 µM). * P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.</p>
