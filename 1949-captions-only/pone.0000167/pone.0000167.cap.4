The top trace represents sIPSCs recorded before, during and after ATPA application. The bottom 3 traces are presented at an expanded scale. (B and C) Time course for the ATPA-induced enhancement of sIPSC frequency and amplitude in the neuron shown in (A). Note the effect of ATPA is reversible. (D) The facilitatory effect of ATPA on sIPSC frequency is concentration dependent (0.03 µM, n = 6; 0.3 µM, n = 5; 3 µM, n = 7). (E) The effect of ATPA (3 µM) could be blocked by LY293558 (30 µM, n = 4) or in GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 4), suggesting that the ATPA's action is mediated by GluR5. *Indicates a significant difference from control without treatment of ATPA. (F and G) ATPA (3 µM) had little effect on either frequency or amplitude of sEPSCs (n = 5). (H and I) A representative trace (F) and time course of drug effect (G) showing that TTX (1 µM) fully reversed the enhancement of sIPSC induced by ATPA treatment (3 µM). Similar results were obtained from an additional 4 neurons. (J and K) In the presence of TTX (1 µM), ATPA did not affect either amplitude or frequency of mIPSCs. Three concentrations of ATPA were used and none had significant effects on sIPSC frequency or amplitude (0.1 µM, n = 7; 0.3 µM, n = 6; and 3 µM, n = 7).</p>
