                Figure 5.  Endogenous activation of GluR5 increases GABA release and tonic GABA current in the BLA.(A) Representative traces of LY293558 (30 µM) modulation of sIPSCs in a BLA pyramidal neuron. (B) Cumulative probability plot showing that LY293558 application decreased sIPSC frequency in the neuron showed in (A). (C) Pooled data showing that LY293558 reduced the frequency of sIPSCs in wild-type mice. GluR5−/− showed the decreased sIPSC frequency compared that in wild-type mice. * P&lt;0.05 compare with GluR5−/− mice, # P&lt;0.05 compared with control without LY293558 application in wild-type mice. (D) Perfusion of bicuculline (10 µM) induced a baseline shift (the tonic GABA current) in BLA neurons from both wild-type and GluR5−/− mice. (E) Tonic GABAergic current was reduced in BLA pyramidal neurons of GluR5−/− mice (wild-type, n = 12; GluR5−/−, n = 11). In the presence of LY293558 (30 µM), tonic GABA current was also significantly reduced (n = 9). * P&lt;0.05 compare with GluR5−/− mice, # P&lt;0.01 compared with control without LY293558 application in wild-type mice. (F) Bath application of TTX (1 µM) induced tonic GABAergic current in wild-type mice (n = 8). In GluR5−/− mice (n = 8), the TTX-induced tonic current is smaller than that in wild-type mice. Further application of bicuculline caused the similar tonic current in both mice. * P&lt;0.05.
