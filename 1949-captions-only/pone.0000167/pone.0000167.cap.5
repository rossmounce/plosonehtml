(B) Cumulative probability plot showing that LY293558 application decreased sIPSC frequency in the neuron showed in (A). (C) Pooled data showing that LY293558 reduced the frequency of sIPSCs in wild-type mice. GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> showed the decreased sIPSC frequency compared that in wild-type mice. * P&lt;0.05 compare with GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice, # P&lt;0.05 compared with control without LY293558 application in wild-type mice. (D) Perfusion of bicuculline (10 µM) induced a baseline shift (the tonic GABA current) in BLA neurons from both wild-type and GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice. (E) Tonic GABAergic current was reduced in BLA pyramidal neurons of GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (wild-type, n = 12; GluR5<sup>−/−</sup>, n = 11). In the presence of LY293558 (30 µM), tonic GABA current was also significantly reduced (n = 9). * P&lt;0.05 compare with GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice, # P&lt;0.01 compared with control without LY293558 application in wild-type mice. (F) Bath application of TTX (1 µM) induced tonic GABAergic current in wild-type mice (n = 8). In GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 8), the TTX-induced tonic current is smaller than that in wild-type mice. Further application of bicuculline caused the similar tonic current in both mice. * P&lt;0.05.</p>
