                Figure 6.  Activation of GluR5 in the BLA affected the output to the CeM in the amygdala.(A) Diagram showing the placement of the stimulating electrode (Sti) and drug puff-application pipette (Puff) in the BLA as well as recording electrode (Rec) in the CeM (left). A typical late-firing neuron showed the delayed firing properties in respond to current steps that from −50 pA to 75 pA within 400 ms (right). Resting membrane potential for this neuron is −63.3 mV. Scale bar, 15 mV and 80 ms. Lower traces showing evoked responses in a CeM neuron by electric stimulation in the BLA. At holding potential of −45 mV, biphasic responses were observed and CNQX application could block both of them. At holding potential of −70 mV, only inward current was observed. (B) Typical recording and cumulative probability plot showing that ATPA (3 µM) application in the BLA decreased sEPSCs in a CeM late-firing neuron. Inset: Relative frequency (freq.) during ATPA application was significantly decreased (n = 6). (C) Typical traces showing that after puff application of ATPA (3 µM) in the BLA, eEPSCs recorded in a CeM neuron were decreased. (D) Individual experiments and statistical results showing that ATPA reduced eEPSC amplitude (n = 7, each neuron represented by a separate symbol). * P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.
