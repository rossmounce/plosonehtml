The stimulation intensities range from 4 V to 10 V. (B) Input-output curve of eEPSCs indicated that at lower stimulation intensity, eEPSCs in wild-type mice were significantly smaller than those in GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice. No difference was found at a higher stimulation intensity (wild-type, n = 8; GluR5<sup>−/−</sup>, n = 7). (C) Local application of LY382884 (10 µM) has similar effect on input-output curve of eEPSC to that in GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice, increasing weak stimulation-induced eEPSCs (n = 8). (D and E) LTP could be induced in CeM neurons by theta burst stimulation in the BLA from wild-type mice (n = 8) or GluR5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 8). There was no significant difference in potentiation between groups. The dashed line indicates the mean basal synaptic responses and the arrow shows the time point of LTP induction. *P&lt;0.05.</p>
