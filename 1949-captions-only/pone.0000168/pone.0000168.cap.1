                Figure 1. Map of the Hudson River estuary with key habitats used by shortnose sturgeon and the salinity zones in the system. Summer habitat, winter juvenile habitat, and salinity zones match horizontally on the figure with locations in the river. The width of the summer habitat designation corresponds with most and least heavily used sections of the river.
