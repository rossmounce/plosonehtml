                Figure 2. Size distribution of adult shortnose sturgeon captured in targeted sampling in spawning and adult wintering habitats, and the size distribution of shortnose sturgeon captured in random sampling during summer. Shortnose sturgeon greater than 50 cm fork length (FL) were classified as adults. During summer sampling, all life stages of shortnose sturgeon are well distributed in the river system.
