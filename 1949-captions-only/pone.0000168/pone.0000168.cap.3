                Figure 3. Population estimates and abundance trend for Hudson River shortnose sturgeon in the 1980s and 1990s. The paired symbols of circles (means) and heavy lines (95% confidence intervals) show the results of population estimates in the late 1970s and late 1990s. The catch per unit effort histogram bars are the average catch of shortnose sturgeon per trawl haul in a riverwide fish survey conducted annually by the Hudson River electric utilities.
