Numbers beside nodes indicate posterior probabilities (consensus of 6,500 trees from 650,000 generations). See methods for further details of phylogentic analyses and supplementary material (<a href="#pone.0000169.s004">Table S1</a>) for accession numbers. Schematic linear scale representations of the structure of the vitellogenin genes are drawn for each taxa with complete sequences in the databanks. Sub-domain structures were identified from conserved cleavage sites. The iPv1 of Pacific oyster is proposed to be the origin of the first polyserine domain in the vitellogenins of insects. The geological scale provides an estimate of the divergence of the genes. Since the Vtg genes were not clock-like, this scale is approximate. See text and <a href="#pone-0000169-g002">Fig. 2</a> for an explanation of the gene duplication model. X = gene lost; (P) = pelagic egg; (B) = benthic egg.</p>
