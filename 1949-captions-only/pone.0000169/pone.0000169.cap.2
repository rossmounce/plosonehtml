                Figure 2. Proposed scheme for the classification of vertebrate vitellogenin genes based on three rounds (R1, R2, R3) of whole genome duplications (WGD), and lineage-specific gene duplications. The genes are classified according to their cluster pattern in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 and the differential degradation of the lipovitellin heavy chain (LvH) during oocyte maturation. The loss of VtgD as is currently indicated in the scheme remains a logical conclusion since there is currently no evidence for its existence in the sequence or genome databases. Due to the low number of species examined to date, however, we do not preclude its existence. The white diamond within the acanthomorph lineage indicates differential regulation of cathepsins among pelagophils and benthophils.
