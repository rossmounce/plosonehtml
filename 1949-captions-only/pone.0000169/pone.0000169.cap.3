Panel A: 3-spined stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>); Panel B: Medaka (<em>Oryzias latipes</em>); Panel C: Zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) includes sequenced genes, and full genes ensembl release 38 and fragments from ensembl release 41; Panel D: Maximum parsimony phylogram of all known teleost genomic vitellogenin genes rooted with silver lamprey. The Vtg bars were constructed from conserved cleavage sites as described in <a href="#pone-0000169-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Homology identity and similarities for the full LvH domains are shown above each bar based on comparison to the reference sequence (arrow). See text and methods for further details of phylogentic analyses.</p>
