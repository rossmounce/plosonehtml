Figures are not controlled for phylogeny and residual values of the linear regression between testis mass and body mass were used to obtain relative testis mass. (A) Significant positive relationship between the shape index derived from Principal Component 2 and relative testis mass (testis mass: slope b = 0.59, t = 2.73, p = 0.01, λ = 0.54). (B) Significant positive relationship between the curvature of the apical hook and relative testis mass (slope b = 0.05, t = 4.48, p&lt;0.0001; λ = 0.56). The pictures of sperm heads represent the range of hook design across species: (1) Rattus tuneyi, (2) Mastomys coucha, (3) Leopoldamys sabanus, (4) Niviventer cremoriventer, (5) Bandicota bengalensis, (6) Apodemus argenteus, (7) Maxomys surifer, (8) Acomys cahirinus, (9) Paruromys dominator, (10) Bunomys fratrorum, (11) Notomys alexis. Open circles mark species belonging to the genus Apodemus.</p>
