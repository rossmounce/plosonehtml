                Figure 1.  Selection of ASLV-B infected DF-1 cells that do not undergo low pH-mediated cell-cell fusion.(A) Selection scheme used to identify subgroup B ASLV-infected cells that are resistant to low pH-mediated syncytia formation. (B) The numbers of hygromycin B-resistant virus-infected colonies that resulted from cell-cell fusion experiments preformed with 293:TVBS3
                  Î”DD cells and either starting population of RCASH-B infected cells or R6 (pH 5.6) cells, are shown. This experiment was performed in triplicate and the average mean values obtained are shown along with the standard deviation of the data. (C) Flow cytometric analysis of EnvB expression. Uninfected cells (green histogram), the starting population of RCASH-B infected DF-1 cells (red histogram, upper panel) and the R6 (pH 5.6) cells (blue histogram, lower panel) were incubated with TVBS3-rIgG and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously [5], [27].
