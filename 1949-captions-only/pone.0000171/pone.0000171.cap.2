                Figure 2.  Common envB mutations in the R6 (pH 5.6) cell population.(A) Schematic of the EnvB protein showing host range regions hr1and hr2 of SU and the fusion peptide (FP) and membrane spanning domain (MSD) of TM. The amino acid sequences of wild-type (WT) Env B and of three common mutations found in the R6 (pH 5.6) cell population are shown below. The frequencies of each mutation in the R6 (pH 5.6) population are indicated in parentheses, measured as described in the text (n = number of cloned copies of the envB genes that were characterized). (B) Representative screen for the A32V mutation. Individual plasmid DNAs containing envB genes were screened for the A32V mutation by digestion with PvuII as described in the text. Plasmids containing wild-type envB gave rise to a linear 6 kb DNA fragment (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 6) whereas those containing A32V envB remain undigested (lanes 2 and 4). Lanes 1 and 2: wild-type and A32V envB controls. Lanes 4–6: Individual envB genes cloned from the R6 (pH 5.6) population. (C) Representative PCR-amplification based screen for the Δ152–164 mutation as described in the text. Plasmid DNA containing wild-type envB give rise to a 209 bp DNA fragment (lanes 1 and 4–8), while those containing the Δ152–164 mutant give rise to a 170 bp DNA fragment (lanes 2 and 3). Lane 1; wild-type envB control, Lanes 2–7: Individual envB genes cloned from the R6 (pH 5.6) population.
