The amino acid sequences of wild-type (WT) Env B and of three common mutations found in the R6 (pH 5.6) cell population are shown below. The frequencies of each mutation in the R6 (pH 5.6) population are indicated in parentheses, measured as described in the text (n = number of cloned copies of the <em>envB</em> genes that were characterized). (B) Representative screen for the A32V mutation. Individual plasmid DNAs containing <em>envB</em> genes were screened for the A32V mutation by digestion with PvuII as described in the text. Plasmids containing wild-type <em>envB</em> gave rise to a linear 6 kb DNA fragment (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 6) whereas those containing A32V <em>envB</em> remain undigested (lanes 2 and 4). Lanes 1 and 2: wild-type and A32V <em>envB</em> controls. Lanes 4–6: Individual <em>envB</em> genes cloned from the R6 (pH 5.6) population. (C) Representative PCR-amplification based screen for the <em>Δ</em>152–164 mutation as described in the text. Plasmid DNA containing wild-type <em>envB</em> give rise to a 209 bp DNA fragment (lanes 1 and 4–8), while those containing the <em>Δ</em>152–164 mutant give rise to a 170 bp DNA fragment (lanes 2 and 3). Lane 1; wild-type <em>envB</em> control, Lanes 2–7: Individual <em>envB</em> genes cloned from the R6 (pH 5.6) population.</p>
