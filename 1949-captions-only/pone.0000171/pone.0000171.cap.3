                Figure 3.  The mutant EnvB proteins exhibit altered low pH thresholds for fusion activation.(A) DF-1 cells (blue histogram) and DF-1 cells expressing wild-type (WT), and either of the mutant forms of EnvB (red histograms) were analyzed by flow cytometry as described in the Fig. 1 legend. (B)The virus-infected DF-1 cells (GFP-positive green) were mixed with 293:TVBS3
                  ΔDD cells labeled by expression of eGFP. The 293:TVBS3
                  ΔDD cells were labeled with R18 red. Images were taken using an Axiovert25 microscope at 50× magnification. Shown are representative panels from the whole cell cultures.
