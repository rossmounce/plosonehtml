(B)The virus-infected DF-1 cells (GFP-positive green) were mixed with 293:TVB<sup>S3</sup>
                  <em>Δ</em>DD cells labeled by expression of eGFP. The 293:TVB<sup>S3</sup>
                  <em>Δ</em>DD cells were labeled with R18 red. Images were taken using an Axiovert25 microscope at 50× magnification. Shown are representative panels from the whole cell cultures.</p>
