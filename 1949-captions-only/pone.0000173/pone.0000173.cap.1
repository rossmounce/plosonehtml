One quality-adjusted life-year corresponds to 12 quality-adjusted life-months. The bars cross each other at the median. The mean point estimate of the bivariate distribution of incremental costs and effects is indicated as a dot. Dotted horizontal and vertical lines at zero indicate no difference between costs and effects of the two strategies. The broken lines indicates a threshold (i.e., maximum willingness to pay) of $US 50'000 per QALY gained. The area to the right of the threshold line (i.e., the point estimate and the respective part of the distribution) is considered as cost-effective if the decision-maker's maximum willingness to pay per QALY is $US 50'000.</p>
