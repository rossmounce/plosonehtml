                Figure 2.  Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves from the health care (A) and societal (B) perspective.Vertical lines indicate the threshold where genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing and treatment optimization based on expert opinion have the same probability of being cost-effective. At a higher willingness to pay per QALY gained (e.g. at $US 50000/QALY) genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing has a higher probability of being cost-effective than expert opinion alone.
