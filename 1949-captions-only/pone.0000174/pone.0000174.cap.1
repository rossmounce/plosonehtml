                Figure 1.  25S rRNA in the peptiptidyl transferase center of yeast.(A) Secondary structure of yeast 25S rRNA in the PTC. snoRNAs targeted for this study are indicated along with the residues they modify. Ψ – pseudouridylated residue; Nm – 2′-O-ribose methylated residue. Helices are numbered in black. (B) Three dimensional representation of the E. coli PTC [34]. Modified residues are labeled by the colors indicated in panel A. Left: view into the PTC from the top of the LSU, right: 90° rotation of Left. Helices and tRNAs are labeled.
