Helices are numbered in black. (B) Three dimensional representation of the <em>E. coli</em> PTC <a href="#pone.0000174-Schuwirth1">[34]</a>. Modified residues are labeled by the colors indicated in panel A. <em>Left</em>: view into the PTC from the top of the LSU, <em>righ</em>t: 90° rotation of <em>Left</em>. Helices and tRNAs are labeled.</p>
