                Figure 2.  Sensitivity of rRNA base modification mutants to Translational Inhibitors.Mutant and isogenic wild-type yeast strains were spotted as ten fold dilutions from 105 to 101 CFU onto YPAD media containing 20 µg/ml anisomycin or sparsomycin. Cells were incubated for 3 days at 30°C, and growth was monitored as compared to growth on plates in the absence of drug. Each strain and drug was assayed at least twice.
