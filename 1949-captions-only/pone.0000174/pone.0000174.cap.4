                     Δ and the isogenic wild-type are shown in the top row, and mutant strain spb1DA/snr52
                     Δ and the isogenic wild-type are show in the bottom row. Error bars represent standard error for all graphs. A. [14C]Phe-tRNA binding to the A-site of the ribosome. One site binding curves of bound tRNA as analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Data are reported as a percentage of the total tRNA bound. B. Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNA binding to the P-site of the ribosome. One site binding curves of bound tRNA as analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Data are reported as a percentage of the total tRNA bound. C. Peptidyltransfer. Timecourse assays of peptidyltransferase activities as measured by the puromycin reaction.
