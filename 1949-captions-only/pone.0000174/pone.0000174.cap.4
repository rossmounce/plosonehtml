[<sup>14</sup>C]Phe-tRNA binding to the A-site of the ribosome. One site binding curves of bound tRNA as analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Data are reported as a percentage of the total tRNA bound. B. Ac-[<sup>14</sup>C]Phe-tRNA binding to the P-site of the ribosome. One site binding curves of bound tRNA as analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Data are reported as a percentage of the total tRNA bound. C. Peptidyltransfer. Timecourse assays of peptidyltransferase activities as measured by the puromycin reaction.</p>
