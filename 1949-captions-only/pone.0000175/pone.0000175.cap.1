(B) Expression patterns of <em>Evx2</em> (left panel) and <em>Hoxd13</em> (right panel) in 11 dpc embryos. <em>Evx2</em> is expressed in the CNS, as well as in the limbs and genital buds, regions that also express <em>Hoxd13.</em> (c) Scheme illustrating the hypothesis that <em>Evx2</em> and <em>Hoxd13</em> display segregated expression patterns. Enhancers located 3â€² from <em>Evx2</em> have differential access to the <em>Evx2</em> promoter and the <em>Hoxd13</em> promoter. The intergenic region of <em>Evx2</em>-<em>Hoxd13</em> prevents enhancer access in CNS but not in limbs.</p>
