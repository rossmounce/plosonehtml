                Figure 1. Genomic structure and expression patterns of Evx2-Hoxd13. (A) Evx2 and Hoxd13 genes are located within 8 kb of each other. (B) Expression patterns of Evx2 (left panel) and Hoxd13 (right panel) in 11 dpc embryos. Evx2 is expressed in the CNS, as well as in the limbs and genital buds, regions that also express Hoxd13. (c) Scheme illustrating the hypothesis that Evx2 and Hoxd13 display segregated expression patterns. Enhancers located 3â€² from Evx2 have differential access to the Evx2 promoter and the Hoxd13 promoter. The intergenic region of Evx2-Hoxd13 prevents enhancer access in CNS but not in limbs.
