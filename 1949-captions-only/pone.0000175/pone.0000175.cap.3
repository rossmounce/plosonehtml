(A) Design of two targeted transgenic mice. XNs and XB as in <a href="#pone-0000175-g002">Figure 2A</a>. (B) Expression pattern of XNs- and XB-transgenic mouse embryos. XNs 11 dpc embryos expressed lacZ in the limbs and genital bud, whereas XB embryos did not. Limbs are shown in the boxed areas and genital buds are shown in the middle panels. (C) Scheme illustrating the regulation underlying enhancer-promoter interaction. Within the CNS, the XB fragment prevents interaction between the enhancer and <em>Hoxd13</em> promoter, while the BB fragment blocks the insulator activity of the XB fragment within the limbs and genital bud.</p>
