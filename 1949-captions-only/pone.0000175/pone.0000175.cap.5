(A) <em>Hoxd13</em> expression in 7 dpc embryos was specifically upregulated. Sample RNA levels were normalized according to β-actin mRNA levels. W1–W3, samples from three litters arising from wild-type mice; B1–B6, samples from six litters arising from internally bred BB-transgenic mice; X1–X8, samples from eight litters arising from internally bred XB-transgenic mice. (B) Hypothetical scheme for premature expression of these genes in XB-transgenic mice. The region downstream of <em>Evx2</em> recruits repression over the <em>Hox</em> complex before the 7-dpc embryonic stage in preparation for <em>Hox</em> expression in wild-type and BB-targeted transgenic mice. The XB fragment disrupts repression, preventing the repressor region downstream of <em>Evx2</em> from recruiting repression into the <em>HoxD</em> complex.</p>
