                Figure 5. Premature expression of Hoxd13 observed in XB-targeted transgenic mice. (A) Hoxd13 expression in 7 dpc embryos was specifically upregulated. Sample RNA levels were normalized according to β-actin mRNA levels. W1–W3, samples from three litters arising from wild-type mice; B1–B6, samples from six litters arising from internally bred BB-transgenic mice; X1–X8, samples from eight litters arising from internally bred XB-transgenic mice. (B) Hypothetical scheme for premature expression of these genes in XB-transgenic mice. The region downstream of Evx2 recruits repression over the Hox complex before the 7-dpc embryonic stage in preparation for Hox expression in wild-type and BB-targeted transgenic mice. The XB fragment disrupts repression, preventing the repressor region downstream of Evx2 from recruiting repression into the HoxD complex.
