(A) Central African human monkeypox occurrences divided into quadrants above and below the median longitude and latitude. (B) Modeled distribution created using only off-diagonal (<em>b/d</em>, red circles) input data. (C) Modeled distribution created using only on-diagonal (<em>a/c</em>, blue circles) input data. Darker shades indicate areas with greater model agreement in predicting area as suitable for monkeypox. Human monkeypox occurrence locations indicated by triangles were not used in model construction.</p>
