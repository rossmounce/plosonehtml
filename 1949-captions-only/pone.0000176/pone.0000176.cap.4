Eight West African and 146 Central African human monkeypox occurrences are indicated with green and blue circles, respectively. (A) Modeled distribution created using only Central African (blue) input data; (B) Modeled distribution created using only West African (green) input data. The vertical line (7.33Â°E longitude) denotes division between West and Central Africa. Nigerian occurrences were excluded from model development. Darker shades indicate areas with greater model agreement in prediction of potential suitability for monkeypox.</p>
