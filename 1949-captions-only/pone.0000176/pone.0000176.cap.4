                Figure 4. Ecological niche modeling results for West and Central African monkeypox. Eight West African and 146 Central African human monkeypox occurrences are indicated with green and blue circles, respectively. (A) Modeled distribution created using only Central African (blue) input data; (B) Modeled distribution created using only West African (green) input data. The vertical line (7.33Â°E longitude) denotes division between West and Central Africa. Nigerian occurrences were excluded from model development. Darker shades indicate areas with greater model agreement in prediction of potential suitability for monkeypox.
