                Figure 1. Effect of TGFβ on cell cycle progression. All cells were synchronised overnight in serum free media. Cells were then released into cell cycle by complete media (C), or kept continuously in serum free media (SF), or in complete media with TGFβ (10 ng/mL), all for 24 hours. DNA content was then assessed by flow cytometry. (A) Representative FACScan profiles for OE33 and FLO. The initial peak represents the G0/G1 fraction, whilst the second peak represents G2M fraction. (B) Summary of cell cycle distribution for each cell line analysed. Each bar represents mean percentage of total cell population in G0/G1 (grey), S (black) and G2/M (white) phase of the cell cycle from three separate experiments. * p&lt;0.05, *** p&lt;0.001
