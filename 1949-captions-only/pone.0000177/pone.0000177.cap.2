                Figure 2. Regulation of anti-proliferative genes by TGFβ in oesophageal cell lines. mRNA expression of p21 (A) and c-Myc (B) was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR in control cells grown in complete media or in complete media containing 10 ng/mL TGFβ for 24 hours. Results for real-time PCR are expressed as the mean and standard error of four separate experiments relative to β-actin expression. * p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.001
