Nuclear translocation (A) and phosphorylation (B) of Smad 2/3 following TGFβ stimulation. Cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of TGFβ1 for 6 h and Smad 2/3 localisation and phosphorylation were determined by immunofluorescence using anti-Smad 2/3 antibody and confocal microscopy and western blotting respectively. Regulation of transcription by TGFβ (C). Cells were co-transfected with the (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-Luciferase reporter plasmid and the Renilla Luciferase reporter plasmid then incubated, with or without 10 ng/mL TGFβ for 24 h. Data is expressed as mean fold change in CAGA luciferase activity in TGFβ samples compared to untreated samples, normalised to the activity of Renilla, from four separate experiments * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001</p>
