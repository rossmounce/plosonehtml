                Figure 4. Regulation of ECM modulating genes by TGFβ. mRNA expression of PAI-1 (A) and uPA (B) was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR in control cells and cells treated with 10 mg/mL TGFβ for 24 hours. Results for real-time PCR expressed as mean and standard error of four separate experiments relative to β-actin expression. * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001
