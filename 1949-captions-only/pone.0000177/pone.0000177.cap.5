                Figure 5. TGFβ modulation of kinase pathways in BE adenocarcinoma cells. Western blot on lysate from OE33, TE7, SEG, BIC and FLO cells treated with control media (−) or media with 10ng/mL TGFβ (+) for 4 hours for phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated JNK or phosphorylated Akt. Immunoprecipitation was performed with total antibody for Akt, ERK and JNK, and then blots were probed with the phosphorylated antibody.
