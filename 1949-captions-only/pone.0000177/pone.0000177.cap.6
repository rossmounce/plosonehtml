                Figure 6. Effect of inhibition of PI3K, ERK and JNK pathways on PAI and uPA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR showing PAI (A) and uPA (B) expression in cells treated with 10 ng/mL TGFβ and PI3K inhibitor LY29004 (LY, 20 µM); ERK inhibitor PD98059 (PD, 10 µM); and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (SP, 10 µM) for 24 hours. Results are expressed as a percentage of expression in inhibitor treated samples compared to TGFβ treated samples, such that the greater the inhibition the lower the percentage expression. Results are mean and standard error of four separate experiments. * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001
