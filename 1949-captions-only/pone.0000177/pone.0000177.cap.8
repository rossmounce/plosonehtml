(A) Aggregation in control cells cultured with normal medium (C), cells treated with TGFβ alone (T) or in the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY), ERK inhibitor PD98590 (PD) or JNK inhibitor SP600125 (SP). Scores represent the mean for 3 separate experiments where 0 is for no aggregates, 1 for small aggregates and 2 for large aggregates. (B) Invasion assay through matrigel matrix over 24 h in untreated cells (C), treated with TGFβ alone (T) or in the presence of inhibitors (LY, PD or SP), (C) Wound healing measured as the percentage of healing of a circular wound over 24 h was assessed in OE33 cells cultured in normal medium (C), or with the addition of TGFβ (T) or with TGFβ in the presence of inhibitors (LY, PD or SP). For all experiments TGFβ is compared with the control and the effect of inhibitors compared with TGFβ. * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.</p>
