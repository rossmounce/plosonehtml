                Figure 1. The effect of willow young leaves extracts on the viability of ALL cells. 7 ALL patients (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) 0.1 ml of the cell suspension containing 105 cells was added to 5 tubes. To three of the tubes, 0.1 ml of the willow extract was added, while the other two tubes served as negative and positive controls. Culture medium was used instead of the willow extract for the negative control and the willow extract was added to the cells from healthy volunteers as a positive control. The tubes were incubated for 24 h and tested for their viability using the trypan blue.
