                Figure 3. The effect of willow young leaves extracts on the viability of Ehrlich asites carcinoma cells (EACC). 0.1 ml of the cell suspension containing 105 cells was added to 4 tubes. To three of the tubes, 0.1 ml of the willow extract was added, while the other tube served as negative control. Culture medium was used instead of the willow extract for the negative control. The tubes were incubated for 24 h and tested for their viability using the trypan blue.
