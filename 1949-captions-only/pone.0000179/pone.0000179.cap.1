                Figure 1.  Individual podosome.Intact osteoclast (A,B) or ventral membranes (Câ€“E) fixed and stained for actin (A) or paxillin (B) or prepared for HR-SEM (C, D, E). Individual podosomes (A, B arrows) are isolated from nearby structures and show no overlap with neighboring podosomes in paxillin staining (B, arrow). The insert in (A) shows a merged image of actin/paxillin staining. (C) An isolated podosome showing a dense actin core at the center of the podosome and actin fibers radiating from it and interacting with the ventral membrane. Note membrane-associated clathrin pits (C, arrow) testimony of the excellent preservation of the sample. (D) Structures very similar to (C) are detected in osteoclasts plated on bone slices. (E) Higher magnification of a podosome shows tightly packed actin fibers at the actin core, many of which are almost perpendicular to the substrate (arrowhead). The occasionally observed concavity at the peak of the podosome (D,E) may reflect the underlying membrane invagination related to dynamin (16). The actin fibers radiating from the core show branching points (arrows).
