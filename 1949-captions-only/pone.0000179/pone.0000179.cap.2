(A) Actin pillars emanate from an “actin-cloud”. (B) Paxillin is largely shared by the cluster and overlaps with the “actin-cloud”. The insert in (A) shows a merged image of actin/paxillin staining. (C) SEM over-view of a cluster. The radial podosome actin fibers appear to correspond to the “actin-cloud”. (D) Higher magnification view of two clustered podosomes showing interactions between radial peripheral cables. There are no cables directly connecting between cores. (E) The same organization as in (D) is detected on bone.</p>
