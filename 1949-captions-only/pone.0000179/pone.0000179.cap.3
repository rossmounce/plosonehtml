                Figure 3.  Sealing zone-like structure.Intact osteoclast (A,B) or ventral membrane (C, D) on glass cover-slips were fixed and stained for actin (A) or paxillin (B) or prepared for HR-SEM (Câ€“D). (A) A dense actin belt is surrounded by inner and outer paxillin belts (B). The insert in (A) shows a merged image of actin/paxillin staining. (C) SEM over-view of a sealing zone-like structure on glass: note the continuous, robust actin organization. (D) Higher magnification view of two neighboring pillars showing numerous inter-pillar cables.
