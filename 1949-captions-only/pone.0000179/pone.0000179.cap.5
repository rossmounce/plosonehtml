On the left is the actin labeling, followed by paxillin labeling and by their merged picture. On the right is the corresponding SEM micrograph. (B) Higher magnification view of the area in the yellow rectangle in (A). (C) Higher magnification view of the area in the yellow rectangle in (B). (D) Merged actin/paxillin labeling from the same area as in (C). (E) Merged image between (C) and (D). The correlation between SEM and immunofluorescence shows paxillin association with podosome radial actin fibers, reaching up to but not co-localizing with the central bundle. (F, G, H) Osteoclast ventral membranes were labeled for paxillin with 15nm colloidal gold particles and visualized by back scattering signal (F) or secondary electron detector (G, H). (F) and (G) show the same area. The colloidal gold particles in (G, H) are marked with brownish dots, showing paxillin in association with actin fibers in close proximity with the ventral membrane.</p>
