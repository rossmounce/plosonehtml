                Figure 1. Estimated values of k̂ and confidence interval coverage for NB datasets. 10,000 datasets were simulated as described in Section 2.1.1 of the text, using mean m, dispersion parameter k, and sample size n as shown. Boxes show the median and interquartile range (IQR) of 10,000 resulting ML estimates of k̂, and whiskers show the 5th and 95th percentile values. Numbers to the right of each subplot show the percentage of simulations for which the true value of k was outside (below (CI overestimate)/above (CI underestimate) for the numbers y/z, respectively) the 90% confidence interval estimated for k̂ The vertical line in each subplot shows the true value of k. To facilitate comparison among parameter sets, the horizontal axis of all subplots is scaled from 0 to 10 times the true value of k.
