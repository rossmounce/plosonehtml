                Figure 2. Estimated values of kÌ‚ and confidence interval coverage for NB datasets with uniform under-counting of secondary cases. The probability with which any secondary case was missed by surveillance was (a) pu
                      = 0.2 and (b) pu
                      = 0.5. 10,000 datasets were simulated as described in Section 2.1.2 of the text, for parameters m, k, and n as shown. Plotting details are described in Figure 1.
