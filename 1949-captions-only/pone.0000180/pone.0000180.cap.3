                Figure 3. Estimated values of kÌ‚ and confidence interval coverage for NB datasets with under-reporting of zeroes. Individuals that caused no secondary infections were missed by surveillance with probability (a) pz
                      = 0.2 and (b) pz
                      = 0.5. 10,000 datasets were simulated as described in Section 2.1.3 of the text. Plotting details are described in Figure 1.
