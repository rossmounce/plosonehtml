                Figure 4. Estimated values of (a) k̂ and (b) m̂ for outbreak datasets generated by branching process simulations with NB offspring distributions. 10,000 datasets were simulated as described in Section 2.1.4 of the text. Circles indicate parameter sets for which fewer than 1 in 105 simulated outbreaks had n cases or more. Other plotting details are described in Figure 1.
