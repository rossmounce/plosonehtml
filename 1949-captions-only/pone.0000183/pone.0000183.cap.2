                Figure 2. Estimates, according to age, of the probability of TB case contacts that undergo tuberculin conversion having each of the 4 possible combinations of ELISPOT results over the 2 sampling points (recruitment and after 3 months). The estimates are derived from the study data using multi-nomial logistic regression and the analysis is restricted to those aged 5–50 years (see methods). The dotted lines represent the predicted probabilities if the sensitivity (ELISPOT −ve:+ve group) and specificity (ELISPOT −ve:−ve group) of the ELISPOT are both 80% (see methods).
