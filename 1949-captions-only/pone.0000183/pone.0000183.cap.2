The estimates are derived from the study data using multi-nomial logistic regression and the analysis is restricted to those aged 5–50 years (see <a href="#s2">methods</a>). The dotted lines represent the predicted probabilities if the sensitivity (ELISPOT −ve:+ve group) and specificity (ELISPOT −ve:−ve group) of the ELISPOT are both 80% (see <a href="#s2">methods</a>).</p>
