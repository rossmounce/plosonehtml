                Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree for H6 influenza A viruses isolated from swans. The DNA maximum likelihood tree was constructed using A/pintail/Alberta/210/2002 (H1N1) as out-group and includes sequences from public databases. Genes clustered into four different groups as described by Spackman et al. [7]. The scale bar represents ~10% of nucleotide changes between close relatives. Small numbers in the tree represent the bootstrap values.
