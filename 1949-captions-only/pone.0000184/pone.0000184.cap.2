The DNA maximum likelihood tree was constructed using A/pintail/Alberta/210/2002 (H1N1) as out-group and includes sequences from public databases. Genes clustered into four different groups as described by Spackman et al. <a href="#pone.0000184-Spackman1">[7]</a>. The scale bar represents ~10% of nucleotide changes between close relatives. Small numbers in the tree represent the bootstrap values.</p>
