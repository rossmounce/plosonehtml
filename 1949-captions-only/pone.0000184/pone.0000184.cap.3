(A) Infected swans left the study area more than a month after the uninfected birds, indicated by broad vertical grey bars ranging from mean-SE to mean+SE. Moreover, their mean net displacement after departure (closed dots±dashed SE-lines) was shorter than for the uninfected birds (open dots±dashed SE-lines). Sample sizes of displacements estimates: <em>n</em> = 2 for infected birds (whole time span); sample size declined for uninfected birds due to birds that flew out of range: <em>n</em> = 10 (days 0–41), <em>n</em> = 9 (42–47), and <em>n</em> = 8 (48–55). (B) Total number of swans in our study area declined more or less gradually over time (W. Tijsen et al. unpubl. data), suggesting a continuous departure of about 30 birds per day (apart from the short dip around day 12 during a snowy cold spell).</p>
