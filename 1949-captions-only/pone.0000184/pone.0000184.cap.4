                Figure 4. Feeding parameters as a function of health status. Compared to healthy birds, infected birds (A) fuelled slower, (B) took fewer bites per hour, and (C) took fewer bites per produced dropping. Because of a seasonal increase observed in bite rate (p&lt;0.05 when all observations pooled), bite rate plotted in (B) were standardized to 1 February. In all graphs, bars give least-square means, error bars are SE.
