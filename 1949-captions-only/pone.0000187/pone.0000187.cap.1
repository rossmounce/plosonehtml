                Figure 1.  The sexual dimorphism in locomotor activity is disrupted in hmgcr mutant.a) Flies homozygous for a P element inserted in the 3′ region of the hmgcr gene (hmgcr11635/hmgcr11635
                     ) do not exhibit a sexually dimorphic start/stop number. Flies heterozygous for this P element insertion (hmgcr11635
                     /CS) behave like wild-type controls Canton-S flies. For all graphics representing the start/stop number in this study, blue and red are males and females respectively, while the number in the boxes indicates the number of flies recorded for each genotype. CS = Canton-S. Mean±SEM is represented and all statistical tests are done using an Anova-Manova test (Statistica software). * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01; *** p&lt;0.001. b) Targeted expression of p[UAS-clb] under the control the p[da-GAL4] driver in flies homozygous for the hmgcr11635
                      allele (p[da-GAL4]; hmgcr11635
                     /UAS-clb, hmgcr11635
                     ) is sufficient to rescue both the lethality and the sexual dimorphism, observed in hmgcr11635/hmgcr11635
                      flies. However, the p[act-GAL4] driver (p[act-GAL4]; hmgcr11635
