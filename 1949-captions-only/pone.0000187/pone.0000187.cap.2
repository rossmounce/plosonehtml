                      is expressed in the brain, the larval fat body, the cardia and the corpus allatum.Immunohistological staining showing the HMGCR expression in various tissues, in adult fly. a, b, c) The HMGCR is expressed in the fat body in flies younger than 4 days (a, left). In flies older than 5 days, no HMGCR expression is detectable (a, right). The HMGCR is also expressed in some neurons, principally in the cortex of the brain (cx) (b) and some cells of the pars intercerebralis (PI) (c). oe: eosophagus, eb: ellipsoid-body. d, e) In the body, the reductase is detected in the cardia (d) and in the corpus allatum (ca) (e). For a negative control of the HMGCR staining, see Figure 5b, in comparison with figures 5a, c, d, e and g. Scale bar = 25 Âµm.
