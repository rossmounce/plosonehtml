In flies older than 5 days, no HMGCR expression is detectable (a, right). The HMGCR is also expressed in some neurons, principally in the cortex of the brain (cx) (b) and some cells of the <em>pars intercerebralis</em> (<em>PI</em>) (c). oe: eosophagus, eb: ellipsoid-body. d, e) In the body, the reductase is detected in the <em>cardia</em> (d) and in the <em>corpus allatum</em> (<em>ca</em>) (e). For a negative control of the HMGCR staining, see <a href="#pone-0000187-g005">Figure 5b</a>, in comparison with <a href="#pone-0000187-g005">figures 5a, c, d, e and g</a>. Scale bar = 25 Âµm.</p>
