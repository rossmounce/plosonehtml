                     Targeted expression of the HMGCR in the
                      corpus allatum rescues the hmgcr mutant phenotype.p[DI-3-GAL4] plus p[act-GAL4] in the same flies are sufficient to rescue the sexual dimorphism disrupted in hmgcr11635/hmgcr11635 flies (DI-3, act-GAL4; hmgcr11635/UAS-clb; hmgcr11635). This suggests a specific role for the HMGCR in the ca to control the sexual dimorphism. Interestingly, this rescue occurs in two days old flies, but not in the same flies of 5 days old.
