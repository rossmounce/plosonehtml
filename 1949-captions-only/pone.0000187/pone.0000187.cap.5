This effect is completely reversible. In 2 days old DI-3/UAS-RNAi-HMGCR flies (b), HMGCR protein is not detectable and the number of start/stop is identical between males and females compared to controls (a) (2 days old UAS-RNAi-HMGCR/CS flies). Interestingly, in 5 days old flies, both DI-3/UAS-RNAi-HMGCR (d) and UAS-RNAi-HMGCR/CS (c) the HMGCR is detectable and the start/stop number is sexually dimorphic. This is in agreement with the temporal expression pattern driven by the DI-3. Additionally, this result strongly suggests the reversibility of the RNAi effect. N.B: results from b) and d) come from the same flies, recorded at 2 and 5 days old respectively. e, f) Expressing the UAS-RNAi-HMGCR in the <em>ca</em> using the DI-11 line (DI-11/UAS-RNAi-HMGCR) also leads to the lack of the HMGCR product (f) and disrupts the sexual dimorphism compared to controls flies (e). g) The HMGCR is expressed both in the c<em>ardia</em> and the <em>ca</em> (left panel) in control flies (2 days old UAS-RNAi-HMGCR/CS flies), whereas in 2 days old (DI-3/UAS-RNAi-HMGCR) flies, the HMGCR is detected only in the <em>cardia</em> (right panel). This last staining serves as a positive control, to demonstrate that the DI-3 drives the UAS-RNAi-HMGCR only in the <em>ca</em>. h) Expressing the UAS-RNAi-HMGCR in the <em>ca</em> under the control of DI-11 leads to a strong lethality when flies are reared at 24°C. Moreover, the only few females that survived are dwarf (left: dwarf female DI-11/UAS-RNAi-HMGCR, middle: female control UAS-RNAi-HMGCR/CS] and right: female CS). Scale bar = 25 µm.</p>
