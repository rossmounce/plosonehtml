                Figure 6.  Directed expression of p[UAS-RNAi-InR] specifically in the corpus allatum, mimics the hmgcr mutation.For all panels (a–c): immunostaining using a primary antibody raised against the human form of the InR, revealed by a secondary antibody labeled with FITC (green). a–c) Targeting the UAS-RNAi-InR specifically in the ca blocks the InR expression and disrupts the sexual dimorphism. This effect is completely reversible. In 2 days old DI-3/UAS-RNAi-InR flies (b), InR is not detectable and the number of start/stop is identical between males and females compared to controls flies (a) (2 days old UAS-RNAi-InR/CS). Interestingly, in 5 days old DI-3/UAS-RNAi-InR flies (c) the InR is detectable and the start/stop number is sexually dimorphic. This result corroborates the temporal expression pattern driven by the DI-3. Additionally, this strongly suggests, like for the RNAi-HMGCR, the reversibility of the RNAi-InR effect. N.B.: again here, results from b) and d) come from the same flies, recorded at 2 and 5 days old, respectively. d) Expressing the UAS-RNAi-InR in the ca under the control of DI-11 leads to a strong lethality when flies are reared at 24°C and 19°C. However, at 19°C, few females survive, but they are dwarf (left: dwarf female DI-11/UAS-RNAi-InR, right: female control (UAS-RNAi-InR/CS). Scale bar = 25 µm.
