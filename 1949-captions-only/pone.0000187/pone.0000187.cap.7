HMGCR and InR are colocalized in the same cells of the <em>ca</em>. Blocking the expression of the HMGCR does not influence the expression of the InR, but abolishes the sexual dimorphism. However, blocking the expression of the InR blocks the expression of the HMGCR and consequently abolishes the sexual dimorphism. This suggests that the InR controls the expression of the HMGCR within the <em>ca</em>. To test this hypothesis, we directed the expression of the UAS-<em>clb</em> concomitantly with the UAS-RNAi-InR (DI-3/UAS-RNAi-InR; UAS-<em>clb</em>). In this case, although InR is not detectable, HMGCR is present in the <em>ca</em> and the start/stop number is sexually dimorphic between males and females (b). Scale bar = 25 Âµm.</p>
