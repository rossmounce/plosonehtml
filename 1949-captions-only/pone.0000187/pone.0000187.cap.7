                Figure 7.  Insulin signaling pathway controls the sexual dimorphism via HMGCR.a) Immunostaining using primary antibodies against the InR and/or HMGCR, revealed by secondary antibodies labeled with FITC (green) or Cy3 (red) respectively. HMGCR and InR are colocalized in the same cells of the ca. Blocking the expression of the HMGCR does not influence the expression of the InR, but abolishes the sexual dimorphism. However, blocking the expression of the InR blocks the expression of the HMGCR and consequently abolishes the sexual dimorphism. This suggests that the InR controls the expression of the HMGCR within the ca. To test this hypothesis, we directed the expression of the UAS-clb concomitantly with the UAS-RNAi-InR (DI-3/UAS-RNAi-InR; UAS-clb). In this case, although InR is not detectable, HMGCR is present in the ca and the start/stop number is sexually dimorphic between males and females (b). Scale bar = 25 Âµm.
