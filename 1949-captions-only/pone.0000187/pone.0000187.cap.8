The informative way (in yellow), which could be feminised, might control the level or the timing of the JH release, while the permissive way (in green) might control or allow the presence of the molecular machinery, as the transcription of the HMGCR, to promote the JH synthesis. In magnification: in the <em>corpus allatum,</em> insulin binds to its receptor (InR), which activates SREBP. In turn, SREBP regulates the transcription of <em>hmgcr</em> gene.</p>
