                Figure 8.  Model of the insulin pathway regulating the expression of the HMGCR in the corpus allatum.We hypothesize that the two different populations of cells, the Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs) and the feminising cells (FCs), located in the pars intercerebralis control, by two distinct ways, the JH synthesis/release by the corpus allatum. The informative way (in yellow), which could be feminised, might control the level or the timing of the JH release, while the permissive way (in green) might control or allow the presence of the molecular machinery, as the transcription of the HMGCR, to promote the JH synthesis. In magnification: in the corpus allatum, insulin binds to its receptor (InR), which activates SREBP. In turn, SREBP regulates the transcription of hmgcr gene.
