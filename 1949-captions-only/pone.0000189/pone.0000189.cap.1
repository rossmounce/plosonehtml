                Figure 1. Exon structure, domain composition and the six basic forms of PDZ/LIM genes. (A) The exon composition of the human PDZ-LIM domain encoding genes in alphabetical order. Indicated are ALP (ENSG00000154553), ZASP (ENSG00000122367, Elfin (ENSG00000107438), ENIGMA (ENSG00000196923), Enigma-Homolog (ENH) (ENSG00000163110) LIMK1 (ENSG00000106683, OTTHUMG00000023448), LIMK2 (ENSG00000182541), LMO7 (ENSG00000136153), Mystique (ENSG00000120913) and RIL (ENSG00000131435). Domains are color coded on the exons: LIM yellow, PDZ blue, CH red and ZM motif green, while transcription start sites are indicated after non coding regions (colored white) with a small arrow on top. (B) Presence of domain architectures for PDZ and LIM genes and their species distribution. Six basic gene structures can be found amongst the different taxons. The tungus gene, found in the two arthropod species investigated and the nematode homolog Eat-1 both encode one N-terminal PDZ and four C-terminal LIM domains. Eat-1 has been described earlier as the Caenorhabditis elegans ALP/Enigma gene [50]. Only a single LIMK gene was found per invertebrate species examined, and the LMO7 homolog lacks the CH domain (CG31534). The LMO7 gene of Drosophila melanogaster lacks not only the CH domain but also the PDZ domain (not shown, see Supplemental table S1). As not all ALP and Enigma subfamily members share the ZM domain (ZASP and ALP contain 2 and Elfin one ZM motif) we have excluded the ZM motif from these groups and show only a ZM motif for eat-1/tungus in this figure.
