(A) The exon composition of the human PDZ-LIM domain encoding genes in alphabetical order. Indicated are <em>ALP</em> (ENSG00000154553), <em>ZASP</em> (ENSG00000122367, Elfin (ENSG00000107438), ENIGMA (ENSG00000196923), <em>Enigma-Homolog</em> (ENH) (ENSG00000163110) <em>LIMK1</em> (ENSG00000106683, OTTHUMG00000023448), <em>LIMK2</em> (ENSG00000182541), <em>LMO7</em> (ENSG00000136153), <em>Mystique</em> (ENSG00000120913) and RIL (ENSG00000131435). Domains are color coded on the exons: LIM yellow, PDZ blue, CH red and ZM motif green, while transcription start sites are indicated after non coding regions (colored white) with a small arrow on top. (B) Presence of domain architectures for PDZ and LIM genes and their species distribution. Six basic gene structures can be found amongst the different taxons. The <em>tungus gene</em>, found in the two <em>arthropod species investigated and the nematode homolog Eat-1 both</em> encode one N-terminal PDZ and four C-terminal LIM domains. Eat-1 has been described earlier as the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> ALP/Enigma gene <a href="#pone.0000189-McKeown1">[50]</a>. Only a single <em>LIMK</em> gene was found per invertebrate species examined, and the <em>LMO7</em> homolog lacks the CH domain (<em>CG31534</em>). The LMO7 gene of <em>Drosophila</em> melanogaster lacks not only the CH domain but also the PDZ domain (not shown, see <a href="#pone.0000189.s002">Supplemental table S1</a>). As not all ALP and Enigma subfamily members share the ZM domain (ZASP and ALP contain 2 and Elfin one ZM motif) we have excluded the ZM motif from these groups and show only a ZM motif for eat-1/tungus in this figure.</p>
