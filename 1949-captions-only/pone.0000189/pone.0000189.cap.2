(A,B,D and E) and PDZ domain sequences (C). In all phylogenetic trees shown, are the percentages for Bayesian posterior probability (first number) and for Maximum Likelihoods (second number) indicated at the branches. In figure C only the major branches are labeled for better overview. The two letter abbreviations used refer to genus and species, with the first capital letter and the second non-capital letter, respectively. All abbreviations used are given in <a href="#s4">material and methods</a>. ENH is used for Enigma homolog (A) Shown is a phylogenic tree based on the full-length sequences of members of the Enigma subfamily. (B) Phylogenetic analysis for the ALP subfamily, based on full length sequences of selected homologs. (C) Evolutionary tree based on the PDZ domains of both ALP and Enigma subfamilies. (D) Phylogeny of the LIM domain kinases based on full length amino acid sequences. The root is placed on the <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> homolog. The fruitfly homolog (which roots with the Uruchordate homolog found in <em>Ciona intestinalis</em>) gives rise to the common ancestor for the vertebrate LIM kinases. This ancestor then duplicates into LIMK1 and LIMK2, which are both present in all the vertebrate species investigated. (E) Evolutionary tree of LMO7 genes. The tree is rooted to the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> sequence of tag-204, which has a similar structure to LMO7, albeit without the CH domain.</p>
