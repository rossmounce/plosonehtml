                Figure 3. Sequence alignments showing the conserved motifs. (A) Conserved amino acids constituting the Alp-like (AM) motif, which was only present in the ALP family genes and neither found neither in the Enigma subfamily nor in their mutual precursor eat-1/tungus. (B) Conserved amino acids constituting the ZASP-like (ZM) motif found in both ALP subfamily and Enigma subfamily genes.
