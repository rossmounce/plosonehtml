(A) Conserved amino acids constituting the Alp-like (AM) motif, which was only present in the ALP family genes and neither found neither in the Enigma subfamily nor in their mutual precursor <em>eat-1/tungus.</em> (B) Conserved amino acids constituting the ZASP-like (ZM) motif found in both ALP subfamily and Enigma subfamily genes.</p>
