Sequence comparisons of LIM domains in a Dendogram, with different clusters color-coded. We included all non-redundant LIM domains found in <em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em> and all from <em>C. elegans</em> and added the closest homologs of PDZ/LIM family LIM domains from different species, which were identified via BLAST search. The Dictyostelium discoideum sequences are marked in red and cluster all together and not with any other of the LIM domain clusters.</p>
