(A) The evolutionary tree for the PDZ domains is shown. The percentages for Bayesian posterior probability (first number) and for Maximum Likelihoods (second number) are indicated at the branches. The tree is rooted using the PDZ domain of the yeast (<em>S. cerevisiae</em>) NAS2 protein as an outgroup. The percentage Bayesian posterior probability and percentage Maximum Likelihood are indicated at the branches (Bayesian/Likelihood). All species can be identified from the last two letters of the taxon labels. All species cluster according to their appearance in the tree of life (<a href="http://www.tol.org">www.tol.org</a>) with the exception of the LIMK1 for <em>Xenopus tropicalis</em> and <em>Gallus gallus</em>, which are in reverse order, this was already seen in the full length analysis of the LIM kinases for the frog and chicken homolog (<a href="#pone-0000189-g002">Fig. 2D</a>). (B) The phylogenetic analysis of the LIM domains is shown. The tree is rooted using the LIM domain of the yeast (<em>S. cerevisiae</em>) LRG1 protein as an outgroup. Percentage Bayesian posterior probability and percentage Maximum Likelihood are indicated at the branches (Bayesian/Likelihood). (C) Shown is the phylogenetic analysis of conserved intronic-sequences of LIM domains of tag204, eat-1, LMO7 and a <em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em> LIM domain as an outgroup.</p>
