The most parsimonious model derived from our phylogenetic analysis shows that the PDZ domain of all 10 different PDZ/LIM encoding genes share a common ancestor, with closest homology to LMO7. The combination of this PDZ domain with a LIM domain formed the common ancestor for both the LMO7 and the ALP/Enigma lineages. The single LIM domain in the ALP/Enigma lineage (closest to LIM2 in <em>eat-1/tungus)</em> then duplicated and gave rise to a PDZ two LIM domain structure. Subsequently the duplicated LIM (closest to LIM3 in <em>eat-1/tungus)</em>, duplicated twice and generated a PDZ four LIM structure similar to <em>eat-1/tungus</em>. From this gene structure, through gene duplication and subsequent domain loss (loosing either three LIM domains (LIM2â€“4) or only 1 LIM domain (LIM1) for the ALP and Enigma subfamilies, respectively), the ALP/Enigma subfamilies evolved. The color code used for domains is PDZ (blue), LIM (yellow and green), CH (red), Kinase domain (black) and AM-motif (pink).</p>
