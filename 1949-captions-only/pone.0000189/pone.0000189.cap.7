                Figure 7. Chromosomal locations of ALP and Enigma subfamily genes. Shown are four species were PDZ/LIM genes are co-localized on the same chromosome. Numbers indicated are distances in mega basepairs (bp). If genes were found on individual chromosomes they are not shown here. Further not shown are the results for Pan troglodytes and Macaca mulatta which show exactly the same chromosomal distribution as observed for the humans. Not shown is also the data for Rattus norwegicus, where LIMK1 was co localized with LMO7, but no other combination was found. No combinations whatsoever were found in Mus musculus and in Canis familaris. It must be noted that for some of the species investigated the genomes are not completely sequenced and/or fully assembled.
