                Figure 1. Molecular models of pure and designer peptide nanofibers. A) Models represent peptide RADA16, ALK, DGR and PRG from Table 1. B) Model representing a Î²-sheet double-tape of a self-assembling peptide nanofiber with PRG motif (4:1). Note the sequences PRG extending out from the nanofiber double-tape.
