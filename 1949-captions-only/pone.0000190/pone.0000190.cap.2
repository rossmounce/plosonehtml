                Figure 2. Tapping Mode AFM images of 1% (w/v) peptides solution of A) RADA16, B) PRG alone, C) PRG+RADA16 (1:1). The bar represents 100 nm. The nanofiber formation is seen in A) RADA16 and C) PRG+RADA16 (1:1). An increase in the fiber thickness in C) PRG+RADA16 (1:1) (D = 29.5±3.1 nm) from A) RADA16 (D = 16.3±1.4 nm) was observed, which correlated to the width of the peptide fiber modeled in Fig. 1.
