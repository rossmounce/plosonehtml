MT3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 2 weeks on different scaffolds. RADA16:RADA16 1% (w/v), ALKmx:ALK 1% (w/v)+RADA16, DGRmx:DGR 1% (w/v)+RADA16, PRGmx: PRG 1% (w/v)+RADA16 (all mix ratio is 1:1). For peptide scaffolds containing active peptides, the cell proliferation rate is higher than that of pure RADA16. *p&lt;0.01; suggesting it is significant against the number of cells grown in pure RADA16 scaffold.</p>
