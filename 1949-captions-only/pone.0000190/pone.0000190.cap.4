                Figure 4. A) ALP activity normalized by DNA amount cultured on the different hydrogels for two weeks. RADA16:RADA16 1% (w/v), ALKmx: ALK 1% (w/v)+RADA16-I, DGRmx:DGR 1% (w/v)+RADA16, PRGmx:PRG 1% (w/v)+RADA16 (all mixture ratio is 1:1). ALK, DGR and PRG show the higher ALP activity compared to RADA16-I. *p&lt;0.01 suggesting it is significant against the ALP activity in pure RADA16-I. B) Osteocalcin content secreted in culture medium after culturing on the different hydrogels for two weeks. RADA16:RADA16 1% (w/v), ALKmx:ALK 1%(w/v)+RADA16, DGRmx:DGR 1%(w/v)+RADA16, PRGmx:PRG 1% (w/v)+RADA16 (all mixture ratio is 1:1). All modified peptides (ALK, DGR and PRG) show the higher osteocalcin contents compared to pure RADA16. PRG has a significantly higher concentration compared to the other scaffolds. *p&lt;0.01 suggesting it is significant against Osteocalcin in RADA16 scaffold.
