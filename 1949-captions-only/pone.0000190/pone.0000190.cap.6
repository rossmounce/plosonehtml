                Figure 6. Cell numbers on the different scaffolds of different mix ratio of designer PRG and pure RADA16 scaffolds after 1-week culture. There is an increase in proliferation following the increase PRG % scaffold when increased from 0 to 40%. There was a decrease in cell proliferation at PRG 100% suggesting that there is an optimal ratio of PRG and RADA16 scaffolds.
