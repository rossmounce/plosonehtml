                Figure 7. Cell morphology on the different scaffolds of various mix ratios of RADA16 1% (w/v) and PRG 1% (w/v) using calcein-AM staining. The bar represents 100 Âµm. A) RADA16 100%:PRG 0%, B) PRG 1%, C) PRG 10%, D) PRG 40%, E) PRG 70%, F) PRG 100% (RADA16: 0%). B) PRG: 1% shows uniform cell distribution compared to (A) 0%, which shows the increase of cell attachment. There is significant morphological difference in (C) 10% and (D) 40%, as seen by a change in cell shape from elongated form to asteroid form.
