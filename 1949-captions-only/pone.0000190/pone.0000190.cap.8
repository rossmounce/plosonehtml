                Figure 8. Reconstructed image of 3-D confocal microscope image of culturing on the different scaffolds consisting of different mix ratio of RADA16 1% (w/v) and PRG 1% (w/v) using calcein-AM staining. The bar represents 100 Âµm. A1 and A2: PRG 10% and B1&amp;B2: PRG 70%. A1 and B1 are vertical view and A2 and B2 are horizontal view. In the case of 10% PRG scaffold, the cells were attached on the surface of the scaffold whereas the cells were migrated into the scaffold in the case of 70% PRG scaffold. There is a drastic cell migration into the scaffold with higher concentration of PRG motif.
