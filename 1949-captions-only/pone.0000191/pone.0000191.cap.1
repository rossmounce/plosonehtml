Each group and selected avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks events are listed in <a href="#pone-0000191-t001">Table 1</a>. Day 0 is the day with the lowest daily minimum temperature recorded; while the red dot represents the date of an outbreak of AIV was reported. For <a href="#pone-0000191-g001">Figure 1(a)</a> the day zero time point of group I was chosen as the time of the outbreak, not the time of the lowest temperature, since the former happened earlier.</p>
