                Figure 1. Variation of daily minimum temperatures at WMO stations near H5N1 virus outbreak areas. Each group and selected avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks events are listed in Table 1. Day 0 is the day with the lowest daily minimum temperature recorded; while the red dot represents the date of an outbreak of AIV was reported. For Figure 1(a) the day zero time point of group I was chosen as the time of the outbreak, not the time of the lowest temperature, since the former happened earlier.
