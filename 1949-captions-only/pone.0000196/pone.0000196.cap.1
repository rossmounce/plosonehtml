                Figure 1. Meta-analyses of the three datasets for the 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms that were selected (p&lt;0.05 unadjusted for multiple comparisons) with at least two of the three strategies. For each polymorphism the forest plot shows the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for each dataset as well as the summary odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals by random effects calculations. Also shown is the p-value for the summary effect and the I-squared statistic for between-dataset heterogeneity.
