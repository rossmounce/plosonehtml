For each polymorphism the forest plot shows the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for each dataset as well as the summary odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals by random effects calculations. Also shown is the p-value for the summary effect and the I-squared statistic for between-dataset heterogeneity.</p>
