                Figure 3.  Boxplot of normalised tectal thicknesses of the four bird species. The log10 of the thickness of the tectum was normalised to the log10 of the width of the midbrain hemisection; N =  22 for kiwi, 40 for Emu, 26 for Barn Owl and 49 for Pigeon. Data was analysed using Mann-Whitney non parametric pairwise comparisons (against Kiwi). *: p≤0.005; **: p≤0.001.
