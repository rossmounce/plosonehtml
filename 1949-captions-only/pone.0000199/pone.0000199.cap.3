                Figure 3. A: Maximum intensity projection of a representative confocal image stack with Chromosome territories 7 (Red, Spectrum orange) and 19 (Green, Rhodamine Green) from DLD-1+19 B: A 3D reconstruction of the nucleus and chromosome territories from the image shown in A (X-Y orientation). C: A scheme adopted for 3D distance measurements of chromosome territories in Red (R1 and R2) and Green (G1, G2, and G3) from the geometric center of the nucleus (Nc), to the nuclear periphery (NP). Points on the nuclear periphery (eg. NpR1) are extensions from the nuclear center through the geometric center of the chromosome territory. D: 3D reconstruction in B shown in X-Z orientation.
