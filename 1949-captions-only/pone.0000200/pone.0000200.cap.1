A. Image of the exposed cortex taken with a 540 nm filter (green light) which shows the angioarchitectonic of areas 7a and DP of the left hemisphere of the second monkey (M2L). B. Image of the exposed cortex taken with a 605 nm filter (orange light) during the recording session; the focus is 500 Âµm below the surface capillaries. The inset of panel B indicates the location of the imaged region for M2L. Note there is an extra unnamed sulcus medial to the STS. Horizontal bars: 1 mm. Data set: M2L 09-24-2002. STS: superior temporal sulcus, IPS: intraparietal sulcus, LS: lunate sulcus, M: medial, A: anterior.</p>
