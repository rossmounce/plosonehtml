                Figure 10. Reliability of the maps. Two different data sets are shown. A. Angioarchitectonic of area 7a and DP. The images show that the topography of optic flow is not related to the vasculature. B,C. Optical maps recorded two days apart from each other. Central portion: for each experiment a careful alignment between the map and the cortical angioarchitectonic has been made. Black lines on the optical maps indicate the drawing of superimposed blood vessels that is used as a landmark for the region of interest (ROI) selection. The squares indicate the ROIs selected in areas 7a (upper portion) and DP (lower portion). The ROIs are shown enlarged to illustrate the patchy architecture. Panel B is shown reduced so to match the resolution of panel C. Horizontal bars: 1 mm. Data set: M1R 11-27-2001 and 11-29-2001.
