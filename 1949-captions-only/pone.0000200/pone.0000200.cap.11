                Figure 11. Optic flow distributions for the same data set shown in Fig. 10. A–B. Optical maps. Black lines indicate the putative border between area 7a and DP. Big squares indicate the regions of interest (ROIs) selected in areas 7a and DP for the distribution analysis. C–D. Polar plots showing the optic flow distribution of each ROI. Arrows represent the mean angle: black arrow indicates 7a, white arrow indicates DP. Panel A is shown reduced so to match the resolution of panel B. Horizontal bars: 1 mm.
