                Figure 13. Spatial frequency analysis of parameter maps. A1. Parameter map for rotation coefficient (note that all parameter maps are the same maps shown in Fig. 6). A2. The FFT is computed (Methods) and the logarithm of the power as a function of horizontal and vertical spatial frequency is presented using a color map. The peak at the center is the DC component; there is a rapid fall-off in power as the spatial frequency increases. A3. Normalized spatial frequency dependence of the power for the rotation map. Eighteen cuts were taken through the FFT of A2. The cut taken at 90° is illustrated. For this graph, the data is normalized by the integral of the RMS power under curve. The arrow indicates the peak 0.7 cyc/mm corresponding to a spatial wavelength of 1.42 mm. B1. Parameter map for radial coefficient. B2. FFT of the radial parameter map. B3. Normalized spatial frequency dependence of the power for the radial map. The arrow indicates the peak 1.07 cyc/mm corresponding to a spatial wavelength of 930 µm. C1. Parameter map for eye position coefficient. C2. FFT of the eye position coefficient. C3. Normalized spatial frequency dependence of the power for the eye position map. The arrow indicates the peak 1.31 cyc/mm corresponding to a spatial wavelength of 760 µm. The dotted line in A–C2 represents the section shown in A–C3. Conventions for grey scale as in Fig. 6. RMS: root mean square.
