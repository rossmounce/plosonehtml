                Figure 14. Polar plot of the spatial frequency of the peak nearest the DC peak for each angle. All 18 sections were examined in order to obtain the set of peaks consistently close to the central DC peak. A. Rotation and radial component B. Eye position component. In each plot the circle represents the data indicated by the arrows in Fig. 13.
