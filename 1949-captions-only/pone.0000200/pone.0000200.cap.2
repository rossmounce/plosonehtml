                Figure 2. Behavioral protocol. A. Stimuli. Optic flow patterns were made by 128 moving dots with an average speed of 6°/sec. B. Temporal sequence of the behavioral task. At the onset of the fixation point (a) the monkey has to pull a lever (d). After two seconds the optic flow stimulus appears (b) and remains displayed for at least four seconds, after which, at a random time, the optic flow stimulus changes its motion from structured to unstructured (c). The monkey had to release the lever within a maximum reaction time of 650 msec (d). The two filled epochs indicate the temporal windows used in the analysis. The baseline image is acquired during the simple fixation, i.e. all frames collected between −1000 and 0 msec are averaged together; the stimulus image is acquired between 2000 and 3000 msec. RT: reaction time. The thick circle represents an exemplar stimulus position, while the dashed circle represents a potential stimulus position.
