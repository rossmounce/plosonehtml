                Figure 3. Behavioral performance in the optic flow task. A. Behavioral results from a single experiment of M2L. The reaction time is plotted as a function of the type of optic flow. Certain flows yielded shorter reaction times than others. Data are shown as upper fixation +SE, lower fixation âˆ’SE. Data set: 11-18-2002. B. Results for the ANOVA in all experiments of M1R and M2L. OF: optic flow; Exp: expansion; Contr: contraction; CW: clockwise; CCW: counter-clockwise. EP: eye position. C. Regression coefficients for both monkeys. The small arrow indicates the data from panel A. SE for each animal is indicated by the thicker line along the circumference. The mean direction for each animal is indicated by the vector arrows. The length of each arrow has no meaning. D. Average reaction times (RT)+SD for all experiments of both monkeys. FIX: fixation.
