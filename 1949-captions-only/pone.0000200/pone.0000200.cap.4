The baseline normalization analysis images from all correct trials in each condition were averaged together providing eight maps (4 optic flow stimuli by 2 eye positions). The average images were multiplied by “−1” to produce images whose brightness indicates expected neuronal activity. The grey scale at the bottom provides the amplitudes. The average of all maps was subtracted from each image. A. Clockwise (CW) during upward fixation. B. CW during downward fixation. C. Counter-clockwise (CCW) during upward fixation. D. CCW during downward fixation. E. Expansion (Exp) during upward fixation. F. Exp during downward fixation. G. Contraction (Contr) during upward fixation. H. Contr during downward fixation. The black lines indicate the putative border between 7a and DP. Horizontal bars: 1 mm. Data set: M1R 12-05-2001.</p>
