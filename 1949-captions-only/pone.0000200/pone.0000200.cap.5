All correct trials in each condition have been averaged together providing eight maps (4 flows by 2 eye positions). To determine the optic flow selectivity for each of the eye positions, planned comparisons were made for each opposing type of optic flow. The subtractions were performed on the images of <a href="#pone-0000200-g004">Fig. 4</a>. A. The average of clockwise (CW) has been subtracted from the average of counter-clockwise (CCW) for fixation in the upper part of the visual field B. Same comparison for fixation in the lower part of the visual field. C. The average of images taken during expansion (Exp) has been subtracted from the average of contraction (Contr) for fixation in the upper part of the visual field. D. Same comparison for fixation in the lower part of the visual field. E. The average of CW during upward fixations has been subtracted from the average of CW during downward fixations. F. Same comparison for Exp motion. Grey scale indicates the percentage of reflectance of the optical signal; brightness indicates increase in deoxyhemoglobin. Horizontal bar: 1 mm; data: M1R 12-05-2005.</p>
