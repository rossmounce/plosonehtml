                Figure 7. Regression analysis for representation of optic flow in the left hemisphere of M2L. A. Eye position map. B. Rotation coefficient map. C. Radial coefficient map. D. Angle map. The recording region is the same as shown in Fig. 1A. The grey scale indicates the percentage of increase (bright) or decrease (dark) of the reflectance of the signal with respect to the baseline. See legend of Fig. 6. Horizontal bar: 1 mm. Data set: M2L 11-19-2002.
