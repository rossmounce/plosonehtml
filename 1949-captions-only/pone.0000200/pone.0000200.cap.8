An analysis sampling the data was performed with and without shuffling the relationship between the measured optical signals and the stimulus conditions <a href="#pone.0000200-Raffi2">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000200-Siegel2">[14]</a>, also see <a href="#s3">Results</a>). Fifty percent of the trials were randomly selected and <em>eq. 2</em> was fit to the data yielding the Sampled maps. Half of the data was also reanalyzed with <em>eq. 2</em>, but the relationship between the collected data and the stimulus condition was randomized yielding the “Monte” coefficient maps. This process was repeated 136 times. Averages of the maps were computed (see <a href="#s3">Results</a>). A1,2. Intercept parameter maps. B1,2. Eye position coefficient. C1,2. Rotation coefficient. D1,2. Radial coefficient. E1,2. Composite amplitude and angle map. The amplitude (given as a grey scale) is superimposed on the angle map. The Monte Carlo map magnitude is very small. F. Polar plot of the circular distributions angles taken from the two regions of interest (ROI) of Panel E. The radial amplitude of the distributions is the number of samples out of 136iterations. Conventions for grey scale as in <a href="#pone-0000200-g006">Fig. 6</a>. Horizontal bars: 1 mm. Data set M1R 12-05-2001.</p>
