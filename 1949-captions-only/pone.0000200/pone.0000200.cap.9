The time courses were averaged in four regions of interest (ROIs), two located in area 7a and two in area DP, of about 0.7×0.7 mm. The time courses were plotted for upward and downward fixations and for each type of optic flow (i.e. radial or rotational). Each ROI has been selected within a patch to show the time course of the signal relatively to a stimulus or a combination of two stimuli. Note that the vertical scale in panel C is different than panels A,B,D. −2000: onset of the fixation point; −1000 to 0: baseline window; 0: onset of the optic flow stimulus; 2000 to 3000: stimulus window. Exp: expansion; Contr: contraction; CW: clockwise; CCW: counter-clockwise. Horizontal bar: 1 mm. Data set: M1R 12-05-2001.</p>
