Basic residues in black, hydrophobic residues in red, other residues in blue. The structure of SP associated to membranes is not known. pAntp is only ~70% helical when interacting with membranes. The basic/hydrophobic surfaces ratio of RL16 is higher than that of RW16. Helices were generated with the Swiss-PdbViewer programme.</p>
