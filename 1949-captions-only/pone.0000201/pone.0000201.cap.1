                Figure 1. Projections of α–helices of the six basic studied peptides. Basic residues in black, hydrophobic residues in red, other residues in blue. The structure of SP associated to membranes is not known. pAntp is only ~70% helical when interacting with membranes. The basic/hydrophobic surfaces ratio of RL16 is higher than that of RW16. Helices were generated with the Swiss-PdbViewer programme.
