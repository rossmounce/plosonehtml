                Figure 3. Membrane deformations on GUVs (PC/PG 9/1) induced by amphipathic peptides. Coexistence of tubes and small vesicles inside the GUVs (A, B) and adhesion of GUVs by RW9 (C). Tubes formation (D) membrane aggregates (E) and GUVs adhesion and internal vesicles (F) induced by RW16 peptide. Time-lapse sequence of a GUV burst induced by RL16, t = 0 s (G) t = 2 s (H) and t = 3 s (I). Scale bar 10 Âµm.
