                Figure 4. Membrane thickness alteration induced by peptides. A) Diffractograms of PC/PG (9/1) MLVs in the absence or presence of peptides with a weight ratio peptide/lipid of 1/20 (at 20Â°C). Thick arrow shows the position of a weak non lamellar contribution induced by substance P. Ld1 and Ld2 are two lamellar phases clearly distinguished by slightly different d-spacings. B) Electron density profiles of Ld1 phase of peptide free MLVs or formed in the presence of RW9 and SP peptides. C) Electron density profiles of Ld2 phase of peptide free MLVs or formed in the presence of RW16 and RL16.
