                Figure 5. Membrane bridging capacity of peptides. A) Aggregation profiles of PC/PG (9/1) vesicles at different Peptide/Lipids weight ratios: R9 (○), pAntp (□), RW9 (•), RW16 (▪), RL16 (▴) and SP (X). Optical density (OD) was recorded at the plateau of aggregation (20 min after peptide addition). B) Membrane binding and aggregation of RW16, RW9 and pAntp peptides. Shift in emission wavelength (λ shift) in function of P/L ratio (solid lines). LUVs aggregation (dotted lines). For presentation facility, data were adjusted in arbitrary units. pAntp (□), RW9 (•), RW16 (▪). All experiments were achieved at 25°C.
