                Figure 7. Movement of Annexin 2-GFP by peptide-induced ion permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Visualisation by fluorescence microscopy of the Anx2-GFP migration from the cytsol to the plasma membrane before and after addition of peptides (10 µM). pAntp, RL16 and RW16. (A,C,E before peptide addition, B,D,F 10 min after peptide addition). Scale bar 10 µm.
