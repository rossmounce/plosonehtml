A) Two main properties are considered: amphipathicity and net positive charge. Changes in these properties result in different degrees of membrane perturbations. Basic surface in dark, hydrophobic surface in white. B) The binding of the amphipathic peptides involves electrostatic interactions between the basic residues and lipid headgroup negative charges, and hydrophobic interactions with lipid fatty acyl moieties. A strong snorkelling effect of the peptide could induce protrusion of headgroups attracted by the charged helix residues inducing lipid reorganisation resulting in asymmetry of the bilayer halves and positive curvature of the membrane. C) The detergent property of amphipathic peptides and the induced positive curvature result in the formation of toroidal pores. D) The binding of basic peptides mainly involves electrostatic interactions with the lipid headgroup phosphates. This results in the recruitment of phospholipids and then in membrane asymmetry with negative curvature. E) The bridging interaction of the peptide between two membranes allows adhesion and vesicles aggregation. F) Membrane tubulation results from the membrane curvature inducing invaginations. The thin tubes could be stabilized by the bridging properties of the peptides between membranes apposed faces.</p>
