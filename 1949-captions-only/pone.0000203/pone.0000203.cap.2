                Figure 2.  Schematic illustrating the relationship between Hsmar DNA-type TEs (A), Made1 MITEs (B) and hairpins (C) of the kind recognized by the miRNA enzymatic processing machinery.A) A full length DNA-type element with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) flanking an open reading frame (ORF) is shown. B) Non-autonomous MITE derivative of a full length DNA-type element, containing TIRs but no internal ORF. C) Predicted hairpin structure that would be formed by base-pair interactions of the MITE TIRs.
