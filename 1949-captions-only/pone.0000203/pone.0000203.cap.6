                Figure 6.  Coexpressed clusters of putative hsa-mir-548 target genes.Centroid views with average tissue-specific expression values are shown for all 20 clusters. Clusters containing genes down-regulated in the colorectal adenocarcinoma sample are shown in red and arrows indicate the colorectal sample.
