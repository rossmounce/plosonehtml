                Figure 7.  Representative gene expression profiles for putative hsa-mir-548 target genes from three coexpressed clusters (12, 15 and 20 in Figure 6).Expression profiles are median centered and log2 normalized, and the log2 ratio color scale is shown above the plot. Overexpressed genes are shown in red and underexpressed genes are shown in green.
