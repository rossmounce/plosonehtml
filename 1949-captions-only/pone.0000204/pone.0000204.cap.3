Comparison of insertions (in profile sequence; black boxes) and deletions (in profile sequence; white boxes), and correspondence of indels (&gt;3 amino acids) with intron positions (yellow boxes). For comparison, all DANGER sequences are mapped onto the Mab-21 profile sequence according to pairwise alignment coordinates. The microdomains IIâ€“VIII are also shown. Species abbreviations are as in <a href="#pone-0000204-g001">Figure 1A</a>.</p>
