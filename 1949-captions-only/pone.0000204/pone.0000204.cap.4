                Figure 4.  Analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) show that mouse and human DANGER sequences exhibit different transcriptional patterns.Upper: Plot depicting the expression levels of the mouse DANGER sequences in different tissues. Lower: Plot depicting the expression levels of the human DANGER sequences in different tissues. (Additional information and the Unigene identification numbers for each gene used in this analysis can be found in Figure S13).
