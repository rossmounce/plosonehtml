PC12 cells expressing D1A have increased neurite outgrowth. Bottom: Phase picture and 485 nm emission of PC12 cells transfected with YFP-alone or YFP+siRNA against rat D1A stimulated with NGF (3 ng/ml 7 days). PC12 cells depleted of endogenous D1A using siRNA have decreased neurite outgrowth. (B) Quantification of neurite outgrowth in PC12 and TT cells. (100 cells counted in 3 independent experiments) (C) Left: Immunofluorescent staining of mouse primary spinal cord neurons with Alexa488-conjugated DANGER1A antibody. Inset: Quantification of spinal cord neurite length in neurons overexpressing YFP alone or YFP+D1A. (D) Western analysis of D1A expression in the p1 (nuclear), p2 (heavy ER and mitochondria), p3(light ER and vesicles), or s3 (cytosol) cell fractions over a time course of 48 h stimulation with NFG (10 ng/ml). These individual blots were developed simultaneously on the same film. The numbers inside the blots quantify the change in D1A distribution over time course (Error: SEM; p&lt;0.01 n = 4). (E) Right: Western analysis of the MAP-kinase proteins ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, Raf, phospho-Raf, and D1A levels in PC12 cells transfected with either YFP, YFP+D1A, or YFP+siRNA D1A. Cells were treated with vehicle (water), or 3 ng/ml NGF for 48 hours. Left: Quantification of changes in total and phospho-ERK1/2 and total D1A by scanning densitometry. All values are expressed as fold-change vs. control; ERK-(Error: SEM; p&lt;0.05 n = 3); D1A-(Error: SEM; p&lt;0.01 n = 3)</p>
