Amphioxus was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Horizontal sections of these samples were hybridized with the sense probes of Ikaros-like (A), EBF (C), Bam32 (E), and TAPP1 (G) as the control. (B) The Ikaros-like genes expressed in the ovary and gills. (D) The EBF gene expressed at the gills, ovary and intestine. (F) Expression of Bam32 was in ovary, metapleural fold and intestine. (H) Expression of TAPP1 was observed in intestine. In all sections, tissues and organs are indicated as flowed: 1, muscle; 2, hepatic cecum; 3, intestines; 4, gill; 5, sexual-gland; 6, notochord. 7, metapleural fold. Positive signals are shown by arrow.</p>
