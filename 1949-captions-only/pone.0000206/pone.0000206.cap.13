                Figure 13. Phosphoinositide binding properties of the amphioxus Bam32 and TAPP1. The ability of the following GST fusion proteins of amphioxus Bam32 and TAPP1 was analysed using a protein-lipid overlay. The indicated phosphoinositides (20 pmol) were spotted on to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with the purified GST-fusion proteins. The membrane was washed, and the GST-fusion proteins bound to the membrane by virtue of their interaction with lipid were detected using a GST antibody. A representative experiment of three is shown. The phosphoinositides are identified by the positions of encircled numbers at the top of the figure. 1, PtdIns (3, 4) P2; 2, PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3; 3, PtdIns.
