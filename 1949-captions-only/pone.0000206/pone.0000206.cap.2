                Figure 2. Transmission electron-microscopic views of the lymphocyte-like cells in follicle-associated epithelium of amphioxus gill. (A) Follicle-associated epithelium cells in the gill contained follicle (F) rootlet (R), and cilia (C). Magnification 29000. (B) The lymphocyte-like cells contained large nuclei (N) with heterochromatin forming a peripheral rim adjacent to the nuclear envelope. Magnification 48000. (C) Under the FAE of normal amphioxus gill, lots of lymphocyte-like cells (L) were seen. The cells contained large nuclei (N) with heterochromatin forming a peripheral rim adjacent to the nuclear envelope. Magnification 5800. (D) At the same magnification, after the microbial challenge, the lymphocyte-like cells were bigger than those of normal cells.
