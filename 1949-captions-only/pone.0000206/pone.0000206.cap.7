The conserved DNA binding domain and IPT/TIG domain were colored with red and orange separately. The atypical zinc finger motif obligatory for DNA binding was marked with black arrows. The horizontal dashed arrow indicated the helix 1 and helix 2 of HLH motif. The additional duplicated helix 2 in vertebrate COE proteins was also indicated. The accession number of Mus EBF-1 is NM_007897.</p>
