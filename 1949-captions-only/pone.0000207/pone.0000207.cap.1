For each set, the 20% isopleth surrounds the densest aggregation of points that appear as relatively black areas in each of the plots. UDs constructed using the fixed kernel least-squares cross-validation method for these data are illustrations in the lower row (sizes have been adjusted to provide visual correspondenceâ€”where precise estimates of the fits are given in <a href="#pone-0000207-t001">Table 1</a>).</p>
