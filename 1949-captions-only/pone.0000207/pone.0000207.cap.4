                Figure 4. The effect of sample size on the optimal (i.e. error minimizing) value of parameters, k, r and a and total errors associated with the construction of the 100% isopleth using the k-LoCoH (solid line), r-LoCoH (dashed line), and a-LoCoH (dotted line) methods respectively for the three data sets (A, B, and C). Mean and standard error for fifteen randomly generated datasets for each sample size are plotted.
