                Figure 8. Comparisons of UD constructions using an a-LoCoH estimators where the value of the parameter is aÌ‚ obtained using the MSHC method (see text for details), and a parametric kernel, where the smoothing parameter h is calculated using the ad-hoc method of Silverman (1986). Panels: a. collar T07 and b. collar T15, both in the Satara Region; and c. collar T13 and d. collar T16. both in the Lower Sabie Region. Black circles are GPS collar locations and the hatched shape is the exclosure in a. and b. and the ridge area in c. and d. The left figure of each panel shows the 100% isopleth in light grey and the 95% isopleth in dark grey, using the a-LoCoH method. The right figure of each panel shows the 100% kernel in light grey and the 95% parametric kernel in dark grey.
