                Figure 3. Change Categorization; an example from Wadi Gaetri. Distance is measured from each interpreted point (IP) to the nearest field observation (FO) with canopy area &gt;6 m2. A If an IP has only one FO closer than 20 m, the two points are considered as referring to the same tree and categorized as surviving. B If an IP is separated by more than 20 m from any FO it is considered unmatched and categorized as dead. C If two IPs have the same FO closer than 20 m, the pair with the shortest distance is considered as referring to the same tree and the IP categorized as “surviving”. The second IP is categorized as dead if no other FO is closer than 20 m. Unmatched FOs are categorized as unrecognized and can be either D accounted for and merged with surviving or E not accounted for and merged with new (cf. [32]).
