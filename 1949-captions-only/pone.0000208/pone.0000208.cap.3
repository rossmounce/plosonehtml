Distance is measured from each interpreted point (IP) to the nearest field observation (FO) with canopy area &gt;6 m<sup>2</sup>. A If an IP has only one FO closer than 20 m, the two points are considered as referring to the same tree and categorized as <em>surviving</em>. B If an IP is separated by more than 20 m from any FO it is considered unmatched and categorized as <em>dead</em>. C If two IPs have the same FO closer than 20 m, the pair with the shortest distance is considered as referring to the same tree and the IP categorized as “<em>surviving</em>”. The second IP is categorized as <em>dead</em> if no other FO is closer than 20 m. Unmatched FOs are categorized as unrecognized and can be either D accounted for and merged with <em>surviving</em> or E not accounted for and merged with <em>new</em> (cf. <a href="#pone.0000208-Andersen2">[32]</a>).</p>
