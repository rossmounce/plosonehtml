                Figure 5. Changes in Wadi Gaetri between A 1996 and B 2003. I: In 2003 a hole in the ground is all that testifies to the presence of the stump (1996). II: A green tree has already lost half of its canopy. In 2003 this tree is completely gone, suggesting live felling for charcoal production.
