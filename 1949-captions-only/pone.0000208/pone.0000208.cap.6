Change, i.e. difference between mortality and recruitment, is the orthogonal distance from the diagonal axis. Labels are explained in <a href="#pone-0000208-t001">Table 1</a>. A and C show absolute change and B and D relative change. In A and B sizes of symbols are proportional to total vegetation density and recruitment estimates are based on <em>new</em> indivduals. Grey shapes show clusters of sites with similar types of change, resulting from similar combinations of mortality and recruitment: A I–III: low to intermediate negative, IV: high negative, V–VI: low to intermediate positive, B I–II: low to intermediate negative, III high negative, IV low positive and V high positive. In C and D recruitment estimates are based on <em>recruits</em>. Note the discontinuous scale on the y-axis in A and C.</p>
