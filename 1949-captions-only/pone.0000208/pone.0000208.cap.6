                Figure 6. Trend of change for sites. Change, i.e. difference between mortality and recruitment, is the orthogonal distance from the diagonal axis. Labels are explained in Table 1. A and C show absolute change and B and D relative change. In A and B sizes of symbols are proportional to total vegetation density and recruitment estimates are based on new indivduals. Grey shapes show clusters of sites with similar types of change, resulting from similar combinations of mortality and recruitment: A I–III: low to intermediate negative, IV: high negative, V–VI: low to intermediate positive, B I–II: low to intermediate negative, III high negative, IV low positive and V high positive. In C and D recruitment estimates are based on recruits. Note the discontinuous scale on the y-axis in A and C.
