                Figure 2. The 50×50 Kohonen maps of the unsupervised clustering (left) and of the supervised clustering (right) of the 5BLC vectors during 1992–93. For clarity reason, only the labels of the most populated LC classes A (black), C (grey) and W (white), are shown. Self-aggregations of equal LC6 labels are amplified by supervising. A given LC spreads on some clusters each one corresponding to a cluster of similar 5LC sequences.
