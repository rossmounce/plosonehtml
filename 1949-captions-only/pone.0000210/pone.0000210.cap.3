                Figure 3. Neighbourhood matrix of LC6 classes, with rounded values of VN3(i,j)×100, for the non supervised Kohonen map in the period 1975–94, where W has been smoothed three times. The non-zero values are coloured to show the closer classes on the map. In the first column are the aggregation factors for each LC, in the second column the LC6 numeration of Table 3.
