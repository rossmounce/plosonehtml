                     <em>E. coli</em> reporter strains ADA100 [AB734 λΦ(<em>ibp</em>::<em>lacZ</em>)], ADA310 [AB734λΦ (<em>cspA</em>::<em>lacZ</em>)], ADA410 [AB734 λΦ(p3<em>RpoH</em>::<em>lacZ</em>)] and ADA510 [AB734 λΦ(<em>sulA</em>::<em>lacZ</em>)] containing the stress-responsive promoters <em>ibpA, cspA, p3RpoH</em> and <em>sulA</em> fused to the <em>lacZ</em> gene respectively, were used to study transcription induction in cells treated or untreated with K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub> (0.5 µg/ml). β-galactosidase activity was evaluated at time 0 and after 3 h with or without tellurite treatment. The fold induction was calculated dividing the value obtained at 3 h by the value at time 0. Results are the average of at least 4 determinations.</p>
