                Figure 2.  Generation of intracellular ROS by K2TeO3.Cytoplasmic ROS content was evaluated measuring the H2DCFDA probe activation in E. coli cells treated with different sub lethal concentrations of tellurite [0 (▪), 0.2 (•), 0.5 (▴) and 1 µg/ml (◂)]. Fluorescence was measured 10 times at 2 min intervals. The inset shows probe activation at 28 min by tellurite at the indicated concentrations. See Methods for details.
