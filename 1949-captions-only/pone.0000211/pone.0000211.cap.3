A, protein oxidation was determined by a chemical protein carbonyl assay by derivatizing total cellular proteins with DNPH and reading specific carbonyls absorbance at 370 nm. B, membrane peroxidation products were determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances present in crude extracts of <em>E. coli</em> BW25113 by the method described by Rice-Evans et al. <a href="#pone.0000211-RiceEvans1">[19]</a>.</p>
