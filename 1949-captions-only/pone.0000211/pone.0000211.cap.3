                Figure 3.  Tellurite increases the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins and membrane lipids in E. coli.
                  Effects of K2TeO3 (0.5 µg/ml) and H2O2 (100 µM) on protein carbonyl (A) and TBARs content (B) of E. coli BW25113 cells exposed to these compounds for 30 min. A, protein oxidation was determined by a chemical protein carbonyl assay by derivatizing total cellular proteins with DNPH and reading specific carbonyls absorbance at 370 nm. B, membrane peroxidation products were determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances present in crude extracts of E. coli BW25113 by the method described by Rice-Evans et al. [19].
