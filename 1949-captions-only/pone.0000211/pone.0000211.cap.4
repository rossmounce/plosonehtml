                Figure 4.  Effect of potassium tellurite on E. coli catalase and superoxide dismutase.A, activity of catalases in crude protein extracts of E. coli BW25113 treated (•) or untreated (▪) with 0.5 µg/ml of K2TeO3. Cells were collected at 15 min intervals and catalase activity (µmol hydrogen peroxide/min/mg protein) was determined. B, activity of superoxide dismutases in crude protein extracts of E. coli BW25113 treated (•) and untreated (▪) with 0.5 µg/ml K2TeO3. Cells were harvested and SOD activity (U/mg protein) was determined.
