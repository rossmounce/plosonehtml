Cells were collected at 15 min intervals and catalase activity (µmol hydrogen peroxide/min/mg protein) was determined. B, activity of superoxide dismutases in crude protein extracts of <em>E. coli</em> BW25113 treated (•) and untreated (▪) with 0.5 µg/ml K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>. Cells were harvested and SOD activity (U/mg protein) was determined.</p>
