                Figure 5.  Tellurite induces katG and soxS mRNA synthesis in E. coli.
                  DNA fragments (300 bp) from E. coli sodA, sodB, katG, soxS and gapA genes were amplified by RT-PCR and fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gels (1.5%). Total RNA from cells grown with (K2TeO3) or without (control) 0.5 Âµg/ml potassium tellurite was used as template for the RT-PCR. The estimated DNA (ng) content determined for each band is shown (see Material and Methods for details).
