                     In vitro tellurite reduction generates superoxide in E. coli.
                  Superoxide generation was evaluated using an in vitro tellurite reduction assay previously developed in our laboratory [34]. The system makes use of the O2
                     − specific reactive compound WST-1. WST-1 reduction was determined in the presence of catalase and NADPH (Cat); catalase, tellurite and NADPH (Cat/Te); catalase, tellurite, NADPH and purified superoxide dismutase (Cat/Te/SOD); catalase, tellurite, NADPH and β-amylase (Cat/Te/amylase).
