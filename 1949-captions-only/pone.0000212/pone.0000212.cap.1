A. Time series of phagocytosis. A red-labeled <em>D. caveatum</em> amoeba (red arrow) phagocytoses a GFP-expressing <em>D. discoideum</em> amoeba (green arrow). Engulfment is complete within 2 minutes following contact. The prey cell is fragmented into several phagosomes within the same time frame (see GFP-positive fragments at 2.5 minutes following contact). After less than 10 minutes, phagocytosis is complete and the <em>D. caveatum</em> amoeba resumes migration until it comes into contact with another prey cell. Time is in minutes and seconds (MM:SS, see Movie <a href="#pone.0000212.s002">S1A</a> and <a href="#pone.0000212.s003">S1B</a>). Bar = 10 µm. B. Histological section of <em>D. caveatum</em> amoebae in an aggregate where the prey cells were initially at 1 <em>D. caveatum</em> for 1000 prey cells. <em>D. caveatum</em> amoebae are presumably the large darker cells showing a cytoplasmic basophilic straining (arrows), containing material resembling the majority of cells in the aggregate (fragments of <em>D. discoideum</em> cells). This section was prepared 16 hours after the beginning of development. Bar = 10 µm. C. Histological section of an aggregate in which nearly all <em>D. discoideum</em> amoebae have been consumed and only <em>D. caveatum</em> cells remain. These cells are packed in dense aggregates, and a few of them still contain remnants of <em>D. discoideum</em> amoebae. Dotted lines have been drawn around foci of aggregating <em>D. caveatum</em> within the cellular mass. This section corresponds to 36 hours after the beginning of development. Bar = 10 µm.</p>
