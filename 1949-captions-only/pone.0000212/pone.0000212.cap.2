Cells of control GFP-expressing <em>D. discoideum</em> populations (A) and GFP-expressing <em>D. discoideum</em> populations containing 1/10<sup>3</sup> Cell Tracker Red-labeled <em>D. caveatum</em> (B) were allowed to develop for 36 hours and continuously observed by time-lapse video microscopy. A. The control <em>D. discoideum</em> cultures undergo development from aggregation to fruiting (collective circular motion within aggregates is observed; see <a href="#pone.0000212.s006">Movie S2A</a>). Three stages are shown here: beginning of development (before aggregation), the tight aggregate stage, and the slug stage. Time is in HH:MM and 00:00 corresponds to the beginning of recording, during the initiation of aggregation. Bar = 200 Âµm. B. Aggregates infected with <em>D. caveatum</em> are blocked at the aggregate stage and no collective circular motion is observed (see <a href="#pone.0000212.s007">Movie S2B</a>). Finally <em>D. caveatum</em> amoebae emerge as slugs and fruiting bodies when all of <em>D. discoideum</em> amoebae are consumed (and the GFP signal disappears).</p>
