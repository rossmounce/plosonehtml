                Figure 3. In mixtures of 1/103 
                     D. caveatum/D. discoideum, aggregation is blocked but cell-type differentiation occurs. Time in HH:MM. 00:00 corresponds to the beginning of recording, during the initiation of aggregation. Bar = 200 Âµm. A. In control developing D. discoideum populations, amoebae start to express CFP and YFP under the control of pre-spore or pre-stalk promoters after aggregation but before tip formation. The collective rotational motion of amoebae in aggregates is observed (see Movie S3A). These markers are subsequently expressed in the pre-spore or pre-stalk regions of slugs and finally the stalk and spores of fruiting bodies (see Movie S3A). Two stages are shown here: late aggregation phase, before the fluorescent reporters are expressed; and tip formation, when the markers are already fully expressed and cells have sorted out to different regions of these aggregates. B. In 1/103 
                     D. caveatum-infected D. discoideum populations, these markers are also expressed after aggregation. However there is no collective rotational motion (see Movie S3B) and no tip formation. These markers persist until all D. discoideum amoebae are ingested and starving D. caveatum triggers its own development program. Here we show the late aggregation phase, before the fluorescent reporters are expressed; and the blocked aggregate phase, when markers are expressed but no tips form on aggregates.
