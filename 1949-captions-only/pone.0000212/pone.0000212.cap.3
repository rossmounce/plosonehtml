                     <em>D. caveatum</em>/<em>D. discoideum,</em> aggregation is blocked but cell-type differentiation occurs. Time in HH:MM. 00:00 corresponds to the beginning of recording, during the initiation of aggregation. Bar = 200 Âµm. A. In control developing <em>D. discoideum</em> populations, amoebae start to express CFP and YFP under the control of pre-spore or pre-stalk promoters after aggregation but before tip formation. The collective rotational motion of amoebae in aggregates is observed (see <a href="#pone.0000212.s008">Movie S3A</a>). These markers are subsequently expressed in the pre-spore or pre-stalk regions of slugs and finally the stalk and spores of fruiting bodies (see <a href="#pone.0000212.s008">Movie S3A</a>). Two stages are shown here: late aggregation phase, before the fluorescent reporters are expressed; and tip formation, when the markers are already fully expressed and cells have sorted out to different regions of these aggregates. B. In 1/10<sup>3</sup> 
                     <em>D. caveatum</em>-infected <em>D. discoideum</em> populations, these markers are also expressed after aggregation. However there is no collective rotational motion (see <a href="#pone.0000212.s009">Movie S3B</a>) and no tip formation. These markers persist until all <em>D. discoideum</em> amoebae are ingested and starving <em>D. caveatum</em> triggers its own development program. Here we show the late aggregation phase, before the fluorescent reporters are expressed; and the blocked aggregate phase, when markers are expressed but no tips form on aggregates.</p>
