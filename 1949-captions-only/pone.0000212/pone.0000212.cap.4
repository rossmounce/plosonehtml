                Figure 4. A chemically induced block to development. A. Dialysis membranes of various pore sizes were filled with starving amoebae of D. discoideum (control) or D. caveatum at 107/mL. Millipore filters, on which test populations of D. discoideum had been deposited, were placed on top of the dialysis membranes. The two populations were in chemical but not physical contact (see Figure 5). After 24 hours of development of the test populations, fruiting was complete in the case of the D. discoideum-filled membranes, partial in the case of the D. caveatum-filled 500 Da membrane. Development was blocked at the aggregation stage, in the case of D. caveatum-filled membranes of size greater than 1 kDa. Bar = 500 µm. A dialysate of a D. caveatum-filled membrane also inhibits development of D. discoideum. A dialysis membrane filled with D. caveatum was dialysed against 1.5 mL of SorC buffer for 24 hours. Test populations of D. discoideum on filters were then incubated with this dialysate or SorC (control). At 20 hours of development, the dialysate had inhibited D. discoideum development at the aggregate stage while control D. discoideum had reached the slug stage. The inhibition was a 4–6 hour lag at aggregation stage. Bar = 500 µm.
