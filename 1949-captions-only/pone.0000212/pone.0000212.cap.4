A. Dialysis membranes of various pore sizes were filled with starving amoebae of <em>D. discoideum</em> (control) or <em>D. caveatum</em> at 10<sup>7</sup>/mL. Millipore filters, on which test populations of <em>D. discoideum</em> had been deposited, were placed on top of the dialysis membranes. The two populations were in chemical but not physical contact (see <a href="#pone-0000212-g005">Figure 5</a>). After 24 hours of development of the test populations, fruiting was complete in the case of the <em>D. discoideum</em>-filled membranes, partial in the case of the <em>D. caveatum</em>-filled 500 Da membrane. Development was blocked at the aggregation stage, in the case of <em>D. caveatum</em>-filled membranes of size greater than 1 kDa. Bar = 500 µm. A dialysate of a <em>D. caveatum</em>-filled membrane also inhibits development of <em>D. discoideum</em>. A dialysis membrane filled with <em>D. caveatum</em> was dialysed against 1.5 mL of SorC buffer for 24 hours. Test populations of <em>D. discoideum</em> on filters were then incubated with this dialysate or SorC (control). At 20 hours of development, the dialysate had inhibited <em>D. discoideum</em> development at the aggregate stage while control <em>D. discoideum</em> had reached the slug stage. The inhibition was a 4–6 hour lag at aggregation stage. Bar = 500 µm.</p>
