                Figure 1.  Inhibition of activin B and nodal-related protein function causes distinct phenotypes and results in the differential regulation of different classes of gene.(A,D) Control embryos (here injected with water; those injected with mMO1 look identical) at stage 11 (A) and 26 (D). (B,E) Embryos injected with MO3, and which therefore lack activin B activity. (B) Stage 11; (E) stage 21. Note the delay in gastrulation and the failure to form a proper axis. (C,F) Embryos injected with Cerberus-short RNA, and which therefore lack nodal-related activity. Note the failure to involute and the formation of a radially symmetrical structure. (G,H). Correlation between microarray and PCR results.
