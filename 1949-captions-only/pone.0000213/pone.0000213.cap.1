(B,E) Embryos injected with MO3, and which therefore lack activin B activity. (B) Stage 11; (E) stage 21. Note the delay in gastrulation and the failure to form a proper axis. (C,F) Embryos injected with Cerberus-short RNA, and which therefore lack nodal-related activity. Note the failure to involute and the formation of a radially symmetrical structure. (G,H). Correlation between microarray and PCR results.</p>
