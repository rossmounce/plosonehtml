Note that <em>Chordin</em> transcripts are restricted to the dorsal marginal zone. (Câ€“F) Expression pattern of DNMT1, a gene that is mis-regulated following inhibition of activin signalling. (C) and (D) show embryos hybridised using a sense probe; (E) and (F) show embryos hybridised using an antisense probe. Note that DNMT1 is expressed ubiquitously.</p>
