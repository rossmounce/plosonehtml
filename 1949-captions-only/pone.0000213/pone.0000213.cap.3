(B,C) Composite images of 10 serial sagittal sections of representative embryos stained with an antibody recognising phosphorylated histone H3 as whole mounts and then sectioned at 12 µm. (B) Control embryo injected with mMO1. Note absence of mitotic cells in involuting mesoderm. (C) Embryo injected with specific antisense oligonucleotide MO3. Involution is perturbed and mitotic cells are visible in dorsal tissue. (D,E) Frozen sections of embryos stained with an antibody recognising phosphorylated histone H3. (D) Control embryo injected with mMO1. Note absence of mitotic cells in involuting mesoderm. (E) Embryo injected with specific antisense oligonucleotide MO3. Involution is perturbed and mitotic cells are visible in dorsal tissue.</p>
