                Figure 1. (a) Line: Deviation of Î´13C/12C ratio from its standard Peedee belemnite (PDB) value in marine carbonate sediments. Adapted from [10]. Shadings show glacial periods: light shading means any geologic evidence of glaciation and darker shading means severe (global?) ice age. (b) Acritarch diversity; most acritarchs likely represent unicellular phytoplankton groups. (c) The evolutionary rate of acritarchs. Number of first apperance (solid) and last appearance (dotted) species per Myrs per species. Source for b and c is [30].
