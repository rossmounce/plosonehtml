A, B and C represent the three phases of pre-apolysis mitotic activity described in the Results. High density cells are shown with red nuclei. PCP expressing cells are shown with green cytoplasm. “*” marks cells of high density zones lining distal and proximal boundaries of each annulus; “**” marks cells of mid-annular high density clusters. High density zones and mid-annular clusters are present at pupation; high density zones expand in space and cell number with the onset of mitotic activity, but mid-annular clusters remain constant in cell number throughout this period.
