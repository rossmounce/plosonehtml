Mitotic activity at 52 hrs a.p. “A” shows cells visualized with anti-phospho H3 antiserum; “B” is tissue visualized using control serum (anti-<em>Apol</em>SNMP1, 1:1000 dilution, after Rogers et al., 1997). Brackets mark single annuli; “d” and “p” mark distal and proximal zones. Asterisk marks discontinuous region in distal zone (see text). C,D. Mitotic figures. Tissue (67.5 hr a.p. male) was double stained with PI and anti-phospho H3 antibody (visualized with Cy2 labeled secondary antibody). Arrows point to identical cells in “C” and “D”. S E,F. High density clusters of cells along annular border as detectable by 2 hrs a.p. Images show male sensory epithelium (2 hr a.p.) centered on an annular boundary (asterisks), with high density zones evident on either side of this boundary (brackets). “E” and “F” are the same tissue at different magnification; asterisks mark identical positions as well as the annular boundary. Size bar: 350 u (A,B); 24 u (C,D).90 u (E); 45 u (F);</p>
