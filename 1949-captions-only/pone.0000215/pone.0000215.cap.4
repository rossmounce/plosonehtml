                Figure 4.  Nuclear stain (PI) reveals zones of high density nuclei which expand with age.Tissues (male) of indicated ages (hours a.p.) are shown stained with PI and at three magnifications. Arrows mark identical positions at each magnification; brackets indicate the boundaries of a single annulus (distal is left). Arrows in high magnification panels (25 u) of 52 hr and 67.9 hr tissues additionally point to mitotic figures. The 67.9 and 67.4 h a.p. tissues are shown in sequence of developmental progression rather than temporal progression; the differential degree of progression in these tissues is presumably due to temporal developmental asymmetry between individual animals. For all images, distal is left, proximal is to the right. Size bars are shown for each row.
