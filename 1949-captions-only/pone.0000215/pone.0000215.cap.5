                Figure 5.  Z-series through a high density zone.Tissue (55.8 hr a.p. male) was stained with PI and imaged at 2 u increments from hemolymph (0 u) to cuticle (16 u) (MPLSM). Mitotic figures appeared to be restricted to the cell layer adjacent to the cuticle. Asterisks mark identical positions in each frame. Arrows in the 14 u panel indicate mitotic figures, which can also be seen from panel 10 uâ€“16 u, indicating that mitotic activity is restricted to an epithelial layer near the cuticle. Lens: Nikon Plan Fluor 40x/0.75 dry. Size bar: 25 u.
