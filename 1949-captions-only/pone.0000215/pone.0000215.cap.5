Mitotic figures appeared to be restricted to the cell layer adjacent to the cuticle. Asterisks mark identical positions in each frame. Arrows in the 14 u panel indicate mitotic figures, which can also be seen from panel 10 uâ€“16 u, indicating that mitotic activity is restricted to an epithelial layer near the cuticle. Lens: Nikon Plan Fluor 40x/0.75 dry. Size bar: 25 u.</p>
