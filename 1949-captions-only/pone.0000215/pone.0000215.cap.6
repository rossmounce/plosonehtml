Arrows mark identical positions at each magnification; brackets indicate the boundaries of a single annulus (distal is left). Arrows in high magnification panels (25 u) (4.25â€“52 hrs a.p.) additionally point to clusters of high density nuclei within the mid-annular regions; the high density zone has expanded into this region in the 67.4 hr tissue, obscuring the observation of these clusters. Note mitotic figures in the high magnification (25 u) 52 hr (asterisk) and 67.4 hr (arrow) panels. Size bars are shown for each row.</p>
