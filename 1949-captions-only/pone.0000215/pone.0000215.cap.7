                     <em>In situ</em> hybridization of tissue (48 hrs a.p., male) using antisense RNA PCP probe (green, cytoplasm), counterstained with PI (red, nuclei). Brackets mark high density nuclear zones; arrows point to a cluster of high density nuclei within the mid-annular region of low density nuclei. “A”, PI stain (white) of nuclei, showing proximal (p) and distal (d) high density zones of two adjacent annuli separated by an inter-annular region. “B”, the same tissue, visualizing PCP expression (white). “C”, color composite showing nuclei (red) and PCP expression (green); black unstained regions correspond to high density zones. “D”, a high density mid-annular nuclear cluster (arrow, similar to the cluster indicated in A–C) within the low density mid-annular region; nuclei are shown in red (PI) and PCP expression in green. PCP expression (green) is restricted to the low density cells, but absent from the cells associating with high density nuclei. PCP data is from a larger study of PCP expression in <em>M. sexta</em> (Bohbot and Vogt, in preparation). Size bar: 50 u (A–C), 12.5 u (D).</p>
