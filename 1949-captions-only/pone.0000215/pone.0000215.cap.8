                Figure 8.  Spatial dynamics of high density zones entering and exiting diapause.A. Presumptive sensory epithelium from animals (males); 15 hr a.p. tissue if from normal developing animal while 120 hr and 50 day a.p. tissue is from animals in diapause. Two magnifications are shown for each tissue; arrows mark identical positions for each pair. Tissues are aged in hours (h) or days (d) a.p. Size bar (15 h–50 d): 200 u (upper), 50 u (lower). B. Presumptive sensory epithelium from animals exiting diapause, stimulated by injection of 20E at t0 (0 h). Two magnifications are shown for each tissue; arrows mark identical positions for each pair. Tissues are aged in hours (h) following hormone injection. Tissue from two animals, both aged 32h after hormone injection, are shown to note the temporal variation in response to the treatment. Size bar (0 h–32 h): 200 u (upper), 50 u (lower); Size bar (32 h*): 200 u (upper), 100 u (lower). C. Tissue exiting diapause, 20 and 32 h following hormone injection; arrows indicate mitotic figures within a high density zone. Size bar: 25 u (upper), 50 u (lower). For all figures, brackets mark single annuli.
