Male epithelium was cultured at approximately 15 hrs a.p. (Stage 1) for 15 hrs at the indicated concentrations of 20 hydroxy ecdysone (A) or alpha ecdysone (B). BrdU was present for the entire culture period. Mitotic activity was visualized using phosphotase tagged BrdU antiserum. C, D. Male epithelium was cultured at either 33 hrs a.p. (C) or 54 hrs a.p. (D) for 15 hrs at the indicated concentrations of 20 hydroxy ecdysone. Mitotic activity was visualized using phospho-H3 antiserum. E, F. Male epithelium was cultured at approximately 30 hrs a.p. (Stage 2) for 24 hrs at the indicated concentrations of the ecdysteroid analogue RH5992. BrdU was either present for the entire culture period (E), or added after 18 hrs of culture (F). For all experiments, tissue was from normally developing animals (non-diapause). Size bar: 170 u (A,B); 234 u (C,D); 214 u (E,F).</p>
