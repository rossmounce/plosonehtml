The trees are inferred from the mean of the squared difference of expression intensities for 98 genes detected on both mRNA and protein levels. Each pool represents an average expression in two chimpanzee (c) or two human (h) individuals. Additionally, protein measurements are based on two independent experimental replicates.</p>
