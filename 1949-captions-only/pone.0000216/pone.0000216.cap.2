                Figure 2. Comparison of protein and mRNA expression differences between humans and chimpanzees. Comparisons are shown for 98 genes, detected on both mRNA and protein levels (A), and for 33 genes showing significant differences in mRNA (⧫) or protein (+) expression between the species (B). Six genes significantly different on both mRNA and protein expression levels are shown using overlapping labels. The names and the functional annotation of the 33 genes are included in table S5. Expression differences are shown using a base-two logarithmic scale. The dotted line represents an ideal regression line (α = 0, β = 1).
