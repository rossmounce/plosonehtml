Any individual in a population (black point) can thus be described by its phenotypic values, which determine the fitness of that organism. At any specific fitness, there are a number of other phenotypic combinations that have equivalent fitness; the values of these phenotypic combinations establish the fitness isoclines (black circle). From the optimum, fitness declines monotonically according to the structure of the landscape (see text). Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from a distribution centered on the phenotypic position of each individual, resulting in offspring with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values (white point).</p>
