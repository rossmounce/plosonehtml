                Figure 2.  Predicted equilibrium fitness as a function of phenotypic complexity (ne).Results are shown for populations of size 100 (black), ten (grey), and three (white). An exponential fitness decline in which Q = 1 was used (yielding a fitness function of f(d) = exp(âˆ’d)). Circles indicate the average fitness reached in the simulation model; curves indicate the analytical results.
