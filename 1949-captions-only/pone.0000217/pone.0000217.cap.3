The VSV populations are shown in dark grey and the ΦX174 are shown in white. Some points have been displaced on the x-axis for clarity. The VSV populations were transferred at effective population sizes of four, ten, and 60; the ΦX174 populations were transferred at effective population sizes of 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1250. The dotted lines specify the maximum likelihood estimate of the f<sub>ref</sub> value (the maximum attainable fitness); the dark dotted line indicates the value for VSV and the lighter dashed line indicates the value for ΦX174.</p>
