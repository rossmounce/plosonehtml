                Figure 3.  Equilibrium drift load as a function of population size for vesicular stomatitis virus and ΦX174.Each point indicates the mean fitness of a population. The VSV populations are shown in dark grey and the ΦX174 are shown in white. Some points have been displaced on the x-axis for clarity. The VSV populations were transferred at effective population sizes of four, ten, and 60; the ΦX174 populations were transferred at effective population sizes of 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1250. The dotted lines specify the maximum likelihood estimate of the fref value (the maximum attainable fitness); the dark dotted line indicates the value for VSV and the lighter dashed line indicates the value for ΦX174.
