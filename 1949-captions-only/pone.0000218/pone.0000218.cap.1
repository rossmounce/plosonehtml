                Figure 1. Two-dimensional representation of the lipid spectra for a selected illustrative sample obtained by reversed phase Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution Mass Spectrometry (positive ion mode). Major lipid groups found in different parts of the spectra are marked. MZmine software [18], [19] was utilized for visualization and spectral data processing.
