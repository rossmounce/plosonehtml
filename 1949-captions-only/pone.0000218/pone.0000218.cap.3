Three latent variables were used (Q<sup>2</sup> = 47%). (A) PLS/DA score plot. Genders and twin-pair identifiers are marked for each sample, although this information was not used to build the model. (B) Fold changes for most important variables based on VIP analysis contributing to the PLS/DA model.</p>
