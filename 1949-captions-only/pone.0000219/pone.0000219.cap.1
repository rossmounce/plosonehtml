(A) Flowchart for the prediction of miRNAs and their targets. (B) Validation of predicted targets for 13 non-conserved miRNAs. Positions of dominant 5′ RACE products (no. 5′ ends at position/total no. 5′ ends sequenced) are indicated by vertical arrows in the expanded regions. Predicted cleavage sites are indicated by a bolded nucleotide at position ten relative to the 5′ end of the miRNA or miRNA-variant. Positions of gene-specific primers are indicated with horizontal arrows above gene diagrams.</p>
