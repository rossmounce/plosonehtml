(A) Effect of <em>dcl1-7</em> and <em>hen1-1</em> mutations on levels of target transcripts for conserved (black) and non-conserved (red) miRNAs. Expression data are shown for two validated or high-confidence predicted targets, if available, for each family. Arrows indicate targets for miR824 (<em>AGL16</em>), miR858 (<em>MYB12</em>) and miR161.1 (At1g63130, a <em>PPR</em> gene). (B) Numbers of gene family members for conserved and non-conserved <em>MIRNA</em>s (<a href="#pone-0000219-t001">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0000219-t002">2</a>). (C) Relative numbers of miRNA target family functions for conserved and non-conserved miRNAs (<a href="#pone-0000219-t001">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0000219-t002">2</a>). Only target classes that have been validated experimentally are included. Note that <a href="#pone-0000219-t002">Table 2</a> shows many <em>MIRNA</em> families with weak or no predicted targets, and these are not represented in the chart.</p>
