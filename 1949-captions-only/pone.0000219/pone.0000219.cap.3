(A) Comparison of most-abundant miRNA families between biological replicates of Col-0 inflorescence (inf.) tissue. Normalized reads for each miRNA family member were consolidated. Note that <em>MIR159</em> and <em>MIR319</em> derived members were counted separately, even though they are frequently assigned to the same family <a href="#pone.0000219-Xie1">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000219-Palatnik1">[57]</a>. (B) Fold-change of miRNAs in <em>dcl1-7</em> inflorescence versus Col-0 inflorescence (left axis, bars). Total number of reads for each family is indicated (right axis, green line). As the <em>dcl1-7</em> mutant contained no reads for many miRNA families, fold-change was calculated using normalized reads+1. This had the effect of dampening fold-change values for low-abundance families. (C) Fold-change of miRNA family reads in leaves at 1 hr and 3 hr post-inoculation with <em>P. syringae</em> (DC3000<em>hrcC</em>) (left axis, bars). Fold-change relative to uninoculated leaves was calculated based on normalized reads as described in panel (B). Total number of reads in the control and inoculated samples is shown (right axis, green line). Grey dashed lines indicate the <em>p</em> = 0.05 upper and lower thresholds.</p>
