                Figure 4. Identification of MIRNA foldbacks with similarity to protein-coding genes. (A) Flowchart for identification of MIRNA foldbacks with similarity, extending beyond the miRNA target site, to protein-coding genes. (B) Arabidopsis gene or transcript hits in FASTA searches using foldback sequences for all conserved and non-conserved MIRNA loci (Tables 1 and 2). The top four hits based on E-values are shown. (C) Z-scores for the Needleman-Wunche alignment values from MIRNA foldback arms with top four gene or transcript FASTA hits. Alignments were done with intact foldback arms (I), and with foldback arms in which miRNA or miRNA-complementary sequences were deleted (D). Z-scores were derived from standard deviation values for alignments of randomized sequences. In (B) and (C), a red symbol represents an experimentally validated target, a pink symbol indicates a gene from a validated target family, and an open symbol indicates a gene that is distinct from either the validated or predicted target family.
