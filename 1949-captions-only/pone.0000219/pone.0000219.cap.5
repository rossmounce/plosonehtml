                Figure 5. Similarity between MIRNA foldback arms and protein-coding genes. Each alignment contains the coding strand for 1–3 genes, the miRNA* arm, and the miRNA arm. Orientation of the foldback arms is indicated by (+) for authentic polarity and (−) for the reverse complement polarity. Two alignments are given for MIR824 because the two arms are each most similar to distinct, duplicated regions within the AGL16 gene (At3g57230). Alignments were generated using T-COFFEE. Colors indicate alignment quality in a regional context.
