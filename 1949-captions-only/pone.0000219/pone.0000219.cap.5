Each alignment contains the coding strand for 1–3 genes, the miRNA* arm, and the miRNA arm. Orientation of the foldback arms is indicated by (+) for authentic polarity and (−) for the reverse complement polarity. Two alignments are given for <em>MIR824</em> because the two arms are each most similar to distinct, duplicated regions within the <em>AGL16</em> gene (At3g57230). Alignments were generated using T-COFFEE. Colors indicate alignment quality in a regional context.</p>
