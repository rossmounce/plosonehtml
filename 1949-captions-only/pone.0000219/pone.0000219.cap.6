Two target prediction scores are shown for each of 16 miRNAs: best overall predicted target score (blue) and target scores calculated for <em>MIRNA</em> foldback-similar genes (grey). Left column indicates whether or not the best overall predicted target gene is in the same family as the foldback-similar gene. A dot indicates that the predicted gene is in an experimentally validated target family. Two calculations corresponding to the two major populations from the <em>MIR161</em> locus (miR161.1 and miR161.2) are shown. The identities of targets are listed in <a href="#pone.0000219.s003">Supplemental Table S3</a>. The plot is centered on a target prediction score of 4, as this corresponds to the upper limit of a reasonable prediction.</p>
