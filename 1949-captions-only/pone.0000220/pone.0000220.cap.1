                Figure 1. Phylogenetic relationships among the seven Y. pestis SNP genotypes identified in this study. Neighbor-joining tree was created using the data presented in Table 3 and MEGA2 software [23], and was rooted on genotype 0, as this genotype was assigned to the two outgroup isolates (see text). The position of the 19 SNPs (Table 1) are indicated below the tree. Individual genotypes or nodes were named based upon their position relative to genotype 0.
