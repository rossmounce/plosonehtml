Neighbor-joining tree was created using the data presented in <a href="#pone-0000220-t003">Table 3</a> and MEGA2 software <a href="#pone.0000220-Kumar1">[23]</a>, and was rooted on genotype 0, as this genotype was assigned to the two outgroup isolates (see text). The position of the 19 SNPs (<a href="#pone-0000220-t001">Table 1</a>) are indicated below the tree. Individual genotypes or nodes were named based upon their position relative to genotype 0.</p>
