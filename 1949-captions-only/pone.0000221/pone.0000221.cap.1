                Figure 1.  Incubation of rabbit retina.Photograph (A) and schematic diagram (B) of the hybrid interphase/perfusion chamber. Deep dishes are used with custom made “stands” of 1 cm height to support the tissue culture insert with the flat-mounted retina. The retina is in contact with the Ames' medium over the filter on the photoreceptor side; the ganglion cell side faces the atmosphere. (C) Low power micrograph of adult rabbit retina transfected with an expression plasmid for EGFP after 4 days in culture. Scale bar, 100 µm. (D) ON/OFF Directionally selective ganglion cell (Type G7, bistratified). All panels show maximum intensity projections of ~20 individual image planes of a through-focus series taken at 1 µm steps on a confocal microscope. (E) ON directionally selective ganglion cell (G10). (F) Alpha cell. (G) Brisk sustained cell (G4). All scale bars, 100 µm.
