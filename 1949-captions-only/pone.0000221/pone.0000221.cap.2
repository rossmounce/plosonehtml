                Figure 2.  Viability of rabbit retina after six days of incubation.(A), Typical piece of rabbit retina stained with an antibody against ChAT (red) six after six days of incubation (focus on the ganglion cell layer). Seven such fields were measured to arrive at a density recovery profile (B) for starburst amacrine cells. Scale bar for A &amp; C, 50 µm. (C), matched field with focus on the inner nuclear layer (OFF starburst amacrine cells). (D), density recovery profile for starburst amacrine cells in the INL. (E, F, and G), ganglion cell layer of rabbit retina incubated for six days stained for dead cells (propidium iodide, red), cells in the process of apoptosis (YO-PRO, bright green) and counterstained with the nuclear dye TOPRO (blue). No dead or dying cells are visible in the ganglion cell layer in central retina (panel E), mid-periphery (panel F), and peripheral retina (panel G). (H, I, and J) show matched fields with the focus on the photoreceptor cell bodies. Several cells are labeled by their incorporation of propidium iodide (arrows), indicating cell death in the photoreceptor layer. Scale bar for panels E–J, 50 µm.
