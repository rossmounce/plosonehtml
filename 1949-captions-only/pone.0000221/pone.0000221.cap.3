The patch-clamp pipette is seen (its light responses shown in C). Black dots are unincorporated gold particles. Scale bar, 50 µm. (<strong>B</strong>) An example of voltage clamp and current clamp recordings after 6 day incubation. All of recorded ganglion cells (n = 30) generated action potentials in response to current injection under current clamp configuration. In the voltage clamp, the cells were voltage-clamped at −77 mV and then command pulses were applied from −117 mV to 13 mV, in 10 mV steps, for 200 msec. In the current clamp, command pulses were applied from −40 pA to +180 pA, in 20 pA steps, for 200 msec. Scale bars are 50 msec. (<strong>C–E</strong>) light responses of ganglion cells from 3 day (the cell shown in A), 4 day, and 6 day-incubated retina, respectively, recorded under current clamp.</p>
