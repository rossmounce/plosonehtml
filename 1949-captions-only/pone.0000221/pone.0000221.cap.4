                Figure 4.  Electrophysiological properties of ganglion cells in incubated retinas are comparable to properties of freshly prepared ganglion cells.(A) Histogram of average firing rates for 69 ganglion cells from 5 retinas after 2 days (3 retinas) or 3 days (2 retinas) of incubation (red columns) and 73 ganglion cells from freshly prepared retinas (black columns). All cells were recorded with multielectrode arrays; the firing rate was calculated in response to spatial white noise (see Methods). The two distributions are similar, although more incubated cells are recorded with mean firing rates below 2 Hz. (B) Histogram of temporal jitter in response to the same spatially uniform temporal white noise stimulus. The temporal jitter distribution does not differ significantly (p&lt;0.05, ANOVA) for the two populations. Mean temporal jitter was 10 milliseconds for incubated ganglion cells and 8.6 milliseconds for fresh ganglion cells. (C) The diameters of receptive field centers. Mean receptive field center was 520 µm for incubated ganglion cells (n = 43) and 430 µm for fresh ganglion cells (n = 73).
