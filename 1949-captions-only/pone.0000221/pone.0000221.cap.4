All cells were recorded with multielectrode arrays; the firing rate was calculated in response to spatial white noise (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). The two distributions are similar, although more incubated cells are recorded with mean firing rates below 2 Hz. (<strong>B</strong>) Histogram of temporal jitter in response to the same spatially uniform temporal white noise stimulus. The temporal jitter distribution does not differ significantly (p&lt;0.05, ANOVA) for the two populations. Mean temporal jitter was 10 milliseconds for incubated ganglion cells and 8.6 milliseconds for fresh ganglion cells. (<strong>C</strong>) The diameters of receptive field centers. Mean receptive field center was 520 µm for incubated ganglion cells (n = 43) and 430 µm for fresh ganglion cells (n = 73).</p>
