                Figure 5.  Expression of markers for subcellular structures in retinal ganglion cells.(A) Single confocal image plane of a large ON ganglion cell transfected with expression plasmids for EGFP-F (labeling the cell membrane) and DsRed2-ER (labeling the endoplasmic reticulum.) Scale bar, 50 µm. (B) Volume reconstruction of a confocal image stack of a large ganglion cell transfected with the cell-filling marker HcRed and a marker for postsynaptic densities of inhibitory synapses, gephyrin-GFP (green). Scale bar, 50 µm. (C) A single dendrite of an OFF alpha ganglion cell transfected with gephyrin-GFP. Note the high density of puncta particularly on the proximal dendrites. Scale bar, 20 µm.
