Most PSD95 puncta are in close proximity to one or more synaptic ribbons. Scale bar, 10 µm. (<strong>B</strong>) Ankyrin-G-MB-GFP (green) and HcRed (red) were transfected into a retinal ganglion cell. HcRed labels the whole extent of the cell, whereas Ankyrin-G-MB-GFP is found in the initial segment of the axon (arrows). Some Ankyrin-G-MB-GFP labeling is seen in the soma and the primary dendrites, the place of protein synthesis. Scale bar 50 µm. (<strong>C</strong>) Starburst amacrine cell transfected with an expression plasmid for synaptophsin-GFP. The known synaptic output sites of these cells, varicosities in the outer third of the dendritic tree are labeled with this marker. (<strong>D</strong>) Starburst amacrine cell transfected with expression plasmids for the cell-filling marker HcRed (red) and a fusion protein from the synaptic vesicle marker VAChT-GFP (green). Scale bar, 50 µm.</p>
