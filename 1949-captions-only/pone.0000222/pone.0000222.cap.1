                Figure 1.  Example of PRESS box position and spectra.Left: To delineate the single-voxel, an elongated PRESS box was located in each hemisphere (here shown only in the left hemisphere) along the calcarine sulcus as far to the back of the occipital pole and the midline of the brain as possible while avoiding the inclusion of fat and vasculature. Right: Example of spectra with Choline, Creatine and NAA peaks.
