In all cases the missing nucleotide is a “G”. <strong>C</strong>) Circular DNA enrichment through DNA degradation by enzymes Exonuclease I and III. <strong>D</strong>) Probe linearization restriction site cleavage. <strong>E</strong>) All reacted and inverted probes are amplified with universal primers, of which one is biotinylated for subsequent amplicon validation.</p>
