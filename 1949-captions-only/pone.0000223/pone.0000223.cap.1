                Figure 1. Schematic overviews of molecular inversion probe technology. A) Synthetic oligonucleotide containing following four regions; i) H1 and H2: homology regions comprised of unique continuous 40–50 base pair fragments for target recognition ii) BARCODE: molecular barcode comprised of a 20 base pair DNA tag for target identification iii) U1 and U2: universal primer regions for inverted probe amplification, and iv) R: restriction site for probe linearization. B) Upon target recognition, a DNA polymerase fills the missing gap in between the juxtaposition of the probes' flanking ends, and through the activity of a DNA ligase the probe is circularized. In all cases the missing nucleotide is a “G”. C) Circular DNA enrichment through DNA degradation by enzymes Exonuclease I and III. D) Probe linearization restriction site cleavage. E) All reacted and inverted probes are amplified with universal primers, of which one is biotinylated for subsequent amplicon validation.
