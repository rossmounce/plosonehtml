Seen in the figure is the sequence for probe-16 prior to inversion. Two shorter fragments were synthesized and hybridized to a bridge complementary to the universal primer regions, common for all probes used in the assay. The coupling of the shorter fragments was mediated by polymerase and ligase activity to achieve maximum yield.</p>
