The figure depicts superimposed pyrosequencing (dispensation time vs. light signal intensity) diagrams for two probes following the MIP reactions, targeting HPV-45 (black) and HPV-59 (red), mimicking a double HPV infection. <strong>A</strong>) The initial DNA amount of each contributing plasmid was 100 ng and equal levels of sequencing intensities are seen. <strong>B</strong>) The DNA amount of HPV-45 plasmid remained at 100 ng, while HPV-59 plasmid was set at 10 ng resulting in ~2-fold lower signal intensity. <strong>C</strong>) DNA amounts were set at 100 ng for HPV-45 plasmid and 1 nanogram for HPV-59 plasmid, which was observed as a ~3-fold decrease in signal intensity. <strong>D</strong>) DNA amounts of 100 ng of HPV-45 plasmid and 100 pg of HPV-59 plasmid resulted in signal from HPV-45-probe without a measurable signal from the probe for HPV-59.</p>
