Seen in the figure are four examples of single HPV infections, one from each genotype, observed in the sample set. HPV-16 was genotyped in sample OM-1751, HPV-18 in OM-1452, HPV-45 in OM-2258 and HPV-59 in OM-1569. The signal-intensities were normalized to the intensity of the peak for the reference probe targeting human Î²-globin gene (rMIP). The remaining bars constitute of the reaction background signal.</p>
