                Figure 5. Results from the in-house barcode-chip screening of a quadruple HPV-infection. A) In-house barcode-chip at wavelength 635 emitting the fluorophore signal for internal control Linker A, positive for all oligonucleotides in the chip. B) Wavelength 535 emitting the fluorophore signal for the biotinylated MIP amplicons and the positive control. The in-house barcode-chip was positive for all four HPV genotypes in the pool (HPV-16, -18, -34 and -59). C) Wavelength ratio 535/635 representing the signal ratio from the positive samples to that from linker A. D) Bar histograms representing mean value signal intensities for 2 arrays analyzed with 5 replicates per chip. The highest peak signal for HPV-59 was used for normalization for all the values in the graph for visual purposes. The variability in probes intensities can be explained by individual differences in probe composition and a batch-to-batch variation in the production of the probes.
