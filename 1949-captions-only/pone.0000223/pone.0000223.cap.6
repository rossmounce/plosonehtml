                Figure 6. Schematic overview of the PathogenMip Assay. A) The 24 probes included in the assay are situated at their respective target sites on the approximately 8000 base pairs of double stranded HPV genomic DNA. Early genes (denoted E) code for virus integration and replication and late genes (denoted L) encode the viral capsule creation. The probes recognize ~40 base pair fragments unique for each targeted genotype. B) Following enzymatic inversion of reacted probes and universal amplification, the amplicons are used for subsequent appropriate HPV genotype screening. C) Conventional HPV genotyping takes a different approach, in which the nested primer pairs PGMY09/11 and GP5+/6+ amplify respectively ~450 base pair and ~150 base pair fragments that, through an appropriate readout process, will make up the basis for genotyping. These primers are restricted to the highly conserved genomic regions, most commonly found in the L1 gene. D) Multiple-primer DNA Pyrosequencing of an incorporated ID-tag. The diagrams depict the complementary sequence of the investigated probes -16 and -18. Marked in the figure is the ID-tag for each probe and the point of ligation where the probes circularized, incorporation of a dGTP, seen here as the complementary “C”. E) The in-house barcode chips here used to detect one HPV-16 positive, and one HPV-18 positive in human genomic DNA presence as seen with a positive rMIP in both chips.
