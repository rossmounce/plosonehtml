                Figure 1. Occurrence of TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR) genes in 226 completely sequenced Gram negative bacterial genomes, in ecological (A) or phylogenetic (B) contexts. TBDRs were detected by screening the Pfam database and the UniprotKB protein knowledge database using the two Pfam HMMs (PF07715, Plug; PF00593, TonB_dep_Rec). Only proteins displaying the two Pfam domains were considered. The habitat of bacteria (A) and their phylogeny (B) are represented by colour codes (see the legend boxes).
