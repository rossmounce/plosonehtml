TBDRs were detected by screening the Pfam database and the UniprotKB protein knowledge database using the two Pfam HMMs (PF07715, Plug; PF00593, TonB_dep_Rec). Only proteins displaying the two Pfam domains were considered. The habitat of bacteria (A) and their phylogeny (B) are represented by colour codes (see the legend boxes).</p>
