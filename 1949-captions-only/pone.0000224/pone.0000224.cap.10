                Figure 10. Expression of the Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris suxA gene in the presence of sucrose, fructose or glucose. The pPr-suxA plasmid carrying the promoterless LacZ reporter gene under the suxA promoter region was used to monitor suxA expression in different genetic backgrounds. Expression was measured in minimal medium and cells were harvested at the indicated times. (A) Expression after 6 hours induction in the presence of different sucrose concentrations, in the wild-type background, the suxR and suxC insertion mutant backgrounds (suxR::pVO and suxC::pVO, respectively), and the suxA and suxB deletion mutant backgrounds (ΔsuxA and ΔsuxB, respectively). (B) Kinetics of LacZ expression in the wild-type background or in the suxA deletion mutant background (ΔsuxA), in presence of 20 mM (triangles) or 100 µM (squares) sucrose. (C) Kinetics of LacZ expression in the wild-type background in the presence of 100 µM sucrose, fructose or glucose.
