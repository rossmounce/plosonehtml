The pPr-<em>suxA</em> plasmid carrying the promoterless <em>LacZ</em> reporter gene under the <em>suxA</em> promoter region was used to monitor <em>suxA</em> expression in different genetic backgrounds. Expression was measured in minimal medium and cells were harvested at the indicated times. (A) Expression after 6 hours induction in the presence of different sucrose concentrations, in the wild-type background, the <em>suxR</em> and <em>suxC</em> insertion mutant backgrounds <em>(suxR</em>::pVO and <em>suxC</em>::pVO, respectively), and the <em>suxA</em> and <em>suxB</em> deletion mutant backgrounds <em>(</em>Δ<em>suxA</em> and Δ<em>suxB</em>, respectively). (B) Kinetics of <em>LacZ</em> expression in the wild-type background or in the <em>suxA</em> deletion mutant background (Δ<em>suxA</em>), in presence of 20 mM (triangles) or 100 µM (squares) sucrose. (C) Kinetics of <em>LacZ</em> expression in the wild-type background in the presence of 100 µM sucrose, fructose or glucose.</p>
