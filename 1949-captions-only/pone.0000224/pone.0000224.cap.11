Putative pectin (A), xylan (B) and maltodextrin (C) utilization CUT loci and specific induction of the corresponding TBDR gene in the presence of PGA, xylose and maltose, respectively. Î²-glucuronidase assays were performed in at least two independent experiments with TBDR insertion mutants cultivated in minimal medium supplemented with glutamate 20 mM (GT) or specific carbohydrates (PGA: polygalacturonic acid 0.125%; XYL: xylose 20 mM; MAL: maltose 20 mM). TBDR: TonB-dependent receptor; PME: pectin methyl esterase; PL: pectate lyase; CGTase: cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase.</p>
