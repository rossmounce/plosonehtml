                Figure 11. Genetic organization of putative Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris CUT loci and specific induction of the TonB-dependent receptor gene by plant carbohydrates. Putative pectin (A), xylan (B) and maltodextrin (C) utilization CUT loci and specific induction of the corresponding TBDR gene in the presence of PGA, xylose and maltose, respectively. Î²-glucuronidase assays were performed in at least two independent experiments with TBDR insertion mutants cultivated in minimal medium supplemented with glutamate 20 mM (GT) or specific carbohydrates (PGA: polygalacturonic acid 0.125%; XYL: xylose 20 mM; MAL: maltose 20 mM). TBDR: TonB-dependent receptor; PME: pectin methyl esterase; PL: pectate lyase; CGTase: cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase.
