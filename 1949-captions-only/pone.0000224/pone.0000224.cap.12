This scheme shows sucrose outer membrane transport <em>via</em> the SuxA TBDR or by passive diffusion through a putative porin. After crossing the inner membrane through the SuxC transporter, sucrose is proposed to interact with the SuxR repressor (thus allowing <em>sux</em> gene induction) and also to serve as a substrate for the SuxB amylosucrase. The large double headed arrow below the <em>sux</em> locus represents the balance between metabolic adaptation and virulence control putatively mediated by CUT loci.</p>
