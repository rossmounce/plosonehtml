                Figure 12. Model of CUT loci functioning based on the Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris sux locus. This scheme shows sucrose outer membrane transport via the SuxA TBDR or by passive diffusion through a putative porin. After crossing the inner membrane through the SuxC transporter, sucrose is proposed to interact with the SuxR repressor (thus allowing sux gene induction) and also to serve as a substrate for the SuxB amylosucrase. The large double headed arrow below the sux locus represents the balance between metabolic adaptation and virulence control putatively mediated by CUT loci.
