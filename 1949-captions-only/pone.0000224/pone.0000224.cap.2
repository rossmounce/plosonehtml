                Figure 2. Expression levels of 9 Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris TonB-dependent receptor genes. (A) β-glucuronidase assays, performed in at least two independent experiments with pVO155 insertion mutant strains, cultivated in minimal medium supplemented with iron (100 µM FeSO4) or containing an iron chelator (100 µM 2,2′-dipyridyl; DPD). (B) Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), performed in at least three independent experiments, on RNA extracted from the wild-type strain, a fur mutant strain (fur1) or from a complemented strain [fur1 (pL-fur)], cultivated in minimal medium containing 100 µM FeSO4. Calculation of relative expression includes normalization against the endogenous control gene 16S RNA.
