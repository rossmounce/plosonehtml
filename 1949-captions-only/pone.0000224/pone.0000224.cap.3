                Figure 3. Palindromic consensus Fur-box sequence identified upstream of 9 Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris Fur regulated TonB-dependent receptor genes. (A) Sequence logos generated by WebLogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/, [123]) of the Xcc Fur-box motif as predicted by the MotifSampler program [41], [42]. (B and C) Multiple alignement generated with Multalin program [116] with previously proposed Fur-box consensus sequences of Bacillus subtilis [46], Shewanella oneidensis [45], X. campestris pv. campestris and Escherichia coli [44] (B) and after a 3 bp shift of the E. coli sequence (C).
