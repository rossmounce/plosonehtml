                Figure 4. Regulation of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris TonB-dependent receptor genes XCC1041 and XCC1719 by hrp regulators. The relative expression was analyzed by real-time quantitaive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), perfomed on RNA extracted from the wild-type strain and hrpG or hrpX insertion mutants (strains XP082 and XP083, respectively). Experiments were repeated at least three times. Calculation of relative expression includes normalization against the endogenous control gene 16S RNA.
