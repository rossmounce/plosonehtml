The relative expression was analyzed by real-time quantitaive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), perfomed on RNA extracted from the wild-type strain and <em>hrpG</em> or <em>hrpX</em> insertion mutants (strains XP082 and XP083, respectively). Experiments were repeated at least three times. Calculation of relative expression includes normalization against the endogenous control gene 16S RNA.</p>
