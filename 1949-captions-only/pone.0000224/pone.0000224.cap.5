(A) Pathogenicity tests with the <em>Xcc</em> wild-type strain and the <em>XCC3358</em> insertion mutant (<em>XCC3358</em>::pVO). (B) Pathogenicity and complementation tests with the <em>Xcc</em> wild-type strain, the <em>XCC3356</em> and <em>XCC3357</em> insertion mutants <em>(XCC3356</em>::pVO and <em>XCC3357</em>::pVO, respectively), the <em>XCC3358</em> and <em>XCC3359</em> deleted mutants (<em>XCC3358</em>D1 and <em>XCC3359</em>D1, respectively) and their corresponding complemented strains [<em>XCC3358</em>D1 (pL-<em>XCC3358</em>) and <em>XCC3359</em>D1 (pL-<em>XCC3359</em>), respectively]. Disease symptoms were scored 5 to 8 days after inoculation. Each inoculated leaf was individually scored as: no symptom = 0; weak chlorosis surrounding the wound sites = 1; strong V-shaped chlorosis = 2; developing necrosis = 3; leaf death = 4. The represented average disease scores and the standard deviations were calculated from the values of four plants with four inoculated leaves per plant.</p>
