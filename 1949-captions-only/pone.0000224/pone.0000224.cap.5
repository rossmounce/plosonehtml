                Figure 5. Quantitative analysis of the interaction between Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and Arabidopsis thaliana Sf-2 plants. (A) Pathogenicity tests with the Xcc wild-type strain and the XCC3358 insertion mutant (XCC3358::pVO). (B) Pathogenicity and complementation tests with the Xcc wild-type strain, the XCC3356 and XCC3357 insertion mutants (XCC3356::pVO and XCC3357::pVO, respectively), the XCC3358 and XCC3359 deleted mutants (XCC3358D1 and XCC3359D1, respectively) and their corresponding complemented strains [XCC3358D1 (pL-XCC3358) and XCC3359D1 (pL-XCC3359), respectively]. Disease symptoms were scored 5 to 8 days after inoculation. Each inoculated leaf was individually scored as: no symptom = 0; weak chlorosis surrounding the wound sites = 1; strong V-shaped chlorosis = 2; developing necrosis = 3; leaf death = 4. The represented average disease scores and the standard deviations were calculated from the values of four plants with four inoculated leaves per plant.
