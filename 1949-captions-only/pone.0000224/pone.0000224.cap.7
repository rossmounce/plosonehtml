                Figure 7. Growth of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris wild-type strain and mutants in minimal medium containing 20 mM sucrose. (A) Bacterial growth of insertion mutants XCC3356::pVO to XCC3359::pVO or deletion mutants XCC3358Δ1 and XCC3359Δ1, compared to the wild-type strain. (B) Growth of strains carrying plamids pL-XCC3358 or pL-XCC3359 allowing the constitutive expression of XCC3358 and XCC3359 genes, respectively. Bars represent standard deviations from 3 independent experiments.
