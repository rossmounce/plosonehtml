                Figure 8. [14C]sucrose transport into Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). (A) Transport of [14C]sucrose over 120 minutes into the Xcc wild-type strain precultured in minimal medium without sugar (uninduced) or supplemented with 20 mM sucrose (induced). (B and C) Transport of [14C]sucrose over 8 minutes into the Xcc wild-type strain, the insertion mutants in suxR and in suxC (suxR::pVO and suxC::pVO, respectively), the deleted mutants in suxA and suxB (ΔsuxA and ΔsuxB, respectively) and their corresponding complemented strains [ΔsuxA (pL-suxA) and ΔsuxB (pL-suxB), respectively]. Cells were grown in minimal medium without sucrose. Transport was measured using 0.5 µM [14C]sucrose.
