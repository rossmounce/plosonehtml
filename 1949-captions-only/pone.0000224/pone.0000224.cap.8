(A) Transport of [<sup>14</sup>C]sucrose over 120 minutes into the <em>Xcc</em> wild-type strain precultured in minimal medium without sugar (uninduced) or supplemented with 20 mM sucrose (induced). (B and C) Transport of [<sup>14</sup>C]sucrose over 8 minutes into the <em>Xcc</em> wild-type strain, the insertion mutants in <em>suxR</em> and in <em>suxC</em> (<em>suxR</em>::pVO and <em>suxC</em>::pVO, respectively), the deleted mutants in <em>suxA</em> and <em>suxB</em> (Δ<em>suxA</em> and Δ<em>suxB</em>, respectively) and their corresponding complemented strains [Δ<em>suxA</em> (pL-<em>suxA</em>) and Δ<em>suxB</em> (pL-<em>suxB</em>), respectively]. Cells were grown in minimal medium without sucrose. Transport was measured using 0.5 µM [<sup>14</sup>C]sucrose.</p>
