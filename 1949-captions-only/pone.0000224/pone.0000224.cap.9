                Figure 9. Concentration-dependent [14C]sucrose transport into wild-type Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Cells were grown in minimal medium without sucrose and transport was measured for 15 sec at the indicated [14C]sucrose concentrations. The insert shows the Scatchard transformation of the binding data.
