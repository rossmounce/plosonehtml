(B) At early chronic infection (week 48–144 of follow-up) most patients had developed a response against the Gag 77-85 (SL9) epitope. (C) Three of the eleven subjects (OP177, OP428, and OP599) developed broad HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses targeting four to five epitopes. The magnitude of the CD8+ T cell responses is given as the percentage of cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α after withdrawing the experimental background.</p>
