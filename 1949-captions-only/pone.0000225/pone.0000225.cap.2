While only one patient recognized 2 epitopes in primary infection, three targeted at least 4 epitopes, situated in HIV-Gag, Env, Nef and Pol, in early chronic infection. (B) All three patients who targeted multiple epitopes (open circles) had a viral load increase &gt;0.5 log<sub>10</sub> during the first year of infection, compared to just one of seven patients with narrow or absent HLA-A2-restricted responses (closed circles) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). Patient OP478, identified as being superinfected during the first year of infection, was excluded from this analysis. (C) While the viral load increased more in the group with broad HLA-A2-restricted responses during the first year of infection (open circles), the absolute viral load increase was not significant in the group during year one (Paired T-test, p = 0.15).</p>
