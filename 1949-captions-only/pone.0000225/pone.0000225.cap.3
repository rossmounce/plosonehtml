                Figure 3.  Longitudinal viral load measures in HLA-A2-positive subjects followed for more than one year (i.e. excluding OP474 and OP506).During the study period three subjects (OP177, OP428, and OP599) developed multiple HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses, which selected for mutations associated with viral escape within targeted epitopes. The additional six subjects followed for more than a year did not develop any HLA-A2-restricted responses or only against the SL9 epitope in HIV-Gag (OP478, and OP539).
