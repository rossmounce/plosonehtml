                Figure 4.  Phylogenetic tree illustrating viral evolution of the HIV-nef region (HXB2 coordinates 8774â€“9540) in subject OP177.Positive selection occurs from the HLA-A2-restricted CTL response (AL9, 83AAVDLSHFL91) at positions 83, 85, 87 and 91 and the variation at these sites are shown in color on the tree and branches (amino acid positions identical to the consensus B sequence are shown in blue and variations in red) as well as sporadic variation elsewhere in the epitope (shown in green). The patient's virus evolves from the consensus 83A, 85 V, 87L/I, 91L (all blue except 87I which is red) to 83G (red), 85L (red), 87L (blue), 91L (blue) over approximately three years during which various epitope variants with single, or linked mutations occur in the population (83K, 87I, 91I, shown in red). Of note is the temporary predominance of the 87I mutation, which is lost shortly after the 85L mutation develop. An X at the end of the clone name refers to changes in other epitopes; green X = KL9 epitope, E98D, green XX = KL9 epitope, G99E, red X = VL9 epitope and overlapping WF9 epitope, R185K, blue X = sporadic changes in WF9 epitope (Table 3). Amino acid numbering corresponds to HXB2 Gag. Scale bars signify substitutions/site. w: corresponds to estimated week from infection (e.g. a clone named 177_w13 are obtained from a plasma sample drawn at week 13).
