                Figure 5.  Characterization of the HLA-A2-restricted SL9-specific (82I and 79F82I autologous variants) and HLA-A1-restricted GY9 specific CTL responses in OP428.Peptide titration of the autologous epitope variants was conducted to evaluate the functional avidity of the responses over time, at weeks 39, 88, and 139 from estimated infection. The CFC assay was used to measure the production of gamma interferon by antigen specific CD8+ T cells, with the indicated peptides in 10-fold dilutions.
