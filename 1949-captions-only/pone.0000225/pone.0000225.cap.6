Amino acids corresponding to the consensus B sequence are shown in blue, while the Y79F mutation within SL9 and GY9 is given in red, and the E93D and V94I mutations within EL9 are shown in green on the tree. The variation found at the positively selected amino acid position 62, where a potential compensatory mutation (E62A) seems to occur prior to, and associated with, the Y79F substitution are as follows: variation at position 62: E, blue, G, orange, V purple and A red. Amino acid numbering corresponds to HXB2 Gag. Scale bars signify substitutions/site. w: corresponds to estimated week from infection (e.g. a clone named 428_w15 was obtained from a plasma sample drawn at week 15).</p>
