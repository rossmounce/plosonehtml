No statistically significant differences in CTL responses to non-HIV antigens included in the CEF peptide pool were seen over time (Paired T-test, p = 0.269). However, the increase in CTL response to the HIV-Gag (p55) peptide pool was borderline significant (Paired T-test, p = 0.064). The responses in subjects OP177, OP428 and OP599, who developed multiple HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses and showed evidence of viral escape within targeted epitopes, are indicated with dashed lines.</p>
