A/ Splenocytes from Pin1−/−mice (KO) or wild-type mice (WT) were activated for 3 hours with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. mRNAs for IFN-γ, IL-2 or CXCL10 were analyzed by reverse transcription, qPCR. Fold change increase in activated compared to resting cells were assessed and averages±SD from 3 mice in each groups are presented. B/ Splenocytes were activated as in (A) for 5 hours and IFN-γ amounts in the cultures were measured by ELISA. Averages±SD from 3 mice in each groups are presented. C/ Percentage of IFN-γ and IL-2 positive CD4+ and CD8+ cells in splenocytes activated for 5 hours with anti-CD3. Splenocytes were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with relevant antibodies at saturation and then washed and analyzed using a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). KO mice (−/−) are compared to heterozygote mice (+/−) and a representative experiment is shown D/ Splenocytes from the same mice (n = 3) were activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 3 hours before treated with actinomycin D (Act D;10 µg/ml). mRNA levels were determined by qPCR at the indicated times after Act D. IFN-γ mRNA levels at T<sub>0</sub> were normalized to 100%. E/ Thymocytes from Pin1−/− (KO) or wild-type (WT) mice were activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 3 hours with or without juglone (1 µM). mRNA levels were determined by qPCR and presented as relative (%) expression of IFN-γ in juglone-treated cells compared to activated. * denotes p&lt;0.05.</p>
