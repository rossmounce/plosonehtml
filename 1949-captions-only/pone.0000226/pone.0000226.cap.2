                Figure 2. Cytokine mRNAs are suppressed by Pin1 inhibition in activated rat splenocytes. A/ mRNAs for IFN-γ, IL-2, and CXCL-10 were analyzed in splenocytes by reverse transcription, qPCR. Cells were cultured for 4 hours without activation (resting), or with ionophore plus PMA (I/P) or I/P plus juglone (I/P/J) at 1 or 0.1 µM. The ionomycin/PMA stimulated sample was normalized to 100 and others expressed as a % of that value. The data are averages±SEM of 3 independent experiments using splenocytes of untreated healthy animals. B/ Secreted IFN-γ and IL-2 after 24 hours from the cultures as described in (A). The data are averages±SEM of 3 independent experiments using splenocytes of untreated healthy animals. C/ Viability of rat splenocytes treated as above for 24 hr, incubated with propidium iodine and analyzed by flow cytometry.
