BAL cells were prepared from control and juglone-treated rats as described above and the percentage of CD4+, CD8+ and γδ T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry with specific antibodies. The graph represents an average +/− SD of 4 experiments. B/ IFN-γ and IL-2 concentrations in concentrated BAL fluid were determined by ELISA. * denotes p&lt;0.01. C/ Mediastinal lymph nodes from control or juglone treated animals were used for reverse transcription, qPCR for the cytokines shown along the x-axis. The values in untreated controls were normalized to 100% and data shown represent % change in juglone treated samples. In (B) and (C), the data shown are an average±SEM of 4 rats in each group 7 days after transplantation. * denotes p&lt;0.05 from control samples. D/ Splenocytes were isolated and cultured as described in <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>. IFN-γ positive splenocytes were quantitated by Elispot (n = 3). * denotes p&lt;0.05.</p>
