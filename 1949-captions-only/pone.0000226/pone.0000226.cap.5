A/ BAL fluid cells from transplanted and untreated controls (⧫), or juglone treated (▴) were quantitated, lysed and used for Pin1 isomerase assay. Juglone (1 µM) was also added <em>in vitro</em> to equal amounts of the control (⋄) and juglone treated (▵) samples and isomerase assay repeated. B/ Mediastinal lymph nodes from 2 untreated controls (⧫,⋄) or one juglone treated animal (▴) were lysed and equal amounts of protein used for Pin1 isomerase assay. C/ Immunoblot with anti-Pin1 or anti-actin of mediastinal lymph nodes from 2 controls, untreated (−juglone) or 2 juglone treated animals (+juglone). D/ Donor lungs were insufflated with 100 µg each of CXCL10 and IFN-γexpression vectors immediately prior to religation in recipient. Animals were then untreated (I, II) or treated with juglone at 1mg/kg for 1 week (III, IV) and histopathologic analysis after H &amp; E staining. Representative sections from multiple animals shown.</p>
