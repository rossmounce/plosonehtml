(II) Treated with juglone at 0.1 mg/kg/d for 7 days. (III) Treated with CsA at 1 mg/kg/d for 3 days plus juglone at 0.1 mg/kg/d for 7 days. For all conditions, gross apearance of the transplant at harvest shown along the left, 5× and 20× representative sections stained with H &amp; E shown in the middle and right panels.
