                Figure 1.  Expression of CSA, CD36 and ICAM-1 on human NK cells.Primary resting human NK cells (CD56+CD3âˆ’) in total PBMC as well as human NK cell lines, NK92 and NKL were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the surface expression of three host ligands for PfEMP1: CSA (left panels, dark line), CD36 (middle panels, dark line) and ICAM-1 (right panels, dark line). Stainings with isotype control for each antibody are represented by filled grey histograms. Stainings of primary resting human NK cells are representative of at least 3 donors.
