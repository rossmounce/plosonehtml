After 1 h at 37°C, a sample of the co-culture was placed between slide and cover and analyzed under a microscope. The NK92 cells directly interacts with IE (FCR3-CSA strain) as rosettes, but not with uninfected erythrocytes (x100 original magnification, left panel). RBC infected with FCR3-CSA or 2A5 were co-cultured with NK92 cells alone or in the presence of soluble CSA (+CSA), or with NK92 cells pre-treated with chondroitinase ABC (+Case ABC). At the end of the co-culture, the percentage of NK cells interacting with at least two IE was determined and expressed as % of cytoadhesion. Each dot represents one independent experiment (right panel). (B) Freshly isolated human PBMC were cultured with uninfected RBC (RBC), RBC infected with FCR3-CSA or RBC infected with the <em>var2csa</em> KO parasite 2A5. After 24 h, NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on CD3<sup>−</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. The CD69 MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) staining on NK cells (left panel), the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> NK cells (middle panel) and the percentage of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> NK cells (right panel) were determined for 7 different healthy donors. Means±SEM are represented. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon test.</p>
