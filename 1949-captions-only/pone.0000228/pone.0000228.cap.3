Total PBMC protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western Blot (left panel). Total PBMC were stained with CD36 antibody or with an isotype control (filled grey histogram, right panel). Histograms for CD3<sup>−</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells from a CD36 deficient donor (dotted line) and a control donor (bold line) are represented. (B) Control or CD36-deficient PBMC were cultured with uninfected RBC (RBC, black bars), or with RBC infected with the 3D7 <em>Pf</em> strain (3D7, grey bars). After 24 h, NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on CD3<sup>−</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells. The CD69 MFI staining on NK cells (left panel), the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> NK cells (middle panel) and the percentage of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> NK cells (right panel) were determined in three independent experiments. Means ± SEM are represented. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann Whitney test.</p>
