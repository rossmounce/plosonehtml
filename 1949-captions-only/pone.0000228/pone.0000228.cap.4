                Figure 4.  Engagement of ICAM-1 with its cellular ligand but not with PfEMP1 is required for NK cell IFN-γ production.(A) Diagram of an ICAM-1 molecule showing schematic binding sites for LFA-1, Mac-1, CD11c/CD18 and PfEMP1. The epitope map of the anti-ICAM-1 mAb 15.2, My13 and RR1/1 is indicated. (B) Human PBMC were cultured with uninfected RBC (RBC, black bars) or with RBC infected with the 3D7 Pf strain (3D7, grey bars) in presence or absence of antibodies directed against NKG2D (isotype control), ICAM-1 or CD18. Three different clones of anti-ICAM-1 were used: 15.2 blocks the interaction of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 and with PfEMP1, RR1/1 blocks only the interaction with LFA-1 and My13 blocks only the interaction with PfEMP1. After 24 h of co-culture, NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on CD3−CD56+ NK cells. The CD69 MFI staining on NK cells (left panel), the percentage of CD25+ NK cells (middle panel) and the percentage of IFN-γ+ NK cells (right panel) were determined for 24 donors (None, NKG2D and 15.2), 13 donors (CD18), 9 donors (My13) or 5 donors (RR1/1). Means ± SEM are represented. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann Whitney test.
