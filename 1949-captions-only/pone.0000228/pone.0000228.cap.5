                Figure 5.  PfEMP1 deficient parasites are potent activators of NK cells.Human PBMC were cultured with uninfected RBC (RBC, black bars) or with RBC infected with the “PfEMP1 KO” strain DC-J. After 24 h, NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on CD3−CD56+ NK cells. The CD69 MFI staining on NK cells (left panel), the percentage of CD25+ NK cells (middle panel) and the percentage of IFN-γ+ NK cells (right panel) were determined for 5 different healthy donors. Means±SEM are represented. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon test.
