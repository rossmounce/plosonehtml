After 24 h, NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on CD3<sup>−</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells. The CD69 MFI staining on NK cells (left panel), the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> NK cells (middle panel) and the percentage of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> NK cells (right panel) were determined for 5 different healthy donors. Means±SEM are represented. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon test.</p>
