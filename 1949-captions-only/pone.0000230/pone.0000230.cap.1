Monkeys sat in chambers equipped with two levers and distinctly colored light stimuli above the levers. Completion of the response requirement (the ratio) on the active lever produced a brief two-sec presentation of a light stimulus and an intravenous injection of nicotine followed by a timeout (TO) period of 5 to 60 sec. Completion of the ratio requirement on the inactive lever resulted in presentation of a brief two-sec light stimulus of a different color but no injection. The fixed-ratio (FR) response requirement was gradually increased over successive sessions from one to ten (FR 1 to FR 10). B. Mean percentage choice for responding on the active lever by monkeys when they were experimentally naive (first week under a FR 1 schedule) and when they had learned to self-administer nicotine under the FR 10, TO 60 sec schedule (first week under the FR 10 schedule). *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01, compared to first week of training.</p>
