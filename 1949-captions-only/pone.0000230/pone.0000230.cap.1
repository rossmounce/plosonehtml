                Figure 1. A. Monkeys sat in chambers equipped with two levers and distinctly colored light stimuli above the levers. Completion of the response requirement (the ratio) on the active lever produced a brief two-sec presentation of a light stimulus and an intravenous injection of nicotine followed by a timeout (TO) period of 5 to 60 sec. Completion of the ratio requirement on the inactive lever resulted in presentation of a brief two-sec light stimulus of a different color but no injection. The fixed-ratio (FR) response requirement was gradually increased over successive sessions from one to ten (FR 1 to FR 10). B. Mean percentage choice for responding on the active lever by monkeys when they were experimentally naive (first week under a FR 1 schedule) and when they had learned to self-administer nicotine under the FR 10, TO 60 sec schedule (first week under the FR 10 schedule). *P&lt;0.01, compared to first week of training.
