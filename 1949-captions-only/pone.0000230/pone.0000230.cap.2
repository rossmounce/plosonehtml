                Figure 2. Maintenance of self-administration behavior under the FR 10 schedule during the first experience with saline substitution. Mean number (Â±SEM) of ratios completed on the active lever during three consecutive session with access to nicotine followed by an additional three sessions with saline substituted for nicotine are shown. The brief 2-sec light stimuli were presented following each ratio completion during both the nicotine and saline sessions. Self-administration behavior was not reduced by the substitution of saline injections for nicotine injections during this first exposure to extinction conditions.
