                Figure 5. Influence of nicotine dose on nicotine self-administration and total nicotine intake per session under the progressive-ratio schedule. Number of nicotine injections per session and corresponding breaking-point values (highest ratio completed) under the progressive-ratio schedule (A) and total nicotine intake per session (B) are presented as a function of injection dose of nicotine (n = 5). Each symbol represents the mean (±SEM) of at least three sessions under each nicotine injection dose condition *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 post-hoc comparisons with saline vehicle (0 µg/kg per injection) conditions.
