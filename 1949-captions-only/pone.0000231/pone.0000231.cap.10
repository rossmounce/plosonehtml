                Figure 10. Periodic intermittent synchronization induced by sinusoidal stimulus. The protein TetR concentrations of 10 cells for 103 cells are plotted, where the inset shows a locally enlarged oscillation with period T0 and declining amplitudes for one TetR. k = 20, η = ηe = 0.1, λ = 2.5, σ = 2.5 and ω = 2π/200. Other parameters are the same as those described for Fig. 6.
