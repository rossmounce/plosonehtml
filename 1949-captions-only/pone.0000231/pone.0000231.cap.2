                Figure 2. Period histogram (a and b) and dependence of R on τ (c) for 103 cells. (a) k = 0.0, (b and c) k = 2.0. For (b), σ = 10, and for (c), T0 = 12.2 (representing the intrinsic period). The lifetime ratio β in the different cells is chosen to obey the Gaussian distribution of mean &lt;β&gt; = 2 and standard deviation Δβ = 0.05.
