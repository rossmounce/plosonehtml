                Figure 4. The effect of external sinusoidal stimulus on collective behaviors, where 103 cells are simulated: For k = 0, synchronization cannot be achieved (stages I and III); For k = 2.0, an appropriate external stimulus can induce phase synchronization (stage II). The protein TetR concentrations of 10 cells are plotted. Other parameters are the same as those described in Fig. 2. The initial values of variables in each latter stage take their final values in the right former stage.
