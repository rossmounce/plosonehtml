(a) Resonance regions (forming Arnold tongues), where two cases corresponding to k = 2 (labeled by red boundaries) and k = 8 (labeled by blue boundaries), respectively, are displayed; (b) The time evolution of TetRs of 10 cells in resonance region II. η = η<em><sub>e</sub></em> = 0.1 (a and b), k = 8, σ = 10, and τ = <em>T</em><sub>0</sub> (b); (c) The effect of parameter k on the mean intrinsic period and amplitude. Other parameters are α = 216 and n = 2, The lifetime ratio β in the different cells is chosen to obey the Gaussian distribution of mean &lt;β&gt; = 2 and standard deviation Δβ = 0.05.</p>
