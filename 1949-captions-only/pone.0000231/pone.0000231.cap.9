                Figure 9. The effect of impulsive stimulus on synchronization of 103 repressilators: Achieving synchronization due to coupling (see stages I and IV); Ruining the achieved synchronization by some external impulses with moderate strength (stage II), and recovering synchronization with the suppressed oscillation amplitude by some strong enough impulses (stage III). The protein TetR concentrations of 10 cells are plotted. k = 20, η = ηe = 3 and τ = 6&lt;T0. Other parameters are the same as those described for Fig. 6.
