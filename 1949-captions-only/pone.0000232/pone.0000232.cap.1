ES cells are induced to form EBs in methylcellulose. CD34<sup>+</sup> EBs are sorted and cultured for one week with OP9 stroma in the presence of indicated cytokines to generate ES-HP cells. ES-HPs are cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15 for NK cell differentiation or on OP9-DL1 stroma with IL-7 and Flt3-L for T cell differentiation. (B) NK cells generated from ES-HPs were stained for the indicated receptors and analyzed by flow cytometer. Filled histograms show staining with the appropriate mAbs and open histograms show isotype-matched control antibody staining. Percentages of positively stained cells over the control staining are shown. Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide and gated out. Residual OP9 cells were also gated out by their high scatter profile. (C) RNA was isolated from 2×10<sup>5</sup> bulk T cells and 2×10<sup>6</sup> bulk NK cells derived from ES-HPs (ES-T and ES-NK, respectively) and converted into cDNAs. Aliquots (1/30) of cDNAs were subjected to PCR for rearranged TCRγ gene. The PCR products were blotted and hybridized to a Jγ1 probe. Thymocytes were used as positive control. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RT-PCR was also used as control. (D) cDNA was generated from ES-T cells as in (C). One microlitre of undiluted, 1/10 and 1/100 diluted cDNA was subjected to PCR for CD3ε and RAG-1. OP9 cells were used as negative control. (E) ES-T cells were harvested on day 7, stained for TCRγδ and TCRβ and analyzed by flow cytometer as in Fig. 1B. OP9-DL1 cells expressed green fluorescent protein and were gated out by green fluorescence. (F) One thousand CD34<sup>+</sup> EBs and ES-HP cells were plated in methylcellulose media for myeloid and erythroid colony formation and the total number of myeloid and erythroid colonies were counted as described in <a href="#s2">materials and methods</a>.</p>
