                Figure 2.  Characterization of NK progenitors within ES-HPs.(A) ES-HP cells were stained for the indicated markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Filled histograms show staining with appropriate mAbs and open histograms show isotype-matched control antibody staining. Percentages of positively stained cells over the control staining are shown. Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide and gated out. OP9 cells were also gated out by their high scatter profile. (B) ES-HPs were co-stained with anti-CD45.2 and IL-7Rα mAbs (left panel), or anti-CD45.2 and γc mAbs (right panel) and analyzed by flow cytometer as in (A). CD45 positive cells were gated and analyzed for the expression of indicated receptors. (C) Irradiated OP9 cells were cultured for 2 days in 96 well plates. ES-HPs were stained with anti-CD45.2 mAb and CD45+ and CD45− ES-HPs were sorted by FACS into the wells with the pre-formed OP9 stroma layers. For CD45+ ES-HPs, 10, 30 and 100 cells per well were sorted into 12 wells each. For CD45− and bulk ES-HPs, 30, 100 and 300 cells per well were sorted into 12 wells each. After culturing with appropriate cytokines for NK cell differentiation, cells in individual wells were harvested and analyzed for the presence of NK cells by granzyme B RT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using L-CalcTM software. The results are means ± SD of three independent experiments, except for bulk ES-HPs which is average of two experiments.
