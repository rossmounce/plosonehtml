                Figure 3.  Characterization of CD34+CD45+ and CD34+CD45− EB cells.(A) EBs were harvested on day 8 and single cell suspension was prepared. Cells were stained with anti-CD34 mAb together with mAb to indicated markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were gated out by propidium iodide staining. (B) CD34+CD45− (left) and CD45+ (right) EB cells in (A) were gated, and analysed for the expression of Mac-1 by flow cytometry. Numbers indicate percentage of cells in quadrants or gates. (C) CD34+CD45− and CD45+ EB cells were isolated by FACS sorting and cultured to generate ES-HPs. The sorted EB cells and the ES-HPs generated from them were plated for myeloid and erythroid colony formation as in Fig. 1F. (D) CD34+CD45− EB cells were directly cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15 for NK cell differentiation. Cells were harvested after 2 weeks, stained for NK markers and analyzed by flow cytometry as in Fig. 1B. (E) CD34+CD45− EB cells were directly cultured onto OP9-DL1 stroma with proper cytokines for T cell differentiation for 3 weeks. Expression of T cell markers was analyzed by flow cytometry as in Fig. 1E. (F) Limiting numbers (100, 300 and 1,000 cells per well) of CD34+CD45− EB cells were sorted into each well of 96 well plates. For NK progenitor assays, wells contained OP9 stroma, IL-2, and IL-15. For T progenitor assays, wells contained OP9-DL1 cells, IL-7 and Flt3-L as described in materials and methods. NK cells were detected by granzyme B RT-PCR and T cells detected by TCRγ RT-PCR followed by southern blotting. The number of progenitors in 1000 plated cells was calculated as in Fig. 2C.
