Cells were stained with anti-CD34 mAb together with mAb to indicated markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were gated out by propidium iodide staining. (B) CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> (left) and CD45<sup>+</sup> (right) EB cells in (A) were gated, and analysed for the expression of Mac-1 by flow cytometry. Numbers indicate percentage of cells in quadrants or gates. (C) CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> EB cells were isolated by FACS sorting and cultured to generate ES-HPs. The sorted EB cells and the ES-HPs generated from them were plated for myeloid and erythroid colony formation as in <a href="#pone-0000232-g001">Fig. 1F</a>. (D) CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> EB cells were directly cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15 for NK cell differentiation. Cells were harvested after 2 weeks, stained for NK markers and analyzed by flow cytometry as in <a href="#pone-0000232-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. (E) CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> EB cells were directly cultured onto OP9-DL1 stroma with proper cytokines for T cell differentiation for 3 weeks. Expression of T cell markers was analyzed by flow cytometry as in <a href="#pone-0000232-g001">Fig. 1E</a>. (F) Limiting numbers (100, 300 and 1,000 cells per well) of CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>−</sup> EB cells were sorted into each well of 96 well plates. For NK progenitor assays, wells contained OP9 stroma, IL-2, and IL-15. For T progenitor assays, wells contained OP9-DL1 cells, IL-7 and Flt3-L as described in <a href="#s2">materials and methods</a>. NK cells were detected by granzyme B RT-PCR and T cells detected by TCRγ RT-PCR followed by southern blotting. The number of progenitors in 1000 plated cells was calculated as in <a href="#pone-0000232-g002">Fig. 2C</a>.</p>
