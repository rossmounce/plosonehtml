                Figure 4.  Characterization of ES-HP cells derived from CD34+CD45− EBs for surface markers and NK potential.(A) ES-HP cells derived from CD34+CD45− EB cells were stained with mAbs to indicated markers and analyzed by flow cytometry as in Fig. 2A. (B) ES-HP cells were co-stained with anti-CD45, c-kit and Sca-1 mAbs. Cells were then gated on CD45+ and analyzed for the expression of c-kit and Sca-1 (left panel). ES-HP cells were stained with a combination of purified anti-CD45.2 mAb followed by Alexa Flour 647-goat anti-mouse IgG, and biotinylated anti-Mac-1 and Ter119 mAbs followed by streptavidin-PE and analyzed by flow cytometer (middle panel). CD45+Mac-1−Ter119− cells were gated and analyzed for the expression of IL-2Rβ (right panel). (C) CD45+Lin− ES-HPs were sorted and cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15. After 3 days, cells were harvested and subjected to flow cytometry analysis after staining with anti-IL-2Rβ and anti-IL-7Rα. (D) Sorted CD45+Lin− ES-HPs were cultured in NK culture (described in materials and methods) for one week and analysed for the expression of NK markers. (E) The bulk and sorted CD45+Lin− ES-HP cells were analyzed for NK progenitor frequency by limiting dilution cultures as in Fig. 2C. For the former 30, 100 and 300 cells per well and for the latter 3, 10, and 30 cells per well were plated. The results are mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
