(B) ES-HP cells were co-stained with anti-CD45, c-kit and Sca-1 mAbs. Cells were then gated on CD45<sup>+</sup> and analyzed for the expression of c-kit and Sca-1 (left panel). ES-HP cells were stained with a combination of purified anti-CD45.2 mAb followed by Alexa Flour 647-goat anti-mouse IgG, and biotinylated anti-Mac-1 and Ter119 mAbs followed by streptavidin-PE and analyzed by flow cytometer (middle panel). CD45<sup>+</sup>Mac-1<sup>−</sup>Ter119<sup>−</sup> cells were gated and analyzed for the expression of IL-2Rβ (right panel). (C) CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> ES-HPs were sorted and cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15. After 3 days, cells were harvested and subjected to flow cytometry analysis after staining with anti-IL-2Rβ and anti-IL-7Rα. (D) Sorted CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> ES-HPs were cultured in NK culture (described in <a href="#s2">materials and methods</a>) for one week and analysed for the expression of NK markers. (E) The bulk and sorted CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> ES-HP cells were analyzed for NK progenitor frequency by limiting dilution cultures as in <a href="#pone-0000232-g002">Fig. 2C</a>. For the former 30, 100 and 300 cells per well and for the latter 3, 10, and 30 cells per well were plated. The results are mean ± SD of three independent experiments.</p>
