                Figure 5.  T, B and myeloid potential of ES-HPs derived from CD34+CD45− EB cells.(A) CD34+CD45− EB cells were sorted and cultured with OP9 and cytokines to generate ES-HPs. They were then cultured on OP9-DL1 stroma with cytokines for T cell differentiation. At different time points, cells were harvested and stained for CD44 and CD25 and analyzed by flow cytometer. Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide and OP9-DL1 cells expressing green fluorescent protein were gated out. The numbers show the percentages of cells in the quadrants. (B) ES-HP cells were cultured for T cell differentiation for 8 days with 5 ng/ml IL-7 as in (A). On day 8, IL-7 concentration was reduced to 1 ng/ml and cells were cultured for an additional 6 days. Cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometer for CD4 and CD8 expression. The numbers indicate the percentages of cells in the quadrants. (C) ES-HP cells were cultured for T cell differentiation with 5 ng/ml IL-7 for 2 weeks and an additional 4 days with 1 ng/ml IL-7, stained for TCRγδ and TCRβ and analyzed by flow cytometer. The numbers show the percentages of cells positively stained with the test antibodies (filled histogram) over control antibody (open histogram). (D) ES-HPs were generated from CD34+CD45− EB cells as in (A). The bulk and sorted CD45+Lin− ES-HP cells were analyzed for T progenitor frequency by limiting dilution cultures as in Fig. 3F, except that 30, 100, 300 and 900 cells per well for bulk and 10, 30 and 100 cells per well for CD45+Lin− cells were plated. The results are average of two independent experiments. (E) CD45+Lin− ES-HPs were sorted and cultured on OP9 cells with IL-7 and Flt3-L for B cell generation. After one week, cells were harvested and analysed for the expression of B220 and CD19 with flow cytometer. (F) One thousand sorted CD45+Lin− ES-HPs were transferred into myeloid differentiation media as in Fig. 1F. The number of myeloid and erythroid colonies were scored.
