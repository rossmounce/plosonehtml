                Figure 1. Experiment: effect of pinning at the subpopulation level, averaged over four replicate metapopulations. (A) The mean FI of the pinned subpopulation was significantly less than the mean of the remaining eight subpopulations. (B) There was no difference in the average FI of the pinned group (the pinned subpopulation and its two immediate neighbors) and the two neighboring groups on either side (No Pin1 and No Pin 2). This suggests that the stabilized subpopulation could not stabilize the dynamics of the pinned group vis-Ã -vis the two neighboring groups. Error bars indicate standard errors around the mean in this and all subsequent figures.
