                Figure 10. Simulations with no extinctions: effects of migration rate on stability. In the absence of extinctions, there were no major differences in the FI of the (A) control and (B) pinned metapopulations. However, there was a change in the profile of the metapopulation FI (cf. Fig 6), indicating that migration rate can interact with the levels of extinction, although this is not expected to interact with pinning to alter the empirically observed patterns of metapopulation stability.
