In the absence of extinctions, there were no major differences in the FI of the (A) control and (B) pinned metapopulations. However, there was a change in the profile of the metapopulation FI (cf. <a href="#pone-0000233-g006">Fig 6</a>), indicating that migration rate can interact with the levels of extinction, although this is not expected to interact with pinning to alter the empirically observed patterns of metapopulation stability.</p>
