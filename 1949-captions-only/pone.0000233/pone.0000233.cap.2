(A) Metapopulation stability and (B) subpopulation stability were measured as the fluctuation index (FI) over 21 generations. (C) Synchrony among nearest neighbors was measured as the cross-correlation at lag zero of the first differenced ln-transformed values of population sizes. Due to the high rates of migration, the subpopulations were found to be in synchrony, as demonstrated by the positive cross correlation coefficients. (D) Average subpopulation size. There was no difference among the pinned and the control metapopulations in any of the panels, indicating that pinning had no detectable effect on metapopulation dynamics.</p>
