                Figure 3. Simulations mimicking experiment: effect of pinning at the subpopulation level. (A) The FI of the pinned subpopulation was lower than the mean of the remaining eight subpopulations, over a substantial range of the intrinsic growth rate parameter, r. (B) There was no difference in the average FI of the pinned group and its two neighboring groups. These observations agree with the experimental results (cf. Fig 1), implying that the experimental findings are non-Drosophila specific. All data points in this, and subsequent simulation figures, represent average of 10 independent runs. See text for details of simulations.
