(A) The FI of the pinned subpopulation was lower than the mean of the remaining eight subpopulations, over a substantial range of the intrinsic growth rate parameter, <em>r</em>. (B) There was no difference in the average FI of the pinned group and its two neighboring groups. These observations agree with the experimental results (cf. <a href="#pone-0000233-g001">Fig 1</a>), implying that the experimental findings are non-<em>Drosophila</em> specific. All data points in this, and subsequent simulation figures, represent average of 10 independent runs. See text for details of simulations.</p>
