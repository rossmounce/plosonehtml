                Figure 4. Simulations mimicking experiment: effect of pinning at the metapopulation level. Ricker based simulations predicted no difference in (A) metapopulation stability, (B) subpopulation stability, and (C) synchrony amongst nearest-neighbors, between the control and pinned metapopulations. (D) The simulations suggested a slight decrease in subpopulation size for low values of r, which was not picked up by the experiment. Overall, these results agree with the corresponding experimental findings (Fig 2), indicating that they are likely to be applicable to other species.
