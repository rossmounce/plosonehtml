Ricker based simulations predicted no difference in (A) metapopulation stability, (B) subpopulation stability, and (C) synchrony amongst nearest-neighbors, between the control and pinned metapopulations. (D) The simulations suggested a slight decrease in subpopulation size for low values of <em>r</em>, which was not picked up by the experiment. Overall, these results agree with the corresponding experimental findings (<a href="#pone-0000233-g002">Fig 2</a>), indicating that they are likely to be applicable to other species.</p>
