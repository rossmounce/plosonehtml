                Figure 5. Simulations relaxing experimental assumptions: effect of pinning density and magnitude on stability. (A) There was no effect on metapopulation FI due to pinning greater number of patches for r&lt;3. When r&gt;3, increasing the proportion of pinned patches generally increased FI, although there were no consistent patterns. (B) Varying the magnitude of pinning had no effects on metapopulation stability. These suggest that the empirical results are robust to departures from the conditions of the experiment.
