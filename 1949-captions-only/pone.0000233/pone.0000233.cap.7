(A) The FI of the pinned subpopulation was higher than the mean of the remaining eight subpopulations only for <em>r</em>&gt;2.6. (B) The average FI of the pinned group tended to be higher than the two neighboring groups for <em>r</em>&gt;2.6, although this difference was significant only for a comparatively narrow parameter range. Both these results were contradictory to the observations from the experiments (<a href="#pone-0000233-g001">Fig 1</a>) and the simulations mimicking the experiments (<a href="#pone-0000233-g003">Fig 3</a>), indicating that the effect of pinning at the subpopulation level interacts with the extinction probability</p>
