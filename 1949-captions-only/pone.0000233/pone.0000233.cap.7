                Figure 7. Simulations with no extinctions: effect of pinning at the subpopulation level. (A) The FI of the pinned subpopulation was higher than the mean of the remaining eight subpopulations only for r&gt;2.6. (B) The average FI of the pinned group tended to be higher than the two neighboring groups for r&gt;2.6, although this difference was significant only for a comparatively narrow parameter range. Both these results were contradictory to the observations from the experiments (Fig 1) and the simulations mimicking the experiments (Fig 3), indicating that the effect of pinning at the subpopulation level interacts with the extinction probability
