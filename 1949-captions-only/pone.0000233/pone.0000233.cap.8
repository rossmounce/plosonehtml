Although there were qualitative differences in the shapes of the profiles compared to the case when extinction probabilities were incorporated (<a href="#pone-0000233-g004">Fig 4</a>), there were no systematic differences between the control and the pinned treatments in terms of (A) metapopulation FI, (B) subpopulation FI, and (C) subpopulation synchrony. However, the average subpopulation size (D) of the pinned subpopulations was predicted to be similar to the controls for <em>r</em>&lt;3, which agrees with the experiments (<a href="#pone-0000233-g002">Fig 2D</a>), but not the earlier simulations (<a href="#pone-0000233-g004">Fig 4D</a>). Taken together it can be said that even in the absence of extinctions, pinning is unlikely to affect metapopulation dynamics.</p>
