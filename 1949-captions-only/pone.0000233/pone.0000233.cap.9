(A) When there are no extinctions, increasing the number of pinned patches was generally found to destabilize the metapopulation dynamics, similar to the experimental scenario (5A). (B) Changing the strength of pinning, however, did not affect the metapopulation stability, although there was a change in the FI profile relative to the earlier simulations incorporating extinctions (cf. <a href="#pone-0000233-g005">Fig 5B</a>).</p>
