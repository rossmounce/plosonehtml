Experimental arrangement in top and lateral views is shown. The laser doppler vibrometer (LDV), the honey bee antenna, and the sound tube were linearly aligned along with the optical axis of the LDV as shown. The vibrometer was positioned at 31 cm away from the flagellum. Sound stimuli are delivered through a Tygon tube ending in a 7 mm opening close to the honey bee. The dashed line indicates the hemispherical zone where full near-field acoustic conditions are maintained. The scanning probe to measure the particle velocity of the surrounding air was positioned at 2 mm away from the flagellum. The probe head was aligned perpendicular to the direction of sound propagation. The joints between head and scape as well as scape and pedicel were fixed with glue to prevent the antennal movements by muscle. The spot position of laser beam was fixed at the tip of the flagellum. All items are not in scale.</p>
