                Figure 4. Intensity and frequency characteristics of honey bee flagellar vibrations in response to acoustic stimuli. The vibration (response) magnitudes, the ratio of the flagellar vibration velocity to the air particle velocity, of 4 live (solid square) and 2 dead (open triangle) bee flagellar tips to pure-tone stimulation at different frequencies (50–1000 Hz) are plotted against the particle velocity (A-G). The data points are parallel to the intensity axis at 50 (A), 160 (B), 500 (E), 750 (F), and 1000 (G) Hz, demonstrating that the flagellar vibration velocity linearly increases as a function of the air particle velocity. The response magnitudes to 265 (C) and 350 (D) Hz stimuli are non-linear, they show the maximum only at intensities between 0.3–4 mm/s, and then decrease at intensities above 4 mm/s. (H) Bar graph shows the mean response magnitudes to stimulation at different frequencies obtained with 0.3 mm/s air particle velocity. Error bars indicate standard error. The resonance frequency of the honey bee flagellum would be around 350 Hz.
