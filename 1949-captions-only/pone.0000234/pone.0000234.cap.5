                Figure 5. Temporal patterns of honey bee flagellar vibrations in response to continuous and pulse tone stimuli. The time traces of honey bee flagellar vibrations in response to the continuous and pulse tone stimuli at 265 and 500 Hz frequencies are shown. The 265 and 500 Hz pulse stimuli represent the honey bee “waggle dance” sound and Drosophila courtship song, respectively. For each measurement, upper and lower traces indicate the time trace of sound stimulus and the flagellar vibration velocity, respectively. Each vibration velocity shown is the averaged response of 10 trials in a single antenna. Note that the vertical scales for 265 and 500 Hz stimuli are different, 1 and 0.25 mm/s, respectively. The honey bee antennal flagellum has the ability to preserve both frequency and temporal patterns of acoustic stimuli applied.
