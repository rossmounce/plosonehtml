                Figure 1. Variation in richness of malaria parasites among different bird host species. The curves represent parasite cumulative richness in 15 passerine species with more than 25 scored parasite infections, belonging to 10 bird genera (represented in different colours, see details in Table 1). The curves provide a standard estimate of parasite richness (R25) for each species, given by the number of parasites accumulated after analysing 25 infected individuals. The small graph shows the curves of parasite accumulation including all infections scored in each species (n = 26-353), crossed by a dotted line at R25. Blackcaps show the highest richness of malaria parasites in both graphs.
