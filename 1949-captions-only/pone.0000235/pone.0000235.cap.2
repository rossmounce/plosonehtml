The tree A shows the phylogenetic position of parasites found in blackcaps (red), garden warblers (blue) and African hill babblers (purple), among 143 parasite lineages found in 48 bird species. Monophyletic parasite groups apparently exclusive to some species are encircled in orange (species names are mentioned and the number of parasites in each group is shown in brackets). The tree B shows the parasite flock (represented by a triangle in the tree A). Numbers represent &gt;75% support to internal branches, based on bootstrap replicates (above) or posterior probabilities (below). For six parasites in this cluster, the figure shows the match between phylogenies based on mitochondrial cytochrome <em>b</em> and nuclear DHFR-TS genes (the number of cases with each association of haplotypes is indicated, and bootstrap support is reported if &gt;75%).</p>
