The map shows the location of our sampling sites within the range of blackcaps, garden warblers and African hill babblers, which are shadowed in different colours according to the key below the map. Blackcaps and garden warblers are sympatric (S) in wide areas of Europe and Africa, during the breeding season and in winter, respectively. African hill babblers are year-round residents. Many blackcaps and garden warblers from Europe spend the winter in the range of African hill babblers, where the three species occur in the same habitat. For each sampling site, the squares indicate the number of parasite lineages from the flock that were found in each species (blackcap parasites in red, garden warbler parasites in blue, and hill babbler parasites in purple).</p>
