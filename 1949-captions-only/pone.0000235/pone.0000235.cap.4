                Figure 4. Co-occurrence of sister blackcap parasites (see tree in Fig. 2B) in mixed infections of individual hosts. Numbers indicate the frequency of occurrence of each parasite combination. Combinations in red involve parasites for which frequent hybridisation is unlikely, according to linkage between mitochondrial and nuclear haplotypes.
