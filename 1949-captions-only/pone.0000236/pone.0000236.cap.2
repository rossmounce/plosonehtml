                Figure 2.  Detection and identification of B-RAF and N-RAS mutations in melanoma cell lines and corresponding tissues by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis SSCP and DNA sequencing.Migration patterns under non-denaturing conditions of single stranded fragments of exon 15 of the B-RAF gene with a T1799A mutation at codon 600 in the cell line Ma-Mel-36 (A) and the corresponding tumor tissue (B). Migration patterns for the B-RAF exon 15 fragments with wild type sequences in the cell line Ma-Mel-37a (C) and the corresponding tumor tissue (D). Panels (E) to (H) show sequence analyses of the cell lines and tumor tissues given in (A) to (D). Fluorescent capillary electrophoresis patterns for the N-RAS exon 2 sequence with a CAA&gt;CGA mutation at codon 61 in the cell line Ma-Mel-05 (I) and the corresponding tumor tissue (J). Migration patterns for the N-RAS exon 2 fragments with wild-type sequences in the cell line Ma-Mel-59 (K) and the corresponding tumor tissue (L). Panels (M) to (P) show the confirmation of the mutations in the cell lines and tissues shown in (I) to (L) by sequence analysis.
