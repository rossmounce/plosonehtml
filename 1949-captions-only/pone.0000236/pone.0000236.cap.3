                Figure 3.  Kaplan-Meier survival estimation for the whole patient population by mutational status.Curves showing the overall survival of 109 metastatic melanoma patients starting from the time point of tumor biopsy. Survival probabilities were compared by the mutational status of B-RAF in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 97) (A) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 105) (D), as well as N-RAS in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 97) (B) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 105) (E). (C) and (F) differentiate patients harbouring B-RAF mutations (n = 52, tissues; n = 52, cell lines), patients harbouring N-RAS mutations (n = 21, tissues; n = 25; cell lines), and patients without mutations in both genes (n = 24, tissues; n = 27, cell lines). Statistical differences between groups were calculated using the log-rank test. Vertical bars indicate censored observations.
