Survival probabilities were compared by the mutational status of B-RAF in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 97) (A) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 105) (D), as well as N-RAS in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 97) (B) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 105) (E). (C) and (F) differentiate patients harbouring B-RAF mutations (n = 52, tissues; n = 52, cell lines), patients harbouring N-RAS mutations (n = 21, tissues; n = 25; cell lines), and patients without mutations in both genes (n = 24, tissues; n = 27, cell lines). Statistical differences between groups were calculated using the log-rank test. Vertical bars indicate censored observations.</p>
