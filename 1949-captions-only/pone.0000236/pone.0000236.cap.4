Survival probabilities were compared by the mutational status of B-RAF in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 70) (A) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 80) (D), as well as N-RAS in tumor tissue biopsies (n = 70) (B) and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines (n = 80) (E). (C) and (F) differentiate patients harbouring B-RAF mutations (n = 43, tissues; n = 45, cell lines), patients harbouring N-RAS mutations (n = 12, tissues; n = 15; cell lines), and patients without mutations in both genes (n = 15, tissues; n = 20, cell lines). Statistical differences between groups were calculated using the log-rank test. Vertical bars indicate censored observations.</p>
