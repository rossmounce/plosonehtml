                Figure 1.  Podocalyxin induces microvillus formation.MDCK (A, B, E, F) and MCF-7 (C, D, G, H) cells transfected with murine Podocalyxin (B, D, F, H) or empty vector (A, C, E, G) and examined by TEM (A–D; scale bar: 1 µm) and SEM (E–H; scale bar: 2 µm). In TEM images, vertical slices are shown near the apical cell surface with some of the numerous additional microvilli labeled with red arrows. Many microvilli are visible as small circles as they are seen in cross-section. SEM images are of the apical cell surface with microvilli evident as thin surface projections. (I) Microvilli in six 50 µm2 fields were enumerated and graphed. Averages are shown; error bars represent standard deviation. T-tests were used to show statistically significant differences between vector and Podocalyxin-transfected cells, with p&lt;0.002 in both cases. Representative of two independent experiments.
