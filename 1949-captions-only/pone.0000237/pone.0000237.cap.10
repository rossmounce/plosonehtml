Scale bars: 5 µm. (A) Projections of merged apical confocal images; white numbers represent Pearson's colocalization coefficient. (B) Vertical slices of confocal stacks. (C, D) High magnification TEM images demonstrate the presence of actin filaments (red arrows) running the length of individual microvilli. Although microvilli of different lengths are shown in this figure, there was no consistent difference in microvilli lengths between samples. Scale bars: 0.1 µm. (C) Cross-sections; (D) longitudinal-sections.</p>
