                Figure 11.  Model of Podocalyxin's functions.(A) Cells expressing low or no Podocalyxin have well-defined cell-cell junctions and adhere well to the substratum. Overexpression of Podocalyxin leads to recruitment of f-actin to the apical membrane for formation of microvilli along with apical domain expansion and weakening of cell-cell junctions. Higher expression induces further recruitment of f-actin to the apical surface, which may lead to a decrease in basolateral actin and disruption of integrin-mediated cell-substratum adhesion. Two models are proposed to explain Podocalyxin's mechanism of action. (B) In the absence of Podocalyxin expression NHERF-1 is localized throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in cells expressing high levels of Podocalyxin NHERF-1 is recruited to the apical membrane. Thus, Podocalyxin may regulate NHERF's role in many biological processes.
