                Figure 2.  Podocalyxin-induced microvilli are structurally dependent on intact actin filaments.MDCK (A) and MCF-7 (B) cells transfected with murine Podocalyxin or empty vector were treated with the actin disrupting agent latrunculin A (LatA) or DMSO (negative control) and then fixed. Podocalyxin was labeled with an anti-Podocalyxin antibody (green); f-actin was labeled with phalloidin (red), and nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 5 Âµm.
