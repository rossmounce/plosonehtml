                Figure 3.  Podocalyxin induces apical expansion and recruits NHERF-1 to the apical membrane.3D images of empty vector and Podocalyxin-transfected MCF-7 cells showing ectopic Podocalyxin (red), endogenous NHERF-1 (green), and DAPI (blue) labeling. Dimensions of blue rectangles: 118×26 µm. (A) Podocalyxin-transfected cells labeled with an anti-Podocalyxin antibody. (B) The same cells labeled with an anti-NHERF-1 antibody. (C) Merged images showing Podocalyxin, NHERF-1, and DAPI labeling. Inset in (A): projection of apical surface of a single Podocalyxin-transfected MCF-7 cell, labeled with an anti-Podocalyxin antibody.
