                Figure 4.  Podocalyxin induces apical recruitment of f-actin and ezrin, and all three molecules colocalize in microvilli.Projections of apical confocal images of MCF-7 cells transfected with murine Podocalyxin or empty vector showing ectopic Podocalyxin (blue), endogenous ezrin (green), and f-actin (red) labeling. White represents colocalization of all three molecules. Note the long extended microvilli in the Podocalyxin-transfected sample. Scale bars: 5 Âµm.
