(A–D) Immunolabeling of VSV-tagged N'ezrin (green), ectopic Podocalyxin (red), and endogenous NHERF-1 (blue). Purple represents apical colocalization of Podocalyxin and NHERF-1 in cells not expressing dominant negative ezrin (internal negative control); white represents apical colocalization of all three molecules in cells expressing dominant negative ezrin. Scale bars: 5 µm. (A, C) Projections of merged confocal stacks taken near the apical cell surface showing individual colors and merged images; (B, D) vertical slices of confocal stacks.</p>
