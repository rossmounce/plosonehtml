Blue: extracellular domain, horizontal bars: carbohydrates/sialic acid residues, red: transmembrane region, purple: cytoplasmic tail (including C-terminal DTHL in wildtype and ΔEC), and green: flag-tag replacing most of Podocalyxin's extracellular domain. (B) FACS profiles demonstrating comparable Podocalyxin expression levels in sorted clones. Dashed lines represent negative controls (vector-transfected cells stained with the same antibodies); solid lines represent Podocalyxin expression. Note: all mutants were detected with an anti-Podocalyxin antibody with the exception of ΔEC, which was detected with an anti-flag antibody.</p>
