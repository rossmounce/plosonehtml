                Figure 7.  Podocalyxin's C-terminal DTHL motif is required for recruitment of NHERF-1.Projections of apical confocal images of transfected MCF-7 cells showing ectopic Podocalyxin (red), endogenous NHERF-1 (green), and DAPI (blue) labeling. Isotype control sample is Podocalyxin-transfected cells labeled with anti-Podocalyxin (red) and NHERF-1 isotype control (green) to demonstrate lack of non-specific NHERF-1 staining. White numbers represent Pearson's colocalization coefficient. Scale bar: 5 Âµm.
