Vertical slices are shown near the apical cell surface with some of the numerous additional microvilli labeled with red arrows. Scale bar: 1 µm. (B) SEM images at the apical surface of transfected MCF-7 cells with microvilli evident as thin surface projections. Scale bar: 2 µm. (C) Microvilli in six 50 µm<sup>2</sup> fields were enumerated and graphed. Averages are shown; error bars represent standard deviation. T-tests were used to show statistically significant differences between vector and Podocalyxin-transfected cells, and between wildtype Podocalyxin and ΔEC-transfected cells with p&lt;0.003 in all cases. Representative of two independent experiments.</p>
