                Figure 9.  Podocalyxin colocalizes with ezrin in a manner independent of any direct interaction with NHERF-1.(A) Vertical slices of confocal stacks demonstrate increased apical recruitment of ezrin in Podocalyxin-transfected MCF-7 cells. Green: ectopic Podocalyxin, red: endogenous ezrin, blue: nuclei (DAPI). Scale bar: 5 µm. (B) Projections of merged apical confocal images of MCF-7 cells transfected with various Podocalyxin constructs or empty vector. Green: Podocalyxin, red: ezrin (or isotype control for ezrin), blue: DAPI. White numbers represent Pearson's colocalization coefficient. Scale bar: 5 µm. (C) In vitro pull-down assays with biotinylated Podocalyxin cytoplasmic tail (PCT) peptides and GST-N'ezrin reveal a lack of interaction between a Podocalyxin peptide representing the cytoplasmic tail of the Δtail mutant (HQRF) and ezrin. Biotinylated Podocalyxin peptides bound to streptavidin-sepharose were incubated with GST-N'ezrin or GST alone, and bound recombinant proteins were detected with an anti-GST-antibody by Western blot.
