(A) Schematic experimental outline of gene transfer and differentiation of striatal neurons followed by exposure to HD model experimental toxins. HD model striatal cells were gene engineered with PA28γ, S5a. After verification of expression for the transferred genes, cells were grown in medium containing 1μg/ml of doxycyclin for 48h before toxin treatment. After 24 h incubation in the toxic environment, medium was collected for the MTS assay and cells were harvested for proteasome activity determination. (B) Semiquantitative Western blot of the huntingtin showing a slight decrease of protein levels by lenti-viral transduction of PA28γ gene into HD model striatal cells. Results are shown as percentage of levels of lenti-GFP control group (* p&lt;0.05).</p>
