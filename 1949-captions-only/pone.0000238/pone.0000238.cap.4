(A) MG132 treated control (CTRL, 26 CAG) and HD model striatal neurons (Htt, 105 CAG) transduced with PA28γ. Shown are cell viabilities after 24 hours of exposure to MG132. (B–G) The reversible proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (B, E); the mitochondrial inhibitor, 3-NP (C, F); and the excitotoxin, QA (D, G) were used at various concentrations to treat control and HD model striatal neurons. HD model striatal neurons showed significantly decreased the resistance to those neuropathological toxins compared to control striatal neurons. PA28γ significantly improved cell survival, and S5a significantly decreased cell survival after exposure to MG132 and QA, but not 3-NP, respectively (§, p&lt;0.05 between wild-type and mutant huntingtin overexpressing striatal neurons. *, p&lt;0.05 between the gene transferred groups of control protein GFP and PA28γ or S5a). The experiments were repeated three times in triplicate.</p>
