All flies were infected at their first feed, the infective bloodmeal containing 100 µM 8-Br-cGMP. Flies were maintained on blood containing either 10 mM L- or D-cysteine from the second feed. Control flies were not fed cysteine. Data presented as the mean +/− S.E.M from three experiments. (MG midgut infections; TI proportion of midgut infections maturing to salivary gland infections). Significance: ***<em>p</em>&lt;0.001; ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 versus the corresponding control values.</p>
