                Figure 1. Effect of cysteine on transmission of T. b. brucei in male and female G. m. morsitans. All flies were infected at their first feed, the infective bloodmeal containing 100 µM 8-Br-cGMP. Flies were maintained on blood containing either 10 mM L- or D-cysteine from the second feed. Control flies were not fed cysteine. Data presented as the mean +/− S.E.M from three experiments. (MG midgut infections; TI proportion of midgut infections maturing to salivary gland infections). Significance: ***p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; *p&lt;0.05 versus the corresponding control values.
