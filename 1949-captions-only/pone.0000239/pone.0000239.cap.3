                Figure 3. Effect of NAME on transmission of T.b. brucei in male and female G. m. morsitans. All flies were infected at their first feed, the infective bloodmeal containing 100 µM 8-Br-cGMP. Flies were subsequently maintained on blood containing either 5 mM L- or D-NAME. Control flies were not fed NAME. Data presented as the mean +/− S.E.M from three experiments. (MG midgut infections; TI proportion of midgut infections maturing to salivary gland infections). Significance, p values as in Figure 1.
