                Figure 4. Effect of chilling and mating on transmission of T. b. brucei in G. m. morsitans. All flies were infected with T. b. brucei, the infective bloodmeal containing 15 mM GSH. For investigation of chilling treated flies were chilled (4°C for 30 min) three days post infection, control flies were not chilled. For investigation of mating, treated flies were mated immediately post infective feed for three days. Both groups in the mating experiment were chilled to allow separation of male flies, control flies were not mated. Data presented as the mean +/− S.E.M from four experiments. (MG midgut infections; TI proportion of midgut infections maturing to salivary gland infections). p values as in Figure 1.
