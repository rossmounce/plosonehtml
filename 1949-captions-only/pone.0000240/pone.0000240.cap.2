(a) Speed and (b) accuracy gains with (♦) and without (□) interference training in the three age-groups. Interference training was given at 2 hours after the termination of the initial training session. Average performance in the initial (init) and the final (end) four blocks of the initial training session, and in four consecutive blocks at 24 hours post-training (24hr post) is shown. Bars–standard error; black arrow - significant interaction; white arrows - no interaction (significant gains in both experiments). Comparison between the three experimental groups' performance at the end of training and at 24 hours post-training in the two experiments, without and with interference (repeated measures ANOVA) showed a significant main effect for time-point for both the number of sequences (speed) and the number of errors (accuracy) (speed: <em>F</em><sub>(1,110)</sub> = 152.06, <em>P</em>&lt;.001 accuracy: <em>F</em><sub>(1,110)</sub> = 7.11, <em>P</em>&lt;.01) and for age (speed: <em>F</em><sub>(2,110)</sub> = 60.01, <em>P</em>&lt;.001 accuracy: <em>F</em><sub>(2,110)</sub> = 6.89, <em>P</em>&lt;.001). The only significant interaction (age-group×assessment time×experiment) was for performance speed (<em>F</em><sub>(2,110)</sub> = 6.82, <em>P</em>&lt;.05) with the 17-year-olds showing less improvement in the interference condition. There was no significant difference between the two experiments for the end time-point in the 17-year-olds (<em>t</em><sub>(37)</sub> = 0.81, <em>P</em> = .42). An analysis of variance for repeated measures, conducted for each age-group separately (with time-points as within-subject factor and age-group and experiment as between-subject factors), showed a significant difference in between-session gains accrued for the initially trained sequence (task A) between the two experiments only in the 17-year-olds (interaction of time-point×experiment, <em>F</em><sub>(1,37)</sub> = 10.62, <em>P</em>&lt;.001). The 9 and 12-year-olds improved to a similar degree with and without interference (no interaction of time-point×experiment, <em>F</em><sub>(1,35)</sub> = 2.89, <em>P</em> = .1; <em>F</em><sub>(1,38</sub> = 2.21, <em>P</em> = .15, 9 and 12-year-olds respectively).</p>
