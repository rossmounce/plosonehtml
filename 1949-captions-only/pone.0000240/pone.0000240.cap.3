                Figure 3. Between-session (delayed) gains with (□) and without (▪) interference training in the three age-groups. The absolute gains in terms of mean number of correct sequences at 24 hours post-training compared to the end of the training session. Bars–standard error. There was a significant interaction of condition by age-group for the mean between-session gains (F(2,110) = 6.82, P&lt;.05). Independent-samples t-tests conducted for each age group separately showed a significant advantage of the no interference over the interference condition only in the 17-year-olds (t(37) = 3.26, P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in delayed gains in the two conditions for the 9 and 12-year olds (t(35) = 1.7, P = 0.1; t(38) = 1.49, P = 0.002, 9 and 12-year-olds respectively).
