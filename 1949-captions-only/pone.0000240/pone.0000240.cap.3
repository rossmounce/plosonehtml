The absolute gains in terms of mean number of correct sequences at 24 hours post-training compared to the end of the training session. Bars–standard error. There was a significant interaction of condition by age-group for the mean between-session gains <em>(F</em><sub>(2,110)</sub> = 6.82, <em>P</em>&lt;.05). Independent-samples t-tests conducted for each age group separately showed a significant advantage of the no interference over the interference condition only in the 17-year-olds (<em>t</em><sub>(37)</sub> = 3.26, <em>P</em> = 0.02). There were no significant differences in delayed gains in the two conditions for the 9 and 12-year olds (<em>t</em><sub>(35)</sub> = 1.7, <em>P</em> = 0.1; <em>t</em><sub>(38)</sub> = 1.49, <em>P</em> = 0.002, 9 and 12-year-olds respectively).</p>
