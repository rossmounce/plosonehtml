                Figure 1. Generation and characterization of the bioluminescent N. meningitidis strain FAM20LU. (A) Chromosomal integration of a bioluminescence expression cassette into strain FAM20. The luxCDABE operon of plasmid pLKMp is flanked by the Neisseria specific porA promoter (P) and terminator (T) sequences of the gapdh gene. The kanamycin resistance gene, kanR, enables selection on agar-plates. UHS and DHS represent two sequences homologous to a non-coding region between orf73 and orf74 of the FAM20 genome. (B) The porA promoter enhances bioluminescent emission. Bioluminescence (in photon units) emitted from N. meningitidis strain FAM20 transformed with pLKMp (black line) or transformed with control vector without promoter (grey line) is plotted against bacterial counts. (C) In vivo BLI of mice challenged i.p. with 108 FAM20LU. Mice were imaged at indicated time points post-infection. In contrast to nontransgenic mice (upper panel), strong signals in the body together with focal signals in the brain were detected in CD46 transgenic mice (lower panel). Images show one representative mouse from each group.
