                Figure 2. Meningococcal disease patterns in CD46 transgenic mice after i.v. infection. (A) BLI of nontransgenic mice and CD46 transgenic mice challenged i.v. with 109 FAM20LU at 6 and 24 h post-infection. Four mice are shown from each group, out of totally 46 mice. Signals at the tail region originate from the injection site. (B) Frequency of disease patterns and bacteremia levels (mean Â± SD) in each group.
