                Figure 5. Translocation of N. meningitidis to the respiratory mucosa is dependent on PilC1. (A) Bioluminescent imaging of mice and nasal washes spread on GC-plates 24 h post infection. CD46 transgenic mice were infected i.v. with wild-type FAM20LU or the PilC1-deficient mutant FAM20ΔpilC1LU. Nontransgenic mice were challenged with FAM20LU. Bacterial counts in the nasal washes (CFU/ml) are presented. Significantly fewer PilC1 mutants were recovered compared with wild-type bacteria (P&lt;0.05). (B) Immunohistochemical detection of N. meningitidis in nasal cavity sections of CD46 transgenic mice at 24 h post-infection. Bacteria (dark brown) were detected with rabbit anti-N. meningitidis antibody followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and stained with DAB. Control sections have been treated without the first antibody (w/o 1st Ab). Scale bar: 20 µm.
