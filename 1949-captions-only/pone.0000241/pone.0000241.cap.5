(A) Bioluminescent imaging of mice and nasal washes spread on GC-plates 24 h post infection. CD46 transgenic mice were infected i.v. with wild-type FAM20<sup>LU</sup> or the PilC1-deficient mutant FAM20Δ<em>pilC1</em><sup>LU</sup>. Nontransgenic mice were challenged with FAM20<sup>LU</sup>. Bacterial counts in the nasal washes (CFU/ml) are presented. Significantly fewer PilC1 mutants were recovered compared with wild-type bacteria (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05). (B) Immunohistochemical detection of <em>N. meningitidis</em> in nasal cavity sections of CD46 transgenic mice at 24 h post-infection. Bacteria (dark brown) were detected with rabbit anti-<em>N. meningitidis</em> antibody followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and stained with DAB. Control sections have been treated without the first antibody (w/o 1st Ab). Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
