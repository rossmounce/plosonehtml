                Figure 6. In vivo virulence properties of FAM20ΔpilC1LU. (A) Survival rates of CD46 transgenic mice infected i.v. with PilC1-deficient FAM20ΔpilC1LU (grey line) or PilC-expressing FAM20LU (black line). Survival was monitored for 6 days. (B) Induction of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in serum at 0 h, 6 h and 24 h post-infection was measured by ELISA. Data are presented as mean ± SD. (C) Bacterial counts in CSF of CD46 transgenic mice at 48 h after infection with FAM20ΔpilC1LU (open bars) or FAM20LU (black bars). Data are presented as mean ± SD.
