                Figure 3.  eIF4E induction causes an increase in the recruitment of a subset of mRNAs to polysomes.A) Total and polysomal (24 fractions) RNA from induced (−tet for 5 hr) and uninduced (+tet for 5 hr) 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Primers for BI-1, survivin, MIF, L23, L34, L9, S17 and actin were used to assess mRNA levels. Amplified PCR bands from the polysomal fractions were quantified using NIH Image, and absolute values were plotted. B) The effect of eIF4E induction on L34 mRNA distribution was assessed by northern blotting. Polysomal RNA was isolated from induced (−tet for 5 hr) and uninduced (+tet for 5 hr) 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells and fractionated into 12 fractions (for purpose of detection). The RNA was loaded on an agarose denaturing gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with radiolabeled murine L34 and actin probes. Bands were quantified using NIH Image, and absolute values were plotted.
