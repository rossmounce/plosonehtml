                Figure 4.  siRNA mediated knockdown of eIF4E in NIH 3T3 cells.NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with an siRNA against murine eIF4E or with a control siRNA, 4E-T-inv (scrambled sequence of human 4E-T), for 48 hr. Cells were lysed, and protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by western blot analysis. The RNAi-mediated knockdown was repeated three times.
