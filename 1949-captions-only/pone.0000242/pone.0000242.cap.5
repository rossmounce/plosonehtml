                Figure 5.  eIF4E induction protects cells against ER-mediated apoptosis.A) 3T3 cells that stably express HA-eIF4E were treated with 5 µM ionomycin for different periods, fixed and stained with propidium iodide. The percentage of apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry (triplicates were pooled to generate the s.d.) B) 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells were seeded at 75% confluency and cultured for 8 hr. Tetracycline containing medium was then replaced by a tetracycline free medium for 16 hr to induce eIF4E expression. Uninduced cells were cultured for the same period without removal of tetracycline. Cells were treated with ionomycin and processed as described in (A). C) 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells were seeded and cultured with or without tetracycline as described in (B). Cells were then cultured for 24 hr in complete medium±5 µM ionomycin. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes, which were immunoblotted with anti–caspase 3 and anti–caspase 12. eIF4E expression was also examined by immunoblot; elevated eIF4E levels were only detected in 3T3-tTA-eIF4E induced cells (−tet).
