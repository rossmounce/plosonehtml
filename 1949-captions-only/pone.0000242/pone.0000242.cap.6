                Figure 6.  eIF4E and TOP mRNA translation.A) DNA segments encompassing the promoters and 5′ UTRs of L32, L32 mut (non-TOP), S16, S16 mut (non-TOP), L30 and β-actin were subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells were transfected with the various firefly luciferase reporters and a renilla luciferase reporter, which was used for transfection efficiency, and were cultured for 32 hr. Tetracycline containing medium was then replaced by a tetracycline free medium for 16 hr; control (non-induced) cells were cultured in parallel with tetracycline. Firefly luciferase activity (FLU) was measured and normalized against renilla luciferase activity (RLU). B) Luciferase activity of the reporters was measured in the parental cell line 3T3-tTA as described in (A). C) TOP sequences of L32, S16 and L30 are depicted. The arrows indicate the transcriptional start site. The nucleotide changes between L32 and S16 and L32 and L30 are underlined. D) Mutated reporters were generated by exchanging the TOP sequences of L32, S16 and L30. Luciferase assays were performed as described in (A). E) Luciferase activity of the reporters was measured in the parental cell line 3T3-tTA as described in (A). Assays were carried out in triplicate. Luciferase activities represent an average obtained from three independent experiments.
