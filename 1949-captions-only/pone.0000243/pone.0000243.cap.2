                Figure 2. Cytotoxic effect of 5-FU on non-sorted and sorted (uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative populations) derived from SCLC cell lines. (A) 1×104 cells (H211, H69AR, H1417) were placed in wells of a 48-well plate in triplicates and incubated for 72 hr in the presence of varying concentrations of 5-FU. (B) SCLC cell lines were FACS sorted after staining with anti-uPAR antibodies and were plated at the same seeding density (4×103/well of 96-well plate) and treated with 5-FU at 0, 10, 100, 200 µg/ml for 72 hr. Cell survival was evaluated after adding Guava ViaCount reagent and counting viable and dead cells. Only viable cells were included in data analysis, and 100% viability was defined as number of viable cells cultured in absence of 5-FU. Statistical analysis (2-way ANOVA) of uPAR(+) and uPAR(−) data sets revealed significant differences among viability of uPAR(+) and uPAR(−) cells (P = 0.0002, 0.0027, 0.0008 for H211, H69AR, H1417 cells, respectively). The data points represent averages±SD of three independent experiments.
