                Figure 5. Expression of CD44 and MDR1 on uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells. (A) FACS analysis of, H211, H69AR and H1417 SCLC cell lines double-labeled with uPAR-FITC and CD44-PE, MDR1-PE. The percentages of cells expressing CD44 and MDR1 were calculated separately for uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells. (B) Fluorescent microscopic analysis of double-labeled and FACS-sorted cells. Examples of uPAR-FITC/CD44-PE double-labeling (a,b,c) and uPAR-FITC/MDR1-PE double-labeling (d,e,f). (Bf-inset) H1417 cell line stained with mouse IgG isotype control-PE (red), isotype control-FITC (green) and DAPI (blue).
