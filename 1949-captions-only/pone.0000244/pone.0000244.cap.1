                Figure 1. During RanQ69L-mediated aster formation, MTs appear to accumulate exponentially at an initial seed MT. A. Quantification of RanQ69L-mediated MT production in meiotic Xenopus egg extract. RanQ69L was added to Xenopus extract to initiate the formation of spindle-like structures (asters). After fixation, asters were imaged by wide field microscopy at the indicated time points. The first detectable intermediates of aster formation were few individual MT bundles. Rapidly, more MTs were produced around these seed MTs. The diameter of the asters at 480 sec was 10–30 µm. B. Quantification of MT production mediated by RanQ69L. The plot shows fluorescence of the MTs at the prospective aster (with standard deviations) as a function of time. A logistic model can reproduce the initial exponential rise as well as the saturation of MT mass during aster formation. The logistic model  with solution  was fit to the experimental data of Figure 1 by minimizing  A logistic model supports autocatalytic MT production where MT production is limited by resource depletion.
