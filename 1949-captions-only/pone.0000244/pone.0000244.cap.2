                Figure 2. Taxol stabilized MT seeds strongly promote MT production and aster assembly in meiotic Xenopus egg extract. The two time series shown here were prepared as in Figure 1A but with addition of soluble Taxol (top series) or Taxol stabilized MT seeds (bottom series). Without MT seeds, the first traces of MTs were visible after ~240 sec and organized asters (of 10–30 µm diameter) were visible after ~480 sec. With MT seeds, organized asters were visible already after ~240 sec. Thus, MT seeds speed up MT production by ~240 sec. This supports a model where MTs induce the production of more MTs and that this mechanism is responsible for the assembly of MT super-structures.
