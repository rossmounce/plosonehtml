The two time series shown here were prepared as in <a href="#pone-0000244-g001">Figure 1A</a> but with addition of soluble Taxol (top series) or Taxol stabilized MT seeds (bottom series). Without MT seeds, the first traces of MTs were visible after ~240 sec and organized asters (of 10–30 µm diameter) were visible after ~480 sec. With MT seeds, organized asters were visible already after ~240 sec. Thus, MT seeds speed up MT production by ~240 sec. This supports a model where MTs induce the production of more MTs and that this mechanism is responsible for the assembly of MT super-structures.</p>
