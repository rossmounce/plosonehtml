A. MTs in a RanGTP gradient (green indicates high RanGTP concentration). Randomly positioned MTs (blue lines) disappear due to dynamic instability and new MTs are produced (red lines). Without coupling the MT production probability to the RanGTP gradient, MT patches form randomly (left panels). Without autocatalytic MT production, MTs distribute proportional to the RanGTP gradient and do not form patches (right panels). All three components can efficiently concentrate MTs in the center of the gradient (center panels). B. MT density at the centre of the gradient as a function of time with (black line) and without (dashed line) autocatalytic MT production. Without autocatalytic MT production, a constant low MT density is quickly reached, while autocatalytic MT production concentrates MTs in the center of the gradient. C. MT density after 1000 sec as a function of distance from the centre (lines as in B). Autocatalytic MT production efficiently localizes MTs to the center of the gradient.</p>
