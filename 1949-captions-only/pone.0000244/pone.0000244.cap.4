                Figure 4. Autocatalytic MT production, dynamic instability, and a RanGTP gradient render MT super-structures robust toward external perturbations. A. The MT super-structure can regenerate within a RanGTP gradient. A fully assembled MT super-structure (top) is divided in two, and one half is moved 20 Âµm to the right. As MTs disassemble due to dynamic instability, new MTs are produced preferentially in the centre of the gradient. Thereby the severed half disintegrates over time and the integrity of the MT super-structure is re-established. B. Time series of two different mechanisms to achieve autocatalytic MT production. The top series shows a nucleator (red) binding to MTs where it becomes activated and nucleates new MTs. The bottom series shows a MT severing protein (green) binding to MTs and cutting them into fragments. These fragments can grow into new MTs.
