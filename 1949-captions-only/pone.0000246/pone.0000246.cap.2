                Figure 2. Comparison of the preference for one of the three diagnostic tests between the 55 patients who received no coronary revascularization (No revascularization) and the 56 patients who underwent subsequent percutaneous or surgical revascularization (Revascularization). Response alternatives were MSCT, MRI, and Angio. The preference for MSCT was only slightly and not significantly reduced in the “Revascularization” group (71%) as compared to the “No revascularization” group (73%), while 12.5% and 11% of the patients in these two groups preferred Angio, respectively.
