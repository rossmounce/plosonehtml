Response alternatives were MSCT, MRI, and Angio. The preference for MSCT was only slightly and not significantly reduced in the “Revascularization” group (71%) as compared to the “No revascularization” group (73%), while 12.5% and 11% of the patients in these two groups preferred Angio, respectively.</p>
