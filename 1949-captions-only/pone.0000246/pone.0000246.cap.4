                Figure 4. Angio (A) and noninvasive coronary angiography using MSCT (B) and MRI (C) all demonstrate absence of significant stenoses in the right coronary artery (arrow) in a 45-year-old female patient with atypical angina pectoris. Note that MSCT due to higher spatial resolution allows better delineation of the distal segments of the right coronary artery than MRI (asterisks).
