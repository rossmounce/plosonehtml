(<em>A</em>) Left panels, Cyclin B1 and cyclin A were visualised by immunoblot and total histone H1 kinase activity by autoradiograph of phosphorylated histone H1 (P-HH1) from samples of a cycling extract taken at the indicated time points during incubation at 23Â°C. Right panels, quantisation (percent of peak value) of cyclin B (open squares; from immunoblot in the left panel), cyclin B1-bound cdk1 (filled triangles; from cdk1 immunoblot of cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates; Ips) and histone H1 kinase (filled squares; autoradiographs of histone H1 kinase assayes from cyclin B1 Ips). (<em>B, C</em>) Left panels, cyclin B (extracts proteins autoradiograph; cyclin B position is indicated) and cdk1-phospho-tyr15 (Cdk1-Y15-P), cdk1 (Cdk1), cdc25C-phospho-ser-287 (Cdc25C-S287-P), cdc25C (Cdc25C) contents (immunoblot) from samples of two independent cycling extracts, incubated in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, taken at 2 min intervals. Right panels, quantisation of total extract histone H1 kinase (filled squares) and cyclin B (open squares) from the same samples. (<em>D</em>) Upper panels, cyclin B1, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity (Cyc B1-activity; phosphorylated histone H1 autoradiograph), cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 and cdk1 contents in cyclin B1 Ips from samples of an extract, incubated in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, taken across the mitosis-interphase transition. Lower graph, quantisation, expressed as percent of peak value, of cyclin B1 content (open squares) and cyclin B1-associated kinase activity (filled squares). (E) Upper panels, cyclin A (Cyc A) and cyclin A-associated kinase activity (Cyc A-activity; phosphorylated histone H1 autoradiograph), cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 and cdk1 contents in cyclin A Ips from the samples described in <a href="#pone-0000247-g001">Fig 1D</a>. Lower graph, quantisation, expressed as percent of peak value, of cyclin A content (open triangles) and cyclin A-associated kinase activity (filled triangles). (<em>F</em>) Samples from a cycling extracts, incubated in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, were taken at 2 min intervals. Samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti cyclin B1 antibody. Left panels, cyclin B1 (Cyc B1; autoradiograph), cyclin B1-associated cdk1 (Cdk1) was visualised by immunoblotting after resolving cyclin B1 Ips by long SDS-PAGE runs and cyclin B1-associated histone H1 kinase activity (Cyc B1 activity; autoradiograph). Right, quantisation of the autoradiographs of labelled cyclin B1 (open square) and phosphorylated histone H1 (filled square). From 34 to 38 min, the fastest migrating, dephosphorylated, cdk1 form accumulated as activity reached the maximum (38 min). Subsequently (40, 42, 44, 46 min), the slower migrating, phosphorylated, cdk1 forms reappeared as activity begun declining. (<em>G</em>) Cyclin B1 (Cyc B1 Ip) and cyclin A (Cyc A Ip) Ips from samples of a cycling extract taken 2 min after the cyclin B1-cdk1 activity peak. The cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 (Cdk1-Y15-P) and cdk1 were visualised by immunoblot after resolving the Ips by long SDS-PAGE runs. Since cyclin A is about 5 fold less abundant than cyclin B1 and cyclin A degradation was already started in the samples used, cyclin A Ips were from 6 times more extract sample than for cyclin B1 Ips to have comparable amounts of cdk1 on the blot.</p>
