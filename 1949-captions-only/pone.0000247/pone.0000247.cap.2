                Figure 2. Cyclin B1 abundance and MPF activity in CSF-arrested extracts. (A) Cyclin B, cdk1-phospho-tyr15, cdk1, cdc25C-phospho-ser-287 and cdc25C contents from total extract samples of a CSF-arrested extract, pre-incubated with [35S]methionine, at the indicated time points after CaCl2 addition. (B) Left panels, cyclin B1, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity, cdk1-phospho-tyr15 and cdk1 contents in cyclin B1 Ips from CSF-arrested extract samples at the indicated time points after CaCl2 addition. Right, quantisation of cyclin B1 content (open squares), cyclin B1-associated kinase activity (filled squares) from cyclin B1 Ips.
