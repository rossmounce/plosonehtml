(<em>A</em>) Cdc25C-phospho-ser-287, cdc25C and cdk1-phospho-tyr15 contents during incubation time of a control cycling extract, treated with GST, and a portion of the same extract treated with GST-RIIβ (+GST-RIIβ) to inhibit PKA. To a portion of the GST-RIIβ-treated extract, cAMP (4 µM) was added at 40 min of incubation, to reactivate PKA, and samples taken at 45 min (-+cAMP). (<em>B</em>) Cyclin B stability during incubation time in a control extract and in portions of a GST-RIIβ-treated extract to which either roscovitine (2 µM; 1/30 extract volume), to inhibit cdk activity, or DMSO (1/30 extract volume), as control, were added.</p>
