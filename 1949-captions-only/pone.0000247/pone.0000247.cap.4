                Figure 4. MPF hampers Cdc20-APC/C interaction through Cdc20 phopshorylation. (A) Cyclin B stability after CaCl2 addition in [35S]labelled CSF-arrested extract portions treated with buffer, as control, recombinant cyclin B1-cdk1wt or cyclin B1-cdk1AF complexes. To portions of the cyclin B1-cdk1AF-treated extract, either roscovitine (2 ÂµM; 1/30 extract volume), or DMSO (1/30 extract volume) as control, were added 1 min after CaCl2. (B) Total Cdc27 and Cdc27-bound Cdc20 (IpCdc27/IbCdc20) from CSF-arrested samples treated with recombinant cyclin B1-cdk1wt and cyclin B1-cdk1AF complexes at the indicated time points after CaCl2 addition (the time 0 sample received no CaCl2). [35S]labelled Cdc20 wild type (wt) and a 7 phosphorylation sites mutant version (7A) were produced in reticulocyte lysates (lanes 1, 2). Labelled proteins were incubated with portions of a CHX-treated CSF-arrested extract for 30 min (lanes 3, 4). Cdc27 was, then, immunoprecipitated (Cdc 27 Ip) and the amount of bound wt (lane 7) and 7A (lane 8) Cdc20 detected by autoradiography. Lanes 5, 6, mock Ips (Mk Ip). (C) Portions of a [35S]labelled CSF-arrested extract were incubated for 40 min with mock (contr.), cdc20 wt or cdc20 7A programmed reticulocyte lysates in the presence of CHX. (D) The cdc20 wt- and cdc20 7A-treated portions where further incubated for 20 min with cyclin B1-cdk1AF. Then, aliquots were taken at the indicated time points after CaCl2 addition. Shown is an autoradiograph of [35S]labelled extracts proteins (the position of cyclin B is indicated). (E) Quantisation of remaining cyclin, expressed as percent, from cyclin B1-cdk1AF-treated extract portions in the presence of cdc20 wt (open squares) or cdc20 7A (filled squares). Error bars refer to variability within three independent experiments.
