                Figure 5. Wee1 and cdk1 physically interact in M-phase. (A) Histone H1 kinase activity in cdk1 Ips from samples of CSF-arrested extract (M), interphase extract (I; 40 min after CaCl2 and CHX additions) and from samples taken at the indicated time points after sea urchin ΔB (100nM) addition to an interphase extract. Left panel, phosphorylated histone H1 autoradiograph (P-HH1). Right panel, quantisation of cdk1 activity from three independent experiments. (B) Cdk1 activity, cdk1-phospho-tyr15 and cdk1 content in cdk1 Ips from extract samples taken at the indicated time points after ΔB addition. (C, D) Wee1 and cdk1 were immunoprecipitated from samples of CSF-arrested (M), interphase (I) extracts and interphase extract samples from the time of ΔB addition. Left panels, wee1 and wee1-associated cdk1 in wee1 Ips. Right, histone H1 kinase activity in cdk1 Ips. In (D) the lower part of the wee1 Ips immunoblot was first probed for cdk1-phospho-tyr15 and subsequently for cdk1. (E, F) Full-length, [35S]labelled, Xenopus cyclin B1 was added to two independent interphase extracts along with ΔB. The extracts were spilt into two portions and DMSO, as control, or roscovitine (10 µM) were added after 33 min incubation, samples were, then, taken at the indicated time points after ΔB addition. Shown are autoradiographs and quantisations of percent remaining [35S]labelled, full-length cyclin B1.
