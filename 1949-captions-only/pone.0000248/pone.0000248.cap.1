The branches of P found only in Australian Aborigines, and details of the P1 branches, are available in <a href="#pone.0000248-Friedlaender1">[17]</a>, supplementary materials. Control region mutations are in bold, those that recur in this phylogeny are underlined, those in blue are synonymous transitions, and transversions are noted with a base suffix. Asterisks denote substitutions that can be both synonymous and nonsynomous because of gene overlap (nts 8563 and 8572). These were regarded as nonsynomous. The dotted line in the tree denotes a missing control region sequence. The poly C regions in HVS1 and 2 as well as 16519 are excluded. Proveniences are listed at the top, abbreviated as follows: NG–New Guinea, TR–Trobriands, AUS–Australian Aborigine, NB-New Britain. Sample numbers, GenBank accession numbers, and sources are listed underneath. Source abbreviations are: SV–<a href="#pone.0000248-vanHolstPellekaan1">[18]</a>; TK–<a href="#pone.0000248-Kivisild1">[25]</a>; MI–<a href="#pone.0000248-Ingman1">[19]</a>; MP–<a href="#pone.0000248-Pierson1">[33]</a>.</p>
