                Figure 1.  Repression of yeast filamentous-form phenotypes by MPT5.(Aâ€“D) Diploid yeast were grown under yeast-form conditions (SCD liquid and SCD) or filamentous-form conditions (SLAD) and microscopically imaged. (E) Patches of yeast were grown on rich medium agar and subjected to a washing-off assay of adhesion.
