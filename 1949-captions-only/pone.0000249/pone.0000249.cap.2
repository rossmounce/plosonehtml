                Figure 2.  In vivo TEC1 mRNA binding by Mpt5.An immunoprecipitate of epitope-tagged Mpt5 protein was subjected to reverse transcription and gene-specific polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of bound mRNAs. Control experiments lacked either the epitope tag or reverse transcriptase.
