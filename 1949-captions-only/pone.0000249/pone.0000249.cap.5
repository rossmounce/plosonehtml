                Figure 5.  Inhibition of Kss1-dependent phosophorylation of Ste7 by MPT5.Yeast strains were grown under yeast-form conditions. Protein extracts were analyzed by western blot, with Pgk serving as a loading control. The effect of MPT5 deletion on Ste7 phosphorylation is independent of RAS2 and PHD1 (A) but depends on KSS1 (B).
