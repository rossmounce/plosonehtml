                Figure 6.  Specific inhibition of fMAPK pathway output by MPT5.(A) Diploid strains with either a minimal filamentation-MAPK-pathway output reporter (FRE-GFP) or a mating-MAPK reporter (PRE-GFP) and the indicated genotypes were grown under yeast-form conditions and subjected to flow cytofluorometry. (B) The morphology and fluorescence of MPT5+ and mpt5Î” diploid cells with FRE-GFP were imaged by transmitted light and confocal fluorescence microscopy.
