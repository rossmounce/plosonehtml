Gene expression can be modulated by direct signaling pathways which sense the environmental cues. Alternatively, it can be regulated by internal cues which are coupled directly to cell growth. In this study we characterize the relative contribution of external vs. internal sensing to the regulation of gene expression. (b,c) Expression profile of ESR modules during growth at different environmental conditions (reported in <a href="#pone.0000250-Gasch1">[25]</a>; see <a href="#pone.0000250.s004">table S1</a> for the list of genes). (b) The colormap represents the log<sub>2</sub>-expression-ratio of the respective gene module. The conditions are sorted by the average expression level of the stress module. (c) Average log<sub>2</sub>-expression-ratio of the respective gene module under the indicated condition. Stress-induced genes are activated, while ribosomal biogenesis and RP genes are repressed under conditions associated with slow growth (e.g. non-optimal temperatures, non-fermentable carbon source, or stationary phase).</p>
