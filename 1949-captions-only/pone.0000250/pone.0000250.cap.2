(a) Glucose is the preferred carbon source for wild-type yeast cells. In contrast, <em>adh1</em> mutant cells grow faster when glycerol is available (See also <a href="#pone.0000250.s001">Fig S1</a>). (b) Wild-type and mutant cells were grown to log phase on media containing glucose or glycerol as the only carbon source (<a href="#s4">Methods</a>). The expression profile on glycerol vs. glucose was quantified with microarrays. The bars represent the average log<sub>2</sub>-ratio-expression of the ESR modules. Notably, both wild type and mutant cells activate the ESR program. Stress genes are induced while ribosomal biogenesis genes and RP are repressed. (c) Response of <em>adh1</em> mutants to change in carbon source. Overnight cultures of <em>adh1</em> cells were transferred both to glycerol and to fresh glucose media. The bars represent the average expression after 30 minutes with respect to the initial cell culture expression (log<sub>2</sub>-ratios). As expected, the ESR is repressed upon transfer to fresh glucose medium. However, upon transfer to glycerol, the favorable carbon source of these mutant cells, the ESR is activated. Specifically, stress genes are induced while ribosomal biogenesis and RP genes are repressed. (d) Wild-type and <em>adh1</em> mutant cells were monitored upon transfer to glycerol versus their transfer to fresh glucose. As previously reported, the size of slow growing wild type cells (glycerol) is smaller than fast growing ones (glucose) <a href="#pone.0000250-Jorgensen2">[26]</a>. Interestingly, <em>adh1</em> mutants display an opposite behavior. Specifically, slow growing <em>adh1</em> mutants (glucose) are appreciably larger than the fast growing ones (glycerol). Thus, it appears that the cell size may also be tuned to the environmental signals rather than to cell division.</p>
