(a) Steady state growing cells were subjected to different environmental stresses. Growth rate was calculated from the measured optical density. Simultaneously, the profile of gene expression was quantified with microarrays. In our study we looked for possible correlations between growth and gene expression (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> for more details). (b) Cells grown at steady state in a glucose-limited chemostat were subjected to 5 different environmental cues. We examined 4 stress pulses: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.6mM-magenta curve), DTT (6mM-blue curve), NaCl (0.4M-green curve), heat shock (39Â°C for 5 hours-black curve), and a stress-relieving pulse of glucose (0.2 g/l-red curve). The Y-axis is normalized such that the steady state O.D. (at t&lt;0) is 1. The markers designate O.D. sampling time, and solid lines are spline interpolations of the data. The perturbations in histidine-limited chemostat are shown in <a href="#pone.0000250.s002">figure S2</a>. (c) Dynamics of the average log<sub>2</sub>-ratio-expression for three ESR gene modules. The DTT, NaCl and heat shock pulses were given during glucose depletion, and the clotrimazole perturbation was given in histidine limitation. Bars designate the cells growth rate, which is normalized relative to the steady state growth rate (see <a href="#pone.0000250.s003">Fig. S3</a> for other perturbations dynamics). (d) Each gene was assigned a growth correlation score (GCR), quantifying the correlation between its expression level and growth rate, averaged over all perturbations (<a href="#s4">Methods</a>). The GCR distribution of several gene modules is shown. The X-axis represents the calculated average correlation, and Y-axis represents the fraction of genes within the module. The two vertical lines designate the threshold for the 5% of genes with the highest or lowest GCR. Notably, the distribution for the ribosomal biogenesis genes lies between the thresholds, while the cell-cycle G2-M gene group is enriched with positive GCR genes.</p>
