The table summarizes the analysis which spanned over hundreds of gene modules. For each gene group and experiment we calculated the enrichment with the positive (blue) and negative (red) correlated genes. Note that none of the gene modules were enriched with both positive and negative correlated genes and only the highest score is displayed. Less significant enrichments are shown in black (P-value&gt;10<sup>âˆ’3</sup>) (see also <a href="#pone.0000250.s006">Tables S3</a>).</p>
