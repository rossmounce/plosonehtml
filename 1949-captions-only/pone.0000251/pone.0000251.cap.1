(a) The result of simulating the layout of the RGC mosaic of ON-center (red) and OFF-center (blue) ganglion cells using the method of Eglen et al (2005). The simulation captures the property that ON/OFF cell pairs lying in close proximity of one another. (b) Conditional density of ON-center cells given that one ON-center cell is located at the center of the image. The shape of the conditional density illustrates that there is a disk of low density surrounding the cell, followed by a rim of high density and then decaying back to the average level. This is the behavior expected from a quasiregular distribution of cell bodies. (b) The conditional density of OFF-center cells given that one ON-center cell is located at the center of the image. The density is flat except for the fact that it dips at the center, indicating that cells bodies cannot overlap.</p>
