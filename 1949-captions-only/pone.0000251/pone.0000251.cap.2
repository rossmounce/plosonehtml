                Figure 2. Orientation maps and simple cell receptive fields generated by the model. The orientation map and representative receptive fields at three locations on the map are shown. Receptive fields are represented in a pseudo-color map such that ON-subregions appear in red and OFF-subregions appear in blue. The horizontal scale bar represents 1mm of cortex.
