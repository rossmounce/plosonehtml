(a) Local distortions in the retinotopy are linked to the local RGC density. The diagram illustrates the location of the RGCs in one patch retina along with the locations in visual space of the centers of cortical RFs whose cell bodies lie on a perfectly square grid on the cortex. All regions bounded by adjacent vertical and horizontal contours map to the same square on the cortical grid. Thus, large regions correspond to locations of low magnification factors and small regions correspond to locations of high magnification factors. (b) The distribution of the Jacobian is such that it sprinkled with discrete regions of local maxima. These regions of rapid change in the cortical RF locations correspond to areas of low densities in the RGC mosaics (both ON and OFF cells are shown by the white dots). (c) The figure shows a scatter-plot of (<em>ρ<sub>ON</sub>, ρ<sub>OFF</sub></em>) while indicating in red those locations with the highest 10% (in red) and the lowest 10% (in blue) values of the Jacobian.</p>
