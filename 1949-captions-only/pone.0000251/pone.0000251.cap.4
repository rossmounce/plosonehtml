(a) A example of an orientation map along with contours bounding the locations with the top 10% values of the Jacobian. There appears to be a tendency for these regions to fall near pinwheels or fractures. (b) Distribution of the orientation structure index (where linear zones attain a value of one, and pinwheels/fractures a value near zero), for regions with high and low Jacobian values.</p>
