(a) Example of an orientation map generated by the model along with regions of high (white contours) and low (dark contours) selectivity. It is apparent that there is a tendency for the white contours to lie in linear regions, while dark contours tend ot lie close to pinwheels or fractures. (b) Scatter-plot between the map structure index and the orientation selectivity index across a simulated piece of cortex. Regions in the map with rapid orientation change tend to have low orientation selectivity. (c) Dependence of orientation selectivity as a function of the local density of ON-center and OFF-center cells. Well tuned cells lie in regions where the densities are both high, as these are regions that will tend to generate RF with two or more subregions. Locations where only one class of cell dominates will tend to generate RFs with one dominant subregion and be broadly tuned for orientation.</p>
