                Figure 6. Spatial frequency maps and their relation to selectivity for orientation. (a) Spatial frequency map with regions of high (white contours) and low (dark contours) orientation selectivity superimposed. Regions that are well tuned for orientation tend to have higher spatial frequency preference. (b) Scatter-plot showing a positive correlation of orientation selectivity and spatial frequency preference. (c) Dependence of spatial frequency preference as a function of the local density of ON-center and OFF-center cells.
