(a) Example of an orientation map along with areas of high (white contours) and low (dark contours) spatial frequency selectivity. There appears to be a tendency for both high and low spatial frequency domains to align with pinwheels. (b). Plotting the absolute deviation of the local spatial frequency from the mean across the population as a function the local map structure confirms that regions with low map structure indices, corresponding to pinwheels/fractures, tend to be associated with an extreme (either low/high) spatial frequency location (the opposite is not always true).</p>
