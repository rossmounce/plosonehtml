                Figure 8. Cytochrome oxidase blobs. (a) The distribution of a metabolic activity index from the RFs generated by the model shows a clustering of cells with broad selectivity generating a blob-like pattern. (b) Regions of high metabolic activity (putative location of the CO blobs), as expected, tend to align with regions of low spatial frequency preference. (c) An example of an orientation map along with regions of high (white contours) and low (dark contours) metabolic activity. There appears to be no obvious relationship between the two. (d) A closer examination by plotting the metabolic activity index versus the orientation map structure index shows that regions of rapid orientation change (pinwheels/fractures) tend to align with regions of low metabolic activity, consistent with the experimental finding of Shoham et al (1997).
