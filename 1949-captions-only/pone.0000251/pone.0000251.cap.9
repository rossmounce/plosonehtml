(a) The relative density of left/right eyes at a scale relevant for the formation of receptive fields shows large fluctuations, in the order of 60%, which could seed the formation of ocular dominance columns despite an early contralateral dominance. (b) When anisotropy in the retinotopy map is simulated, the result is a relative density having a banding pattern similar to that observed in some primates.</p>
