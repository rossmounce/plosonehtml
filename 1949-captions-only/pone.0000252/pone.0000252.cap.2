                Figure 2. Pafah1b2 and Pafah1b3 interact specifically with the NPxY motif of VLDLR. (A) Diagram of the VLDLR expression constructs used in this study. TM = transmembrane region. CT = cytoplasmic tail. (B) The NPxY motif is required for VLDLR binding to Pafah1b3. Pafah1b3-MYC was co-expressed in 293T cells with the indicated GFP-tagged VLDLR constructs. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibodies and the blot was probed with GFP antibodies to detect VLDLR receptors (upper panel). Only full-length VLDLR and the NPxY-containingVLDLR?855 co-precipitated with Pafah1b3. WCLs were probed with GFP (middle panels) or Myc (lower panels) antibodies to ensure that similar amounts of VLDLR or Pafah1b3 proteins were present in each sample. (C) The NPxY motif is required for VLDLR binding to Pafah1b2. FLAG-Pafah1b2 was co-expressed in 293T cells with GFP-tagged VLDLR constructs and immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies. Blots were probed with GFP antibodies to detect VLDLR proteins in the IP (upper panel) or WCLs (middle panel), or FLAG antibodies to detect Pafah1b2 in the WCLs (lower panel). Only full-length VLDLR and VLDLR?855 co-precipitated with Pafah1b2. IP, immunoprecipitate; WCL, whole cell lysate.
