                Figure 4. Pafah1b α subunits compete with each other and with Dab1 for binding to VLDLR. (A) Pafah1b α subunits compete for VLDLR binding. Proteins were expressed in vitro using a cell-free-system (TNT) and radiolabeled with 35S (lanes 1–3). Equal amounts (50 μl) of VLDLR and Pafah1b3 were incubated with increasing amounts of Pafah1b2, as indicated. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against VLDLR (lanes 5–9) or a control antibody (lane 4) and detected by autoradiography. The plot represents the mean ratio of co-precipitated Pafah1b3 and Pafah1b2 normalized to the amount of precipitated VLDLR in each sample. Increasing amounts of Pafah1b2 reduced the amount of co-precipitated Pafah1b3. (B) Proteins were expressed in vitro (TNT) and radiolabeled with 35S (lanes 1–3). Equal amounts (50 μl) of VLDLR and Dab1 were incubated with increasing amounts of Pafah1b3, as indicated. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against VLDLR (lanes 5–9) or a control antibody (lane 4) and detected by autoradiography. The plot represents the mean ratio of co-precipitated Pafah1b3 and Dab1 normalized to the amount of precipitated VLDLR in each sample. Increasing amounts of Pafah1b3 reduced the amount of co-precipitated Dab1. Bars represent the standard error of the mean from triplicate experiments. IP, immunoprecipitate.
