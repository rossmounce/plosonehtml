Sagittal sections of the neocortex were obtained from adult mice of the indicated genotype. Adjacent sections were stained with cresyl violet (CV) (a-f) or subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies against calbindin to label cells in layers II–III (g-l), or Foxp2 to label cells in layer VI (s-x). Histograms represent the radial distribution of cells positive for calbindin (m-r) or Foxp2 (y-dd) from the bottom of the cortical plate (set as 0) to the pial surface (set as 100). <em>Pafah1b1<sup>+/−</sup></em> and <em>Vldlr <sup>−/−</sup></em> single or double mutants presented no obvious cortical layering defects. <em>Apoer2 <sup>−/−</sup></em> single mutants exhibited some laminar dispersion of upper layer neurons. In contrast, <em>Pafah1b1 <sup>+/−</sup>;Apoer2 <sup>−/−</sup></em> double mutants displayed a marked inversions of upper and lower layers (<em>reeler</em>-like phenotype) comparable to that seen in <em>Apoer2 <sup>−/−</sup>;Vldlr <sup>−/−</sup></em> mice. Scale bars = 500 µm.</p>
