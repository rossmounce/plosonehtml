                Figure 5. reeler-like disruption of cortical layers in Pafah1b1 +/− mice lacking ApoER2 but not VLDLR. Sagittal sections of the neocortex were obtained from adult mice of the indicated genotype. Adjacent sections were stained with cresyl violet (CV) (a-f) or subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies against calbindin to label cells in layers II–III (g-l), or Foxp2 to label cells in layer VI (s-x). Histograms represent the radial distribution of cells positive for calbindin (m-r) or Foxp2 (y-dd) from the bottom of the cortical plate (set as 0) to the pial surface (set as 100). Pafah1b1+/− and Vldlr −/− single or double mutants presented no obvious cortical layering defects. Apoer2 −/− single mutants exhibited some laminar dispersion of upper layer neurons. In contrast, Pafah1b1 +/−;Apoer2 −/− double mutants displayed a marked inversions of upper and lower layers (reeler-like phenotype) comparable to that seen in Apoer2 −/−;Vldlr −/− mice. Scale bars = 500 µm.
