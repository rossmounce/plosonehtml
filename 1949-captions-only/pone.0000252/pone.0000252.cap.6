                Figure 6. reeler-like disruption of hippocampal layers in Pafah1b1 +/−;Apoer2−/− double mutants. Comparable sagittal sections of the hippocampus obtained from adult mice of the indicated genotype were stained with cresyl violet. The hippocampus proper (HP) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of Apoer2+/− mice are normal, whereas a splitting of the pyramidal layers is evident in Pafah1b1+/− and in Apoer2−/− mice. Severe dyslamination of cellular layers is seen in double Pafah1b1+/−;Apoer2−/− (reeler-like). Scale bar = 500 µm.
