                Figure 7. Reelin induces Dab1 and Akt phosphorylation in Pafah1b1 +/−;Apoer2−/− double mutant neurons. Cortical neurons were cultured from mutant mice of the indicated genotype, and incubated with either control or Reelin-containing medium for 20 min. Lysates were analyzed by Western blot using the 4G10 antibody to detect Dab1 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and a phospho-Akt antibody to detect Akt phosphorylation on serine 473. Blots were reprobed with antibodies against total Dab1 and Akt to ensure that similar amount of proteins were present in each sample, and with antibodies against VLDLR and ApoER2 to confirm the genotype of the mutants.
