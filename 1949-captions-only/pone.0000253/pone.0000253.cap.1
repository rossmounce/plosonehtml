                Figure 1. Over-expression of B52 under the control of the ey-Gal4 transgene impairs eye development. (A) Scanning electron microscope images of wild-type flies (a, e) and UAS-B52/+; ey-gal4/+flies (ey&gt;B52) (b–d, f and g). Photographs were taken at 140× (a–d) and 900× (e–g). (B) ey&gt;B52 flies display variable eye phenotypes ranging from small reductions to absence of the eye (a–d).
