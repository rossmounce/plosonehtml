(A) Genomic organization of the <em>D. melanogaster eyeless</em> gene. Alternative inclusion of exon 2 (left panel, black box) generates the Ey(2a) isoform that contains 60 additional amino acids (right panel, black box) upstream from the paired domain (right panel, grey box) compared to the canonical Ey isoform. The homeodomain is shown as the hatched box. (B) Sequence comparison of the first 150 amino acids of the Ey(2a) isoform in four <em>Drosophila</em> species. <em>D. melanogaster</em> exon 2 sequence was used to blast the first intron of the ey gene in the three other species. Predicted protein sequences were deduced from the following genomic scaffolds: AE003843 (<em>D. melanogaster</em>), AAPP01017013 (<em>D. ananassae</em>), CH475402 (<em>D. pseudoobscura</em>), CH940665 (<em>D. virilis</em>). The protein sequences derived from exon 2 are between the brackets. (C) <em>eyeless</em> exon 2 is alternatively spliced in <em>D. virilis</em> and <em>D. melanogaster</em>. RT-PCR with primers in exon 1 and 3 of <em>ey</em> was performed on total RNA from <em>D. virilis</em> (lane 1) and <em>D. melanogaster</em> (lane 2) larvae. (D) <em>ey</em> alternative splicing during <em>D. melanogaster</em> development. RT-PCR with primers in exon 1 and 3 of <em>ey</em> was perfomed on total RNA from <em>D. melanogaster</em> at various developmental stages and in different tissues of third instar larvae.</p>
