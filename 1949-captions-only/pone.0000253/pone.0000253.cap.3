(A) RT-PCR analysis of <em>eyeless</em> expression in wild type (lane 1) and ey&gt;B52 (lane 2) eye imaginal discs at the third instar larval stage. RT-PCR was performed with primers specific for each isoform. (B) RT-PCR analysis of <em>ey</em> exon 2 inclusion in wild-type (lane 1) and <em>B52<sup>s2249</sup></em> mutant (lane 2) second instar larvae. The right panel corresponds to quantitation of <em>ey</em> exon 2 splicing in <em>B52<sup>s2249</sup></em> normalized to wild-type (WT). RT-PCR was performed in triplicates with primers specific for <em>ey</em> isoform (exon 1â€“3), <em>ey(2a)</em> isoform (exon 2), or both (exon 9); and expression was normalized to the RP49 level. The expression level in WT was arbitrary set up to 1. Quantitation with primers specific for <em>ey</em> exon 9 showed that the global level of eyeless expression does not change in <em>B52<sup>s2249</sup></em> mutant background. (C) SL2 cells were treated with dsRNA against dASF (lane 1) or B52 (lane 2) or untreated (lane 3), and analyzed by RT-PCR (top panel) or western blotting (bottom panel). (D) Cross-linking of exon 2 sequences to B52. Radiolabelled probes corresponding to contiguous sequences of exon 2, named a, b and c were incubated in Kc nuclear extracts and exposed to UV light. A high affinity binding site for B52 (BBS) was used as a positive control. Autoradiography of the SDS-PAGE (left panel) shows that probes a (lane 1) and b (lane 2), as well as BBS (lane 4), predominantly cross-link a 52 kDa protein. Cross-linking of BBS to 52 kDa protein was efficiently competed by increasing amounts of unlabelled probes a (right panel; lanes 6 and 7) and b (lanes 8 and 9) but not c (lanes 10 and 11). (E) RNA probes a (lane 1), b (lane 2), c (lane 3) and BBS (lane 5) were covalently bound to beads and incubated with Kc nuclear extract. After washing, beads were loaded on an SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with anti-dASF (panel dASF) and anti-B52 sera (panel B52). Beads alone (lane 4) and Kc nuclear extract alone(lane 6) were run as controls.</p>
