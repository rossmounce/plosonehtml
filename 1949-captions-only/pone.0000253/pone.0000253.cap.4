(A) Representative eye phenotypes obtained after expression of Ey (panel b) or Ey(2a) (panel c) isoforms under the control of ey-Gal4, compared to wild-type flies (panel a). Ey isoform expression induces strong disorganization of the ommatidia lattice (compare panels e and d). Ommatidia appear of variable size with possible fusion between them, as observed in (panel h). ey&gt;Ey flies often display local overgrowth in the eyes (arrowhead in panel b). Expression of the Ey(2a) isoform only reduces the size of the eye (panels c and f) with moderate disorganization of the omatidia lattice (panel i). (B) Expression of Ey (panel a) and Ey(2a) (panel b) isoforms under the control of <em>MS1096</em>. (C) Ectopic expression of Ey and Ey(2a) in the wing induces expression of downstream target genes at different levels. RT-PCR analyses were performed to measure the expression of <em>eyeless</em> (panel ey), the ribobosomal <em>Rp49</em> (panel rp49), <em>Sine oculis</em> (panel so), <em>eyes absent</em> (panel eya), <em>shifted</em> (panel shf) and <em>Optix</em> (panel opx) mRNAs in wing discs from wild type (lane 1) MS1096&gt;Ey (lane 2) and MS1096&gt;Ey(2a) (lane 3) third instar larvae.</p>
