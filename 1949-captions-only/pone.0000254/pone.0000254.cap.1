                Figure 1.  Chimeric mRNA revealing chromsome interaction.Schematic representation of regions of two chromosomes, represented by red and blue thick lines, with accompanying mRNA transcripts in corresponding colors, represented by wavy lines, transcription factories and RNA polymerases. When chromosomes are not in proximity, mRNAs are less likely to interact (A), whereas proximal chromosomes generate a chimeric mRNA, revealing interchromosomal interaction (B).
