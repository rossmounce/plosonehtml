The size of each square is proportional to the number of times a fusion event is observed between chromosomes <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>, for <em>i</em>,<em>j</em>Є1,2,…,22,<em>X</em>,<em>Y</em>. The barplots represent known gene densities on each chromosome, according to Ensembl gene counts for all chromosomes.</p>
