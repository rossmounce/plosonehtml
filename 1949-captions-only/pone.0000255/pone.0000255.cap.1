                Figure 1. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Fraction of samples with copy number &gt;2.8 (red bars above baseline), copy number &lt;1.2 (grey bars below baseline), and LOH (blue bars below baseline). SNPs are mapped according to their chromosomal position, from chromosome 1 on the left to chromosome X on the right. (Copy number alterations for chromosome X in samples derived from males were counted if copy number was &gt;1.4 or &lt;0.6.)
