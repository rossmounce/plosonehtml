SNP array analysis of neuroblastoma tumor samples and matched constitutional DNA showing LOH on the left and copy number on the right of the chromosome 11 ideogram. For each sample, chromosome 11 is depicted as a vertical bar in both the LOH and copy number panels. Blue areas represent regions of LOH, while yellow denotes retention of heterozygosity. Copy number is marked by shades of red, with ≤1 copy in light red and ≥3 copies in dark red (see scale at the bottom of the panel). Both chromosome 11q and 11p LOH, as well as gain of 11p, are shown.</p>
