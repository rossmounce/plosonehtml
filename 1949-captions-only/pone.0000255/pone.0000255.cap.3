Global view of common areas of LOH (left) and copy number change (right) in 22 primary neuroblastomas. Each sample is depicted as a series of vertical bars in both the LOH and copy number panels. Blue areas represent regions of LOH, while yellow denotes retention of heterozygosity. Copy number is marked by shades of red, with ≤1 copy in light red and ≥3 copies in dark red (see scale at the bottom of the panel).</p>
