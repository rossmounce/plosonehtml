SNP array analysis of neuroblastoma tumor samples and matched constitutional DNA showing LOH on the left and copy number on the right of the chromosome 17 ideogram. For each sample, chromosome 17 is depicted as a vertical bar in both the LOH and copy number panels. Blue areas represent regions of LOH, while yellow denotes retention of heterozygosity. Copy number is marked by shades of red, with ≤1 copy in light red and ≥3 copies in dark red (see scale at the bottom of the panel). This figure depicts copy number gain of chromosome 17q in 21 out of 22 samples.</p>
