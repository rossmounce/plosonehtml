(A) SNP copy number analysis of a portion of chromosome arm 2p demonstrating amplification (represented by the darker red SNPs) at the <em>MYCN</em> gene locus (2p24.3) in three tumor samples and at the <em>ALK</em> gene locus (2p23.2) in one sample. (B) Individual SNP copy number assessment of the SNPs surrounding the <em>ALK</em> locus. The blue curve in the graph on the right indicates the degree of amplification of each SNP from 0 on the left to 40 on the right. The red vertical line indicates a copy number of 2. (C) FISH of neuroblastoma with the <em>MYCN</em> probe showing multiple copies of <em>MYCN</em> (left panel), and FISH of the same tumor using the <em>ALK</em> break apart probe showing amplification of <em>ALK</em> (right panel).</p>
