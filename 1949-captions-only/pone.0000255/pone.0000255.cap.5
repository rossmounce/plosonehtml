                Figure 5. Amplifications on chromosome 2p. (A) SNP copy number analysis of a portion of chromosome arm 2p demonstrating amplification (represented by the darker red SNPs) at the MYCN gene locus (2p24.3) in three tumor samples and at the ALK gene locus (2p23.2) in one sample. (B) Individual SNP copy number assessment of the SNPs surrounding the ALK locus. The blue curve in the graph on the right indicates the degree of amplification of each SNP from 0 on the left to 40 on the right. The red vertical line indicates a copy number of 2. (C) FISH of neuroblastoma with the MYCN probe showing multiple copies of MYCN (left panel), and FISH of the same tumor using the ALK break apart probe showing amplification of ALK (right panel).
