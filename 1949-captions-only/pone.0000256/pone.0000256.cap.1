                Figure 1. Stimuli for adaptation (a) and test (b) phases of the main experiment. When the observer indicates that the two blank areas have faded from view, the adapting stimulus is replaced for 100 ms with the test stimulus. The observer's task is to decide which of the two test patches (left or right) has the higher contrast. When one of the tests has zero contrast, the task is one of simple detection. Otherwise, it is contrast discrimination.
