                Figure 3. Left panel: The dipper function for MJM at three different levels of adapting contrast (diamonds, squares and circles for adapting contrast 0, 0.3 and 1.0 respectively). Horizontal axis: pedestal contrast; vertical axis, performance threshold. Middle panel: effects of different levels of adapting contrast (horizontal axis) on thresholds at two levels of pedestal contrast (squares and circles). Right panel: Effects of pedestal contrast on contrast discrimination for a 2 cpd/4 Hz drifting Gabor pattern, in the presence (circles) and absence (boxes) of superimposed dynamic noise masks (as in Fig 1b).
