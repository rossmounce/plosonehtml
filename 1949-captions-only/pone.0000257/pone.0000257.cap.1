Real-time PCR analysis of sialoadhesin mRNA levels in PBMCs derived from five sets of patients with or without HIV-1 infection at different stages of disease. Patients with AIDS but not AIDS-KS, and patients with AIDS-KS were analysed separately. Levels were significantly different (p≤0.0005) between uninfected controls/HHV-8 infected patients, and HIV-1 infected patients, respectively. Levels were also significantly different (p≤0.0005) between HIV-1 infected patients and AIDS patients. Significant differences are indicated with an asterisk. No significant differences were found between patient groups not infected with HIV-1 (p = 0.1), or between AIDS and AIDS-KS patients (p = 0.14). B. Real-time PCR analysis of HIV-1 mRNA levels in PBMCs derived from either HIV-1 infected asymptomatic patients or patients with AIDS (including AIDS-KS). The elevated HIV-1 load in AIDS patients compared to asymptomatic HIV-1<sup>+</sup> patients is highly significant (p≤0.0001). C. Real-time PCR analysis of sialoadhesin mRNA levels in PBMCs obtained from eight patients before and after HIV-1 seroconversion. Sialoadhesin mRNA was analysed in the first HIV-1 seropositive sample of each patient, which is within three months from the real seroconversion event in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS, as samples are taken on a three-monthly basis.</p>
