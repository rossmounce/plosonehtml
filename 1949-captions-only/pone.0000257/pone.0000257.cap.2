Sialoadhesin (CD169) expression on CD14<sup>+</sup> cells from a healthy human control (left) and an HIV-1 infected patient (right). The mean fluorescent intensity of CD169 from the CD14<sup>+</sup> cells increases from 26 in the control cells (left) to 286 in the cells from the HIV-1 infected patient (right). B. CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells were gated and their expression of sialoadhesin is shown in the histograms. The mean fluorescent intensity of CD169 from the CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells increases from 17 in the control cells (left) to 158 in the cells from the HIV-1 infected patient (right). The data are representative of three experiments.</p>
