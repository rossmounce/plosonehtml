                Figure 2.  Expression of CD14, CD16, and sialoadhesin on monocytes from an HIV-1 infected and uninfected patient.A. Sialoadhesin (CD169) expression on CD14+ cells from a healthy human control (left) and an HIV-1 infected patient (right). The mean fluorescent intensity of CD169 from the CD14+ cells increases from 26 in the control cells (left) to 286 in the cells from the HIV-1 infected patient (right). B. CD14+CD16+ cells were gated and their expression of sialoadhesin is shown in the histograms. The mean fluorescent intensity of CD169 from the CD14+CD16+ cells increases from 17 in the control cells (left) to 158 in the cells from the HIV-1 infected patient (right). The data are representative of three experiments.
