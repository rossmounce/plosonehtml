                Figure 2. Trail temperatures exceed the critical thermal maximum for leaf-cutter ants for several hours per day. These data were recorded by an iButton Thermochron (Dallas Semiconductors) that was placed in full sun on the surface of an active trail. Data were collected during the week preceding our study (19â€“22 March 2006); this same trail should be even hotter during the middle of summer.
