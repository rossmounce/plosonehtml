                Figure 3. A) Ants from urban colonies (black lines) tolerated extreme heat (42Â°C) for longer than did ants from rural colonies (grey lines). Each line represents the survivorship curve of ants from a single colony. B) Ants from urban and rural colonies recovered from chill coma within a similar period of time. Each line represents the recovery curve of ants from a single colony.
