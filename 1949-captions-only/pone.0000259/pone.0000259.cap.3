                Figure 3.  Differential responses to actively and passively learned melodies.Increased BOLD effect in response to the actively learned melodies compared with the passively learned melodies was located in the left anterior insula, extending to the deep fronto-opercular cortex (p&lt;0.005, k&gt;100, Z-score&gt;3.0, slices are at x = âˆ’39 and y = 9).
