Activation likelihood estimates (ALEs, see <a href="#s2">Methods</a> section for further details) are color coded. The highest likelihood for hand movement-related activation was in a region from approx. Y = 0 to Y = 20 and from Z = −10 to Z = 10. The peak locations of the present study are indicated by white discs; numbers refer to the rows of <a href="#pone-0000259-t001">Tab. 1</a>. Peak 2 was located in the region with high ALE. The dashed line indicates the approximate outline of the left insula.</p>
