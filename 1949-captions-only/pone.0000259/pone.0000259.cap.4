                Figure 4.  Relation of response peaks to the insular cortex sensorimotor hand area.The likely position of the hand area of the insular cortex was determined by a meta-analysis or previous fMRI studies [16]–[35]. Activation likelihood estimates (ALEs, see Methods section for further details) are color coded. The highest likelihood for hand movement-related activation was in a region from approx. Y = 0 to Y = 20 and from Z = −10 to Z = 10. The peak locations of the present study are indicated by white discs; numbers refer to the rows of Tab. 1. Peak 2 was located in the region with high ALE. The dashed line indicates the approximate outline of the left insula.
