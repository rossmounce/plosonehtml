                Figure 2. Immunohistological analysis of dormant tumors in PPARα KO mice. The dormant tumors contain viable and proliferating cells, and show decreased microvessel (PECAM1) and increased leukocyte (CD45) staining. (A) Dormant PPARα(−/−)MEF/RS tumors in PPARα KO mice from day 60 post-tumor implantation revealed abundant SV40 large T-antigen staining and proliferation (Ki-67). Dormant PPARα(−/−)MEF/RS tumors on day 60 were implanted as pieces (1 mm3) into PPARα WT and KO mice (3 mice in each group). (B) Immunohistochemical analysis of subcutaneous B16-F10/GFP tumors (H&amp;E, CD45/brown color, PECAM-1/brown color) from day 30 post-implantation in PPARα WT mice and KO mice. Scale bars, 100 µm.
