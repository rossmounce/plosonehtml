(A) FGF-2 (20 ng) stimulates corneal neovascularization in WT 129S4/SvJae strain, WT 129S1/SvIMJ strain and obese WT (129S1/SvJae) mice. Soluble murine VEGFR1 completely inhibits FGF2-induced angiogenesis in WT mouse (sVEGFR1). FGF2-induced corneal neovascularization is potently suppressed in PPARα KO mouse (KOS4). Vessel length, clock hours, and area of neovascularization in PPARα WT and KO mice are represented in bar graphs (average±standard deviation). (B) Evans blue dye leakage in dorsal skin and ears after injection with VEGF or saline in PPARα WT and KO mice (n = 6 mice/group). Spectrophotometric analysis of extravasated Evans blue of skin and ear is represented in bar graph (average±standard deviation).</p>
