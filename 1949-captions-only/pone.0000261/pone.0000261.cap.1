                Figure 1. Species that winter in Eurasia, but that breed across the Holarctic (including North America). The top 2 panels present examples of single species (Phylloscopus borealis, Charadrius hiaticula; green = breeding distribution, blue = wintering distribution), whereas the lower 2 panels show species richness patterns of this set of species (see Appendix S1) in winter (white = 0, darkest shade = 8 species) and in the breeding season (white = 0, darkest shade = 11 species), with color ramp indicating number of species.
