                Figure 2. Species that breed across both hemispheres in the Holarctic, but winter at least in part in the Americas; one species (Larus ridibundus) ranges considerably farther south in Russia, extending to areas that have indeed seen HP-H5N1 outbreaks; these species winter in diverse parts of the Americas, but are focused along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf coastlines of North America. The top 2 panels present examples of single species (Limnodromus scolopaceus, Larus ridibundus), whereas the lower 2 panels show species richness patterns of this set of species (see Appendix S1) in winter and in the breeding season, with color ramp indicating number of species (white = 0, darkest shade = 5 species).
