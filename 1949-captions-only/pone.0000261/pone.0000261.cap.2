The top 2 panels present examples of single species (Limnodromus scolopaceus, Larus ridibundus), whereas the lower 2 panels show species richness patterns of this set of species (see <a href="#pone.0000261.s001">Appendix S1</a>) in winter and in the breeding season, with color ramp indicating number of species (white = 0, darkest shade = 5 species).</p>
