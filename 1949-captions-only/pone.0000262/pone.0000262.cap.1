                Figure 1. An example of divergently oriented inverted repeat. A. Schematic representation of the inverted repeat structure of the C. elegans F44E5.4 - F44E5.5 genomic region, CBG13233 - CBG13234 genomic region in C. briggsae and Contig35.Fgenesh-Celegans.59.final (Contig35-1) - Contig35.eannot.383.final.final (Contig35-2) region in C. remanei. B. Sequence comparison was carried out between sequence 1 and sequence 2 for each row. Sequence identity within each species (intraspecies) in a global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) is shown in the last column of the table. C. Sequence identity between species (interspecies) is shown in the last column of the table. Sequence identity within a species is much higher than the sequence identity between species. CE: C. elegans; CB: C. briggsae; CR: C. remanei; IGR: intergenic region. * indicates that sequence identity could be higher than 88.5% because Contig35-2 has a stretch of Ns (10) which is estimated length of the sequencing gap.
