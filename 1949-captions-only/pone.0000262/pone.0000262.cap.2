A. Schematic representation of the inverted repeat structure of <em>C. elegans</em> T27E4.3 - T27E4.9 genomic region as well as <em>C. briggsae</em> and <em>C. remanei</em> orthologous genomic region. In <em>C. elegans</em>, the region of T27E4.8, IGR-1, T27E4.3 and IGR-L is a perfect mirror image of the region of T27E4.2, IGR-2, T27E4.9 and IGR-R. In <em>C. remanei</em>, Contig904-snap.9.final (Contig904-1), Contig904-eannot.018.final.final (Contig904-2), Contig904.eannot.1017.final.final (Contig904-3) and Contig904.snap.4.final (Contig904-4) have similar inverted repeat structure. In <em>C. briggsae</em>, CBG04605, CBG04606, CBG04607 and CBG04608 are arranged in the same orientation but don't have inverted repeat structure. B. Sequence comparison was carried out between sequence 1 and sequence 2 for each row. Sequence identity within each species (intraspecies) in a global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) is shown in the last column of the table. C. Sequence identity between species (interspecies) is shown in the last column of the table. Sequence identity within a species is much higher than the sequence identity between species for <em>C. elegans</em> and <em>C. remanei</em>. CE: <em>C. elegans</em>; CB: <em>C. briggsae</em>; CR: <em>C. remanei</em>; IGR: intergenic region.</p>
