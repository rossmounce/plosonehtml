                Figure 3. Duplication and evolution of inverted repeat orthologous gene pairs. A. Duplication of inverted repeat gene pair in C. briggsae. The CBG13233 - CBG13234 genomic region, which is orthologous to the C. elegans F44E5.4 - F44E5.5 genomic region, is duplicated as tandem repeats in C. briggsae. Number shows sequence identity between two sequences in a global alignment. Number in parenthesis shows sequence identity between two sequences in a local alignment. CBG13231 and CBG13233 are 99.3% identical for the first 297 nt. CBG13232 and CBG13234 are 99.2% identical for the first 764 nt. CBG13231 and CBG13232 are 100% identical for the first 297 nt. The intergenic region between CBG13231 and CBG13232 are 98% identical to the intergenic region between CBG13233 and CBG13234. B. Duplication of inverted repeat gene pair in C. remanei. The Contig35.Fgenesh-Celegans.59.final (Contig35-1) - Contig.eannot.388.final.final (Contig35-2) region, which is orthologous to the C. elegans F44E5.4 - F44E5.5 genomic region, is duplicated in C. remanei. Currently, it is not clearly whether the duplicated regions are in the same chromosome or not. Sequence identities between duplicated genes as well as between duplicated intergenic sequences are shown in the boxes.
