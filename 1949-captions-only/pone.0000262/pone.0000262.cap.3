A. Duplication of inverted repeat gene pair in <em>C. briggsae</em>. The CBG13233 - CBG13234 genomic region, which is orthologous to the <em>C. elegans</em> F44E5.4 - F44E5.5 genomic region, is duplicated as tandem repeats in <em>C. briggsae</em>. Number shows sequence identity between two sequences in a global alignment. Number in parenthesis shows sequence identity between two sequences in a local alignment. CBG13231 and CBG13233 are 99.3% identical for the first 297 nt. CBG13232 and CBG13234 are 99.2% identical for the first 764 nt. CBG13231 and CBG13232 are 100% identical for the first 297 nt. The intergenic region between CBG13231 and CBG13232 are 98% identical to the intergenic region between CBG13233 and CBG13234. B. Duplication of inverted repeat gene pair in <em>C. remanei</em>. The Contig35.Fgenesh-Celegans.59.final (Contig35-1) - Contig.eannot.388.final.final (Contig35-2) region, which is orthologous to the <em>C. elegans</em> F44E5.4 - F44E5.5 genomic region, is duplicated in <em>C. remanei</em>. Currently, it is not clearly whether the duplicated regions are in the same chromosome or not. Sequence identities between duplicated genes as well as between duplicated intergenic sequences are shown in the boxes.</p>
