A. Schematic representation of the genomic structure of the F42F12.1-F42F12.9 gene pairs as well as two <em>C. elegans</em> paralogous gene pairs, four <em>C. briggsae</em> orthologous gene pairs and three <em>C. remanei</em> orthologuos gene pairs. Numbers above each gene pair indicate the sequence identities between the two coding genes in a global alignment. Numbers below each gene pair indicate the sequence identifies between two arms of the inverted repeat intergenic region. Number in parenthesis shows sequence identity between the two sequences in a local alignment. B. Sequence identify between coding sequences. C. Sequence identity between intergenic sequences. For each row, sequence comparison was performed between sequence 1 and sequence 2 and sequence identity between these two sequences is shown in the last column. Contig59-1: Contig59.Fgenesh_Celegans.40.final; Contig59-2: Contig59.eannot.1190.final.final; Contig25-1: Contig25.Fgenesh_Celegans.92.final; Contig25-2: Contig.1332.final.final; Contig25-3: Contig25.Fgenesh_Celegans.94.final; Contig25-4: Contig.1333.final.final.
