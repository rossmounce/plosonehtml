This band was shifted dot-wise either to the left or to the right behind a mask (B), which in turn comprised regularly spread slits of 1 dot width. Distances between arrowheads in the stimulus band were integer multiples of the distance between slits; so same information was visible simultaneously within various slits. (C) During the crossing of one slit, only a small fraction of the arrowheads is physically visible at each point in time. Depending on the arrowhead orientation as well as on the motion direction, the two dots visible within the slits either diverged (as shown here) or converged. (D) Across multiple slit crossings the global motion direction emerged. Both, global cues between slits and local cues within slits must be registered in order to obtain the correct response, i.e. the original arrowhead orientation.</p>
