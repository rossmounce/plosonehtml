                Figure 2.  Motion detection.(A) In the critical dichoptic condition, two monocular sets of arrowheads with the same arrowhead orientation and motion direction are superimposed with a phase difference of 180 deg. Thus, only monocular but not binocular detectors are presented with unambiguous motion information. Results show clearly that spatiotemporal interpolation mechanisms have no access to monocular motion. Note that in this experiment and in 1B, all stimuli were always shown as red dots on dark ground and that colour coding is introduced here for the sake of clarity: Red, green and yellow mark stimuli presented to the right or left eye or by both eyes, respectively. (B) Two monocular sets of arrowhead stimuli are superimposed in the critical condition of this task. In both, arrowheads point to the same side but move into opposite directions. As a result, only interpolation mechanisms reading out monocular motion information can interpolate the stimuli correctly, while mechanisms relying only on binocular motion detection will perceive ambivalently oriented arrowheads. Stimuli for the four conditions (binocular, monocular left, monocular right and dichoptic) are shown along with the mask behind which they float. (C) Motion direction and hence correct arrowhead orientation can only be derived after the binocular fusion, while monocular motion information is always ambivalent. The stimulus is the same for all four conditions, whereas the mask differs. Here, the mask and the resulting global motion path are shown for the dichoptic condition. In the monocular conditions, exclusively either the red or else the green dots were visible, whereas in the binocular case, all dots were always visible by both eyes. Results for all three experiments are given as means Â±1 s.e.m.
