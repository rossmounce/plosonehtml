                Figure 3.  Form detection.(A) Due to dichoptic masking, arrowhead orientations may only be detected by monocular form mechanisms, while binocular ones will only perceive ambivalent cues. Stimuli are shown for the four conditions (binocular, monocular left, monocular right and dichoptic). Note that here stimuli were always shown as red dots on dark ground and that colour coding appears here only for the sake of clarity. (B) Since monocular stimuli are incomplete, detection of the arrowheads in this experiment is reserved for binocular interpolation mechanisms which have access to the interocularly combined images. Results for all experiments are shown as means Â±1 s.e.m.
