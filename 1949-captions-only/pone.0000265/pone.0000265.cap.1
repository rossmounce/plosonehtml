Display (a) is the Hermann grid display <a href="#pone.0000265-Hermann1">[1]</a>. Most observers see illusory dark gray smudges at the grid intersections. The illusion is strongest when viewed on a computer monitor. Displays (b) and (c) are based on displays that were presented at the European Conference on Visual Perception (Geier, Sera, Bernath, 2005, <em>Perception</em> 34, supplement 54).</p>
