                Figure 1. The six displays used in the experiments. Display (a) is the Hermann grid display [1]. Most observers see illusory dark gray smudges at the grid intersections. The illusion is strongest when viewed on a computer monitor. Displays (b) and (c) are based on displays that were presented at the European Conference on Visual Perception (Geier, Sera, Bernath, 2005, Perception 34, supplement 54).
