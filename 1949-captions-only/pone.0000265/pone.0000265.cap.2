                Figure 2. The experimental results. For each experiment, the plots show the luminance required for the target disk to be detected 80.35% of the time. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean. For some points the errors are so small that the error bars corresponding to those points collapse into horizontal lines. The horizontal dotted line represents the luminance of the gray background.
