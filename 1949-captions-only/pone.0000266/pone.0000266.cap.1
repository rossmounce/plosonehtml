                Figure 1.  Phylogeny estimation from analysis of fifteen R. felis proteins.Phylogeny estimation under parsimony of fifteen R. felis proteins (hypothetical protein RF_0005, threonyl-tRNA synthetase, preprotein translocase SecA subunit, uncharacterized low-complexity protein RF_0864, pyruvate phosphate dikinase precursor, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, hypothetical protein RF_0556, NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, DNA polymerase III alpha chain, O-antigen export system permease protein RfbA, thioredoxin, NADPH-dependent glutamate synthase beta chain and related oxidoreductases, putative TIM-barrel protein in nifR3 family, UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl] glucosamine, and zinc/manganese ABC transporter substrate binding protein TroA_c) from nine rickettsial species (Rickettsia bellii, R. canadensis, R. prowazekii, R. typhi, R. akari, R. felis, R. conorii, R. rickettsii, and R. sibirica) and two strains of Wolbachia. Branch support is from one million bootstrap replicates. Genome information was compiled from the PATRIC Website. * Total R. felis genome size: 1,485,148 bp = chromosome; 62,829 bp = pRF and 39,263 bp = pRFÎ´.
