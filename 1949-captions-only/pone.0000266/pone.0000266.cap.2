(B) Estimated phylogeny of 10 proteins present on the chromosome and plasmids of <em>R. felis</em>. “Ancestral” (red) refers to primitive rickettsiae with no known potential for host virulence. TG (aquamarine) = typhus group, TRG (light blue) = transitional group and SFG (brown) = spotted fever group. TG and TRG boxes depict the major differences in tree topologies. The pRF genes are boxed and shaded. Results from both analyses of amino acids are from an exhaustive search under parsimony with branch support from one million bootstrap replications.</p>
