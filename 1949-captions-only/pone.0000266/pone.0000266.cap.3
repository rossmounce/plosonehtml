                Figure 3.  Individual phylogeny estimations for the seven pRF proteins used in the combined analysis of pRF.(A, B) Majority rule consensus trees. (Câ€“H) Strict consensus trees. All analyses were of amino acids from an exhaustive search under parsimony with branch support from one million bootstrap replications. Bootstrap values are placed above branches. Percentages of nodes recovered in majority rule consensus trees are shown below branches. Scores are tree lengths, with total characters and number of parsimony informative characters provided.
