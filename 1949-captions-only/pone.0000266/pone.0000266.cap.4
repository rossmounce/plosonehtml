                Figure 4.  Characteristics and summary information of predicted origin of replication (oriV) of the pRF plasmid of Rickettsia felis.(A) Schematic map of the pRF with shaded regions containing the putative oriV (right) and replication termination region (left). The region outlined in the dark dashed line depicts the portion of the plasmid missing in pRFδ (pRF15-pRF38). Grey boxes depict genes, with gene names described in Tables 1 and 2. Red lines depict coding strands, and yellow blocks depict areas of gene overlap. (B) AT-skew of pRF, with AT-skew (blue), cumulative AT-skew (red) and minimum AT-skew (orange). (C) CG-skew of pRF, with CG-skew (blue), cumulative CG-skew (red) and maximum CG-skew (orange). Plots generated and values computed with GenSkew (http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/gen​skew).
