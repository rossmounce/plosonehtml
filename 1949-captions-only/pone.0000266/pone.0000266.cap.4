The region outlined in the dark dashed line depicts the portion of the plasmid missing in pRFδ (pRF15-pRF38). Grey boxes depict genes, with gene names described in <a href="#pone-0000266-t001">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0000266-t002">2</a>. Red lines depict coding strands, and yellow blocks depict areas of gene overlap. (B) AT-skew of pRF, with AT-skew (blue), cumulative AT-skew (red) and minimum AT-skew (orange). (C) CG-skew of pRF, with CG-skew (blue), cumulative CG-skew (red) and maximum CG-skew (orange). Plots generated and values computed with GenSkew (<a href="http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/genskew">http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/gen​skew</a>).</p>
