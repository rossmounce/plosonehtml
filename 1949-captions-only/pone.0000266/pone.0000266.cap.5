(B) Our hypothesis centered on the notion that the ancestor to all rickettsiae harbored a plasmid system with subsequent losses in the ancestors to the TG and SFG rickettsiae, and in <em>R. canadensis</em> and <em>R. bellii</em> str. RML369-C. Red = ancestral rickettsiae, Aquamarine = typhus group, light blue = transitional group, brown = true spotted fever group. Trees are from <a href="#pone-0000266-g002">Figure 2A</a>.</p>
