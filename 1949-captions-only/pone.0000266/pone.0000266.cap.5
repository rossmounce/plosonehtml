                Figure 5.  Comparison of two hypotheses for the evolution of plasmids in rickettsiae.(A) The appearance of a plasmid system in R. felis (as a member of SFG rickettsiae) as recently suggested (Ogata et al., 2005b; Blanc et al. 2007). (B) Our hypothesis centered on the notion that the ancestor to all rickettsiae harbored a plasmid system with subsequent losses in the ancestors to the TG and SFG rickettsiae, and in R. canadensis and R. bellii str. RML369-C. Red = ancestral rickettsiae, Aquamarine = typhus group, light blue = transitional group, brown = true spotted fever group. Trees are from Figure 2A.
