                Figure 2.  225Ac-E4G10 therapy inhibits the growth of LnCap prostate tumors.A, Flow cytometric analysis depicting the lack of E4G10 binding to LnCap cells; J591, mouse-anti prostate specific membrane antigen is the positive control. Mouse and rat isotype controls were also evaluated. B, Photographs of in situ (left) and excised tumor (right) in a representative dual control and 225Ac-E4G10 treated animal. C, Tumor volume in various treatment groups at described time-points. D, Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the three treatment groups at 22 days post-implantation with 5 million LnCap cells. E, Kaplan Meier curve showing enhancement of survival with 225Ac-E4G10 treatment. Data in C, D are mean Â± S.E.M. Scale bar, 1 cm.
