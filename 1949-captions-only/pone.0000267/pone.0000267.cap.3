                Figure 3.  Effect of 225Ac-E4G10 therapy on tumor histology, vascularity and apoptosis.A, Light microscopy depicting numerous RBC-filled vascular spaces (arrows) in dual control tumor and fewer, but relatively normal-looking vessels (arrowheads) in the 225Ac-E4G10 treated tumor. B, Top: Immunohistochemical staining of tumor-sections for vWF, an endothelial cell marker (top). TUNEL staining of tumor sections to detect apoptosis (bottom). Quantification of vWF staining (C) and apoptosis (D) in 4 randomly selected fields. Data are mean Â± S.E.M.
