                Figure 4.  225Ac-E4G10 treatment results in a relatively normal remaining tumor vasculature.A, Greater coverage of tumor blood vessels (CD31 positive) by pericytes (α-SMA-positive cells) in 225Ac-E4G10 treated tumor relative to dual control. B, Transmission electron micrographs of blood vessels in dual control and 225Ac-E4G10 treated tumor. The dual control tumor contains extravasated RBC-filled vascular spaces that are not lined with endothelial cells, whereas blood vessels in 225Ac-E4G10 treated tumor display a continuous endothelial lining (arrow) resting on a basement membrane (BM) that is shared with the surrounding pericyte.
