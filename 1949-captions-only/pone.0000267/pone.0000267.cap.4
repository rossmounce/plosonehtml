B, Transmission electron micrographs of blood vessels in dual control and <sup>225</sup>Ac-E4G10 treated tumor. The dual control tumor contains extravasated RBC-filled vascular spaces that are not lined with endothelial cells, whereas blood vessels in <sup>225</sup>Ac-E4G10 treated tumor display a continuous endothelial lining (arrow) resting on a basement membrane (BM) that is shared with the surrounding pericyte.
