                Figure 1.  Linkage disequilibrium between the 92 common variants (MAF&gt;0.05) in HapMap CEPH trios.Each square represents the correlation (r2) between each pair of SNPs with darker shades representing stronger LD. Tag SNPs are indicated with those SNPs that failed assay design being shown in grey font.
