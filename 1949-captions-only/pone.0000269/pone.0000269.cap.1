(b) Apoptosis was also determined in irradiated (10 Gy) or Ara-C (5 µM) treated HL60 cells grown on 5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> laminin (LN) or collagen-1 (COL1) after 48 h. (c) Limiting dilution analysis was performed to measure long-time survival. The number of positive wells (i.e. viable and proliferating cells) was used for calculation of survival rates after ionizing radiation (2, 4 or 6 Gy) or a 48-h Ara-C treatment (5 nM or 5 µM) relative to untreated controls (0 Gy or co). Results represent mean±s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistics were calculated by comparing adhesion cultures to matrix proteins versus BSA and/or suspension cultures. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
