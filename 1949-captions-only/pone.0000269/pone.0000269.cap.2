(b) Fractionation of membrane (m), cytoplasmic (c) and nuclear (n) proteins was carried out to analyze the distribution of β1 integrins in the transfected and control cells. Cells were lysed in different buffers and centrifuged according to <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Each protein fraction separated by Western blotting contains the protein amount from 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells. Histon H3 was detected for the nuclear fraction and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed on the cytoplasmic fraction. Numbers shown indicate the absorbance of the cytoplasmic protein fraction monitored at 490 nm and 690 nm using a spectral-photometer. (c) Level of cell surface expression of transfected β1 integrin in HL60 cells. β1 integrins were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-β1-integrin antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. As control, a FITC-conjugated, isotype-matched non-specific IgG (IgG control) was used. (d) Induction of apoptosis in serum grown or serum-free HL60β1 and HL60VC suspension (susp) or FN (5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) cell cultures was examined at 48 h after 2 or 10 Gy (mean±s.d.; n = 3). Student´s <em>t</em> test compared FN+serum, FN-serum or susp-serum versus susp+serum cultures. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01</p>
