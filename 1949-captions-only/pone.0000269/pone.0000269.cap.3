Statistical analysis compared FN versus suspension cultures. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01. (b) and (c) Cell viability was determined by MTT assay (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Cells (3×10<sup>4</sup>) were seeded onto FN, LN or COL1 in triplicate and grown under similar conditions as described for (a). Experiments were repeated three times and results show mean±s.d.. Statistical analysis compared HL60β1 versus HL60VC cells. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01. (d) Adhesion of HL60 transfectants to FN was evaluated in the presence or absence of stimulatory (TS2/16; 1 µg/ml) or inhibitory (13; 1 µg/ml) anti-β1 integrin mAbs or peptides (GRGDS; 500 µg/ml) under serum-free conditions (controls: non-specific anti rat IgG1 or GRADSP employed at equivalent concentrations). Columns represent mean±s.d. of the absorbance at 630 nm representing cell adhesion (n = 3). <em>P</em>-values were calculated by comparison of mAbs or peptide versus controls. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01. (e) Radiation-induced apoptosis was determined in cells grown in suspension or on FN in the presence of TS2/16 or mAb13 (1 µg/ml; anti rat IgG1 as control) or GRGDS peptide (500 µg/ml; GRADSP as control) under serum-free conditions. Results represent mean±s.d. (n = 3) and statistics compared mAb or peptide versus controls. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
