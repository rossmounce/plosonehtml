                Figure 4.  Adhesion to FN reduces radiation-induced cleavage of procaspase-9, -3, -8 and PARP in a concentration dependent manner.(a) Following a 1-h growth on either increasing FN concentrations or in suspension, HL60β1 cells were irradiated with 10 Gy. Cells were harvested 8 h later and total proteins were extracted. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, selected proteins were detected using specific antibodies. β-actin served as loading control. (b) FN adhesion maintains the ΔΨm. TMRE staining of 10-Gy irradiated or Ara-C-treated (5 µM) HL60VC and HL60β1 cells was analyzed by FACS to determine the amount of ΔΨm low (mean±s.d.) representing the apoptosis-related breakdown of this potential relative to non-irradiated or non-Ara-C-treated controls ( = 0%). (c) Activation of caspases was determined by FACS analysis in FITC-VAD-fmk-stained cells under identical conditions. Results (mean±s.d. of three independent experiments) are plotted as arbitrary units (a.u.) showing the fold increase after normalization to suspension conditions. Statistics were calculated by comparison of increasing FN concentrations versus suspension. *P&lt;0.01.
