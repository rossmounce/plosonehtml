                Figure 5.  Upon adhesion, β1 integrin-mediated antiapoptotic signaling involves procaspase-8 and Akt.(a) Coprecipitation was performed to detect interactions between β1 integrin and procaspase-8, FADD or Akt. Cells were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and immunoprecipitation (reverse immunoprecipitation used anti-caspase-8 mAb) was carried out at 4 h after irradiation using non-specific IgG or anti-β1 integrin antibodies. (b) To analyze the impact of procaspase-8, -3 or Akt on the induction of apoptosis following FasL, HL60VC cells were held in suspension or plated onto FN and, where indicated, incubated with mAb TS2/16 or 13 (anti rat IgG1 as control) for 1 h. After 30 min, cells were also exposed to 20 µM of inhibitors for caspase-8 (IETD-fmk), -3 (DEVD-fmk), 10 µM Ly294002 (PI3K) or 0.25 µl/ml DMSO. After additional 30 min, treatment with 300 ng/ml FasL was accomplished and cells were isolated, stained with DAPI and counted for apoptotic morphology at 48 h thereafter (mean±s.d.; n = 3). Statistics were calculated by comparing inhibitor-treated cells versus DMSO or IgG. *P&lt;0.01. (c). In parallel, total cell extracts were isolated, subjected to Western blotting and pro and cleaved forms of caspase-8 and -3 and Akt and Akt-S473 were detected using the appropriate antibodies. β-actin was the loading control.
