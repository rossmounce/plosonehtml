Expression of β1 integrin was inspected by immunoblotting. (b) Following β1 integrin knockdown, 10 Gy or 300 ng/ml FasL were applied to the cells grown on 100 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> FN. Apoptosis was determined 48 h later by DAPI. (c) In parallel, cell lysates were harvested for analysis of procaspase-8, -3 and Akt expression. (d) Subsequent to administration of 20 µM caspase-8 (IETD-fmk) or caspase-3 (DEVD-fmk), 10 µM Ly294002 or 0.25 µl/ml DMSO for 30 min, caspase-8 and -3 activity was measured at 4 h after 10 Gy. Statistics were calculated by comparing the level of apoptosis in β1 integrin knockdown cells versus DXII. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
