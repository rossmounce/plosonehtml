The red cooperator population is invaded by red defectors at <em>t</em>≈1200. At <em>t</em>≈4500, cooperation is established based on blue tags. Blue defectors invade at <em>t</em>≈6000. The time unit is given by one individual learning event (pairwise comparison). For example, after <em>t</em> = 5000 each individual had <em>100</em> learning events on average. The following parameters are used: population size <em>N = 50</em>, intensity of selection <em>β = 1.0</em>, cost of cooperation <em>c = 0.5</em>, benefit from cooperation <em>b = 1.0</em>, mutation rate <em>u = 0.01</em>.</p>
