                Figure 2. Evolutionary chromodynamics in finite populations. The red cooperator population is invaded by red defectors at t≈1200. At t≈4500, cooperation is established based on blue tags. Blue defectors invade at t≈6000. The time unit is given by one individual learning event (pairwise comparison). For example, after t = 5000 each individual had 100 learning events on average. The following parameters are used: population size N = 50, intensity of selection β = 1.0, cost of cooperation c = 0.5, benefit from cooperation b = 1.0, mutation rate u = 0.01.
