The first <em>n</em> bits encode the strategy according to a parity rule: if the sum of the first <em>n</em> bits is even, the strategy is cooperation, otherwise it is defection. The last <em>m</em> bits encode the tag. Each sequence encodes a different tag. Hence there are 2<sup>m</sup> possible tags. There is an overlapping region of <em>L</em> bits which affect both the strategy and the tag. This setup allows evolution of tag based cooperation if <em>b/c&gt;(2nâˆ’L)/L</em> is fulfilled.</p>
