                Figure 3. Consider a pleiotropic gene that encodes both strategy and tag. The first n bits encode the strategy according to a parity rule: if the sum of the first n bits is even, the strategy is cooperation, otherwise it is defection. The last m bits encode the tag. Each sequence encodes a different tag. Hence there are 2m possible tags. There is an overlapping region of L bits which affect both the strategy and the tag. This setup allows evolution of tag based cooperation if b/c&gt;(2nâˆ’L)/L is fulfilled.
