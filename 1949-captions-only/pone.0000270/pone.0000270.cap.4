                Figure 4. In a model with 2K phenotypes consisting of a pair of strategy and tag, cooperation evolves depending on the benefit to cost ratio. For small mutation rates, the critical benefit to cost ratio for evolution of cooperation is given by b/c&gt;(K+1)/(K−1) (red line). If the benefit to cost ratio exceeds this critical value, then cooperators are more abundant than defectors averaged over time. With increasing mutation rates, the populations become more mixed which favors defectors. Hence, the critical benefit to cost ratio increases with a higher mutation rate, as shown for u = 0.01 and u = 0.001. In all cases, the critical benefit to cost ratio decreases with the number of tags K and converges to 1 for β→∞. The following parameters are used: population size N = 100, intensity of selection β = 0.1, cost of cooperation c = 0.2, averages over 108 time steps.
