The inset shows a single representative example of replicate wt-1. B) The 6 mutant MT4 cultured replicates show an initial fitness increase that seems to reach a maximum at around a relative fitness of 1.04Â±0.02. All trajectories are best described by an exponential regression model with an upper limit (F-test, p&lt;0.05). The inset shows a single representative example of replicate mt-1 (see <a href="#pone-0000271-t002">Table 2</a> for relative fitness values at day 110). C and D) relative fitness of 6 wt and 6 mt C8166 cultured viruses, respectively. Relative fitness did not significantly deviate from the starting virus over the course of the experiment (ANOVA, p&gt;&gt;0.05; see <a href="#pone-0000271-t003">Table 3</a> for relative fitness values at day 110). Fitness is relative to reference strain v13 (also see <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a> section.</p>
