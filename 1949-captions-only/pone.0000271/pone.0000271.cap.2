Thus, each data point corresponds to the amount of genetic variation within a single serial passage line at a certain point in time. Genetic variation (Kimura 2 parameter) is plotted separately for the two cell-lines. A) No correlation in genetic variation in MT4 evolved viruses was observed (n = 44, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.011, p = 0.49). B) There is a strong linear correlation in genetic variation between the LTR and <em>Env</em> in C8166 cultured viruses (n = 39, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.745, p&lt;0.0001). Even if the two outliers are taken out, the strong correlation remains (n = 37, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.475, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
