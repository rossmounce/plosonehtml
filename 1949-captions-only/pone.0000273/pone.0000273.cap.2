                Figure 2. A schematic representation of the interplay between the growth phase, Dam-mediated methylation and transcriptional effects of CRP and Sigma38. This model is a hypothesis shows that Dam does not directly inhibit TF/Sigma binding and its downregulation in stationary phase correlates with the activation of CRP and Sigma38 whose binding sites which are enriched for GATC.
