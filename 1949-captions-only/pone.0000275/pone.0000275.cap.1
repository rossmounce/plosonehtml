GFP-aequorin (GA) expression in the MBs was driven by the P[GAL4]OK107 line. Seen are the vertical and medial lobes, which are localised in the anterior part of the brain. They are subdivided into five axonal lobes; α and β lobes (in red), α' and β' (in green), and the γ lobe (in blue) (note that the γ lobe does not have a vertical counterpart and the tip of the α' lobe terminate laterally to the α lobe). The calyx (in yellow shading) and the cell bodies (in magenta) are located dorsally and posteriorly in the brain. Scale bar = 50 µm. B) Light emission (photons/pixel/s) plotted as a function of time (s), following four successive applications of high [KCl]. C) A representative example of K<sup>+</sup>-depolarised Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the MBs. The first frame shows an image of the whole brain and the localization of GFP fluorescence in the MBs. Following frames show consecutive bioluminescent images (15 s integration) after K<sup>+</sup>-depolarization (70 mM), starting at “0” when KCl was applied. D) Light emission from each lobe (see in C) was plotted as a function of time (photons/pixel/s). The red trace corresponds to the tip of the vertical lobes (α, α' lobes), the blue trace to the medial (β, β') lobes. E) The first peak shows the effect verapamil (10 µM) on the K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-response in the lobes. The second peak shows K<sup>+</sup>-depolarised Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in the lobes after washout of the drug. Red trace, vertical lobes and blue trace is medial lobes.</p>
