                Figure 2.  In vivo detection of Ca2+ activities in the ellipsoid-body (eb).A) A representative example showing GFP fluorescence of GA expression in the eb (P[GAL4] C232), a sub-structure of the CC. This frontal view shows the cell bodies (cb), which are localized frontally, medially and laterally to the eb structure. The ring-shaped arborisation of the ring-neurons is also visible in the center of the brain. The cell bodies are on a different plane and are therefore slightly out of focus. Outside the eb, few other neurons located ventrally to the eb, are also labeled. However, those neurons are not yet precisely characterized. (20× objective, scale bar = 50 µm). Corresponding frames show Ca2+-induced bioluminescence after K+-depolarisation (70 mM). Each image represents 30 s of accumulated light, starting at “0” when KCl was applied. B) Traces showing the average light emission±s.e.m in the eb and the cell bodies (photons/pixel/s, n = 3 flies). C) Histogram represents the calculated means+/−s.e.m. for the maximum photons/pixel/s determined for the eb (n = 3 flies) and cell bodies with and without TTX (n = 6, 3 flies). *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.
