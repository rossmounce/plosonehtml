                Figure 3.  Nicotine induced [Ca2+] signalling in the MBs.A) Representative example of GFP fluorescence in the whole brain of Drosophila expressing GA in the MBs (scale bar = 50 µm). Corresponding frames show consecutive images of bioluminescence, after application of nicotine (100 µM). Note that the secondary rise in [Ca2+]i has a slow rate of rise and decay in the vertical (α, α') and medial (β, β' and γ) lobes. Bioluminescence images each represent 100 s of accumulated light, starting at “0” when nicotine was applied. B) Traces showing the light emission versus time from the calyx-cell bodies and the medial lobes in (A). C) Traces showing that the secondary Ca2+-response can be reproduced after sequential application of nicotine (100 µM). D) Light emission in the medial lobes after two consecutive applications of acetylcholine (100 µM). E) Two representative examples (fly 1 &amp; 2) of Ca2+-induced bioluminescence in the lobes after application of nicotine (100 µM) showing that the delayed secondary Ca2+ response in the lobes occurs sequentially. (Upper panel) GFP fluorescence image of the lobes on one side of the brain (20× objective), followed by the corresponding bioluminescence images. Each panel represents the accumulated light emission occurring during the specified time interval after application of nicotine (time “0”). The first bioluminescence panel shows activation in the α' and β' lobes, which is followed the γ lobe (second panel) and finally, by the α and β lobes (third panel). The outline has been drawn by freehand to highlight the sequential activation of the different lobes. This can also be seen in the associated movies (suppl. movies 5A &amp; B). Resolution is 256×256 pixels, each pixel is approximately 2.6 µm2. Light emission (photons/pixel) is coded in pseudocolors.
