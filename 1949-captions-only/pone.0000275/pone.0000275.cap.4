B/Peak Max. A (see <a href="#s4">methods</a> for explanation), recorded in the medial lobes after application of nicotine (n = 13, 8 flies). The delayed secondary response is significantly blocked by thapsigargin (2 µM, n = 10, 5 flies), but is unaffected by TTX (n = 6, 4 flies). Finally, in <em>dunce<sup>1</sup></em> mutant flies, the delayed secondary response is significantly reduced (n = 16, 11 flies). **<em>P</em>&lt;0.01, *** <em>P</em>&lt;0.001. B &amp; C) Four representative individual traces showing the light emission in the medial lobes (photons/pixel/s), from wild-type Canton-S flies (B) and from <em>dunce<sup>1</sup></em> mutant flies (C). The percentage of flies producing responses similar to those represented by each graph is also given.</p>
