                Figure 4.  The nicotine induced delayed secondary Ca2+ response in the MB lobes is dependent on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and is reduced in the dunce mutant.A) Histogram showing the means+/−s.e.m. for the calculated ratio of Peak Max. B/Peak Max. A (see methods for explanation), recorded in the medial lobes after application of nicotine (n = 13, 8 flies). The delayed secondary response is significantly blocked by thapsigargin (2 µM, n = 10, 5 flies), but is unaffected by TTX (n = 6, 4 flies). Finally, in dunce1 mutant flies, the delayed secondary response is significantly reduced (n = 16, 11 flies). **P&lt;0.01, *** P&lt;0.001. B &amp; C) Four representative individual traces showing the light emission in the medial lobes (photons/pixel/s), from wild-type Canton-S flies (B) and from dunce1 mutant flies (C). The percentage of flies producing responses similar to those represented by each graph is also given.
