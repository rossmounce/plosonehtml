Total activation produced by TMS as measured by the global mean field power (GMFP) derived from all 60 electrodes. The GMFP was increased between 10 and 130 ms post stimulus (gray area) following rTMS (pre, 112.9±37.6 µV; post, 196.1±43.7 µV; p&lt;0.05, paired t-test, n = 10). Inset: Source localization of the average TMS-evoked EEG response at the earliest significant component, 18 ms after magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex, before the rTMS conditioning (n = 8 subjects). Activity is color coded and projected onto the Montréal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard brain. Electrode positions are indicated by black dots.</p>
