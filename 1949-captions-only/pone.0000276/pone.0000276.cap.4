Topographic depiction of positive correlations between SWA change and the change in global mean field power in the late component of the TMS-evoked response after 5-Hz rTMS conditioning. For each subject the change in activity between 100 and 140 ms before and after the 5-Hz conditioning was calculated and correlated with the change in SWA at each electrode. Filled circles indicate electrodes showing a significant correlation (white circle, r = 0.65, p&lt;0.05 at electrode 8, n = 10), or a trend (grey circles, p&lt;0.1).</p>
