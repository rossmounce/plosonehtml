                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic relationships of the six newly characterized Rhizobiales genospecies.Internal branches with length not significantly different from zero are shown as a dashed line. Numbers correspond to percentage bootstrap support for internal branches based on 100 replications (only values above 50% are shown). Scale bar corresponds to numbers of nucleotide substitution per site. A) Phylogenetic position of genospecies V,W and X within the B. japonicum group. B) Phylogenetic position of genospecies Y and Z within the B. elkanii group. C) Phylogenetic position of genospecies AL within Rhizobiales.
