(B) Accumulation of cellular IFN-β and viral mRNAs after infection with virus irradiated by variable UV energies. Cells were infected for 24 h with measles virus irradiated with a range of UV energies and RNAs were quantified by RT-QPCR. Data were expressed as % of the RNA amounts from cells infected with non irradiated virus. (C) Lack of IFN-β stimulation by measles viral mRNAs. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors (0.4 µg/10<sup>5</sup> cells) encoding the various measles virus or control (eGFP, T7 RNA polymerase) proteins or with 200 ng poly(I:C). IFN-β mRNA was quantified 24 h post-transfection and protein expression was checked by western blot (see arrows). Note that, due to the lack of a suitable antibody, L protein expression could not be checked. (D) Short <em>in vitro</em> leader transcripts from VSV activates IFN-β. Identical amounts of short RNAs purified from <em>in vitro</em> transcription of VSV and treated or not with RNase A were transfected in 293T cells and IFN-β mRNA was quantified. Mock is transfection with oligofectamine alone. Results are from one representative experiment out of three.</p>
