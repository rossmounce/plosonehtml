As controls, RNAs were digested with RNase A before transfection. (B) 5′-triphosphate RNA are stronger IFN inducers than 5′-monophosphate RNA. Monophosphate RNAs were obtained as described in <a href="#pone.0000279.s003">Figure S3</a> and have length identical to their 5′triphosphate counterparts. 200 ng of 5′-triphosphate short leader (le), 5′-monophosphate short leader (le), 5′-triphosphate long leader (lle), 5′-triphosphate-shRNA<sup>eGFP</sup>, 5′-monophosphate-shRNA<sup>eGFP</sup> (sh) or poly(I:C), were transfected into 293T cells. The results are from one representative experiment out of three. (C) <em>In vivo</em> T7-driven, but not <em>in vivo</em> Pol III-driven transcription of measles virus RNA leader activates IFN-β. 293T and 293-3-46 (noted 293-T7) cell line stably expressing the T7 polymerase were transfected with 0.4 µg/10<sup>5</sup> cells of pcDNA-t7-leader or pSUPER-H1-leader and the amount of IFN-β transcripts was quantified. (D) <em>In vitro</em> T7 transcripts but not <em>in vivo</em> Pol III transcripts induce IFN-β activation. 293T cells were transfected with peGFPN2 plasmid coding for the eGFP together with either eGFP specific shRNA transcripts made <em>in vitro</em> by the T7 polymerase or a plasmid DNA encoding an eGFP specific shRNA under the Pol III promoter.</p>
