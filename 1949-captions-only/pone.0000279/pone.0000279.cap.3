                Figure 3.  IFN-β activation by measles virus and by viral 5′-triphosphate leader is mediated by RIG-I.Lack of IFN-β response in the RIG-I deficient Huh7.5 cells after measles virus infection (A) or transfection with 200 ng of in vitro T7-driven leader transcript (B). Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells were infected with measles virus for 24 h and checked for N and IFN-β mRNA expression. (C) Exogenous expression of Flag-RIG-I enhances IFN-β stimulation by in vitro T7-driven leader transcript. 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid or a plasmid coding RIG-I (0.4 µg DNA), followed 24 h later by transfection with no RNA, T7 transcribed leader or poly(I:C) (200 ng). 24 h after the second transfection, IFN-β mRNA was quantified as described above. Ectopic expression of Flag-RIG-I was controlled by western blotting (not shown).
