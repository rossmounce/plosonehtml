Protein sequences were aligned using the program MUSCLE <a href="#pone.0000279-Edgar1">[51]</a>, and manually refined. Predicted and actual secondary structure elements of RIG-I and Hef are shown above the alignment. Sequence numbering corresponds to the RIG-I sequence. The dots in the alignment and in the structural elements indicate gaps. Identical amino acids are boxed in red. Similar residues are drawn in red. The seven helicase motifs are underlined. (B) Superimposition between the RIG-I homology-derived 3D model (cyan) and the crystal structure of the <em>Pyrococcus furiosus</em> helicase (yellow). (C) Superimposition of the motif Ia from Rep (red), PcrA (white), HCV NS3 (orange) and RIG-I (cyan). (D, E, F) Superimposition of RIG-I motif Ia onto that of Rep (D), PcrA (E), and HCV NS3 (F). The residues contacting the nucleic acid are shown in sticks. The base closest to the Ia motif in each helicase is shown in white and in sticks. (D) Stick representation of Rep Thr56 and Lys 58 (red), and of RIG-I Gln 299 (cyan). (E) Stick representation of PcrA Phe64 (white) and of RIG-I Gln299 (cyan). (F) Stick representation of NS3 HCV Pro230 and Val232 (orange), and of RIG-I Gln299 (cyan). (G) Loss of RIG-I binding to RNA after Gln299Ala mutation. Binding assays were carried out as described in <a href="#pone-0000279-g004">Fig. 4</a> legend.</p>
