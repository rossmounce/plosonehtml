                Figure 1. Initial 100 amino acids of the alignment of partial TRPV1 genes, showing a shared indel in the reptilian clade that is absent from the common ancestor, Xenopus tropicalis. Fragments were ~650 bp (Crocodylus porosus, Poephila guttata, Coturnix chinensis) and ~350 bp (Pseudomoia entrecasteauxii and Amphibolurus muricatus) (a). Phylogenetic relationships of partial TRPV1 and 2 genes based on an alignment of amino acids and analysed using Bayesian Inference (BI). The numbers at nodes indicate posterior probabilities and ML bootstrap values (BI/ML) for clades where these exceed 50%. The new sequences from this work are in red. The reptilian clade is shown in yellow. The full alignment is available from the authors.
