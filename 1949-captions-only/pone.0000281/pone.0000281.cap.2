                Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships of TRPM8 genes based on an alignment of amino acids, analysed using BI. The numbers at nodes indicate posterior probabilities and ML bootstrap values (BI/ML) for clades, where it exceeds 50%. The new sequence from this work is in red, and it was ~500 bp. The full alignment is available from the authors.
