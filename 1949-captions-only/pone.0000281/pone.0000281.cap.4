After administration of capsazepine, the body temperature of experimental animals ceased to oscillate periodically, while body temperature patterns of control animals remained unchanged (b). Both (a) and (b) show representative examples of data from the same pair of animals. Body temperature time series were transformed into a frequency domain, and the periodogram of the control and experimental animals before treatment shows regular body temperature cycles at 43 and 86 min cycle<sup>−1</sup> (c). After treatment, these regular cycles disappear when TRPV1 and TRPM8 were blocked, but there is no change in control animals (d). Means from all animals±s.e. are shown in c and d.</p>
