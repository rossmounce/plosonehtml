                Figure 5. The total power density, i.e. the intensity of periodic body temperature cycles, is significantly less when TRPV1 and TRPM8 were blocked, compared to the other treatments which do not differ significantly from each other (CTL = control animals, EXP = experimental animals, DMSO = DMSO treatment, CAP = capsazepine treatment; means from all animalsÂ±s.e. are shown).
