                Figure 1.  Schematics of a branching process.Two generations of infections are shown. Every horizontal bar segment represents the time interval that a specified individual remains infectious; these time intervals follow a negative exponential distribution with average μ−1. The time intervals between infections for any given individual follow a negative exponential distribution with an average of β−1.
