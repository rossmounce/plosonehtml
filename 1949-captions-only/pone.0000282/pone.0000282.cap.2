Individuals are represented as the nodes of the network; two individuals a and b are connected by a directed link from b to a if b has infected a. In the Figure, a is a newly infected individual added to the growing transmission network. As an example of an infection rule, a node b is uniformly randomly chosen to be the infectious individual who has infected a. If a removal occurs, an individual c is randomly chosen from the infected group, and is removed. Under the assumption that the number of the secondary infections caused by c is a proxy for the progression of the disease, we choose that the probability that c is removed to be proportional to the number of secondary infections caused by c plus one; i.e., to be proportional to the total number of connections of c. The node c remains connected to the network, but can not cause any new infections; i.e., c becomes the same as node d who previously infected c. The rates of infections and removals per infectious capita are <em>β</em> and <em>μ</em>, respectively. The branching process presented in <a href="#pone-0000282-g001">Fig. 1</a> yields the same expected incidence as our ILM which is given by the <em>SI</em> ODE model.</p>
