The open circles represent results for the branching process while the dots represent results for our ILM. We used <em>β</em>  = 0.015, <em>μ</em>  = 0.01, and we averaged over 1,000 stochastic realizations. On a logarithmic scale, the results fit very well with a straight line, with slope <em>(β−μ)</em> and intercept 0, that corresponds to the ODE solution <em>I(t) = I(</em>0<em>)exp[(β−μ)t]</em>, where <em>I(</em>0<em>) = </em>1. B The average number of secondary infections stratified versus the date of infection. The open circles represent results for the branching process while the dots represent results for our ILM. We used <em>β</em>  = 0.015, <em>μ</em>  = 0.01, and we averaged over 15,000 stochastic realizations. The R<sub>0</sub> of the branching process is 1.5, while the R<sub>0</sub> of our ILM is approximately 1.4.</p>
