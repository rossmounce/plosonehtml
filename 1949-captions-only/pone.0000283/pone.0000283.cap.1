                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the NWD gene family.The structural domains of the 10 members of the NWD gene family of the sequenced S strain are represented by blue boxes (HET domain), pink boxes (NACHT domain) and orange boxes (WD-repeat unit). Arrowheads represent stop codons in the pseudogenes. Numbers in brackets indicate the range of repeat number found in wild type isolates (Table 2). Note that NWDp-3 pseudogene was apparently inactivated by inversion of a 60 kbp fragment splitting an ancestral HNWD gene in two segments with opposite orientations (arrows).
