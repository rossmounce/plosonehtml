Arrowheads represent stop codons in the pseudogenes. Numbers in brackets indicate the range of repeat number found in wild type isolates (<a href="#pone-0000283-t002">Table 2</a>). Note that <em>NWDp-3</em> pseudogene was apparently inactivated by inversion of a 60 kbp fragment splitting an ancestral <em>HNWD</em> gene in two segments with opposite orientations (arrows).</p>
