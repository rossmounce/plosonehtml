Each box represents a single WD-40 sequence. Asterisks indicate Internal Branch Length tast values over 80. The corresponding full size tree is presented on <a href="#pone.0000283.s003">figure S3</a>. B/Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree of NACHT domain sequences. Each WD-40 unit is designated by its gene of origin and position in the domain. Cyan branches indicate sequences associated to NACHT domains belonging to N-I clade of the NACHT phylogeny. Internal Branch Length test values over 80 are indicated. For both trees, species of origin are colour coded.</p>
