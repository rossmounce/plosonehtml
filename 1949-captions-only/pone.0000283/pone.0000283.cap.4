                Figure 4.  Analogy based modelling of interacting partners.A/Top and side view of the predicted structure of the HET-E WD repeat domain. Positions under strong positive selection are coloured. B/Predicted structure of the het-C gene product encoding a glycolipid transfer protein. Red amino acids correspond to positions experimentally shown to be involved in recognition specificities, yellow amino acids represent highly polymorphic positions between het-C alleles. Note that residue 126 is located in a unstructured loop, so its positioning is uncertain. Residues forming the sugar binding site are coloured in cyan, residues forming the lipid binding tunnel are coloured in blue. Polymorphic residues are located outside the sugar binding site and the lipid binding hydrophobic tunnel.
