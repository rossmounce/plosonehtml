Blocks were defined as containing at least two SNPs with the most frequent haplotype homozygosity (MHH) â‰¥0.9 in the test population (blue frame). Using these same blocks, homozygosity for the test population's most frequent haplotype (HTMH) in the reference population, and haplotype homozygosity (HH) were calculated in both the reference and test populations. This illustration shows the observed values of haplotype homozygosities, <em>i.e</em>., the frequencies of homozygous diplotype individuals in each population. In the test population, 9/10 individuals have homozygous genotype for all the SNPs in the block, <em>i.e.</em>, four blue boxes. In the reference population, only 1/10 individual have homozygous diplotype (two blue and two red boxes) and no individual is homozygote for the test population's most frequent haplotype (four blue boxes).</p>
