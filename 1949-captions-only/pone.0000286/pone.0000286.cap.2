                Figure 2. Distributions of rMHH and rHH under simulations. (A and B) Comparison of the observed (obs) and expected (exp) values of homozygosities. Distributions of rMHH (A) and rHH (B) under the selection (sel) and neutral (neu) models were shown. The parameters used in the simulations are default settings (def): size of the test population, Nt = 1000; size of the reference population, Nr = 1000; generations after the population split, G = 200; selection coefficient, s = 0.15; SNP interval = 2 kb/SNP. (C and D) rMHH (C) and rHH (D) under different selection models. (E and F) rMHH (E) and rHH (F) under neutral different models. The parameters were changed accordingly in these simulation models. (G and H) Accumulative distributions of rMHH (G) and rHH (H). Denotation of each line is same as in Câ€“F. (I and J) Accumulative distributions of rMHH (I) and rHH (J) for the case of selection on a standing allele. Selection models for several initial frequencies (IF) of the advantageous allele and a neutral model (neu) were analyzed.
