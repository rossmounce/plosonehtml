                Figure 3. Correlation among poorly performing SNPs The number of discrepancies between HapMap calls and RLMM calls made with the reduced or full feature genotype data. Most SNPs (30,585) are perfectly called with both the full and reduced sets (peach), while another 3,030 poor SNPs fall along the diagonal and are not improved with data from additional features. Those few 2,516 SNPs (red box) that do improve with additional features do not justify redundant designs for all SNPs on the array.
