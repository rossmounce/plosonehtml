The same group of bees (SER-PER group; n = 80) was trained in a double discrimination task with an odorant (‘A’) paired with an electric shock that elicited the sting extension reflex (SER) and with another odorant (‘B’) paired with sucrose solution delivered to the antennae and proboscis that elicited the proboscis extension reflex (PER). a) Bees responded significantly with a SER to the odorant associated with the electric shock (black dots and bar), but not to that associated with sucrose (white dots and bar). b) The same bees responded significantly with a PER to the odorant associated with sucrose (white dots and bar), but not to that associated with electric shock (black dots and bar). One hour after the last conditioning trial, bees still responded correctly to the odorants (bars), even if their respective USs were absent in the tests. As a result of training, bees exhibited the appropriate response to the appropriate odorant. Appetitive and aversive learning can thus be mastered simultaneously. c,d: Control groups trained to discriminate odorants A and B, one of which was non-reinforced and the other reinforced either with electric shock (c: SER group; n = 80) or with sucrose solution (d: PER group; n = 80). c) Bees responded significantly with a SER to the odorant associated with the electric shock (black squares and bar), but not to the non-reinforced odorant (grey squares and bar). The performance of this group did not differ from that of the SER-PER group [compare with a)]. d) Bees responded significantly with a PER to the odorant associated with the sucrose solution (white squares and bar), but not to the non-reinforced odorant (grey squares and bar). The performance of this group was significantly better than that of the SER-PER group [compare with b)]. *: p&lt;0.0001.</p>
