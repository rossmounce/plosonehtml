Responses (SER) of bees trained to discriminate an odorant reinforced with an electric shock (black squares) and a non-reinforced odorant (white squares) during 12 acquisition trials (6 reinforced and 6 non-reinforced). A retention test was conducted 1 h after the last acquisition trial (black bar: odorant previously reinforced; white bar: odorant previously non-reinforced). a) Responses (SER) of control bees injected with Ringer into the brain (n = 40); b) Responses (SER) of bees injected with the octopaminergic antagonist mianserine 3.3 mM into the brain (n = 40); c) Responses (SER) of bees injected with the dopaminergic antagonist flupentixol 2 mM into the brain (n = 40). Ringer-and mianserine-injected bees learned to discriminate the reinforced from the non-reinforced odorant and remembered the difference one hour later. Flupentixol-injected bees did not learn to discriminate the reinforced from the non-reinforced odorant, nor did they respond appropriately in the retention tests. Similar results were obtained with other concentrations of octopaminergic and dopaminergic antagonists (see <a href="#pone-0000288-g006">Fig. 6</a>). These results show that dopamine, but not octopamine receptors are required for aversive olfactory learning in honeybees.</p>
