                Figure 1.  Thermodynamic stability of DNA/DNA (green), sense and antisense RNA/DNA duplexes in a region of chromosome 12 in S. cerevisiae (plots of all sixteen chromosomes are available at http://obzor.bio21.bas.bg/stoyno/).ΔG of RNA/DNA duplexes (blue), containing RNA identical to Watson coding strand represents the sense strand for Watson's ORFs and antisense strand for Crick's ORFs. ΔG of RNA/DNA duplexes (red), containing RNA identical to Crick coding strand represents the sense strand for Crick's ORFs and antisense strand for Watson's ORFs.
