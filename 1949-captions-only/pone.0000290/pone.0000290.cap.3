(A) Relationship between mRNA level and Δ G avg of all coding sequences in intron containing ORFs. (B) Relationship between mRNA level and Δ G avg of coding sequences in intron containing ORFs longer than 2000 bp. (C) Relationship between mRNA level and Δ G for all available EPRs. (D) Relationship between mRNA level and ΔG of EPRs for genes shorter than 250 bp.</p>
