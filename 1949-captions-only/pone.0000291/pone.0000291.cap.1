Amino acid sequences (one-letter code) are shown beneath the underlined coding regions of <em>MTT1</em> and <em>MTT3</em>. Various motifs in sequence flanking both coding regions are indicated on the nucleotide sequence: MTCM1 (Metallothionein Conserved Motif 1) plus and minus strand matches (red and blue highlighted sequences, respectively); a perfect palindrome (boxed region) formed mostly by two inverted MTCM1 motif copies; a 16 nt conserved sequence in the putative 5′UTR of both genes (bold letters); TATA-like boxes (underlined italic letters); potential polyadenylation signals (white letters in black boxes); and potential mRNA degradation signal (bold pink letters in 3′ flanking region). The poly-A tail sites in <em>MTT1</em> (DQ517937 and EF195745) and <em>MTT3</em> (EF195744) are indicated by arrows.</p>
