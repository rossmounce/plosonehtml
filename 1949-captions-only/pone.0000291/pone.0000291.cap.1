                Figure 1.  Nucleotide sequences of the MTT1 and MTT3 genes and flanking regions.Selected segments of the complete macronuclear sequence assembly (about 4.4 Kb) including two Tetrahymena thermophila MT genes (MTT1 and MTT3). Amino acid sequences (one-letter code) are shown beneath the underlined coding regions of MTT1 and MTT3. Various motifs in sequence flanking both coding regions are indicated on the nucleotide sequence: MTCM1 (Metallothionein Conserved Motif 1) plus and minus strand matches (red and blue highlighted sequences, respectively); a perfect palindrome (boxed region) formed mostly by two inverted MTCM1 motif copies; a 16 nt conserved sequence in the putative 5′UTR of both genes (bold letters); TATA-like boxes (underlined italic letters); potential polyadenylation signals (white letters in black boxes); and potential mRNA degradation signal (bold pink letters in 3′ flanking region). The poly-A tail sites in MTT1 (DQ517937 and EF195745) and MTT3 (EF195744) are indicated by arrows.
