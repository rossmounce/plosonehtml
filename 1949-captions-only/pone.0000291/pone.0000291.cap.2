Additional features: a segment of partial red and blue overlap between two inverted copies of MTCM1 is shaded lavender; a 476-bp duplicated region (one duplicate is underlined, the other italicized); a 63 bp intron in the 3â€²UTR is highlighted yellow, with blue underscoring to indicate a 32-nucleotide potential stem-and-loop structure; Numbered arrows: PolyA addition sites inferred, from GenBank cDNA and EST submissions, as the junction between genomic sequence and a run of at least 5 As absent from it. The physical addition site is ambiguous when the genomic sequence contains one or more adenines at the right of the junction, as defined. (Accession numbers corresponding to each arrow: 1: CX576461, CX576877 and DQ517936; 2: CX577509; 3: CX576383; 4: CX572435; 5: CX573352 and CX578296; 6: CX581879, CX590118, and our unpublished observations; 7: CX574235.</p>
