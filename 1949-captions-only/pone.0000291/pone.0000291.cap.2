                Figure 2.  Nucleotide sequence of the MTT5 gene and flanking regions.Motifs shared with MTT1 and MTT3 are indicated as in Figure 1. Additional features: a segment of partial red and blue overlap between two inverted copies of MTCM1 is shaded lavender; a 476-bp duplicated region (one duplicate is underlined, the other italicized); a 63 bp intron in the 3â€²UTR is highlighted yellow, with blue underscoring to indicate a 32-nucleotide potential stem-and-loop structure; Numbered arrows: PolyA addition sites inferred, from GenBank cDNA and EST submissions, as the junction between genomic sequence and a run of at least 5 As absent from it. The physical addition site is ambiguous when the genomic sequence contains one or more adenines at the right of the junction, as defined.
