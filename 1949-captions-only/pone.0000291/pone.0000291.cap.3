                Figure 3.  Alignment of eight Tetrahymena metallothioneins.Key to Tetrahymena species abbreviations: Tthe = T. thermophila, Tpyr = T. pyriformis; Tpig = T. pigmentosa. The protein sequences were aligned using the T-Coffee software with default settings without any manual adjustments. Cys and Lys residues are highlighted in green and blue, respectively. Numbers represent the position of the last amino acid in each row. The top 5 proteins correspond to subfamily 1, while the bottom three belong in subfamily 2, as defined in the text.
