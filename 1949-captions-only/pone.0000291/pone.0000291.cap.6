Gene expression levels are shown relative to an untreated control (which is set at 1±0.0 for every gene). Normalization of expression was achieved against the amplification of an endogenous gene (α-tubulin). Each bar of the histogram corresponds to an average value ±SD of two or three independent experiments. Heavy metal concentrations are as reported in the <a href="#s4">Material &amp; Methods</a>; Cd+ refers to 27 µM Cd plus 80 µM Cu; treatments times were: 1 h (light bars) and 24 h (dark bars) for all heavy metals. See <a href="#pone.0000291.s002">Table S2</a> for numerical values. Panel D. Relative expression levels for each gene, in the order <em>MTT1</em> (blue bars), <em>MTT3</em> (green bars) and <em>MTT5</em> (red bars), after induction by stress treatments other than heavy metals. Temperature treatments were for 2h, pH and Paraquat treatments were for 24 h, while starvation treatments were for 24 hrs and 4 days.</p>
