                Figure 7.  Hierarchical modular structure of the DNA sequence in the MTT5 5â€² flanking region.The two major tandem 416-bp repeats are delimited by blank lines; a three-bp gap (dashed) has been introduced in the first repeat in order to facilitate visual detection of the two repeats. Grey highlight: MTCM1 motif; underlined: degraded versions of MTCM1. Aqua (TCA) and yellow (TGA) shading within MTCM1: elements of the AP1 binding site-like heptanucleotide TGA(A/T)TCA, and of a TCATGA palindromic hexanucleotide that overlaps the AP1-like site; this shading is included to facilitate visual identification of the orientation of various MTCM1 copies. Nucleotide substitutions between the two repeats are boxed. Underlined ATG at the end of the sequence: MTT5 start codon.
