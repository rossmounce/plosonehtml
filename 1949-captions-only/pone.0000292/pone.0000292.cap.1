                Figure 1.  Subunit expression of cardiac L-VDCC subunits in human myocardial specimens(a) Human specimens from non-failing (NF) and failing (F) myocardium (n = 4–5) were analyzed in immunoblots using specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the particular L-VDCC subunits. (b) L-VDCC subunit expression was normalized to cardiac calsequestrin protein expression in the same sample (number of NF/F specimens was always identical for each subunit; n = 5–8). Quantitative analysis of subunit protein expression is depicted as ratio of F vs. NF. * p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.0001. (c) mRNA expression of β-subunit isoforms (NF: n = 5; F: n = 9–13) was measured by real time PCR, and always normalized to cardiac calsequestrin mRNA expression. * p&lt;0.05.
