                Figure 3.  Immunocytochemistry shows increased sarcolemmal expression of CaV1.2 and β2-subunits in ventricular myocytes from old tg CaV1.2 mice(a) Immunocytochemistry of cardiomyocytes isolated from 10 months old wild-type or tg CaV1.2 mice. Controls show no specific interaction for TRITC labeled secondary antibody and labeling of sarcolemma, T-tubules and intercalated discs by Oregon Green 488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA).
(b,c) Primary antibodies directed against CaV1.2 and β2-subunits, respectively, demonstrate predominant t-tubular localization of the respective antigens in old wild-type and tg CaV1.2.
