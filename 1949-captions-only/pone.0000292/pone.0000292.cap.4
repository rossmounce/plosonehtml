                Figure 4.  tg mouse model with an inducible cardiac overexpression of the β2a under control of a hybrid bombyx-ecdysone receptor(a) For cardiac-specific expression the hybrid bombyx-ecdysone receptor (VgBmEcR) was placed under the control of αMHC promoter (for details see Materials and Methods). Transgenic mice (tgind β2a) positive for the hybrid bombyx-ecdysone receptor and the construct of the ecdysone response element (EcRE) and the β2a, respectively, are identified in Southern blots. The radiolabeled probe specific for the coding sequence of VgBmEcR was generated by SacI digestion. It hybridized to a 3.7 kb band in transgene mouse genomic DNA digested by EcoRI digest; the radiolabeled DNA probe specific for the coding sequence of β2a was generated by HindIII/KpnI digest. It hybridized to a 2.4 kb band of genomic DNA digested with HindIII/BamHI in tgind β2a but not in WT. 
(b) 48 h after treatment with the inducing drug tebufenozide (+T) Western-blot analysis with ventricular tissue from 4–5 month old mice reveals increased expression of β2-protein in tgind β2a compared to treated wild-type or sham-induced transgenics.
(c) Exemplary traces of single-channel recordings from murine ventricular myocytes. Induction of cardiac overexpression of the β2a (+T) does not alter single-channel behavior compared to either wild-type mice after treatment with the inducing drug or i.p-application of only the vehicle (water/oil-emulsion) to β2a-transgenic mice (“sham”). Data were obtained by patch-clamp recordings using cell-attached configuration (charge carrier: 70 mM Ba2+; holding potential: −100 mV; test potential: +20 mV for 150 ms). Bottom traces show ensemble average currents from the respective experiment.
