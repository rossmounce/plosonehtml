Transgenic mice (tg<sub>ind</sub> β<sub>2a</sub>) positive for the hybrid bombyx-ecdysone receptor and the construct of the ecdysone response element (EcRE) and the β<sub>2a</sub>, respectively, are identified in Southern blots. The radiolabeled probe specific for the coding sequence of VgBmEcR was generated by SacI digestion. It hybridized to a 3.7 kb band in transgene mouse genomic DNA digested by EcoRI digest; the radiolabeled DNA probe specific for the coding sequence of β<sub>2a</sub> was generated by HindIII/KpnI digest. It hybridized to a 2.4 kb band of genomic DNA digested with HindIII/BamHI in tg<sub>ind</sub> β<sub>2a</sub> but not in WT. </p>

Induction of cardiac overexpression of the β<sub>2a</sub> (+T) does not alter single-channel behavior compared to either wild-type mice after treatment with the inducing drug or i.p-application of only the vehicle (water/oil-emulsion) to β<sub>2a</sub>-transgenic mice (“sham”). Data were obtained by patch-clamp recordings using cell-attached configuration (charge carrier: 70 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>; holding potential: −100 mV; test potential: +20 mV for 150 ms). Bottom traces show ensemble average currents from the respective experiment.</p>
