Compared to 4–5 months old mice showing a cardiac overexpression of the human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (tg Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2), the inducing compound tebufenozide (T) significantly increased single L-VDCC activity in ventricular myocytes from age-matched double-transgenics (tg Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2×tg<sub>ind</sub> β<sub>2a</sub>, showing an additional inducible β<sub>2a</sub>-overexpression) 48 h after drug administration. Overexpression of the β<sub>2a</sub>-subunit without overexpression of the human Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 does not alter single-channel gating (cp. <a href="#pone-0000292-g004">Figure 4c</a>). Tebufenozide treatment does not affect single-channel gating in ventricular myocytes from wild-type mice. Data were obtained by patch-clamp recordings using cell-attached configuration (charge carrier: 70 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>; holding potential: −100 mV; test potential: +20 mV for 150 ms). *p&lt;0.05 and <sup>(</sup>*<sup>)</sup>p&lt;0.09 compared to tg Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in Student's t-test.

Activity of single L-VDCC is clearly higher in old (≥9 months, failing) tg Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 compared to channels from young (4–5 months, non-failing) tg Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. Induction of β<sub>2</sub>-overexpression in hearts of young tg<sub>ind</sub> β<sub>2a</sub>×tg Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 by tebufenozide mimicks the heart-failure phenotype of L-VDCC gating otherwise not observed until tg Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 enter the “Maladaptive State” at an age ≥9 months. T = tebufenozide. Data were obtained by patch-clamp recordings using the cell-attached configuration (charge carrier: 70 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>; holding potential: −100 mV; test potential: +20 mV for 150 ms). Bottom traces show average currents from the respective experiment.</p>
