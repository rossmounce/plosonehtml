                Figure 1.  Phenotypical and cytological characterization of pCSCs.A &amp; B, The phenotype of pCSC clones (A) and monocytic cell clones (B) from the same mouse (14): the data shown are a representative of pCSC (2C4; A) and monocytic clones (3B11; B). The phenotype of the 2C4 clone was similar to 3B5C and 3B6C clones (not shown). Red histograms represent isotype mAbs (A &amp; B), and black (A) or green (B) histograms represent specific mAbs. C, Phase contrast micrographs: a representative (2C4) of 3 pCSC clones (top panel) and differentiated DC-like clone (3B11) from the same mouse (bottom panel; original magnification ×200). D, Comparison of cytology between the pCSCs, 3B11, and HSCs: HSC-enriched CD34−Lin− and CD34+Lin− cells were sorted by FACSorter from the BM of B6 mice (Wright-Giemsa staining; original magnification ×1000). DC-like cell line 3B11 was derived from the same mouse of the pCSCs. E, The karyotype of pCSCs: a representative of 2C4 clone that exhibits a pseudodiploid karyotype with multiple chromosomal translocations identical to the 3B5C and 3B6C clones (not shown). Left panel: karyotype of the 2C4 clone; right panel: an example of Robertsonian translocations in the 3B11 clone.
