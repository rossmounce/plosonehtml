Donor-specific CD45.2<sup>+</sup> lymphoid (CD3ε<sup>+</sup>) and myeloid (CD11b<sup>+</sup> or Gr-1<sup>+</sup>) cells were monitored by flow cytometric analysis of blood cells starting from 4 wks post transfer, once every two wks, until 18 wks (A). The mice were sacrificed 10 moths post transfer, and the blood and BM cells were collected for HANDS-Nested DNA PCR to identify donor-derived cells (B). To verify the self-renewal capability of the long-term repopulated donor cells, 1×10<sup>6</sup> BM cells from the primary recipients were injected i.v. into the secondary recipients, which were sacrificed 10 wks post transfer. The pCSC-derived <em>neo<sup>r</sup></em> gene in the BM, liver, and spleen was determined by HANDS-Nested DNA PCR (C). The data shown in B are from a recipient with transient expansion of pCSC-derived hematopoietic cells at 8 and 13 wks post transfer, and the data shown in C &amp; D are from one of 3 experiments (5~10 mice/group/expt).</p>
