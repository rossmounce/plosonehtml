                Figure 3.  pCSCs can differentiate into various type of tissue cells.A, Differentiation of pCSCs into hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells: The lethally irradiated CD45.1 congenic B6 mice were injected i.v. with 1×106 2C4 (n = 5) or eGFP+ 2C4G2 cells (n = 10), along with 5×105 recipient-type BM cells, as described above. The mice were sacrificed 5 months post transfer. Various organs, including the liver, kidney, spleen and adipose tissues were harvested, fixed in 10% formaldehyde of PBS, prepared for H &amp; E. staining, and examined under fluorescent microscope. At least three discontinuous sections (100 µm/step) were examined for each organ to ensure that eGFP+ cells were identified under the fluorescent microscope. The morphology of eGFP+ cells was determined under the bright field of the fluorescent microscope (original magnification ×1000). B–E, Development of pCSCs in blastocyst chimeric mice: E3.5 dpc of FVB mice were injected with 2C4G2 (8~10 cells per blastocyst) and transferred to pseudopregnant surrogate mothers. The progeny were delivered and grew to adult without any complication. The data shown are from one of two experiments in which 8 progeny (male: n = 6; female: n = 2) were obtained. One male mouse died of fighting at 3 months of age. B, eGFP+ RBCs in 7/8 of the chimeric mice: The data represent the air-dried blood smears from two mice, at the age of 2 months, examined under, respectively, the bright and fluorescent fields of a fluorescent microscope (Nike, E400, Japan). C, pCSC-derived eGFP+CD45+ cells: peripheral blood was harvested from the chimeric mice at age 2 months (n = 6; other two pregnant mice were not examined) or control FVB mice (n = 10), stained with PE-conjugated mAb to CD45, and analyzed by flow cytometry. D &amp; E, Living image of the chimeric mice: A representative living image of the chimeric mice at 4 months of age is shown in D, demonstrated by IVIS imaging systems incorporated with Living Imaging® software (Xenogen Inc.); and the eGFP-derived photon counts in the region of interest (ROI) of 7 mice are shown in E. Normal FVB mice were used as control for living imaging.
