The samples were analyzed by three- (A) or four-color flow cytometry (B). The green and red dot plots or histograms represent, respectively, the tumor cells derived from eGFP<sup>+</sup> 2C4G2 (green) and eGFP<sup>âˆ’</sup> 2C4 (red) cells (A). Five populations (p1~5) of tumor cells are identified based on the level of CD45 and eGFP expression (B).</p>
