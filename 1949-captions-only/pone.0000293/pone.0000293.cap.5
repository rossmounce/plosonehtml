                Figure 5.  Phenotypic alterations of pCSCs progressing to cancer.Single tumor cells were either prepared and freshly stained with mAb to CD45 and a mixture of lineage-specific mAbs to CD3, CD11b, Ter-119, Gr-1 and B220 (A) or cultured for 2 d and stained with mAb to CD45 in combination with mAbs to lineage markers or to c-kit and Sca-1 as indicated (B). The samples were analyzed by three- (A) or four-color flow cytometry (B). The green and red dot plots or histograms represent, respectively, the tumor cells derived from eGFP+ 2C4G2 (green) and eGFPâˆ’ 2C4 (red) cells (A). Five populations (p1~5) of tumor cells are identified based on the level of CD45 and eGFP expression (B).
