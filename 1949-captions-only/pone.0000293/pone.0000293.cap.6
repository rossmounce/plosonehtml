The data represent at least 3 experiments. B, Inhibition of pCSC expansion <em>in vitro</em> by mili-specific siRNA: 2C4 cells (100 cells/well) were either transfected or not by mili-specific siRNA (100 nMol) or mock-transfected in triplicate in 24-well plates. The cells were counted at indicated times. The data represent 5 experiments. **, p&lt;0.01 as compared to the mock- or non-transfected groups. C, Knockdown of <em>mili</em> mRNA by mili-specific siRNA: 2C4 cells (1×10<sup>6</sup>/well) were transfected by mili-siRNA or scramble nucleotide (nt) RNA, and harvested 48 hrs post transfection. The expression of <em>mili</em> mRNA was revealed by RT-PCR. The data represent 3 experiments.</p>
