                Figure 6.  Exclusive expression of piwil2 and embryonic stem cell-related genes in pCSCs.A, Exclusive expression of mili (piwil2) gene in pCSCs: Total RNA was isolated randomly from 2C4, 3B5C and 3B6C cell cultures at various times or from the CD34+Lin− and CD34−Lin− BM cells of B6 mice, which were purified by FACS Aria in 3 separate experiments, and was subject to RT-PCR analysis for embryonic, germ-line, and adult stem cell-related stemness genes and oncogenic genes. The data represent at least 3 experiments. B, Inhibition of pCSC expansion in vitro by mili-specific siRNA: 2C4 cells (100 cells/well) were either transfected or not by mili-specific siRNA (100 nMol) or mock-transfected in triplicate in 24-well plates. The cells were counted at indicated times. The data represent 5 experiments. **, p&lt;0.01 as compared to the mock- or non-transfected groups. C, Knockdown of mili mRNA by mili-specific siRNA: 2C4 cells (1×106/well) were transfected by mili-siRNA or scramble nucleotide (nt) RNA, and harvested 48 hrs post transfection. The expression of mili mRNA was revealed by RT-PCR. The data represent 3 experiments.
