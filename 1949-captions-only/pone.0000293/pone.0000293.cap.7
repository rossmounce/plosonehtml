Schematic construct of Lenti-GFP-Mili viral vector. B, The effect of ectopic expression of <em>mili</em> on marrow cell proliferation: BM cells from B6 mice were transduced with Lenti-GFP-Mili or Lenti-GFP viruses in 24-well plates (n = 4 well/group), as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. The number of GFP<sup>+</sup> colonies were counted at indicated times. **, p&lt;0.01, compared to Lenti-GFP group. C, Representative eGFP<sup>+</sup> EB-like colonies at day 10 post transduction (arrow). The micrographs were taken under the inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U, Japan), using original magnification: Ã—200.</p>
