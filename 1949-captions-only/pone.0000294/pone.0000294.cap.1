                Figure 1. Characterization of japonica TARs. (A) Classification of all identified TARs based on known transcriptional evidence and sequences of known origin. Exon, exons of annotated gene models; Unigene, rice Unigenes in GenBank; Repeat, plant repetitive sequences and organelle insertions. (B) Density of different sets of transcription units along Chromosome 8. The number of transcription units was calculated in 500 Kb-sliding-windows with a 100 Kb step. Position of the centromere is indicated by the triangle. (C) Venn diagram showing the comparison of japonica non-exonic TARs with indica transcription units. Two independent comparisons were made. First, the japonica non-exonic TARs were compared with annotated indica gene models. Second, the japonica non-exonic TARs were compared with indica non-exonic TARs, which were identified outside of gene models from tiling array analysis of the indica genome. Shaded areas indicate japonica TARs that overlap with indica gene models or non-exonic TARs.
