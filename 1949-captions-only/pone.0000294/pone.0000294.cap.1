(A) Classification of all identified TARs based on known transcriptional evidence and sequences of known origin. Exon, exons of annotated gene models; Unigene, rice Unigenes in GenBank; Repeat, plant repetitive sequences and organelle insertions. (B) Density of different sets of transcription units along Chromosome 8. The number of transcription units was calculated in 500 Kb-sliding-windows with a 100 Kb step. Position of the centromere is indicated by the triangle. (C) Venn diagram showing the comparison of <em>japonica</em> non-exonic TARs with <em>indica</em> transcription units. Two independent comparisons were made. First, the <em>japonica</em> non-exonic TARs were compared with annotated <em>indica</em> gene models. Second, the <em>japonica</em> non-exonic TARs were compared with <em>indica</em> non-exonic TARs, which were identified outside of gene models from tiling array analysis of the <em>indica</em> genome. Shaded areas indicate <em>japonica</em> TARs that overlap with <em>indica</em> gene models or non-exonic TARs.</p>
