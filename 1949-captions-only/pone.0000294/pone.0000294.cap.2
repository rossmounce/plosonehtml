(A) Transcription of gene models and TARs detected by the re-array. Shown on the left is a tree diagram of the overall transcriptional relation of gene models among the 10 assayed tissue types computed with the Manhattan distance function. Expression rates in percentage of all gene models, the PASA gene models, and non-exonic TARs are shown on the right. (B) Heat map of differentially expressed gene models and non-exonic TARs. The red and yellow colors represent up- and down-regulated transcription units, respectively. The gene tree is shown on the left. Numbers on top represent the tissue types: 1, developing seed, 2, carpel, 3, whole flower, 4, dark-grown seedling, 5, seedling root, 6, light-grown seedling, 7, flag leaf, 8, leaf, 9, <em>Xoo</em>-infected leaf.</p>
