                Figure 3. Analysis of non-exonic TARs representing portions of annotated gene models. (A) Number of TARs in different components of the rice genome. (B) Relative frequency of TARs in different genomic compartments. Note that strandedness of the TARs was not considered in this analysis. TAR frequency was calculated as the number of TARs per Mb and normalized to the genomic TAR frequency. (C) The RT-PCR assay to examine whether a gene/TAR pair belongs to the same transcript in which primer pairs target the gene model and the TAR in a convergent fashion. (D) Examples of PCR products amplified in a reverse transcription (RT) dependent manner for the gene/TAR pairs Os10g21310 and Chr10fwd_10366435 (left), and Os02g50070 and Chr2fwd_30528038 (right). (E) Confirmation rates obtained for intronic TARs and proximal intergenic TARs by RT-PCR.
