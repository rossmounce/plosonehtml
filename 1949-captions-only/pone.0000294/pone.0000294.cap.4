                Figure 4. Experimental verification of selected non-exonic TARs representing uncharacterized portions of gene models. (A) Annotation of an intronic TAR. The TAR Chr4rev_30188695 is in the first intron of the gene model Os04g51690. A TAR-containing transcript was proposed in which the TAR serves as the alternative first exon. (B) RT-PCR analysis of the transcript abundance in diverse conditions for the FL-cDNA AK102588 and the TAR-initiated alternative transcript. Positions of the primers are indicated by the asterisks shown in (A). (C) Annotation of a proximal intergenic TAR 3â€² to a gene model. Arrows indicate the primer positions.
