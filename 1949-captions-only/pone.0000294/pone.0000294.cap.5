                Figure 5. Characterization of antisense TARs. (A) Pie chart analysis of antisense TARs. Of the 8256 antisense TARs, 7061 were expressed in at least one tissue type according to the re-array (left), 4993 were antisense to a non-TE gene model (center), of which 884 had a transcriptional correlation coefficient with the corresponding gene models in the 10 assayed tissue types &lt;âˆ’0.4 (right). (B) Scatterplot of the relative transcription level of the gene model/antisense TAR pairs in the cultured cell versus their correlation coefficient across the 10 assayed tissue types. (C) Annotation of an antisense TAR. The TAR Chr4rev_5677533 overlaps convergently with the gene model Os04g10780. (D) Transcription level of the TAR Chr4rev_5677533 and the gene model Os04g10780 in the 10 assayed tissue types. 1, cultured cell, 2, seedling root, 3, dark-grown seedling, 4, light-grown seedling, 5, leaf, 6, Xoo-infected leaf, 7, flag leaf, 8, whole flower, 9, carpel, and 10, developing seed. (E) Northern blot analysis of small RNA related to antisense TARs. The probes were PCR products derived from antisense TARs. The migration positions of a 21 nt RNA are indicated by the black triangle.
