                Figure 7. Analysis of 5â€² proximal antisense TARs. (A) Annotation of TAR Chr4rev_22552532 that locates in a divergent antisense orientation to the gene model Os04g38590. (B) Predicted secondary structure of the RNA transcript derived from the TAR Chr4rev_22552532. RNA secondary structure was predicted using RNAfold, which is available as part of the Vienna RNA Package.
