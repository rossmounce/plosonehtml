                Figure 2.  Trophic skew in regional invasions versus combined global and regional extinctions broken down by percentage of species in each trophic group.Colors indicate trophic level (white = 1, light grey = 2, dark grey = 3, black = 4). Extinctions are skewed towards trophic levels 3 and 4 (secondary consumers and predators) while invasions are skewed towards trophic level 2 (primary consumers).
