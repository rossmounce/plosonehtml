Colors indicate trophic level (white = 1, light grey = 2, dark grey = 3, black = 4). Patterns match those in the larger global/regional data set (<a href="#pone-0000295-g002">Fig. 2</a>), with extinctions and invasions occurring within different trophic groups, and neither matching the natural trophic distribution of species.</p>
