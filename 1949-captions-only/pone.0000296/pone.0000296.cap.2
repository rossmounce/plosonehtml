                Figure 2. Scaling of ED scores with clade size for ten Critically Endangered mammal species. ED scores were calculated at each node between the tips and root for ten species in different orders. Species chosen are: the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii), persian mole (Talpa streeti), Omiltemi rabbit (Sylvilagus insonus), Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), black-faced lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara), Livingstone's flying fox (Pteropus livingstonii), red wolf (Canis rufus) and northern Luzon shrew rat (Crunomys fallax). See Materials and Methods for further details.
