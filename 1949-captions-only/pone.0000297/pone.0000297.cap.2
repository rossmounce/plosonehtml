                Figure 2.  The differences in: (a) log bat active minutes (high EMF minus control).A negative value indicates that bat activity was higher at the control site than at the site subject to a high electromagnetic field strength (&gt;2 v/m). (b) log total number of bat passes (high EMF minus control). Each triad of differences represent a single radar site (n = 10).
