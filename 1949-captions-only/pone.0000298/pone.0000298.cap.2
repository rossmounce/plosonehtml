                Figure 2.  Tripotential differentiation of NS cells in vitro and generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo.(A–E) Quantitative marker expression and representative immunofluorescence images. The specific culture conditions used to differentiate NS cells resulted in the generation of oligodendrocytes (~20%) positive for O4 (B), Rip (D) and PLP (E), GFAP-expressing astrocytes (~40%; C–D) and neurons positive for ß-III tubulin/TUJ1 (~10%; C). (F–H) NS cells cultured in N2 medium and proliferated for 4 days in the presence of FGF2, PDGF and forskolin were transplanted into the brain of 2- to 3-day-old myelin-deficient rats. Two weeks after transplantation, the engrafted cells had formed PLP-positive myelin internodes. Shown are representative pictures from septum (F) and corpus callosum (G–H). Scale bars B–D, 100 µm; F–H, 20 µm.
