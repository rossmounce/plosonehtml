Scale bar, 20 µm. (B) Neuronal currents elicited by optical activation of Halo. <em>Left</em>, representative outward currents elicited by two 1-second pulses of yellow (560±27.5 nm) light (~10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) in a voltage-clamped neuron held at −70mV. <em>Right</em>, population data for <em>n</em> = 22 neurons. In this and subsequent figures, gray bars represent mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise indicated. Yellow bars in this and subsequent figures represent the period of yellow light exposure. (C) Kinetic properties of yellow light-elicited, Halo-mediated currents from voltage-clamped neurons. (i), 15–85% current onset time; (ii), 85–15% offset time. For each measurement, data is presented from neurons held at −70 mV, −30 mV and+10 mV (<em>left</em> to <em>right</em>). In this panel, gray bars represent mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). (D) Neuronal hyperpolarizations elicited by optical activation of Halo. <em>Left</em>, representative membrane voltage hyperpolarizations elicited by two 1-second pulses of yellow light, in a current-clamped neuron held at resting membrane potential. <em>Right</em>, population data for <em>n</em> = 19 neurons. (E) Kinetic properties of yellow light-elicited, Halo-mediated hyperpolarizations from current-clamped neurons, including both 15–85% voltage change onset time and 85–15% offset time.</p>
