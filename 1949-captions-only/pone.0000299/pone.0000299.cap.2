                Figure 2.  Safety of Halo in cultured hippocampal neurons.(A) Membrane resting potential of Halo-expressing vs. wild-type neurons (n = 19 each). (B) Membrane resistance of Halo-expressing vs. wild-type neurons. (C) Fraction of Halo-expressing (n = 22) vs. wild-type (n = 308) cultured neurons whose nuclei stained positive for the membrane-integrity assessing DNA stain ethidium homodimer-1.
