Each light pulse lasts 10 ms, and the Poisson train has a mean inter-pulse interval of λ = 100 ms. (B) Voltage traces of three different representative current-clamped neurons exposed to the same Poisson train of light pulses (λ = 100 ms). (C) Properties of hyperpolarization events elicited by Poisson trains with inter-pulse interval λ = 100 ms (i, ii) and λ = 200 ms (iii, iv), plotted versus onset time of each light pulse. Plots (i) and (iii) show the peak amplitude of each hyperpolarization event (black symbols), as well as the across-trials standard deviation of these amplitude values across ten trials (gray symbols). Plots (ii) and (iv) show the latency between the onset time of the light pulse and the time of the hyperpolarization peak (black symbols), as well as the across-trials standard deviation of these timing values across ten trials (gray symbols). In this panel, plotted points are across-neuron mean±S.E.M. (<em>n</em> = 5 neurons). (D) Comparison of the peak hyperpolarization (i) and the time-to-peak (ii) data between the beginning (first5) and end (last5) of each Poisson train, for the <em>n</em> = 5 neurons described in <a href="#pone-0000299-g003">Fig. 3C</a>. In (i): for each neuron, the average of the first 5 or last 5 hyperpolarization peaks (black) or the across-trials standard deviation of these amplitude values (gray) was first computed, then the across-neuron mean±S.E.M. was plotted. In (ii): for each neuron, the average of the first 5 or last 5 times-to-peak (black) or the across-trials standard deviation of these times-to-peak (gray) were first computed, then the across-neuron mean±S.E.M. was plotted. For (ii), the gray bars were stacked on top of the black ones for ease of visualization.</p>
