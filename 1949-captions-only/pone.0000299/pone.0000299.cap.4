(B) Population data (<em>n</em> = 6 neurons) for light-driven, Halo-mediated spike blockade, showing high spike probability during periods of darkness (spikes 1–6, 12–16, and 18–20), and low spike probability during periods of yellow light illumination (spikes 7–11 and spike 17). Error bars (S.E.M.) are smaller than the points plotted.</p>
