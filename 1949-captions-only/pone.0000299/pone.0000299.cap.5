(ii) Timecourse of Halo-mediated hyperpolarization for the same cell exhibited in (i), but when Halo function is facilitated by a 400-ms pulse of blue light in between the 15-second period of yellow light and the first 1-second test pulse. (B) Population data for blue-light facilitation of Halo recovery (<em>n</em> = 8 neurons). Plotted are the hyperpolarizations elicited by the four 1-second test pulses of yellow light, normalized to the peak hyperpolarization induced by the original 15-second yellow light pulse. Dots represent meanÂ±S.E.M. Black dots represent experiments when no blue light pulse was delivered (as in <a href="#pone-0000299-g005">Fig. 5Ai.</a>). Open blue dots represent experiments when 400 ms of blue light was delivered to facilitate recovery (as in <a href="#pone-0000299-g005">Fig. 5Aii.</a>).</p>
