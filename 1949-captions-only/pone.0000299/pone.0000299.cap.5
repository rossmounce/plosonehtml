                Figure 5.  Blue light facilitates optimal Halo function.(A) (i) Timecourse of Halo-mediated hyperpolarizations in a representative current-clamped hippocampal neuron during 15 seconds of continuous yellow light, followed by four 1-second test pulses of yellow light (one every 30 seconds, starting 10 seconds after the end of the first 15-second period of yellow light). (ii) Timecourse of Halo-mediated hyperpolarization for the same cell exhibited in (i), but when Halo function is facilitated by a 400-ms pulse of blue light in between the 15-second period of yellow light and the first 1-second test pulse. (B) Population data for blue-light facilitation of Halo recovery (n = 8 neurons). Plotted are the hyperpolarizations elicited by the four 1-second test pulses of yellow light, normalized to the peak hyperpolarization induced by the original 15-second yellow light pulse. Dots represent meanÂ±S.E.M. Black dots represent experiments when no blue light pulse was delivered (as in Fig. 5Ai.). Open blue dots represent experiments when 400 ms of blue light was delivered to facilitate recovery (as in Fig. 5Aii.).
