                Figure 6.  Bi-directional optical control of voltage with blue and yellow light pulses.(A) Action spectrum for ChR2 (blue, adapted from [71]), overlaid with absorption spectrum for N. pharaonis halorhodopsin (orange, adapted from [32]). Each spectrum is normalized to its own peak, for ease of comparison. Gray bars denote bandpass windows of commercially-available Chroma HQ450/50× and HQ590/55× filters, which may be useful for high-fidelity fast-wavelength switching between ChR2 photostimulation and Halo photoinhibition. (B) Co-expression of ChR2-mCherry (left) and Halo-GFP (middle) in a single representative cell expressing both (right, overlay). Scale bar, 20 µm. (C) Hyperpolarization and depolarization events elicited in a single representative neuron, by two interleaved 2.5 Hz trains of yellow and blue light pulses (50 ms duration), denoted by bars of respective coloration. (D) Hyperpolarization and depolarization events induced in a representative neuron by a Poisson train (mean inter-pulse interval λ = 100 ms) of alternating pulses of yellow and blue light (10 ms duration), denoted by appropriate colors.
