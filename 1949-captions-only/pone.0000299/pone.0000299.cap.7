(i), stimulus traces showing subsegments of the somatically injected filtered Gaussian white noise current used in all these experiments (top), as well as of the Poisson train (mean inter-pulse interval λ = 100 ms) of alternating yellow and blue light pulses (bottom). (ii), twenty-trace overlays of voltage responses to the somatically injected white noise current, either with no light (top, black traces) or with delivery of a Poisson train of yellow and blue light pulses (bottom, green traces). (iii), spike raster plots for the traces shown in <a href="#pone-0000299-g007">Fig. 7Aii</a>. (iv), spike-timing histograms (bin size: 500 µs) for the rasters shown in <a href="#pone-0000299-g007">Fig. 7Aiii</a>. (B) Spike rates of neurons (<em>n</em> = 7) injected with filtered Gaussian white noise current, either with no light (left) or with concurrent delivery of a Poisson train of yellow and blue light pulses (right). Plotted is mean±S.E.M. (C) Cross-correlation between spike trains elicited from the same filtered Gaussian white noise current injection, played twice, when either both current injections were performed in the dark (black curve), or when one of the current injections was performed with concurrent delivery of a Poisson train of yellow and blue light pulses (green trace). Data is plotted as mean±S.E.M (averaged across <em>n</em> = 7 neurons). See <a href="#s4">Methods</a> for details.</p>
