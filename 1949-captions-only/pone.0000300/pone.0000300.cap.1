                Figure 1. Effect of γc cytokines on HIV specific T cell responses in a chronic progressor. Fresh ex vivo PBMC from an HIV infected individual with chronic progression (Pt# 11) were incubated overnight in the following culture conditions: medium, IL-2 (20U/ml), IL-15 (20 ng/ml), IL-15+IL-7 (20 ng/ml each), or IL-4 (20 ng/ml). The following day, cells were washed twice, resuspended in plain medium and then stimulated with control antigen (DMSO) or a gag peptide pool in the presence of Monensin, and then stained for intracellular cytokines. Shown are dot plots of gag or control antigen stimulated samples from PBMC in respective culture conditions, for CD4+ T cells (a) or CD8+ T cells (b). The upper right numbers in the right hand panels indicate the % of HIV gag specific IFN-γ producing CD4+ or CD8+ T cells after subtraction from DMSO controls (left panel).
