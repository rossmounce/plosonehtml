The following day, cells were washed twice, resuspended in plain medium and then stimulated with control antigen (DMSO) or a <em>gag</em> peptide pool in the presence of Monensin, and then stained for intracellular cytokines. Shown are dot plots of <em>gag</em> or control antigen stimulated samples from PBMC in respective culture conditions, for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (a) or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (b). The upper right numbers in the right hand panels indicate the % of HIV <em>gag</em> specific IFN-γ producing CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after subtraction from DMSO controls (left panel).</p>
