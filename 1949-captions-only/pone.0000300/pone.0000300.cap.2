                Figure 2. Effect of γc cytokines on HIV specific T cell responses in an acute seroconverter. Fresh ex vivo PBMC from an HIV infected individual with acute HIV infection (Pt# 5) were incubated overnight similarly to as in Figure 1. Shown are dot plots of HIV gag antigen stimulated samples for CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (DMSO control conditions not shown). The upper right numbers indicate the % of HIV gag specific IFN-γ producing CD4+ (left panel) or CD8+ T cells (right panel) after subtraction from DMSO controls (not shown).
