PBMC were then washed and then exposed to HIV <em>gag</em> or control antigen (not shown) and tested for intracellular IFN-γ. Shown are dot plots of antigen stimulated conditions for CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The increased numbers of IFN-γ producing T cells after IL-15 exposure is not associated with any dilution of CFSE staining. Numbers represent % of HIV <em>gag</em> specific IFN-γ producing cells. Shown, are representative data of one of three experiments.</p>
