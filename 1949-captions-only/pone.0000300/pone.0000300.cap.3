                Figure 3. Effect of γc cytokine treatment on proliferation of HIV specific T cells. Ex vivo PBMC obtained from Participant #7 were labeled with CFSE and then incubated in medium or IL-15 as described above. PBMC were then washed and then exposed to HIV gag or control antigen (not shown) and tested for intracellular IFN-γ. Shown are dot plots of antigen stimulated conditions for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The increased numbers of IFN-γ producing T cells after IL-15 exposure is not associated with any dilution of CFSE staining. Numbers represent % of HIV gag specific IFN-γ producing cells. Shown, are representative data of one of three experiments.
