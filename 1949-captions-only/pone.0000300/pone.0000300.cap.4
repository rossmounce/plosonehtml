PBMC from three HLA A*0201 individuals with chronic progression were cultured overnight in medium, IL-2 or IL-15 as described in <a href="#pone-0000300-g001">Figure 1</a>. Cells were then washed and exposed to the A*0201 restricted p17 peptide of HIV and then stained for intracellular IFN-γ, CD8, and with a p17 specific tetramer. Dots plots for one individual are shown in (a) after gaiting on CD8. Large numbers (%) in upper right quadrants indicate the% of tetramer staining cells that co-stain for IFN-γ. Small numbers in all quadrants represent % of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Summary data from all three individuals are shown depicting in (b) the % of tetramer staining cells which also produce IFN-γ (upper R/upper R+lower R quadrant) , in (c) the % of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN-γ but do not stain for tetramer (upper L quadrant/ total CD8s), and in (d) the number of tetramer staining CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in all conditions (upper and lower R quadrant/ total CD8s). Bar graphs depict means and bars represent standard errors on the mean.</p>
