                Figure 1. Comparison of type II topoisomerases from S. pneumoniae and E. coli. Schematic domain organization of (A) S. pneumoniae topoisomerase IV, (B) S. pneumoniae gyrase (with the proteolytic fragments generated by trypsin digestion superimposed) and (C) graphical representation of the sequence similarity scores for 500-residue N-terminal fragments of ParC (P72525) and GyrA (P72524) from S. pneumoniae and equivalent fragments of ParC (P0AFI2) and GyrA (P0AES4) from E. coli calculated using ClustalW [49].
