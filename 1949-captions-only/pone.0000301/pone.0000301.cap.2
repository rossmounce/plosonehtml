(A) Orthogonal views of the ParC55 biological dimer from <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. (B) Structure of the N-terminal region of <em>E. coli</em> ParC (18) (1ZVU) equivalent to ParC55 fragment. (C) Structure of the N-terminal fragment (GyrA59) of <em>E. coli</em> GyrA <a href="#pone.0000301-MoraisCabral1">[19]</a> (1AB4). In (A), (B) and (C) the ‘towers’ and the CAP-like domains are shown in ice blue; the ‘tails’ along with adjacent helices α14, α18 and α19 are in ochre; the helix α4 in red; the helix α3 in cyan and the 100-122 loop in yellow. The active-site tyrosines are shown in green. Residues Ser 79 and Asp 83 responsible for drug-resistance upon mutation are in purple. (D) Schematic conversion of ParC55 from ‘closed’ (red) to ‘open’ (blue) conformation on the basis of the <em>E. coli</em> ParC structure. Panels were rendered using VMD <a href="#pone.0000301-Humphrey1">[50]</a> and Pov-Ray.</p>
