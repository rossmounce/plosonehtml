                Figure 2. Structure of the ParC55 dimer and illustration of structurally related E. coli ParC and GyrA proteins. (A) Orthogonal views of the ParC55 biological dimer from S. pneumoniae. (B) Structure of the N-terminal region of E. coli ParC (18) (1ZVU) equivalent to ParC55 fragment. (C) Structure of the N-terminal fragment (GyrA59) of E. coli GyrA [19] (1AB4). In (A), (B) and (C) the ‘towers’ and the CAP-like domains are shown in ice blue; the ‘tails’ along with adjacent helices α14, α18 and α19 are in ochre; the helix α4 in red; the helix α3 in cyan and the 100-122 loop in yellow. The active-site tyrosines are shown in green. Residues Ser 79 and Asp 83 responsible for drug-resistance upon mutation are in purple. (D) Schematic conversion of ParC55 from ‘closed’ (red) to ‘open’ (blue) conformation on the basis of the E. coli ParC structure. Panels were rendered using VMD [50] and Pov-Ray.
