(A) Stereo view of the superposition of the active site of ParC from <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (red) and ParC from <em>E. coli</em> (violet). (B) Stereo view of the superposition of the active sites of ParC from <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (red) and GyrA from <em>E. coli</em> (blue). The active-site tyrosines and arginines are represented in CPK mode. Sites responsible for drug-resistance when mutated are represented in Licorice mode.
