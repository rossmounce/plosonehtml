                Figure 3. Structural comparison between active sites of topoisomerases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. (A) Stereo view of the superposition of the active site of ParC from S. pneumoniae (red) and ParC from E. coli (violet). (B) Stereo view of the superposition of the active sites of ParC from S. pneumoniae (red) and GyrA from E. coli (blue). The active-site tyrosines and arginines are represented in CPK mode. Sites responsible for drug-resistance when mutated are represented in Licorice mode. Panels were rendered using VMD [50] and Pov-Ray.
