                Figure 4. Electrostatic surface potential calculation. GRASP2 [51], [52] electrostatic surface potentials within the DNA-binding grooves calculated for equivalent N-terminal fragments of: (A) S. pneumoniae ParC (ParC55), (B) E. coli ParC, (C) E. coli GyrA. The E. coli ParC structure was manually brought into the ‘closed’ conformation, but the experimentally determined fold of the active site was preserved. Negatively charged surfaces are in red and positively charged surfaces are in blue.
