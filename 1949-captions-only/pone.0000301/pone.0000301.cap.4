GRASP2 <a href="#pone.0000301-Petrey1">[51]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000301-Warwicker1">[52]</a> electrostatic surface potentials within the DNA-binding grooves calculated for equivalent N-terminal fragments of: (A) <em>S. pneumoniae</em> ParC (ParC55), (B) <em>E. coli</em> ParC, (C) <em>E. coli</em> GyrA. The <em>E. coli</em> ParC structure was manually brought into the ‘closed’ conformation, but the experimentally determined fold of the active site was preserved. Negatively charged surfaces are in red and positively charged surfaces are in blue.</p>
