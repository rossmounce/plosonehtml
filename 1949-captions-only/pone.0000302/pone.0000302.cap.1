Note that <em>ca2a</em> is also expressed on spinal cord neurons (sn) and the pronephric duct (pd) in A and B. In A, some epidermal ionocytes which were double-positive for both <em>ca2a</em> and <em>atp1b1b</em> are highlighted with asterisks. (C, D) High-magnification view of <em>ca2a</em> and <em>atp1b1b</em> expressions in the yolk extension region of 72-hpf embryos. Differentiating H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase rich-cells cells (HRCs) (labeled by asterisks) express a high level of <em>ca2a</em> and a low level of <em>atp1b1b,</em> while differentiating Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-rich cells (NaRCs) are positive for only <em>atp1b1b</em>. (E–M) Dynamic expression of <em>foxi3a</em> (red) and <em>foxi3b</em> (green) in epidermal ionocyte progenitors and differentiating epidermal ionocytes from the 5-s to the 72-hpf stage. Whole-mount <em>in situ</em> hybridization of 72-hpf embryos show that the expression patterns between <em>foxi3a</em> (I) and <em>foxi3b</em> (J) are distinct in the cephalic domain. (K) In the yolk extension region, some cells express a high level of <em>foxi3a</em> (red) and a low level of <em>foxi3b</em> (green), while others are positive only for <em>foxi3b</em> (green). Immunodetection of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (green) and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (red) in 72-hpf embryos which were <em>in situ</em>-stained with either <em>foxi3a</em> (L) or <em>foxi3b</em> (M). Results showed that <em>foxi3a</em> was only expressed in HRCs (red arrow), while <em>foxi3b</em> was expressed by both HRCs (red arrow) and NaRCs (green arrow). (N) Schematic diagram showing the major events of epidermal ionocyte development in zebrafish embryos at the progenitor stage (the 90% epiboly to 14-s stages), differentiation stage (the 14-s stage to 36 hpf), and maturation stage (from 36 hpf onwards). The developmental stage is indicated in the left lower corner of each panel.</p>
