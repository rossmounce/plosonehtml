                Figure 10.  Schematic Diagram Shows the Molecular Mechanism Controlling Epidermal Ionocyte Specification and Differentiation in Zebrafish.For the cell fate specification stage of epidermal ionocyte development, Bmp-DeltaC/Notch1a/3 signals play an essential role in setting the epidermal ectoderm competence and singling-out epidermal ionocyte progenitors from the epidermal stem cell pool. For the epidermal ionocyte differentiation stage, the foxi3a/foxi3b regulatory loop activates an unknown downstream factor (X) to promote a later Na+,K+-ATPase-rich cell (green) (NaRC) and H+-ATPase-rich cell (red) (HRC) differentiation program. See the last "Result" section for details of the regulatory mechanism. D, dorsal; V, ventral; A, anterior; P, posterior; The foxi3a+/deltaC+ epidermal ionocyte domain is labeled in yellow, while the deltaC single-positive domain is labeled in light blue. KC, keratinocytes (gray); tb, tail bud.
