In the beginning, <em>foxi3a</em> was activated in some P63-positive epidermal stem cells at the tail bud (tb) stage (indicated by asterisks, A). However, as development precedes, P63 expression in epidermal ionocyte progenitors is sharply downregulated (at the 14-somite (14-s) stage, B) ultimately to an undetectable level (24 hour post infection (hpf), C). (D–I) The mosaic distribution of epidermal ionocyte progenitors within the epidermal ionocyte domain is controlled by Delta-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. In DAPT-treated embryos (F), and <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em>- (G) or <em>X-Su(H)<sup>DBM</sup></em> mRNA-injected embryos (H), the <em>foxi3a</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain has become denser and more homogeneous. While in <em>X-Su(H)/Ank</em> mRNA-injected embryos (I), <em>foxi3a</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain is greatly reduced. The developmental stage is indicated in the left lower corner of each panel.</p>
