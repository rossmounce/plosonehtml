For <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> embryos (B) or their siblings (A), epidermal ionocyte progenitors were labeled with <em>foxi3a</em> (black), and mitotic cells were labeled with phosphor-histone 3 (pH3) antibody staining (green). Cells which were double positive for <em>foxi3a</em> and pH3 are highlighted by asterisks. (C) Quantitative comparison of the epidermal ionocyte progenitor number, mitotic divided cell number, and mitotic divided epidermal ionocytes between <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> embryos and siblings. (D–I) The excess epidermal ionocytes in <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> embryos occur at the expense of the epidermal stem cell fate. For 24-hour post-fertilization (hpf) <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> embryos (D–F) and siblings (G–I), differentiating Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-rich cells (NaRCs), H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-rich cells (HRCs), and epidermal stem cells were labeled with <em>atp1b1b (green), ca2a</em>, (red), and P63 (blue) staining, respectively. (J) Quantitative comparison of NaRC, HRC, and epidermal stem cell numbers between <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> embryos and siblings. The cell number in (C and J) is presented as the mean±S.D. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, compared with siblings, as determined by Student's <em>t</em>-test.</p>
