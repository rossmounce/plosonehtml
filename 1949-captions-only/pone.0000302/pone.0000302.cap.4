The angles of the <em>deltaC</em> and <em>foxi3a</em> expression domain are presented as the mean±S.D. (B) The area demarcated by the dotted line in (A) is viewed at high magnification. Basically, <em>foxi3a</em>+ epidermal ionocyte progenitors (red) also co-express <em>deltaC</em> (green, asterisks). However, some <em>deltaC</em>+ cells outside the epidermal ionocyte domain are negative for <em>foxi3a</em>, suggesting that they are not epidermal ionocytes. (C–D) Fluorescent double <em>in situ</em> hybridization with <em>deltaC</em> (green) and <em>foxi3a</em> (red) probes to show that d<em>eltaC</em> is transiently expressed in the epidermal ionocyte lineage. As development proceeds, <em>deltaC</em> is sharply downregulated in the epidermal ionocyte lineage. (E–L) Evaluation of <em>foxi3a</em> expression by genetic mutants or morphants with reduced or enhanced Notch activity at the tb stage. <em>foxi3a</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain was more homogeneous in <em>deltaC</em> mutants of <em>bea<sup>tit446</sup></em> (E) and <em>bea<sup>tw212b</sup></em> (F), in a <em>notch1a</em> mutant of <em>des<sup>th35b</sup></em> (G), and in a <em>notch3</em> MO-injected <em>des<sup>th35b</sup></em> mutant (I). The <em>foxi3a</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain was severely reduced in <em>notch1a</em> intracellular domain (ICD) RNA- (J) or <em>notch3</em> ICD RNA-injected embryos (K). (H) <em>notch1a</em>/<em>des <sup>th35b</sup></em> mutants injected with the <em>notch1b</em> MO showed no significant difference with uninjected mutants. N1a, notch1a; N1b, notch1b; N3, notch3; ICD, intra-cellular domain; MO, morpholino.</p>
