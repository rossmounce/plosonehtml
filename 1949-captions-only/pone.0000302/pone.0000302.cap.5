(Bâ€“F) Evaluation of <em>deltaC</em> expression by genetic mutants or mRNA-injected embryos with enhanced or reduced Notch activity. Compared to the wild-type (B), <em>deltaC</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain was more homogeneous in <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> (C), <em>bea<sup>tit446</sup></em> (D), and <em>X-Su(H)<sup>DBM</sup></em> mRNA-injected embryos (E). On the contrary, <em>deltaC</em> expression in the epidermal ionocyte domain was completely abolished in <em>X-Su(H)/Ank</em> mRNA-injected embryos (F). Embryos in the upper panel of all photos are oriented in ventral view, with the anterior to the top, while in the lower panel, all are oriented in lateral view, with the anterior to the left. Epidermal ionocyte domains are highlighted by dotted lines. hpf, hour post-fertilization; tb, tail bud.</p>
