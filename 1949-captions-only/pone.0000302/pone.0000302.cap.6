(D–F) Detection of <em>foxi3b</em> expression in wt embryos, <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA-injected embryos, and <em>foxi3a</em> morphants at the 5-s stage. The <em>foxi3a+</em> or <em>foxi3b</em>+ area was measured by ImageJ software and is presented as the mean±S.D (µm<sup>2</sup>). Asterisks indicate <em>p</em>&lt;0.05 when compared with the wild-type embryos, as determined by Student's <em>t</em>-test. To highlight the position of ectopic epidermal ionocytes which were generated by misexpressing either <em>foxi3a</em> or <em>foxi3b</em>, the epidermal ectoderm is subdivided into three domains of I, II and III by dotted lines. (G–H) Comparison of <em>foxi3a</em> (red) and <em>foxi3b</em> (green) expressions between 24-hour post-fertilization (hpf) wt embryos and <em>foxi3a</em> morphants. The number of <em>foxi3a</em>-(red) and <em>foxi3b</em>-(green) expressing ionocytes is indicated in the bottom.</p>
