For wild-type embryos, normal Na<em><sup>+</sup></em>,K<em><sup>+</sup></em>-ATPase rich cell (NaRC) (<em>atp1b1b+</em>) and H<em><sup>+</sup></em>-ATPase rich cell (HRC) (<em>ca2a+</em> and <em>atp1b1b+</em>) differentiation was not activated until the 14-s and 18-s stages, respectively. However, when <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA was misexpressed in wild-type embryos, it was sufficient to promote the precocious differentiation of both NaRCs and HRCs in the ventral ectoderm and ectopic sites (labeled by a dotted line) at the 5-s stage. For <em>foxi3b</em> mRNA-misexpression, it is only sufficient to promote the precocious differentiation of NaRCs in the ventral ectoderm and ectopic sites (label by dotted line) at the 5-s stage. (D–F) Triple labeling of <em>atp1b1b</em> (green), <em>ca2a</em> (red), and P63 (blue) on wild-type embryos, <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA-injected embryos, and <em>foxi3b</em> mRNA-injected embryos aged at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). For wild-type embryos (D), both NaRCs and HRCs seldom appeared on the cephalic ectoderm (highlighted by a dotted line). However, when either <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA (E) or <em>foxi3b</em> mRNA (F) was misexpressed in wild-type embryos, it was sufficient to generate the ectopic NaRCs and HRCs on the cephalic ectoderm. Ectopic epidermal ionocytes occur at the expanse of epidermal stem cell fate, since some regions with strong <em>atp1b1b</em> and <em>ca2a</em> expression completely lacked P63 expression (indicated by arrows).</p>
