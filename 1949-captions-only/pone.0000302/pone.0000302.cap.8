(B) Normal Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase rich cell (NaRC) and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase rich cell (HRC) differentiation in wild-type embryos aged at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). In wild-type embryos, a few IC progenitors were selected from the epidermal stem cell pool within the epidermal ionocyte domain by Delta-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, and then differentiated into NaRCs (green, detected by <em>atp1b1b in situ</em>) or HRCs (red, detected by <em>ca2a in situ</em>) which are scattered on the epidermal layer. (C) For <em>X-Su(H)/Ank</em> mRNA-injected embryos (500 pg/embryo), the <em>foxi3a</em> and <em>foxi3b</em> expressions were inhibited due to the elevated Notch activity in the epidermal ionocyte domain. In such a condition, all epidermal ionocyte progenitors adopted the epidermal stem cell fate; therefore, subsequent NaRC and HRC differentiation was completely abolished. (D) When <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA (50 pg/embryo) and <em>X-Su(H)/Ank</em> mRNA (500 pg/embryo) were co-injected, high levels of exogenous <em>foxi3a</em> expression could compensate for the elevated Notch activity and restore both NaRC and HRC differentiation. (E) When <em>foxi3b</em> mRNA (50 pg/embryo) and <em>X-Su(H)/Ank</em> mRNA (500 pg/embryo) were co-injected, a high level of exogenous <em>foxi3b</em> expression was also sufficient to compensate for the elevated Notch activity to restore NaRC and partially restore HRC differentiation. (F) In <em>bmp7</em> morphants (0.1 mM/embryo), although the low level of Bmp signals was still sufficient to promote P63 expression, it was insufficient to drive either <em>foxi3a</em> or <em>foxi3b</em> expression and finally the epidermal ionocytes lost their identity. (G) When <em>foxi3a</em> mRNA (50 pg/embryo) and <em>bmp7</em> MO (0.1 mM/embryo) were co-injected, a high level of exogenous <em>foxi3a</em> expression could compensate for the low Bmp activity and restore both NaRC and HRC differentiation. (H) When <em>foxi3b</em> mRNA (50 pg/embryo) and <em>bmp7</em> MO (0.1 mM/embryo) were co-injected, a high level of exogenous <em>foxi3b</em> expression could compensate for the low Bmp activity to restore NaRC and partial HRC differentiation. All embryos were scored at 24 hpf.</p>
