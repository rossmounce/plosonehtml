(A) ATPase rates for 400 nM eIF4AIII in the presence or absence of 800 nM MLN51 SELOR, 800 nM Y14-Magoh and 200 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup> yeast RNA. Increasing the Y14-Magoh concentration (lane 7; 3.2 µM) did not further inhibit the ATPase activity. RNA-dependent rates were measured at increasing ATP concentrations for 1 µM eIF4AIII alone (B) or for 400 nM eIF4AIII with 800 nM MLN51 SELOR (C) and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine values for <em>K</em><sub>M</sub> and <em>k</em><sub>cat</sub>.</p>
