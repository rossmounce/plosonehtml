                Figure 2. RNA binding by the core of the exon-junction complex. Binding to a biotinylated 35-mer RNA oligonucleotide was measured using surface plasmon resonance. 160 nM protein samples were injected across the chip surface and the interactions measured. The injections started at time zero and finished at 200 s. The sensorgrams are indicated in the key.
