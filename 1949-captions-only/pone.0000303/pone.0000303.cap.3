                Figure 3. RNA-helicase activity of eIF4AIII. Helicase activity was assayed for 0.25 to 4 µM eIF4AIII with 10 nM 32P-labelled duplex RNA. Experiments were performed for (A) eIF4AIII alone, (B) with 5 µM MLN51 SELOR in lanes 2-8 or (C, D) with 5 µM MLN51 SELOR and Y14-Magoh in lanes 2-8. D is the same as C except the assays were terminated with a higher SDS concentration to disrupt the core EJC, affecting the resolution of the gel. The duplex was heated to 95°C (lane 1) as a marker for the migration of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and the input duplex double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), in the absence of additional protein, is shown in lane 2 top panel. A control assay in the absence of ATP was also performed (lane 8). A schematic illustration of the RNA substrate is shown at the top of the Figure.
