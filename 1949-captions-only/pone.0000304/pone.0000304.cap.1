                Figure 1. I-factor Repression in SF Daughters Correlates with I-RE Transcript Levels in their Ageing Reactive Mothers. (A) Ability to repress the I-factor, which pre-exists in the ovaries of ageing reactive mothers, was assessed after a dysgenic cross with young w1118 inducer males, by measuring the level of I-factor repression in their SF daughters, i.e. the percentage of hatching embryos they laid at constant age (8 day-old). The age of the wK reactive mothers used for the dysgenic crosses is indicated. Relative amounts of I-RE RNAs (B) as well as control rp49 (C) and light (D) mRNAs, were measured by performing specific quantitative real-time PCR on randomly reverse-transcribed total RNAs from ovaries dissected from wK reactive flies at different ages. Values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. au, arbitrary unit. The age of the wK reactive females is indicated. Bars represent standard deviation from the mean.
