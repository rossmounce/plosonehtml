(A) Ability to repress the <em>I</em>-factor, which pre-exists in the ovaries of ageing reactive mothers, was assessed after a dysgenic cross with young <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em> inducer males, by measuring the level of <em>I</em>-factor repression in their SF daughters, <em>i.e.</em> the percentage of hatching embryos they laid at constant age (8 day-old). The age of the <em>w<sup>K</sup></em> reactive mothers used for the dysgenic crosses is indicated. Relative amounts of <em>I</em>-RE RNAs (B) as well as control <em>rp49</em> (C) and <em>light</em> (D) mRNAs, were measured by performing specific quantitative real-time PCR on randomly reverse-transcribed total RNAs from ovaries dissected from <em>w<sup>K</sup></em> reactive flies at different ages. Values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. au, arbitrary unit. The age of the <em>w<sup>K</sup></em> reactive females is indicated. Bars represent standard deviation from the mean.</p>
