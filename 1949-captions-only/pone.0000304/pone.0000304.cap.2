Relative amounts of transcripts from different <em>I</em>-REs (named Ip2862, I503/507 and Ip3172) were individually measured by performing specific quantitative real-time PCR (as described in the legend to <a href="#pone-0000304-g001">Figure 1</a>). I503/507 represents the measurement of two <em>I</em>-REs (I503 and I507) which could not be differentiated by the primers used for PCR.</p>
