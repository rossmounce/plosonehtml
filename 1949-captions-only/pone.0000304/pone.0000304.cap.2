                Figure 2. The Amount of Transcripts from Individual I-REs Increases in Reactive Ovaries during Ageing. Relative amounts of transcripts from different I-REs (named Ip2862, I503/507 and Ip3172) were individually measured by performing specific quantitative real-time PCR (as described in the legend to Figure 1). I503/507 represents the measurement of two I-REs (I503 and I507) which could not be differentiated by the primers used for PCR.
