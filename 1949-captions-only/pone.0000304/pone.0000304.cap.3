                Figure 3. I-factor Repression in SF Daughters Correlates with I-RE Transcript Levels in their Heat Treated Reactive Mothers. Ability to repress the I-factor (A) and the relative amounts of I-RE RNAs (B) as well as control rp49 (C) and light (D) mRNAs were measured as described in the legend to Figure 1, but using ageing reactive females/mothers subjected or not to a 31°C heat treatment, flies being normally reared at 22°C. Gray arrows indicate the beginning and the end of the 31°C heat treatment.
