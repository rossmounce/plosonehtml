Relative amounts of <em>I</em>-RE RNAs were measured (as described in the legend to <a href="#pone-0000304-g001">Figure 1</a>) in whole males, ovaries and carcasses of females (devoid of ovaries) from w<sup>K</sup> reactive flies of different ages. Ability to repress the <em>I</em>-factor in each tissue is schematized (+, high repression ability; -, low repression ability).</p>
