                Figure 4. Ability to Repress the I-factor Correlates with the Amount of I-RE Transcripts in Tissues from Ageing Flies. Relative amounts of I-RE RNAs were measured (as described in the legend to Figure 1) in whole males, ovaries and carcasses of females (devoid of ovaries) from wK reactive flies of different ages. Ability to repress the I-factor in each tissue is schematized (+, high repression ability; -, low repression ability).
