Fluorescent emissions of the reaction mixtures (80 µl) were monitored with the Genexus® Analyzer at a setting of 32% PMT after 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 minutes of incubation at RT. Intensity of triplex-associated fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for the BG triplexes formed in the presence of either 300 nM YOYO-1 (1) or 300 nM YOYO-1 and human genomic dsDNA (2).</p>
