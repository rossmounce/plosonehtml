                Figure 2.  Assay of drosophila genomic dsDNA for the ts1 mutation in the erg gene.Fifty ng of either wild-type drosophila genomic dsDNA (wt gDNA) or mutant drosophila genomic dsDNA (ts1 gDNA) were reacted at RT for 5 min with 4 pmoles of wild-type probe 2 in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 500 nM YOYO-1. Fluorescent emissions of the reaction mixtures (100 µl) were monitored with the Genexus® Analyzer at a setting of 30% PMT after 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes of incubation. The intensity of fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for each sample analyzed. The samples consist of YOYO-1 only with no DNA present (1), wt gDNA with no added ssDNA probe (2), ts1 gDNA with no added ssDNA probe (3), ssDNA probe 2 (4), perfectly matched triplex (5) and 1 bp A–A mismatched triplex (6), as indicated.
