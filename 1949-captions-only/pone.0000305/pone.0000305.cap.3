(A) 500 pg of wild-type human genomic dsDNA (approximately 75 copies) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 600 nM YOYO-1. (B–D) 1 ng, 2 ng or 200 pg of wild-type human genomic dsDNA (approximately 151 copies, 302 copies or 30 copies, respectively) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 500 nM YOYO-1. (A–D) Reaction mixtures (80 µl) were irradiated as described in the text and analyzed for fluorescent emission. The intensity of triplex-associated fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for each sample analyzed. The samples consist of perfectly matched triplex (1) and mismatched triplex (2) as indicated for <em>CFTR</em> delta F508 (A), <em>CFTR</em> 3659delC (B), <em>CFTR</em> 2789+5G→A (C) and <em>FVL</em> G1691A (D).</p>
