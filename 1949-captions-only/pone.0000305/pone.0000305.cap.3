                Figure 3.  Assay of CFTR and FVL mutations in human genomic dsDNA.Human genomic dsDNA was extracted from blood (A, B and D) or saliva (C) as described in the text. (A) 500 pg of wild-type human genomic dsDNA (approximately 75 copies) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 600 nM YOYO-1. (B–D) 1 ng, 2 ng or 200 pg of wild-type human genomic dsDNA (approximately 151 copies, 302 copies or 30 copies, respectively) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 500 nM YOYO-1. (A–D) Reaction mixtures (80 µl) were irradiated as described in the text and analyzed for fluorescent emission. The intensity of triplex-associated fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for each sample analyzed. The samples consist of perfectly matched triplex (1) and mismatched triplex (2) as indicated for CFTR delta F508 (A), CFTR 3659delC (B), CFTR 2789+5G→A (C) and FVL G1691A (D).
