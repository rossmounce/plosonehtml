One ng of human genomic dsDNA (approximately 151 copies) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE and 500 nM YOYO-1. Reaction mixtures (80 µl) were irradiated as described in the text and analyzed for fluorescent emission. The intensity of triplex-associated fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for each sample analyzed. The samples consist of perfectly matched triplexes (1 and 4), mutant heterozygous triplexes (3) and mismatched triplexes (2 and 5) as indicated for <em>MTHFR</em> C677T.</p>
