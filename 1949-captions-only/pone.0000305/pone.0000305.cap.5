                Figure 5.  Waxing and waning of triplex-associated fluorescent emissions can enhance a homogeneous in solution assay.(A, B) Human genomic dsDNA was extracted from blood as described in the text. Two ng of wild-type human genomic dsDNA (approximately 302 copies) was reacted at RT with 3.2 pmoles of either wild-type or mutant ssDNA probe in the presence of 0.5×TBE, 40 mM TMA-Cl and 500 nM YOYO-1. (A) YOYO-1 was added last to the reaction mixtures. (B) Human genomic dsDNA was added last to the reaction mixtures. (A, B) Reaction mixtures (80 µl) were irradiated as described in the text and analyzed for fluorescent emission. The intensity of triplex-associated fluorescence is plotted as a function of incubation time for each sample analyzed. The samples consist of perfectly matched triplex (1) and mismatched triplex (2) as indicated for CFTR 3849+10kbC→T.
