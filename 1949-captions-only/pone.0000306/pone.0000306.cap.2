B) FACS plots indicating relative decrease of bone marrow progenitor B cells in Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> mice according to the Hardy classification. B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> cells were gated (G1) and further analyzed for expression of CD24 and BP-1 (middle panel). B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>−</sup> cells were gated (G2) and analysed for expression of B220 and IgM (bottom panel). Flow cytometry was done in pooled cell suspensions (n = 5 mice). Shown is a representative experiment of 5.</p>
