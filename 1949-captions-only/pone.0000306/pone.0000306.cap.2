                Figure 2.  Analysis of bone marrow B cell development in Gfi1−/− mice.A) Absolute numbers of B220+ bone marrow B lineage cells determined from bone marrow of both hind limbs (n = 4 mice). B) FACS plots indicating relative decrease of bone marrow progenitor B cells in Gfi1−/− mice according to the Hardy classification. B220+CD43+ cells were gated (G1) and further analyzed for expression of CD24 and BP-1 (middle panel). B220+CD43− cells were gated (G2) and analysed for expression of B220 and IgM (bottom panel). Flow cytometry was done in pooled cell suspensions (n = 5 mice). Shown is a representative experiment of 5.
