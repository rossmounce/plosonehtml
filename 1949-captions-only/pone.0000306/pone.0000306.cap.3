HSC were differentiated using IL7 and SCF and analyzed for expression of B220 and CD19 (top panel) and for expression of B220 and IgM (bottom panel). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. B) FACS plot indicating rescue of B cell differentiation upon retroviral gene transfer. LSK cells from Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were isolated and transduced with retroviral constructs encoding GFP or Gfi1-GFP. Transduced cells were cultured in the presence of SCF and IL7 for 14 days and GFP-positive cells were analyzed for expression of B220 and IgM. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. C) FACS plot showing decreased in vitro B cell development upon knockdown of Gfi1 in HSC. HSC were transduced with lentiviral constructs encoding Gfi1 specific shRNA. Transduced cells were cultured in the presence of SCF and IL7 for 14 days and analyzed for expression of CD19 and IgM. Cells transduced with lentiviral backbone served as controls. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.</p>
