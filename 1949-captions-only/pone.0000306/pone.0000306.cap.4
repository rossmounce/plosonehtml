LSK cells from Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup> and Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were initially cultured in the presence of SCF, IL6, IL3, TPO and Flt3L for 48 hours and subsequently cultured in the presence of indicated cytokines. Cells were analyzed by PI staining and FACS 48 hours later. Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. B) Realtime PCR showing Bcl2 RNA levels. Sorted Lin−B220+ bone marrow cells were stimulated with IL7. RNA was extracted at indicated time points and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. C) Cell proliferation indicated by CSFE dilution. LSK cells from Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup> and Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were initially cultured in the presence of SCF, IL6, IL3, TPO and Flt3L for 48 hours. Cells were washed, labeled with CSFE and incubated in the presence of indicated cytokines for 72 hours. Histograms representing CFSE fluorescence and division history of Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup> (top panel) and Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> (bottom panel) cells are shown. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. D) CFU assay indicating decreased colony-forming-activity in Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> HSC. LSK cells were cultured on semisolid medium in the presence of indicated cytokines. 14 days later, the absolute numbers of colony forming units of Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup> (white bars) and Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> (black bars) cells were enumerated and plotted. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. E) Expression of B cell specific transcription factors in defined precursor B cell populations according to Hardy classification. mRNA expression levels of E2A (top panel) EBF (middle panel) Pax5 (bottom panel) were determined by RT-PCR. Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. F) Contour plots indicating reduced expression of CD19 in Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow B lineage cells (upper panels). Bar diagrams indicating absolute numbers of CD19<sup>+</sup> cells in BM of Gfi1<sup>−/−</sup> and Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup> mice (lower panel, n = 3 mice). Data are representative of 6 independent experiments.</p>
