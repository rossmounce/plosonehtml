                Figure 5.  Defective STAT5 signalling in Gfi1−/− progenitor B cells.A) Western blot analysis showing decreased STAT5 phosphorylation in B220+ bone marrow cells upon IL7-signalling. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. B) Realtime PCR showing increased RNA levels of SOCS3 in Gfi1−/− B cells. Sorted B220+ bone marrow cells were stimulated with IL7, RNA was extracted at indicated time points and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Expression of SOCS3 mRNA was quantified by realtime PCR. Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. C) Western blot showing protein levels of SOCS3. Sorted B220+ bone marrow cells were stimulated with IL7 and assessed for SOCS3 protein using specific polyclonal antibodies. GAPDH was detected by specific monoclonal antibodies to confirm equal protein loading. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. D) Intra-cytoplasmic detection of SOCS3 and p-STAT5 by FACS. LSK cells from Gfi1+/+ mice were transduced with either GFP or SOCS3-GFP retroviruses, respectively. SOCS3 expression was measured by cytoplasmic staining with an anti-SOCS3 monoclonal antibody (upper panel). Sorted GFP and SOCS3-GFP transduced progenitor cells were stimulated in the presence of IL7 for 10 minutes and intra cytoplasmic staining was performed using an anti-pSTAT5 monoclonal antibody (lower panel). Shaded histograms represent cells stained with isotype control antibodies. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. E) Viability of SOCS3 over-expressing progenitor cells in response to IL7. Sorted GFP and SOCS3-GFP transduced progenitor cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of IL7. At indicated timepoints, cells were analyzed by PI staining and FACS. Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.
