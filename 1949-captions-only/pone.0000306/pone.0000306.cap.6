                Figure 6.  Modulation of IL7Rα expression by Gfi-1.A) Histograms plots indicating IL7Rα surface expression in distinct populations of bone marrow B lineage precursor cells. BM cells from 5 mice were pooled, and IL7Rα expression was analyzed in the following subpopulations: B220+CD43+BP1−CD24− (Fraction A), B220+CD43+CD24+ (Fraction B–C), B220+CD43−IgM− (Fraction D), B220+CD43−IgM+ (Fraction E), and B220highCD43−IgMhigh (Fraction F). Shaded histograms represent IL7Rα fluorescence and open histograms represent isotype fluorescence. The GMFIi is indicated in each plot. Geometric mean fluorescence intensity index was calculated as follows: GMFIi = GMFI(antibody stained cells)−GMFI(Isotype control treated cells). Data are representative of 5 independent experiments. B–C) Realtime PCR showing IL7Rα RNA and surface expression levels during in vitro B cell development. LSK bone marrow cells isolated from Gfi1+/+ and Gfi1−/− mice were first expanded for 48 hours in a cytokine cocktail containing IL3, IL6, SCF, Flt3L, TPO and then cultured in the presence of SCF and IL7. RNA was extracted at indicated time points, reverse transcribed into cDNA and Realtime PCR was performed (B). Cell surface expression of IL7Rα during in vitro B cell differentiation. LSK bone marrow cells of Gfi1+/+ and Gfi1−/− mice were cultured in the presence of SCF and IL7. Aliquots of cells were taken at indicated time points and analyzed for expression of IL7Rα by FACS (C). Shown are the mean values of duplicate samples. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. D) Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis of Gfi1 binding to the IL7Rα gene. Crosslinked chromatin from Gfi1+/+ bone marrow B220+ cells was immunoprecipitated using control goat IgG or anti-Gfi1 antibodies. PCR was performed on input DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA using primer pairs spanning Gfi1 binding sites that are present in intron 2, intron 3, intron 4, promoter and exon 8 of the IL7Rα gene, respectively. Genomic DNA and no template lanes represent controls. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. E) Semi-quantitative real time PCR analysis. Crosslinked chromatin from Gfi1+/+ and Gfi1−/− bone marrow B220+ cells was immunoprecipitated using control goat IgG or anti-Gfi1 antibodies. Realtime PCR was performed on input and immunoprecipitated DNA using primer pairs spanning Gfi1 binding sites in intron 2 of IL7Rα gene. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.
