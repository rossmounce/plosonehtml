                Figure 1.  EPI data quality.A representative example of raw EPI (echoplanar imaging) data normalized to MNI space is shown in a coronar (MNI y = −7 mm) and axial (MNI z = −20 mm) section. The axial section corresponds approx. to the sections shown in [51]. The example represents the average across all EPI volumes acquired during the experimental session of one subject. The outline of the amygdala is shown (red line), enclosing the area with at least 50% probability of belonging to the amygdala (according to the probabilistic maps from [26]). The extent of the laterobasal (LB) group of the amygdala (LB, &gt; = 80% probability) is shown in blue, the superficial group (SF) in green, and the centromedial group (CM) in magenta. In addition, the outline of the segmentation mask enclosing the area with sufficient signal for application of point spread function (PSF) based EPI distortion correction (see reference [39] for further details) is shown in yellow. In all subjects, the whole analyzed extent of the amygdala was within the segmentation mask and therefore distortion correction was possible in this region. Good EPI signal quality in the amygdala region was achieved in all subjects investigated.
