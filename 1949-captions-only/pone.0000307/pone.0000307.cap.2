Probabilities to belong to LB are color coded with black = 10% and pure red = 100%. In (a), the probabilistic ROI is defined as the area with&gt; = 50% probability to belong to LB (solid yellow line). As a consequence of a simulated localization error which consists of a linear shift of approximately 4 mm (indicated by the white arrow) the true measured volume is localized as indicated by the dashed yellow line, containing voxels with little or no probability to belong to LB. In contrast, when restricting the ROI to voxels with 90% or 100% LB probability (b) and given an equally large localization error, the true measured volume is still entirely located within the area of LB. In this way, the robustness against localization errors could be increased, counteracting potential localization errors while still maintaining excellent anatomical specificity.</p>
