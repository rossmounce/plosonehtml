                Figure 3.  Music-related amygdala responses.The extent of the amygdala subregions LB, SF, and CM defined by maximum-probability maps (MPMs, [28]) are rendered in blue, green, and magenta, respectively, on a coronar section. Regions with significant (p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons in the search volume) music-related responses are shown in red. The BOLD percentage signal change (PSC) of each of the three activation sites in the four music conditions (1: dissonant slow, 2: consonant slow, 3: dissonant fast, 4: consonant fast) is presented as mean and standard error. The fifth PSC value refers to the time period during which subjects evaluated the emotional effect evoked by the preceding musical piece, compared with rest. In the left amygdala, a cluster with positive responses to all music conditions was mainly located in LB and a cluster with negative responses was mainly found in SF and CM (see also Tab. 2). A smaller cluster with consistently positive responses was also found in the right amygdala approximately in the mirror position to the positively responding left cluster.
