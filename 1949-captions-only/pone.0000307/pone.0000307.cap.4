Voxels with a significant increase in BOLD signal to music presentation are displayed as red or yellow squares (p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, see <a href="#s2">material and methods</a> for further details). Voxels with a significant signal decrease are displayed as black or yellow triangles. Anatomical probabilities for red and black responses were 50% to 60%, for yellow responses 70% or above. The majority of significant effects was found in the left amygdala. Positive effects were found in both right and left LB and SF (c.f. <a href="#pone-0000307-t002">Tab. 2</a>), negative effects were localized in left LB, SF and CM. For visualization, probability maps were smoothed using a spatial filter with a 5 mm isometric Gaussian convolution kernel.</p>
