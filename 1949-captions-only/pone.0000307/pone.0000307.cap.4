                Figure 4.  Human amygdala responses to music in probabilistically defined anatomical regions.The volumes with at least 50% and 80% probability to belong to the three major amygdala subregions: LB = laterobasal group (blue), SF = superficial group (green), and CM = centromedial group (magenta) are rendered with high (for 50% probability) and low (for 80% probability) transparency. Voxels with a significant increase in BOLD signal to music presentation are displayed as red or yellow squares (p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, see material and methods for further details). Voxels with a significant signal decrease are displayed as black or yellow triangles. Anatomical probabilities for red and black responses were 50% to 60%, for yellow responses 70% or above. The majority of significant effects was found in the left amygdala. Positive effects were found in both right and left LB and SF (c.f. Tab. 2), negative effects were localized in left LB, SF and CM. For visualization, probability maps were smoothed using a spatial filter with a 5 mm isometric Gaussian convolution kernel.
