Values for the right (black) and left (light grey) amygdala are shown in a stacked way. For each PSC bin, a lateralization index (LI) was calculated. LIs of 100, âˆ’100, and 0 indicate purely right-sided, purely left-sided, and symmetrically distributed effects, respectively. LB and SF showed a similar lateralization pattern of both extremely positive and negative PSC predominating in the left amygdala. CM showed a different lateralization pattern with negative PSC predominating in the left and positive PSC in the right amygdala.</p>
