Bars in the above figure show the result of three averaging steps: first across all voxels of a given area, then either across all four music conditions, the dissonant conditions, or the consonant conditions, and finally across the 14 subjects. Results are given for left LB, SF, and CM in blue, green, and magenta. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean from of the average across subjects. In each case, the differences between left LB and left SF and CM were significant at p&lt;0.005. There were no corresponding significant differences in the right amygdala.</p>
