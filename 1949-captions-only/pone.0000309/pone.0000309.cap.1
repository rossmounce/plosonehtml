                Figure 1.  Circular representation of the IncA/C backbone (inner circle) and laterally acquired regions (outer circles) on each of the three plasmids.Nucleotide composition is represented on each of the outer circles and PCR primers used in this study are indicated in the inner circle. Antimicrobial determinants are colored red and labeled with gene names as follows: sulfonamides (sul1, sul2); phenicols (cat, floR); tetracyclines (tetRA); aminoglycosides/aminocyclitols (aacC, aadA, aphA, strAB); quaternary ammonium compounds (qacEdelta1, sugE1, sugE2); Î²-lactams (blaCMY-2-1, blaCMY-2-2, blaSHV-1); trimethoprim (dhfrI); mercury ions (merRTPABDE, merRTPCADE). Sequences described in this manuscript have been deposited in GenBank, accession numbers are CP000603 (pIP1202), CP000604 (pSN254), CP000602 (pYR1).
