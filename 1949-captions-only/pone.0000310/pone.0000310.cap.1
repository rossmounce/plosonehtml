(A) Treatment schedule of animals. (B and C) Schematic representation of the injection site and brain area dissected for RNA isolation, respectively. (D) A 2-contrast plot of genes selected as differently expressed in ipsilateral side when LPS injection was performed in mice pre-treated or not with RU486. The abscissa axis represents the difference (contrast) between LPS/RU486 treatment and LPS single treatment (RMA expression levels); ordinate axis represents the LPS <em>vs</em>. Saline contrast. Red dots represent ipsilateral contrast value; green dots, represent contralateral contrast values. Genes highlighted in the diagram were selected for validation experiments. Dashed lines: 30% fold-change. (E) Similar to “D”, but in regard to contralateral side. (F) Representation of the gene expression behavior associated with RU486 effects on LPS-induced changes, defining how these groups of genes are described in the text. Abbreviations: AP, antero-posterior; contra, contralateral; DV, dorso-ventral; i.p., intra-peritoneal; ipsi, ipsilateral; i.s., intrastriatal; L, lateral.</p>
