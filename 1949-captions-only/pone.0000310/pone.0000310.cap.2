                Figure 2. Functional classification and biological relevance of the differently expressed genes. The plot showing significant biological processes (hypergeometric distribution) associated with six different lists of differently expressed genes (LPS upregulated, LPS upregulation exacerbated by RU486, LPS upregulation prevented by RU486, LPS downregulated, LPS dowregulation prevented by RU486 and RU486 main effect). Hierarchical clustering of the Gene Ontology nodes was performed as described in text S1. A color/intensity code assigns number of genes and p-value for each biological process associated with the lists' heat map.
