                Figure 3. Bimodal RU486 effect on CNS inflammation as demonstrated by APRs and genes only responsive to LPS upon GR-antagonism. (A) Dark-field photomicrographs showing hybridization signals of the specified transcripts from mice that received saline or, LPS or, LPS/RU486 combined treatments. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis of mRNA levels [optical density (O.D.)] in mouse brains 12 h after the intracerebral infusions. Absence (-) or presence (+) of LPS or increasing doses of RU486 is indicated. Quantification methods may vary among transcripts; see “Experimental Procedures” section. Results represent means ± SEM of 3–5 mice per group. One-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test: significantly different (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.005) from the saline-injected group; significantly different (# p&lt;0.05) from the LPS-treated group. Abbreviations: BnST, bed nucleus of stria terminalis; bv, blood vessel; Cx, cortex; Ipsi, ipsilateral; LV, lateral ventricle; m, meninges; MPO, medial preoptic nucleus.
