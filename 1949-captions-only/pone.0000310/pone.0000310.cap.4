(A) Representative examples of coronal sections depicting LPS induced changes in gene expression of the indicated transcripts. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis of mRNA levels (O.D.) in mouse brains 12 h after the intracerebral infusions. One-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test: significantly different (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.005) from the saline-injected group; significantly different (# p&lt;0.05, ### p&lt;0.005) from the LPS-treated group. Abbreviations: Ipsi, ipsilateral; LV, lateral ventricle; Pir, piriform cortex.</p>
