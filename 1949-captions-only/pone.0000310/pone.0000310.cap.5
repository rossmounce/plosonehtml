(A) Hybridization signals of Cp riboprobe on brain sections of saline-, or LPS-, or LPS/RU486-treated mice, sacrificed 12 h after the intrastriatal injection. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis of Cp mRNA levels (O.D.) depicted in “A”. (C) Results of quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qPCR). (D) RMA expression levels of four different probe sets to detect Cp transcript selected according to a significant LPS effect. (E) Representative microphotographs of labeling experiments combining immunohistochemistry with <em>in situ</em> hybridization. Silver grain signals (<em>Cp mRNA</em>) overlap IBA1-, GFAP- and CD31-positive cells. (F) Confocal microscopy results showing co-localization of CP protein with CD31-, IBA1- and GFAP-positive cells, but not with MAC-2-positive cells, in brain sections from animals sacrificed 24 h after LPS challenge. Dark arrowheads: co-localization of silver grains with immunolabeling brown staining. Empty white arrows: co-localization determined by confocal laser scanning. Full white arrows and white arrowheads were used to identify cell types that failed to show convincing co-localization. One-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey'S HSD multiple comparison test: significantly different (** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.005) from the saline-injected group; significantly different (# p&lt;0.05, ### p&lt;0.005) from the LPS-treated group.
