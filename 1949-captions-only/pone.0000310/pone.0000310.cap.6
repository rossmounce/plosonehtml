                Figure 6. Ceruloplasmin regulates brain iron levels during inflammation and confers neuroprotection. (A) Cp+/+, +/- or -/- mice were sacrificed 2 days after LPS infusion and brain sections stained for Iron III (Perls' staining). (B) High magnification of iron labeling (representative brain sections from Cp-/-mice sacrificed 2 or 5 days after LPS infusion). (C) Surface analysis to determine extent of iron deposition. (D) Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining was performed in brain sections from Cp+/+, +/- and -/- infused with LPS or saline. Volumetric analysis was performed by stereological procedure. (E) Representative dark-field picture of adjacent brain sections hybridized with Tlr2 cRNA probe in LPS treated mice 2 days after infusion. (F) Semi-quantitative analysis of Tlr2 mRNA hybridization signal. (G) Representative sections hybridized with Plp cRNA riboprobe to detect regions lacking signals (demyelinated area). These panels show two different coronal levels (cannulae track level and a section distal to the site of injection). (H) Surface analysis of demyelinated area. (I) and (J) are representative microphotographs of Sudam Black B (SBB) stained sections from Cp+/+ and -/- mice sacrificed 2 days after LPS infusion, as indicated. Statistical analysis was performed via a two or three-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni's multiple comparison test when applicable. “a”, significant genotype effect (p&lt;0.05), significant time effect (p&lt;0.01), significant treatment effect (p&lt;0.001), Cp-/-significantly different from Cp+/+ (p&lt;0.01) and Cp+/- (p&lt;0.05). “b”, significant genotype effect (p&lt;0.01), Cp-/- statistically different from Cp+/+ (p&lt;0.005). “c”, significant interaction between treatment and time factors (p&lt;0.01), LPS treatment 2 days statistically different from LPS 5 days (p&lt;0.001). “d”, significant interaction between treatment and genotype effect (p&lt;0.05), significant time effect (p&lt;0.001), in the LPS treated group Cp-/- was statistically different from Cp+/+ († p&lt;0.005) and from Cp+/- (‡ p&lt;0.01).
