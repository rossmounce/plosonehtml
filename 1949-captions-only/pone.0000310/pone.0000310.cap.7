(A) Survival curves of <em>Cp</em>+/+, +/- and -/- following inoculation with <em>S. Penumoniae</em> (2 week follow up). (B) Ceruloplasmin protein immunoreactivity at the vascular level in the hindbrain of a <em>Cp</em>+/+ infected mouse; <em>Cp</em>-/- mice was used as control for the primary antibody. (C) Dark-field photomicrographs showing representative hybridization signals of Nfkbia or Selp riboprobes on hindbrain sections of <em>Cp</em>+/+ or -/- mice killed at the early phase of infection (36â€“48 h post-infection). (D) High magnification photomicrographs depicting the expression pattern of Selp mRNA associated with large blood vessels and not in cells lining the meninges or the ventricle. (E) Semi-quantitative analysis of Nfkbia and Selp mRNA levels O.D. Student's t-test was used to compare <em>Cp</em>+/+ and <em>Cp</em>-/- means (see text for details); * p&lt;0.05. Abbreviations: bv, blood vessel; Cb, cerebellum; IC, inferior colliculus; m, meninges.</p>
