                Figure 7. Modulation of cerebro-vascular response by ceruloplasmin during early phases of pneumococcal infection. (A) Survival curves of Cp+/+, +/- and -/- following inoculation with S. Penumoniae (2 week follow up). (B) Ceruloplasmin protein immunoreactivity at the vascular level in the hindbrain of a Cp+/+ infected mouse; Cp-/- mice was used as control for the primary antibody. (C) Dark-field photomicrographs showing representative hybridization signals of Nfkbia or Selp riboprobes on hindbrain sections of Cp+/+ or -/- mice killed at the early phase of infection (36â€“48 h post-infection). (D) High magnification photomicrographs depicting the expression pattern of Selp mRNA associated with large blood vessels and not in cells lining the meninges or the ventricle. (E) Semi-quantitative analysis of Nfkbia and Selp mRNA levels O.D. Student's t-test was used to compare Cp+/+ and Cp-/- means (see text for details); * p&lt;0.05. Abbreviations: bv, blood vessel; Cb, cerebellum; IC, inferior colliculus; m, meninges.
