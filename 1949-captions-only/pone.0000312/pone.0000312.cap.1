                Figure 1.  Impaired PMN responsiveness to LPS in MMP-8 deficient mice.(A) Infiltration of PMNs in vivo in response 1 Âµg of LPS (n = 8) or phosphate buffered saline control (n = 4) injected into the air pouch of male Mmp8-/- (black bar) and wild type mice (white bar) was assessed 8 h post-injection. The PMN influx was quantitated by myeloperoxidase activity. Error bars, standard error. (B) Western blot analysis of murine MMP-8 in LPS-treated air pouch PMN lysates corresponding to 50,000 cells per lane.
