                Figure 2.  MMP-8 Cleavage of LIX.(A) Tris-tricine 15% SDS-PAGE gel analysis of MMP-8 cleavage of murine CXCR2-binding chemokines DCIP-1, KC, LIX and MIP-2. The m/z [M+H]+ of reaction products are as shown. (B) Identification of cleavage products by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and NH2-terminal Edman sequencing. n.d., not determined. (C) Tris-tricine 15% SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis of LIX cleavage products generated over time (h) by MMP-8. (D) Tris-tricine 15% SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis of LIX cleavage by MMP-8 in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of recombinant hemopexin C-domain (MMP-8 CD), 10 µM EDTA, or 10 µM BB94. (E) Heparin Sepharose AKTA chromatograms of synthetic analogues of MMP-8 cleavage products of LIX eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl as indicated.
