                Figure 3.  LIX is selectively cleaved by multiple MMPs.(A) Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of MMP processing of LIX (enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w:w)) showing that MMPs 1, 2, 8, 9 and 13 cleave LIX at position 4â€“5, whereas MMP-14 does not, and that only MMP-8 also cleaves at position 79~80. Cleavage assays of rodent MMP-8 and MMP-13 are shown in the second 8 and 13 lanes. (B) Cleavage data are summarised using the full-length sequence of LIX.
