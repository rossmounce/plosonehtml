(C) By transwell cell migration assay, both LIX (5-92) and LIX (5-79) truncated forms are more potent chemoattractants compared with the full-length LIX (1-92) for both CXCR2-expressing B300-19 cell transfectants and (D) murine PMNs isolated from either <em>Mmp8</em>+/+ or <em>Mmp8</em>-/- mice, all at 10 nM chemokine concentration.</p>
