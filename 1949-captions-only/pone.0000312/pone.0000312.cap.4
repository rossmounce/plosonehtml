                Figure 4.  In vitro cellular responses to MMP-8 cleaved LIX.(A) Enhanced intracellular calcium mobilization was induced by LIX (5-92) and LIX (5-79) compared to full-length LIX (1-92) in recombinant CXCR2-expressing B300-19 cells and (B) PMNs isolated from Mmp8-/- mice (100 nM chemokine). (C) By transwell cell migration assay, both LIX (5-92) and LIX (5-79) truncated forms are more potent chemoattractants compared with the full-length LIX (1-92) for both CXCR2-expressing B300-19 cell transfectants and (D) murine PMNs isolated from either Mmp8+/+ or Mmp8-/- mice, all at 10 nM chemokine concentration.
