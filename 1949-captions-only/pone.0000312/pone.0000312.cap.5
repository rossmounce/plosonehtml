PMN numbers were calculated from myeloperoxidase assay after sacrifice at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h following injection of chemokine (n = 4). Unaltered PMN cell migration into air pouches of <em>Mmp8</em>-/- mice (black bars) compared to wild type mice (white bars) injected with MMP-cleaved analogues of LIX (5-92 or 5-79) reveals no intrinsic cell kinesis defects or chemotactic ability in the PMNs of the knock out mice.</p>
