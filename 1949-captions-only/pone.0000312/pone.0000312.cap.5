                Figure 5.  MMP-8 is required for PMN chemotaxis towards LIX in vivo, but is not required for PMN cell migration.PMN infiltration was greatly reduced in response to full-length LIX (1-92) injected into the dorsal skin air pouch of Mmp8-/- mice (black bars) compared to wild type mice (white bars). PMN numbers were calculated from myeloperoxidase assay after sacrifice at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h following injection of chemokine (n = 4). Unaltered PMN cell migration into air pouches of Mmp8-/- mice (black bars) compared to wild type mice (white bars) injected with MMP-cleaved analogues of LIX (5-92 or 5-79) reveals no intrinsic cell kinesis defects or chemotactic ability in the PMNs of the knock out mice.
