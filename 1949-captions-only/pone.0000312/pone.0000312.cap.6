                Figure 6.  MMP processing of CXCL8 and CXCL5.(A) Tris-tricine 15% SDS-PAGE gel and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of CXCL8 cleavage products after assay with the indicated human MMPs at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100. Cleavage assays of rodent MMP-8 are shown in the second 8 lane. The NH2-terminus of the CXCL8 truncated forms were deconvoluted from the mass spectrometry data and confirmed by Edman sequencing (as shown in C) with the CXCL8 forms identified shown below the corresponding gel lanes. 1-77, full-length CXCL8. (B) The effect of recombinant MMP-8 hemopexin C domain (MMP-8 CD), 10 µM EDTA, or 10 µM BB94 on CXCL8 cleavage by human MMP-8 as determined by Tris-tricine 15% SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The m/z [M+H]+ of reaction products is as shown. (C) Identification of the NH2-termini of MMP cleavage products of CXCL8 and CXCL5 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and NH2-terminal Edman sequencing. n.d., not determined. (D) Location of the various MMP cleavage sites on the CXCL8 and CXCL5 sequences.
