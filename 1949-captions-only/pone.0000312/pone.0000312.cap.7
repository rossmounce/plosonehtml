                Figure 7.  Enhanced bioactivity of MMP-truncated CXCL8 in vitro and in vivo.(A) Ca++ ion mobilization with 10 nM CXCL8 and (B) chemotaxis of CXCR2-transfected B300-19 cells stimulated with 10 nM full-length CXCL8 (1-77) and CXCL8 (6-77) synthetic analogue of MMP-8-cleaved CXCL8. (C) Time course of air pouch PMN influx in response to CXCL8 (1-77) and CXCL8 (6-77) in Mmp8-/- mice (black) and wild type (white) mice as quantitated by myeloperoxidase assay.
