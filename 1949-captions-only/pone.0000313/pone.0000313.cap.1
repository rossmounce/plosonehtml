                Figure 1. Internalization of L. rhamnosus by BMDCs. BMDCs were incubated for 18 h with Lr32 strain at a bacteria-to-DC ratio of 10 and then processed for transmission electron microscopy. Bacteria are visible within membrane-bound phagosomes at various stages of degradation (arrows). Bar, 2 Âµm.
