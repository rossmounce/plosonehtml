                Figure 2. Cytokine (A) and chemokine (B) response of murine BMDCs (0.5×106 cells/ml) derived from BALB/c mice to stimulation with strains L. rhamnosus Lr32, L. salivarius Ls33, L. acidophilus NCFM, L. lactis MG1363 and E. coli TG1. Bacteria were collected after overnight culture and the stimulation of BMDC was done at a ratio of 10:1 (bacteria/DC). Results represent the mean±SEM of 7 independent experiments.
