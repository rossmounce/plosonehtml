                Figure 7. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory or regulatory mediators in colons obtained 48 h after TNBS-induced colitis. Mice were left untreated (None) or IP administered with untreated BMDC (DC) or Lr32-treated BMDCs (Lr32-DC). The values are expressed as the mean ratioÂ±SEM of mRNA levels after TNBS challenge compared with non challenged healthy mice.
