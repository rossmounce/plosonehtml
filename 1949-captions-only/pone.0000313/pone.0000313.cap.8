Ten mice per group were challenged with TNBS alone (CTL) or after Lr32-pulsed BMDC transfer (Lr32-DC). The effect of a pre-treatment by either 200 µg of anti-CD25 (α-CD25) or control rat IgG (rat IgG) mAb, 24 h before colitis induction was analyzed in mice treated or not by Lr32-pulsed BMDC (Lr32-DC) transfer. Wallace inflammation scores (mean ± SEM) were calculated in each group and compared to each other by a Mann-Whitney U test (&lt;0.01, **; p&lt;0.001, ***). Percent of mortality and protection (reduction of the mean Wallace scores of mice treated with BMDCs, in relation to the mean score of TNBS control group) are also reported.</p>
