                Figure 9. Protective effect of intra-peritoneal administration of untreated (DC) or Lr32-treated BMDCs (Lr32-DC) derived from C57Bl/6 WT or MyD88−/−, TLR2−/−, NOD2 −/− or IL-10−/− KO mice on TNBS-induced colitis in C57Bl/6 mice. For technical reason, the protective effect of all KO BMDC's have not been analyzed in the same experiment. For that reason, results are only expressed as the reduction (in %) of the mean macroscopic inflammation scores of mice treated with BMDCs, in relation to the mean scores of non-treated mice (corresponding control TNBS). Significance values p&lt;0.05 (*) or p&lt;0.01 (**), as compared to the corresponding TNBS-control group or the groups that received the corresponding non-treated BMDCs, were calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test (n = 10). The dashed line indicates the 25% threshold of the uncertain statistical significance as previously described (48).
