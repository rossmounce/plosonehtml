                Figure 1. Photoreceptor degeneration is slowed in P23H animals crossed onto the Long Evans (LE) pigmented background in comparison to albino transgenic animals (A), but not in S334ter animals (B). B-wave data (+/- SEM) was taken from the contralateral untreated eyes of experimental animals. N = 5 for all groups.
