                Figure 2. Structural protection of photoreceptors. A) Haematoxylin and Eosin staining of retinal sections at 28 weeks after AAV subretinal injection. XIAP-treated retinas have increased layers of photoreceptor nuclei in comparison to contralateral untreated controls as well as age-matched GFP-treated controls. B) For the LE-P23H animals, XIAP-treatment preserves the ONL in comparison to both the untreated control eyes (p&lt;0.0001) and GFP-treated eyes (p&lt;0.0001) (XIAP N = 16, GFP N = 4). For LE-S334ter, XIAP-treated eyes are similarly significantly better than untreated controls (p&lt;0.001) and GFP-treated eyes (p&lt;0.005) (XIAP N = 15, GFP N = 8).
