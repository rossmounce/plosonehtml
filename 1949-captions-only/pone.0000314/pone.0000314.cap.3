Blot was probed with an anti-HA antibody. Given that the protein extracts were made from the whole retina, and only a fraction of the retina was covered by the subretinal injection, XIAP protein levels seen on the Western blot are an under-estimation of the level of over-expression at the site of injection. Some variability in XIAP expression is present between animals. Ponceau red staining of membrane confirms equal loading. (B) Anti-HA immunofluorescence (green) confirms XIAP over-expression at site of neuroprotection in a P23H animal. (C) Contralateral untreated control has no fluorescence and shows diminished ONL thickness. (D) GFP-injected retina of a S334ter animal is shown at boundary between photoreceptors covered by the virus and photoreceptors outside the range of the virus. ONL thickness is similar on either side of the virus boundary. Sections are counterstained with DAPI (nuclear stain).</p>
