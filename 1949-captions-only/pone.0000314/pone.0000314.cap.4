                Figure 4. To assess functional preservation, the a- or b-wave amplitude of the treated eye was divided by that of the contralateral, untreated eye to give an amplitude ratio. Amplitude ratios from the 8th luminance step (0.63 cd.s/m2) are graphed. Amplitude ratios for LE-S334ter animals (A,B) show no significant differences between treated and control retinas. Ratios for LE-P23H animals (C,D) show significant differences for a-wave (p&lt;0.001) and b-wave (p&lt;0.03) by ANOVA. For statistical analyses, N values were 12 and 3 for XIAP and GFP respectively.
