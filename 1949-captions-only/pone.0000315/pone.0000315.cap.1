The two genome maps from 98HAH12 (A) and 05ZYH33 (B) were annotated with CGView (Stothard and Wishart 537-39). The replication origins of the genomes were determined using GC skews, dnaA boxes, and characteristic genes around the replication origins. The origins (indicated with vertical blue lines) are assigned as base pair 0 and then the sequences and their annotation are displayed clockwise. ORFs and their coordinates are displayed along both outside and at the center the concentric circles. In circle 1, the ORFs (in orange-yellow) outside (inside) represent the genes located on the positive (negative) strand. In circle 2, the GC contents of the genomes are shown. In circle 3, GC skew [(Gâˆ’C)/(G+C)] is displayed (Green indicates values&gt;0, and deep-blue indicates values&lt;0). (C) The genes of 98HAH12, 05ZYH33 and P1/7 were compared using FASTA3. These numbers are displayed in the same color as that of each strain (98HAH12, 05ZYH33, and P1/7). Numbers in the intersections indicate genes shared by two or three strains. First, 44, 67, and 101 is the number of the unique genes in 98HAH12, 05ZYH33, and P1/7, respectively. Second, 1907 represents the number of the genes of 98HAH12, which are shared by both 05ZYH33 and P1/7; 1913 indicates the number of the genes of 05ZYH33, which can be found in both 98HAH12 and P1/7; 1841 means the number of the genes of P1/7, which are common in both 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33. Third, the numbers 144 and 135 separately indicate the genes of 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33 which are only shared with each other and not with P1/7; the numbers 4 and 78 represent the genes of 05ZYH33 and P1/7, respectively, which are only shared with each other but not with 98HAH12; the numbers 23 and 96 separately imply the genes of P1/7 and 98HAH12, which are only shared with each other, but not with 05ZYH33. Notably, the numbers in the intersections are slightly different partially due to gene duplications in some strains.</p>
