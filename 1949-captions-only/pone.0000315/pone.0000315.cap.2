                Figure 2. Identification of 89K, a putative PAI, through comparative genomics. (A) MUMer-based genomic display between 98HAH12 and P1/7. (B) MUMer-based genomic display between 05ZYH33 and P1/7. (C) MUMer-based genomic display between 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33. The hallmark in both (A) and (B) is a breakpoint of plots at the position of ~0.9Mb which is highlighted in a square. (D) Co-linearity comparison of three S. suis genomes (98HAH12, 05ZYH33, and P1/7). The red lines represent similar DNA sequences (BLASTN search, e-value&lt;10âˆ’5) between genomes. Blue lines stand for those regions with inverted sequences. Noticeably, a special region (designated 89K in a black rectangle) is present in both 98HAH12 and 05ZYH33, but absent in P1/7. (E) Mimic model of 89K in the vicinity of the genomes. The adjacent DNA sequences to 89K on both sides are directly presented. +1 means the first nucleotide acid (C) of 89K, and+2 indicates the second nucleotide acid (T) in the right arm of 89K. Obviously, 89K is highlighted in figures from (A) to (E), and linked each other by the dashed lines. (F) The GC contents of three S. suis genomes. The zigzags representing the GC percentage of S. suis strains 05ZYH33, 98HAH12&amp;P1/7, are plotted in yellow, magenta and blue, respectively. The scale is amplified at genomic position from 0.8 to 1.0 Mb. The shadowed region represents the ~89K segment in 05ZYH33 and 98HAH12. An artificial 89K gap is arranged in the P1/7 genome at the counterpart position. The boxes indicate the potential genomic islands in the S. suis genomes, excluding the ~89K region.
