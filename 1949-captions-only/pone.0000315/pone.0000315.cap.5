(A) RT-PCR analysis of the response regulator (05SSU0943) at its transcriptional level. The PCR product (05SSU0943) at the position of the arrow (~0.6 kb), is used as control (CK). (B) RT-PCR analysis of the sensor histidine kinase (05SSU0944) at its transcriptional level. The PCR product (05SSU0944) functions as control (CK) at the position of the arrow (~0.2 kb). (C) RT-PCR analysis of 16S rRNA, one of the most housekeeping genes featuring the constitutive expressions. The expected fragment is of ~1.3 kb at the arrow position. (D) Electrophoresis analysis of the total RNA isolated from both representative SS2 strains (98HAH12&amp;05ZYH33). Two conservative subunits of bacterial rRNAs are pointed out with 16S and 23S, respectively.</p>
