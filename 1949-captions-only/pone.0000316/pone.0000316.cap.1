(B) TAFs, TBP (left panels) and certain TFTC subunits (right panels) were individually expressed (In factor) or coexpressed with TAF8 (In factor+TAF8) in Sf9 cells as indicated and WCEs were made. TAF8-containing complexes were immunopurified (IPed) with an anti-TAF8 mAb (2TAU 2B8). Protein expression in the input fractions and TAF8-bound proteins were analysed by western blot with the indicated antibodies. In each experiment, the expression and the IP efficiency of TAF8 was the same as shown in a single representative experiment (lower panel).</p>
