Protein expression in the WCEs was verified by western blot analysis (WB). Note that in the seven-TAF complex each TAF is indicated with only its corresponding number according to the TAF nomenclature <a href="#pone.0000316-Tora1">[3]</a>. (Bâ€“C) TAF10-containing complexes were purified from the WCEs with an anti-TAF10 mAb (1H8). Bound complexes were eluted by peptide competition and analysed either by western blot (WB) with the indicated antibodies (B) or by silver nitrate staining (Silver) (C).</p>
