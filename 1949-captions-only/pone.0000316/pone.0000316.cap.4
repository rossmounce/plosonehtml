                Figure 4.  The TAF8-TAF10 HF pair incorporates into a higher order TFIID subcomplex only if another five TAFs are simultaneously present.(A) Either seven TAFs (TAF4, -5, -6, -8, -9, -10 and -12) or only six of them (each time only the omitted TAF is indicated compared to the seven-TAF complex) were coexpressed in Sf9 cells and WCEs made. Protein expression in the WCEs was verified by western blot analysis (WB). Note that in the seven-TAF complex each TAF is indicated with only its corresponding number according to the TAF nomenclature [3]. (Bâ€“C) TAF10-containing complexes were purified from the WCEs with an anti-TAF10 mAb (1H8). Bound complexes were eluted by peptide competition and analysed either by western blot (WB) with the indicated antibodies (B) or by silver nitrate staining (Silver) (C).
