(A) Mitotic spindles in wild-type (WT) and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells at the restrictive temperature of 20°C. Cells grown in liquid culture were at 33°C were shifted to the restrictive temperature of 20°C for 4 hr and fixed with methanol. Anti-tubulin antibody TAT1 (green) and DAPI (red) were used for immunostaining and DNA staining, respectively. WT cells containing nuclei consistent with both metaphase and anaphase were observed as indicated, whereas <em>dis3-54</em> cells appeared to have arrested during mitosis with abnormally long metaphase-like spindles. Scale bar = 10 µm. (B) Mitotic spindle length distributions in WT and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells grown at restrictive temperature of 20°C for 4 hr. Cells were stained with anti-Sad1 (spindle pole body component) and anti-tubulin antibody after fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde and the pole-to-pole distance of the spindle microtubule in mitotic cells was measured. The inverted triangle represents the position of mode. (C) Time-lapse images of <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells expressing chromosomally integrated GFP-tagged α2-tubulin (Atb2) under the inducible <em>nmt1</em> promoter. Images of cells growing at both 20°C (restrictive temperature, left panels) and 33°C (permissive temperature, right) were taken at 30 sec intervals for approx. 90 min with a confocal microscope. Numbers within each panel represent the time (min) after start of observation. The white arrow indicates the collapsed spindle microtubule, often observed after an extended period of mitotic arrest in <em>dis3-54</em>. (D) Time course plot of spindle length based on time-lapse images shown in Fig. 1<em>C</em>. Cells grown at 33°C (blue line) and 20°C (yellow line; “cell 1”) were measured and the 0 min time point was adjusted to reflect the start of mitosis. Normal changes in spindle length representing phases I, II and III were observed during the time-course at 33°C <a href="#pone.0000317-Nabeshima2">[18]</a>.</p>
