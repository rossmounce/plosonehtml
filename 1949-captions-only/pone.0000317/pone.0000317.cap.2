WT and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant strains that carried a chromosomally integrated Cut2/securin-GFP fusion gene under control of the native promoter were cultured at 20°C for 4 hr in synthetic EMM2 medium. Cells were stained with Hoechst H33342 for visualizing DNA together with GFP signals, and were not subject to fixation. WT cells in both pre-anaphase (p) and anaphase (a) were observed, whereas persistent Cut2 signals in <em>dis3-54</em> (three representative cells shown) confirmed they were in a pre-anaphase stage. Scale bar = 10 µm.</p>
