(A) Cellular localization of Mad2-GFP in WT and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells at 20°C. WT and <em>dis3-54</em> strains carrying a chromosomally integrated copy of Mad2-GFP were shifted to 20°C for 8 hr prior to imaging. Cells were stained with Hoechst H33342 for DNA and were not subject to fixation. WT cells in both pre-anaphase (p) and anaphase (a) were observed. All mitotically arrested <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells contained intense Mad2-GFP signals (n = 23). (B) Cellular localization of Bub1-GFP in WT and <em>dis3-54</em> at 20°C. WT and <em>dis3-54</em> strains carrying a chromosomally integrated copy of Bub1-GFP were cultured as in A, however, cells were first fixed in methanol prior to staining with Hoechst H33342. Bub1-GFP dot signals were observed in WT cells only during the pre-anaphase stage, whereas intense signals were observed in all mitotically arrested <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells (n = 24). Scale bar = 10 µm. (C) Full mitotic spindle elongation and asymmetrical nuclei in a <em>dis3-54 Δmad2</em> double mutant as observed by immunostaining. Cells were grown and treated as in <a href="#pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<em>A</em></a>. (D) Cellular localization of Cut2-GFP in the <em>dis3-54 Δmad2</em> double mutant at 20°C. Loss of Cut2 signals demonstrates progression from pre-anaphase (p) to anaphase (a) in the absence of Mad2, similar to that observed in WT (compare with <a href="#pone-0000317-g002">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
