                Figure 4. Removal of the mitotic checkpoint reveals unequal chromosome segregation in a dis3-54 Δmad2 double mutant. (A) Time-dependent changes in frequency of different nuclei phenotypes observed in dis3-54 single (left panel) and dis3-54 Δmad2 double (right panel) mutants upon shift to the restrictive temperature of 20°C. Red line, dis nuclei phenotype (see Fig. 1A); Blue line, asymmetrical nuclei and lagging chromosomes (see Fig. 3C). (B) Localization of the CenI-GFP in the wild-type (WT), dis3-54 single mutant and dis3-54 Δmad2 double mutant cells. Cells were cultured and treated with Hoechst as in Fig. 1A. Sister chromatids were able to separate in the double mutant, but chromosome segregation was abnormal. (C) dis3-54 and dis3-54 Δmad2 mutants are hypersensitive to TBZ. Serial dilutions (1:5) of each strain were spotted onto YPD solid media containing 0 and 10 µg/ml TBZ and incubated at 30°C. The cold- and TBZ-sensitive nda2 mutant strain defective in α1-tubulin was used as control [25].
