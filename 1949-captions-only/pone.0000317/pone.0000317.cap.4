(A) Time-dependent changes in frequency of different nuclei phenotypes observed in <em>dis3-54</em> single (left panel) and <em>dis3-54 Δmad2</em> double (right panel) mutants upon shift to the restrictive temperature of 20°C. Red line, <em>dis</em> nuclei phenotype (see <a href="#pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<em>A</em></a>); Blue line, asymmetrical nuclei and lagging chromosomes (see <a href="#pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<em>C</em></a>). (B) Localization of the CenI-GFP in the wild-type (WT), <em>dis3-54</em> single mutant and <em>dis3-54 Δmad2</em> double mutant cells. Cells were cultured and treated with Hoechst as in <a href="#pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<em>A</em></a>. Sister chromatids were able to separate in the double mutant, but chromosome segregation was abnormal. (C) <em>dis3-54</em> and <em>dis3-54 Δmad2</em> mutants are hypersensitive to TBZ. Serial dilutions (1:5) of each strain were spotted onto YPD solid media containing 0 and 10 µg/ml TBZ and incubated at 30°C. The cold- and TBZ-sensitive <em>nda2</em> mutant strain defective in α1-tubulin was used as control <a href="#pone.0000317-Umesono1">[25]</a>.</p>
