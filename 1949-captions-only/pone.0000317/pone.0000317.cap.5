                Figure 5. The dis3-54 mutation alters the Dis3 RNase II domain and causes reduced RNase activity. (A) The Dis3 protein contains the PINc, RNB and S1 domains. PINc belongs to a large family of protein domains associated with exonuclease or nucleotide binding activity. S1 is an RNA binding domain [65]. The RNaseII RNB domain contains four high consensus regions, Motif I, II, III and IV [30]. Amino acid sequences from Motifs I and IV of E. coli (EcRNaseII), S. pombe (SpDis3), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScDis3) and Human (Hs) are compared. Identity and similarity are indicated as black and gray boxes, respectively. The dis3-54 mutation alter the Pro509 residue to Leu (P509L) in Motif I, while another mutation affecting RNase activity (T808A) is located in Motif IV. (B) In vitro RNase activity of WT, P509L and T808A mutant Dis3-GST proteins at 37°C (top panel) and 20°C (bottom panel). Wild-type and mutant Dis3-GST proteins (1 pmol/lane) purified from S. pombe cells were incubated with total S. pombe RNA (1 µg/lane) as described in Materials and Methods. Reactions were stopped at the indicated time points and subject to denatured agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was detected by ethidium bromide staining. 25S and 18S rRNA bands are indicated. (C) Quantitation of three independent experiments represented in Fig. 5B. Total ethidium bromide signal intensities for the major 25S and 18S rRNA bands were measured using an Image Analyzer (Bio-Rad) and normalized against the intensities for the 0 min time points. (D) A multicopy plasmid carrying the wild-type dis3 gene is able to complement the cold sensitivity of dis3-54 mutant at 20°C on YPD media, whereas equivalent plasmids carrying either the dis3-54 (P509L) or dis3-T808A RNase mutant genes are unable to complement the cold sensitivity.
