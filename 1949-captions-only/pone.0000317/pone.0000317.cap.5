(A) The Dis3 protein contains the PINc, RNB and S1 domains. PINc belongs to a large family of protein domains associated with exonuclease or nucleotide binding activity. S1 is an RNA binding domain <a href="#pone.0000317-Bycroft1">[65]</a>. The RNaseII RNB domain contains four high consensus regions, Motif I, II, III and IV <a href="#pone.0000317-Zuo2">[30]</a>. Amino acid sequences from Motifs I and IV of <em>E. coli</em> (EcRNaseII), <em>S. pombe</em> (SpDis3), <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (ScDis3) and <em>Human</em> (Hs) are compared. Identity and similarity are indicated as black and gray boxes, respectively. The <em>dis3-54</em> mutation alter the Pro509 residue to Leu (P509L) in Motif I, while another mutation affecting RNase activity (T808A) is located in Motif IV. (B) <em>In vitro</em> RNase activity of WT, P509L and T808A mutant Dis3-GST proteins at 37°C (top panel) and 20°C (bottom panel). Wild-type and mutant Dis3-GST proteins (1 pmol/lane) purified from <em>S. pombe</em> cells were incubated with total <em>S. pombe</em> RNA (1 µg/lane) as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Reactions were stopped at the indicated time points and subject to denatured agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was detected by ethidium bromide staining. 25S and 18S rRNA bands are indicated. (C) Quantitation of three independent experiments represented in Fig. 5<em>B</em>. Total ethidium bromide signal intensities for the major 25S and 18S rRNA bands were measured using an Image Analyzer (Bio-Rad) and normalized against the intensities for the 0 min time points. (D) A multicopy plasmid carrying the wild-type <em>dis3</em> gene is able to complement the cold sensitivity of <em>dis3-54</em> mutant at 20°C on YPD media, whereas equivalent plasmids carrying either the <em>dis3-54</em> (<em>P509L</em>) or <em>dis3-T808A</em> RNase mutant genes are unable to complement the cold sensitivity.</p>
