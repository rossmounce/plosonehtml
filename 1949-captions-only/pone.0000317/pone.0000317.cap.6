Centromeric silencing of four <em>S. pombe</em> strains, wild-type (WT), Dicer deletion RNAi mutant (<em>Δdcr1</em>), Mis6 kinetochore mutant (<em>mis6</em>) and single <em>dis3-54</em> mutant, was examined in a genetic background containing the <em>ura4</em><sup>+</sup> reporter gene integrated into different regions of the centromere (<em>otr::ura4, imr1::ura4, cnt1::ura4</em>). Schematic diagram of <em>S. pombe</em> centromere I (upper panel) shows the <em>ura4<sup>+</sup></em> insertion sites. A strain without the <em>otr::ura4</em> reporter was included as a control (<em>ura4</em><sup>−</sup>). Silencing of a reporter gene integrated into the mating type locus (<em>mat1)</em> was also examined for <em>dis3-54</em>. Serial dilutions (1:5) of each strain were plated on YPD media without selection (N/S) and on YPD media containing 5-FOA (inhibitor of Ura+ strains), and incubated at permissive (33°C) and restrictive (26°C) temperatures as indicated. Note that <em>mis6</em> is a heat-sensitive mutant and that the permissive and restrictive temperatures for <em>mis6</em> are 26°C and 33°C, respectively.</p>
