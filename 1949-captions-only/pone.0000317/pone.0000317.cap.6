                Figure 6. The dis3-54 mutant shows defects in centromeric silencing. Centromeric silencing of four S. pombe strains, wild-type (WT), Dicer deletion RNAi mutant (Δdcr1), Mis6 kinetochore mutant (mis6) and single dis3-54 mutant, was examined in a genetic background containing the ura4+ reporter gene integrated into different regions of the centromere (otr::ura4, imr1::ura4, cnt1::ura4). Schematic diagram of S. pombe centromere I (upper panel) shows the ura4+ insertion sites. A strain without the otr::ura4 reporter was included as a control (ura4−). Silencing of a reporter gene integrated into the mating type locus (mat1) was also examined for dis3-54. Serial dilutions (1:5) of each strain were plated on YPD media without selection (N/S) and on YPD media containing 5-FOA (inhibitor of Ura+ strains), and incubated at permissive (33°C) and restrictive (26°C) temperatures as indicated. Note that mis6 is a heat-sensitive mutant and that the permissive and restrictive temperatures for mis6 are 26°C and 33°C, respectively.
