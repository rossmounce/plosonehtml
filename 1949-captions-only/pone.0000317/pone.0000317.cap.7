                Figure 7. Centromeric siRNA production and and overall chromatin structure in dis3-54 is similar to wild-type. (A) Accumulation of RNA transcripts derived from native centromeric repeats was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using strand-specific primers. Total RNA isolated from WT and S. pombe RNAi deletion mutants, Δrdp1, Δago1 and Δdcr1, grown at 33°C, and from WT and dis3-54 cultured at the restrictive temperature (20°C) were assayed. Actin was also assayed as a loading control, and reactions without reverse transcriptase (-RTase) were included as a control against DNA contamination. (B) Total small RNAs were extracted from S. pombe wild-type (WT) and dis3-54 mutant cells cultured at the restrictive temperature (20°C). WT and Δdcr1 deletion mutant strains cultured at 33°C were included as a positive control. Small RNA northern blots were probed with a specific probe to detect siRNAs derived from the centromeric dh repeat. Position of RNA size marker is shown to the left. Blots were re-probed with U6 snRNA for loading control. (C) The RITS complex was isolated from wild-type (WT), Δdcr1 and dis3-54 mutant cells by immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged Chp1 component. Small RNAs that co-purified with FLAG-Chp1 were extracted by phenol-chloroform and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after labeling with [5′-32P] pCp using RNA ligase. Position of the RNA size marker is shown to the right. (D) Localization of Swi6 protein at centromeric otr region in the dis3-54 mutant. ChIP analysis was performed using antibody against Swi6 protein [58]. Co-precipitated DNA was purified and PCR amplified using otr (dg1 and dg3) region specific primers. (E) Chromatin structure at the three centromere regions, cnt1, imr1 and otr (dg1) in WT, mis12 and dis3-54 mutants. Nuclear chromatin fractions were prepared from WT and dis3-54 mutant cells grown at 20°C for 8 hr, and mis12 at 36°C (restrictive) for 8 hr, and digested with MNase for 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 min. Southern Hybridization was then performed using specific probes for cnt1, imr1 and dg1.
