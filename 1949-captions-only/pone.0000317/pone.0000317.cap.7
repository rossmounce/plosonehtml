(A) Accumulation of RNA transcripts derived from native centromeric repeats was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using strand-specific primers. Total RNA isolated from WT and <em>S. pombe</em> RNAi deletion mutants, <em>Δrdp1, Δago1</em> and <em>Δdcr1</em>, grown at 33°C, and from WT and <em>dis3-54</em> cultured at the restrictive temperature (20°C) were assayed. Actin was also assayed as a loading control, and reactions without reverse transcriptase (-RTase) were included as a control against DNA contamination. (B) Total small RNAs were extracted from <em>S. pombe</em> wild-type (WT) and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells cultured at the restrictive temperature (20°C). WT and <em>Δdcr1</em> deletion mutant strains cultured at 33°C were included as a positive control. Small RNA northern blots were probed with a specific probe to detect siRNAs derived from the centromeric <em>dh</em> repeat. Position of RNA size marker is shown to the left. Blots were re-probed with U6 snRNA for loading control. (C) The RITS complex was isolated from wild-type (WT), <em>Δdcr1</em> and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells by immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged Chp1 component. Small RNAs that co-purified with FLAG-Chp1 were extracted by phenol-chloroform and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after labeling with [5′-<sup>32</sup>P] pCp using RNA ligase. Position of the RNA size marker is shown to the right. (D) Localization of Swi6 protein at centromeric <em>otr</em> region in the <em>dis3-54</em> mutant. ChIP analysis was performed using antibody against Swi6 protein <a href="#pone.0000317-Dziembowski1">[58]</a>. Co-precipitated DNA was purified and PCR amplified using <em>otr</em> (<em>dg1</em> and <em>dg3</em>) region specific primers. (E) Chromatin structure at the three centromere regions, <em>cnt1, imr1</em> and <em>otr</em> (<em>dg1</em>) in WT, <em>mis12</em> and <em>dis3-54</em> mutants. Nuclear chromatin fractions were prepared from WT and <em>dis3-54</em> mutant cells grown at 20°C for 8 hr, and <em>mis12</em> at 36°C (restrictive) for 8 hr, and digested with MNase for 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 min. Southern Hybridization was then performed using specific probes for <em>cnt1, imr1</em> and <em>dg1</em>.</p>
