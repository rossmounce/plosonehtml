(A) Synthetic lethality of <em>dis3-54</em> mutant with the deletion strains of Swi6 (HP1 homolog; <em>Δswi6</em>) and Dicer (RNAi component; <em>Δdcr1</em>). Single and double mutants were plated on solid media and replica plates incubated at a range of temperatures from permissive to restrictive (36°C, 33°C, 30°C, 20°C). Synthetic defects were observed at semi-permissive temperatures for the double mutants as indicated. (B) One model for the role of Dis3 in correct kinetochore formation and function. Dis3 exosome activity is involved in heterochromatin silencing at regions neighbouring centromeric repeats, possibly processing transcripts cleaved by Ago1. This processing mechanism would also be important for establishment of a functional kinetochore and microtubule attachment. Dis3 activity (either directly or indirectly) is then monitored as a key step by the mitotic checkpoint, preventing serious errors in the absence of correct kinetochore formation.</p>
