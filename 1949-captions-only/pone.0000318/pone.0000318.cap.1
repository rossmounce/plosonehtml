                Figure 1.  Rad21 depletion in HeLa cells.(A) Cartoon showing locations in the Rad21 mRNA sequence that were targeted by 9 different siRNA oligos used in this study. (B) Protocol used for achieving early S-phase synchrony of HeLa cells. (C) Summary of 8 different protocols used to deplete Rad21. Open rectangle indicates the timing of siRNA transfection relative to the synchrony protocol (which was done as described in B) or in asynchronous culture (leftmost arrow). Protocol-A, -B and -C are indicated as (a, b, c). For the protocols involving synchrony, the numbers at the bottom of each protocol indicate the total time from the siRNA transfection until the cells were released from the final early S-phase arrest, at which time protein extracts were prepared for biochemical analysis. In parallel, samples were fixed with Carnoy's for cytological analysis 11 hours after the release (in half of the samples, nocodazole was present during the last 2 hours before Carnoy's fixation). For the asynchronous protocol, protein samples and Carnoy's fixed samples were prepared 48 hours after siRNA transfection (in half of the samples, nocodazole was present for 2 additional hours and thus the cells were fixed with Carnoy's 50 hours after siRNA transfection). (D,E) Western blots showing degrees of Rad21 depletion achieved using Protocol-A and Protocol-B. Apc2 is a loading control. Left four lanes are dilution series of control samples. Letters above the other lanes denote the siRNA oligos used and correspond to those depicted in A. (F, H–J) Cytological analysis corresponding to the biochemical analysis shown in D and E. Samples were scored to determine the frequencies of mitotic cells that had cohered sisters (H), resolved primary constrictions (I) or fully separated sister chromatids (J). (Note that the cells shown are not arrested in nocodazole, and therefore serve as examples only. Examples with nocodazole are shown in Fig. 2.) The data tabulated in D and E indicate the frequencies of sister separation (combining the categories depicted in I and J) and the histogram plots (F) are colored corresponding to the categories depicted in H–J. (G) Depletion of Smc3 in HeLa cells (Protocol-C). Western blot shows Smc3 level at the time of release from S-phase synchrony. Tub = alpha-tubulin loading control. Cells with separated sisters chromatids (in tabulated form) were quantified from chromosome preparations fixed with Carnoy's and stained with Giemsa.
