Nocodazole was added after release from the S-phase synchrony and cells prepared for cytological analysis at the indicated time points. Cells with separated or partly separated sister chromatids were scored versus cells with cohered sisters, as depicted in C–E. For comparison, Sgo1-depleted cells were examined under the same conditions. Sgo1 depletion (~80% depletion) was slightly less efficient that Rad21 depletion (data not shown). Note that the data in panel A are reproduced in panel B but with a different Y-axis scale. (F) HeLa cells were depleted of Rad21 (or mock depleted) with the indicated siRNA oligos as described in <a href="#pone-0000318-g001">Figure 1, Protocol-A</a>. Nocodazole was added 48 hours after siRNA transfection and cells prepared for cytological analysis at the indicated time points, then scored as in A–E (% separated sisters combines the categories shown in D+E).</p>
