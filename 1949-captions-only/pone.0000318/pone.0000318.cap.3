After release from the early S-phase synchrony, samples were taken for biochemical (A) and cytological (B–L) analysis over the next 21 hours. (A) Western blot showing level of Rad21 depletion and mitotic status of the cells based on cyclin B levels (Tubulin = loading control). (B–D) Samples for cytology were fixed and stained (see <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>) and mitotic categories scored on at least 1000 cells per sample and time point. (E–F) Cytological features of cells transfected with Rad21-W siRNA: (E) Normal sister cohesion upon nuclear envelope breakdown (observed in 100% of the prophase and prometaphase cells); (F) Normal sister cohesion in early prometaphase; (G) Normal metaphase plate formation; (H–I) Aberrant anaphases – centromere regions separating before arms (arrows) and some chromosomes segregating to the poles before other chromosomes have separated their sisters. (J) Abnormal telophase – chromosomes have segregated (unevenly) to three cell poles; (K) Chromosome breaks in a cell with separated sister chromatids (presumably a post-anaphase cell); (L) Chromosome breaks in metaphase or early anaphase cells.</p>
