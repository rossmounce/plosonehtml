                Figure 4.  Anaphase and telophase abnormalities in Rad21-depleted HeLa cells.(A–L) Cells fixed with Carnoy's and stained with Giemsa. (A–E) Control series showing the cytology of control-treated cells at different mitotic stages: (A,B) Metaphases - side and polar views; (C) Early anaphases – polar and side views; (E) Telophase. (F–L) Examples of cells treated with Rad21-specific siRNA: (F) Metaphase – polar view; (G–I) Aberrant anaphase – asynchronous anaphase, defined as described in Fig. 3; (J) Apolar telophase – separated sisters scattered in the cytoplasm (cell may be arrested in mitosis based on the level of chromosome condensation); (K–L) Telophases with chromosome bridges and lagging chromosomes; (M) Quantification of abnormal anaphase and telophase cells in control-treated and cohesin-depleted cells. At least 1000 cells were scored per sample.
