Controls: (A,B) Normal cohesion and sister resolution in late prophase and early prometaphase; (C) Metaphase – polar view; (D) Anaphase -side view; (E) Telophase. NC-Rad21: (F–G) Delayed nucleolus disassembly in early prometaphase and delayed sister chromatid resolution (56% of prometaphases had the resolution defect); (H–I) Late prometaphase and metaphase cells with unresolved sisters (32%); (J) Metaphase – polar view; (K–L) Aberrant anaphases – centromere regions separating before arms (arrows) and some chromosomes segregating to the poles before other chromosomes have separated their sisters (28% were abnormal based on these criteria); (M) Cut telophase (26% of the telophases had this phenotype); (N) Apolar telophase (16% of the telophases had this phenotype); (O) Partially resolved diplochromosomes (5% of mitotics), in agreement with the described separase RNAi phenotype <a href="#pone.0000318-GimnezAbin3">[41]</a>; (P–T) DNA (DAPI; blue) and CREST (green) staining of kinetochores after NC-Rad21 induction. (P′–T′) DAPI channel only. (P) Metaphase; (Q) Early anaphase – one pair of kinetochores appears to be segregating prematurely; (R) Laggard kinetochores in anaphase; (S) Cut telophase - kinetochores have segregated to the poles despite deficient karyokinesis; (T) Bridged and laggard chromosomes in telophase.</p>
