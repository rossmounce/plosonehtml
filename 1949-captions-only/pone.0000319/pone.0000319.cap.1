Raster points represent the occurrence of action potentials. STP defined as the central 80% area of the PSTH (<em>white region</em>). <em>C</em>, Example raw data traces (12 traces superimposed) of spike responses elicited to the stimulation with different compound EPSCs: Left to right τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 0.1/1, 0.3/3, 5/50 ms. <em>D,E</em>, Mean STP as a function of EPSC decay and rise time (mean±s.e.m; <em>n</em> = 10 cells). <em>D</em>, STP as a function of EPSC decay time constant showed two levels of precision: high STP for τ<sub>decay</sub> values≤6 ms and low STP for τdecay≥6 ms. <em>E</em>, EPSC rise time had no significant effect on STP in combinations with the two different decay times (6 and 50 ms, <em>open</em> and <em>solid symbols</em>) shown.</p>
