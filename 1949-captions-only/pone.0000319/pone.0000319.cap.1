                Figure 1. Generation of different EPSC shapes by independently varying rise and decay times and measurement of spike time precision. A, Time varying currents, produced by a beta-function mimicking EPSCs with constant rise time (0.1 ms) and variable decay times (upper left) or constant decay times (lower left: 6 ms, lower right: 50 ms) and variable rise times. B, Raster and peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH, bin width = 1 ms) depicting spike responses to 300 presentations of an identical compound EPSC stimulus aligned on EPSC onset. Raster points represent the occurrence of action potentials. STP defined as the central 80% area of the PSTH (white region). C, Example raw data traces (12 traces superimposed) of spike responses elicited to the stimulation with different compound EPSCs: Left to right τrise/τdecay 0.1/1, 0.3/3, 5/50 ms. D,E, Mean STP as a function of EPSC decay and rise time (mean±s.e.m; n = 10 cells). D, STP as a function of EPSC decay time constant showed two levels of precision: high STP for τdecay values≤6 ms and low STP for τdecay≥6 ms. E, EPSC rise time had no significant effect on STP in combinations with the two different decay times (6 and 50 ms, open and solid symbols) shown.
