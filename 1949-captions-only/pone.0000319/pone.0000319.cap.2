                Figure 2. Physiological EPSCs induce spike responses with a temporal precision that is mostly determined by EPSC decay time. A, Action potentials induced by the repeated somatic injection of physiological compound EPSCs. Each plot shows 12 traces of raw data superimposed. The left column shows spike responses to compound EPSCs with fast kinetics (τrise/τdecay 0.1/1, 0.3/3 and 0.1/8 ms). The right column shows responses to compound EPSCs with slow kinetics (τrise/τdecay 5/50, 5/80 and 5/200 ms). B, Mean STP is plotted as a function of EPSC rise time. Note that the same rise time could be combined with up to three different decay times to produce different EPSC shapes. C, STP plotted as a function of EPSC decay time constant. Same data as shown in B. D, STP plotted as a function of EPSC width at half amplitude. Same data as shown in B.
