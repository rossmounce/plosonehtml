Each plot shows 12 traces of raw data superimposed. The <em>left column</em> shows spike responses to compound EPSCs with fast kinetics (τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 0.1/1, 0.3/3 and 0.1/8 ms). The <em>right column</em> shows responses to compound EPSCs with slow kinetics (τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 5/50, 5/80 and 5/200 ms). <em>B</em>, Mean STP is plotted as a function of EPSC rise time. Note that the same rise time could be combined with up to three different decay times to produce different EPSC shapes. <em>C</em>, STP plotted as a function of EPSC decay time constant. Same data as shown in <em>B</em>. <em>D</em>, STP plotted as a function of EPSC width at half amplitude. Same data as shown in <em>B</em>.</p>
