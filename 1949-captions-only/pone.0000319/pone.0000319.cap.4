                Figure 4. Spike time precision as a function of the temporal jitter of compound EPSCs. A, The diagram depicts the generation of a compound EPSC with a specific standard deviation (compound sigma) of the temporal distribution of EPSCs in the compound EPSC. B, Charge normalized compound EPSCs with different degrees of compound sigma but identical EPSC kinetics. C, Action potential responses induced by EPSCs τrise/τdecay 0.3/3 ms and different values of compound sigma. D, STP decreased with increasing temporal jitter in the compound EPSCs (n = 10), but the change was not significant. The two levels of spike precision exhibited by fast (square and triangle) and slow (circles) compounds matched the precision induced by the EPSC decay time shown in Figure 1D. Data were approximated with a linear regression (solid lines), slow compounds (circles) (r = .81, p = .18), fast compounds (squares) (r = .98, p = .09) and (triangles) (r = .98, p = .12).
