The two levels of spike precision exhibited by fast (<em>square</em> and <em>triangle</em>) and slow (<em>circles</em>) compounds matched the precision induced by the EPSC decay time shown in <a href="#pone-0000319-g001">Figure 1<em>D</em></a>. Data were approximated with a linear regression (<em>solid lines</em>), slow compounds (<em>circles</em>) (r = .81, <em>p</em> = .18), fast compounds (<em>squares</em>) (r = .98, <em>p</em> = .09) <em>and</em> (<em>triangles</em>) (r = .98, <em>p</em> = .12).</p>
