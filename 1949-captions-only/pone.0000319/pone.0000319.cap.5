Inset shows results for EPSPs 0.1/1 and 0.3/3 drawn on a larger scale. The addition of background noise had similar effects on fast and slow EPSCs, with the exception of EPSPs with τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 0.1/8 ms, which produced similar STPs under all three conditions (ANOVA, <em>p</em>&gt;0.05) and τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 1/20 ms, which showed decreased STP under noise conditions (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05), but no difference in STP between the noise and pre-noise condition (<em>p</em>&gt;0.05). For EPSCs with slow dynamics (τ<sub>rise</sub>/τ<sub>decay</sub> 5/50 and 5/200 ms), STP was reduced in the pre-noise condition by 82.5±4.3% and by 182.7±8.5% in the noise condition. For fast EPSCs, STP was reduced by 39.5±1.7% in the pre-noise condition and by 127.9±3.2% in the noise paradigm (ANOVA = <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). <em>C</em>, Spike delay relative to stimulus onset and spike time precision were linearly related. The addition of simulated synaptic background noise increased the slope of the STP vs. delay function (linear regression). Same data as in B, each symbol corresponds to the same EPSCs as B. Each connected pair of symbols corresponds to the same compound EPSC value (mean±s.e.m.; <em>n</em> = 10 cells).</p>
