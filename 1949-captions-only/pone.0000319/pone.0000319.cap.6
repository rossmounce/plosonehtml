Compound sigma values for which spike responses failed to occur in 90% or more of the cases were termed “sigma<sub>f</sub>” (marked by the asterisks in <em>A</em>). <em>B</em>, Compounds with fast EPSC kinetics failed to elicit spikes when the temporal jitter in the compound exceeded a few milliseconds (sigma<sub>f</sub>≤4 ms, <em>n</em> = 4 cells). Spike responses to a compound EPSC with slow kinetics, on the other hand, were less sensitive to temporal jitter in the compound (sigma<sub>f</sub> = 10±0.82 ms) (mean±s.e.m.).</p>
