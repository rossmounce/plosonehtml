                Figure 6. Reliability of spike generation as a function of input synchronization and EPSC shape. A, Spike responses to somatic injections of normalized compound EPSCs (τrise/τdecay 0.3/3 ms, top traces; τrise/τdecay 5/50 ms, bottom traces) with different levels of compound sigma. Compound sigma values for which spike responses failed to occur in 90% or more of the cases were termed “sigmaf” (marked by the asterisks in A). B, Compounds with fast EPSC kinetics failed to elicit spikes when the temporal jitter in the compound exceeded a few milliseconds (sigmaf≤4 ms, n = 4 cells). Spike responses to a compound EPSC with slow kinetics, on the other hand, were less sensitive to temporal jitter in the compound (sigmaf = 10±0.82 ms) (mean±s.e.m.).
