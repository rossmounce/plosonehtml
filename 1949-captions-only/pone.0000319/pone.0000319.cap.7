                Figure 7. Reliability of spike responses to unsynchronized compounds is significantly increased by background synaptic noise. A Firing probability in response to a fast compound EPSC plotted versus different compound sigma values with and without background noise. B Firing probability in response to a slow compound EPSC plotted versus different compound sigma values with and without background noise. For both EPSCs tested, the addition of background noise resulted in a significant increase in firing probability for each compound sigma and - particularly for the fast compound EPSC - in a more gradual decline of firing probability with increasing compound sigma. Data shown are averaged across three cells.
