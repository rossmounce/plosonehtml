                Figure 1. a. Example dual task trial. SOA from tone to letter was 200 or 800 ms. Single task tones and letters (here not shown) occurred at a fixed time (200 ms) from trial onset. b. Behavioural data from fMRI session. For dual task trials, SOA indicates interval between tone and letter, with tone data plotted at negative SOA and letter data at positive SOA. For comparison, single tone and letter data are plotted at a notional SOA. Letter data are for target trials. Error bars indicate standard errors.
