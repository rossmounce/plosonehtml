                Figure 2. Significant activity (q(FDR)&lt;.001 for both activation maps) for the contrast between single visual trials (orange) and single auditory trials (green) trials versus ‘null trials’ baseline. LH – left hemisphere, RH – right hemisphere. A list of cortical regions commonly activated by single visual trials and single auditory trials is provided in Table 1.
