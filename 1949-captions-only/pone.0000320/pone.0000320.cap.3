                Figure 3. Significant activity (p&lt;.03, uncorrected; voxel threshold&gt;60) for the whole brain contrast between dual task trials with long SOA and dual task trials with short SOA in a) frontal cortex and b) middle temporal gyrus. Details are provided in Table 2. Time courses of activity were extracted for dual task trials with short and long SOA and nontarget letters (dual task_200_nontarget; dual task_800_nontarget), dual task trials with short and long SOA and successfully identified letter targets (dual task_200_hit; dual task_800_hit), single visual trials with nontargets and successfully identified letter targets (single task_vis_nontarget, single task_vis_hit), single auditory trials (single task_aud) and dual task trials with short SOA and letter target misses (dual task_200_miss), in contrast to the null trial activation baseline. Error bars indicate standard errors.
