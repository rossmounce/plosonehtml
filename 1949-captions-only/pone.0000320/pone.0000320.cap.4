                Figure 4. Results of the whole brain contrasts between dual task trials with long SOA and short SOA in modality specific cortices. Significant activity (p&lt;.03, uncorrected; voxel threshold&gt;60) was found in modality-specific visual cortex (see also Table 2), but not in auditory regions. Time courses show activity for dual task trials with short and long SOA and nontarget letters (dual task_200_nontarget; dual task_800_nontarget), dual task trials with short and long SOA and successfully identified letter targets (dual task_200_hit; dual task_800_hit), single visual trials with nontargets and successfully identified letter targets (single task_vis_nontarget, single task_vis_hit), single auditory trials (single task_aud) and dual task trials with short SOA and letter target misses (dual task_200_miss), in contrast to the null trial activation baseline. Error bars indicate standard errors.
