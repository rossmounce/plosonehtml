                Figure 1.  T cell differentiation profile in bulk CD8+ T cells.Based on the lineage markers, CD45RA and CCR7 bulk CD8+ T cells of HIV-1 Controllers (black bars) and HIV-1 progressors (hatched bars) were stratified into 4 subpopulations: effector (E), effector memory (EM), central memory (CM) and na√Øve (N) CD8+ T cells. Terminally differentiated (E) CD8+ T cells were of significantly higher frequency in HIV-1 Controllers (p = 0.017, Mann-Whitney), while Progressors had higher levels of CM cells (p = 0.02), indicated by asterisks (*).
