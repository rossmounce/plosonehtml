                Figure 2.  The effector phenotype of an individual CD8+T cell response may not be adequately reflected in a peptide pool.Panels A and C show IFN-γ production upon stimulation with the Pol peptide pool (A) and an individual Pol peptide (C). Panels B and D are gated on the IFN-γ producing cells and show differentiation phenotype of these HIV-1 specific cells as defined by CCR7 and CD45RA isoform. The terminally differentiated response to the Pol peptide 356–374 (31.9% CCR7−/CD45RA+ of gated cells) is diluted in the response to the entire Pol peptide pool (only 8.8% gated cells are CCR7−/CD45RA+).
