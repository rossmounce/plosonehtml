Frequencies of effector phenotype T cell responses were significantly higher in HIV-1 Controllers (squares) compared to progressors (triangles). An HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell response with &gt;20% of CD45RA+/CCR7− cells was considered to be of terminally differentiated phenotype (dotted line) <a href="#pone.0000321-Hess1">[25]</a>. (B) More HIV-1 Controllers had at least one terminally differentiated HIV-1 specific T cell response compared to HIV-1 Progressors (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact). (C) Of the CD8+ T cell responses against HIV-1 tested per individual a higher percentage of terminally differentiated responses were detectable in HIV-1 Controllers (p = 0.007, Mann Whitney). For 3 Controllers all investigated responses were of the terminally differentiated phenotype, while five Controllers had none.</p>
