                Figure 1.  Prediction signal across chromosome 5 for the laboratory strains A364A, W303, Σ1278b and SK1.A364A and W303 genomes are mosaics of regions diverged from S288C, as indicated by extended regions of positive prediction signal for polymorphisms, interspersed with extended regions of sequence identity or low polymorphism, indicating common ancestry or recent divergence. The genomes of Σ1278b and SK1 show extensive divergence for most or all regions.
