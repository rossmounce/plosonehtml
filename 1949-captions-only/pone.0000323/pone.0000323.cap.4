            <em>Cluster analysis of secretory and membrane proteins.</em> Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of expression of 187 genes encoding putative membrane or secreted proteins in normal pancreas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, islet cell tumor tissues and a panel of normal tissues <a href="#pone.0000323-Shyamsundar1">[9]</a>. Only genes for which 80% of spots met quality criteria were used. The figure shows 187 genes representing secretory or membrane-bound proteins that show enhanced expression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas or islet cell tumors. An enlarged view of the array dendrogram along with sample identification is shown on the right. A color bar (<em>top</em>) relates color code to the magnitude of the differences in gene expression relative to the all-sample means for each gene. Grey indicates missing or excluded data.</p>
