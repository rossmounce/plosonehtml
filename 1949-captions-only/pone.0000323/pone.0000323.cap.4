                Figure 4. 
            Cluster analysis of secretory and membrane proteins. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of expression of 187 genes encoding putative membrane or secreted proteins in normal pancreas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, islet cell tumor tissues and a panel of normal tissues [9]. Only genes for which 80% of spots met quality criteria were used. The figure shows 187 genes representing secretory or membrane-bound proteins that show enhanced expression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas or islet cell tumors. An enlarged view of the array dendrogram along with sample identification is shown on the right. A color bar (top) relates color code to the magnitude of the differences in gene expression relative to the all-sample means for each gene. Grey indicates missing or excluded data.
