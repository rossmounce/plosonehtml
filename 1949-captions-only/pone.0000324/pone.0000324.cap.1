                Figure 1.  Distributions of orphans and non-orphans in E.coli K12.The predicted proteins in E.coli K12 that were found to be unique (light gray) when compared to 122 bacterial proteomes (shown in Table S1) were designated as orphans (n = 174). All remaining proteins (dark gray) were non-orphans (n = 4137). Distributions of values for both groups were calculated as a percentage for (a) length, (b) percent low complexity, (c) G+C difference from the mean, (d) Cost and (e) Neighbourhood Distribution.
