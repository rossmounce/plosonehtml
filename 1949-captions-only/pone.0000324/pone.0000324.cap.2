                Figure 2.  QIPP and Criterion Distributions of orphans in 122 bacterial genomes.The orphans (n = 43513) obtained from 122 bacterial genomes were scored and the distribution plotted according to (a) QIPP and the individual criteria that constitute QIPP: (b) length, (c) percent low complexity, (d) G+C difference from the mean, (e) cost and (f) Neighbourhood Distribution.
