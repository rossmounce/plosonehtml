                Figure 3.  Genomes which are more taxonomically isolated have larger numbers of high-scoring orphan predicted proteins.Chi-squared tests were used to determine which genomes had significantly more predicted proteins in the top 50% of the list of ranked orphan predicted proteins than would be expected by chance (âˆ’1 = significantly less orphans than expected in top 50% rank, 0 = no significant difference and 1 = significantly more orphans than expected in top 50% rank).
