                Figure 4.  Calculated QIPP scores for 5 bacterial genomes split into taxonomic classes.Every predicted protein in (a) E.coli K12, (b) H.pylori 26695, (c) N.meningitides MC58, (d) P.marinus CCMP1375 and (e) V.vulnificus CMCP6 was put into the taxonomic level at which it was restricted and scored according to QIPP.
