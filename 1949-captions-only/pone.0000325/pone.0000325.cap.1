                Figure 1.  Correlation between nucleotide content of DNA barcodes and the nucleotide content of the mitochondrial genome.Panel A shows the GC content of the DNA barcodes plotted against the GC content of the entire mitochondrial genome (including protein-coding and non-coding sequences). The outlier point (shown in red) is from Trichoplax adhaerens (NC_008151). Panel B shows the DNA barcode GC content plotted against the GC content of the combined protein-coding sequences only.
