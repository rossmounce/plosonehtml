IL-2 activated primary human NK cells were co-incubated with <sup>51</sup>Cr labeled 221 target cells at an E:T ratio of 0.8:1 to 0.05:1 for 4 and 16 hours. (A) 51 Cr release assay was used to calculate % specific lysis for 4 and 16 hours duration. (B) % specific lysis was used to calculate killing frequency by dividing the number of target cells killed by number of effector cells used for each E:T ratio. (C) Killing frequency of IL-2 activated NK cells using four independent donors for 4 and 16 hours duration.</p>
