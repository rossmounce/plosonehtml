                Figure 2. Serial killing by an NK cell. (A) A single NK cell makes multiple contacts with tumor cells resulting in lysis of tumor cells. Dye-labeled IL-2 activated NK cells (N, red) were incubated with unlabelled 221 tumor cells at an E:T ratio of 0.2:1 for 16 hours at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 and images were recorded by time lapse microscopy. Dead cells were detected using Sytox Green and numbered in the order of lysis. Time (h:mm) is indicated in the upper left corner of each image. (B) Majority of conjugate formations result in lysis. Conjugate formations between NK and 221 cells were randomly selected and lysed target cells counted. To rule out the possibility of interference of dyes in killing process, a control 51Cr release assay was performed with labeled cells. No difference was noted between the killing ability of labeled and unlabeled cells (data not shown).
