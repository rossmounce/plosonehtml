                Figure 6. Rituximab increases killing frequency of IL-2 activated NK cells. 221 target cells were treated with Rituximab (10 Âµg/ml) and killing frequency of NK cells was assessed by 4 h (A) or 16 h (B) 51Cr release assay and compared to untreated or isotype treated targets. (C) Data from three independent donors show that rituximab increases the killing frequency of NK cells two fold as compared to untreated target cells.
