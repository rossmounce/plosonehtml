                Figure 1. Example of reciprocal deletion/duplication CMA ratio plots with FISH validation. A Three sets of ratio plots showing examples of reciprocal microdeletion and microduplication at PWS/AS (on V5), NF1 (on V4) and DGS/VSFS (on V5) critical regions on chromosomes 15q11.2, 17q11.2 and 22q11.2, respectively. The vertical lines represent the BAC clones interrogating targeted regions of the genome, aligned according to their chromosomal position with the signal intensity ratios observed from the combined dye-swap experiments. Gains (G) are to the right and losses (L) to the left. Red circles highlight the signal ratios revealing genomic losses whereas the blue circles indicate copy number gains consistent with genomic deletions and reciprocal duplications, respectively. B FISH validation results. Control probes were labeled with a green chromophore and clones detecting deletions (in metaphase) or duplications (in interphase) were labeled in red for PWS/AS del/dup, NF1 del/dup and DG/VCFS del/dup.
