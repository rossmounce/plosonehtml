Big arrows indicate CNVs Type 1 (N = 119), except <em>AZFc</em> on the Y chromosome (N = 35). * represents V4 and for V5 for CNVs Type 2 (N = 143). A total of 262 copy number variations (CNVs) were identified by CMA. Of these, 217 were interpreted as familial variants (green) and 11 were determined to be <em>de novo</em> (red); 34 CNVs that await parental studies are depicted with unknown clinical significance (black). Positions showing losses are on the left side of the chromosome whereas gains are on the right side.</p>
