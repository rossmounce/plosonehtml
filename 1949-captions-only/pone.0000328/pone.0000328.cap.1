(A–C) or at 4 h p.i. (D–L). (A) <em>Mimivirus</em> particle being phagocytosed by an amoeba; bar = 2 µm. (B) Several single viral particles within intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles; bar = 2 µm. (C) Higher magnification of the boxed area in B showed the open vertex of an empty particle (arrow); bar = 1 µm. (D) Close contact of the membranes of two vacuoles (arrow), one with several <em>Mimivirus</em> particles and the other with a single viral particle; bars = 1 µm. (E) Extrusion of the internal <em>Mimivirus</em> membrane toward the vacuole membrane; bar = 200 nm. (F) Higher magnification of the contact zone between viral and vacuole membranes (arrow); bar = 100 nm. (G) Full closed, empty with open vertex (arrow) and opening <em>Mimivirus</em> particles; bar = 500 nm. (H) Higher magnification of the opening <em>Mimivirus</em> particle in G. The fused viral and vacuole membranes were clearly visible (arrow); bar = 100 nm. (I) Condensed electron dense material inside the cell nucleus (arrow); bar = 2 µm. (J) Higher magnification of the condensed electron dense material between the nuclear membrane and the nucleolus (arrow); bar = 500 nm. (K) An electron dense structure (arrow), distinct from the cell nucleus was observed; bar = 5 µm. (L) Higher magnification of this heterogeneous structure, surrounded with mitochondria; bar = 200 nm.</p>
