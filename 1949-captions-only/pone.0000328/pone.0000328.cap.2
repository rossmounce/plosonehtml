Nu : cell nucleus; bar = 5 µm. (B) At 12 h p.i. the cell cytoplasm was filled with newly synthesised viruses. The cell nucleus (Nu) was expelled to the periphery; bar = 3 µm. (C–G) Pictures were taken at 8, 12 or 16 h p.i. (C) Different stages of viral particles morphogenesis from the replication centre : beginning of hexagonal capsid assembly (white and black arrowheads); complete empty capsid (thick closed black arrow); filling of empty capsids with condensed electron dense material (thick open black and white arrows); release of full closed viral particles surrounded by fibrils at the periphery of the virus factory; bar = 500 nm. (D–G) Different aspects of viral capsid assembly : beginning of capsid assembly (D bar = 500 nm; G bar = 100 nm); almost complete capsids detaching from the replication center (E bar = 100 nm; F bar = 200 nm); complete capsid being filled with electron dense material (F) or complete viral particle without fibril (G). Membranes were observed beneath the capsid layer (F, G long black arrow). The vertex (small black arrows) was on the external side, opposite to the attachment and filling side (C–G).</p>
