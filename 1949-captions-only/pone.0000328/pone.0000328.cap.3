                Figure 3.  Ultrastructural aspects of the late steps of Mimivirus replication cycle â€“ encapsidation of viral DNA.Pictures were taken at 8, 12 or 16 h p.i. (A) Different stages of capsid assembly and DNA encapsidation : complete empty capsid (arrowhead); progressive stages of viral DNA insertion (black arrows) through a portal opposite to the vertex (white arrows); bar = 500 nm. (B) Viral DNA insertion into a capsid (arrowhead) and two different detaching steps of full complete viruses from the replication centre (arrows); bar = 500 nm. (C) Higher magnification of the complete viruses seen in B; bar = 200 nm; (D) Insertion of condensed viral DNA into a viral capsid; bar = 200 nm.
