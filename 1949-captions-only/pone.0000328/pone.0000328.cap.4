A, B : non infected amoebae; C, D: 0 h p.i. <em>Mimivirus</em> particles inside the cytoplasm and near the cell nucleus could be seen; E, F: 4 h p.i. The heterogeneous structure of the VF appeared near the cell nucleus. No viral particles were detectable in the cytoplasm; G, H : 8 h p.i. The intensively stained VF appeared as an homogeneous structure and neosynthesized viral particles accumulated around the VF; I, J : 18 h p.i. The VF was still intensely stained with quite a different structure, whereas the cell cytoplasm was completely filled with new viral particles. Fluorescence (left column) and DIC (right column) images of the same slide field were taken with a 63Ã—/1.4 oil lens. Fluorescence pictures were taken with an exposure time of 1 sec (A) and 64 msec with gain 2 (C, E, G, I). Inset pictures corresponded to the same as E, G and I taken at a different exposure time 64 msec (E, G) and 16 msec respectively (I).</p>
