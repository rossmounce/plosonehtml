                Figure 5.  Evolution and 3D reconstruction of Mimivirus factory.A: Characterisation and quantification of the different types of replication centre. Fluorescence pictures were taken at 4 h (I, exposure time 32 msec), 8 h (II and III, exposure time 64 and 128 msec respectively) and 16 h (IV, exposure time 32 msec) p.i. Bar = 10 µm. Histogram : a total of 717 DAPI-stained cells were analysed to quantify the proportion of each replication centre time at the indicated time points. B: DIC pictures of an APM infected A. polyphaga at 8 h p.i. taken with a 63×/1.4 oil lens. Different sections according to the depth of focus are shown downward (upper part, from a to d). Bar = 10 µm. The lower part represented a 3D reconstruction combining DIC and DAPI staining of the VF present in different infected cells of a microscope field. The dotted line box framed the cell analysed in the upper part. Blue : DAPI-staining.
