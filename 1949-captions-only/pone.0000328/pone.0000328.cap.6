The nuclei are marked around their edge with a blue line to allow quantification of their areas compared to those of the <em>Mimivirus</em> factories. (B) Quantification curve showing the normalized parameter (y-axis) as a function of time p.i. (x-axis). Red line: nuclei intensity; green line: nuclei surface fraction; blue line: <em>Mimivirus</em> factory surface fraction. Evolution of the mean fluorescence intensity over time p.i. in cell nuclei (C) or in virus factories (D), at 100 and 4 msec exposure time respectively, using R software; *** = p&lt;0.01 (Wilcoxon test).</p>
