                Figure 6.  Quantification of the kinetics of Mimivirus factory formation.(A) Fluorescence picture of a representative field from A. polyphaga at 5 h p.i., stained with DAPI (40Ã— magnification/0.7 lens). The nuclei are marked around their edge with a blue line to allow quantification of their areas compared to those of the Mimivirus factories. (B) Quantification curve showing the normalized parameter (y-axis) as a function of time p.i. (x-axis). Red line: nuclei intensity; green line: nuclei surface fraction; blue line: Mimivirus factory surface fraction. Evolution of the mean fluorescence intensity over time p.i. in cell nuclei (C) or in virus factories (D), at 100 and 4 msec exposure time respectively, using R software; *** = p&lt;0.01 (Wilcoxon test).
