                Figure 7.  Increase in total cellular DNA content in A. polyphaga during the Mimivirus infection cycle.A. Estimation of the total amount of cellular DNA by fluorescence intensity quantification of DAPI staining in Mimivirus infected (bars) or uninfected amoebae (hatched bars). Total intensity = staining area (pixels) Ã— mean intensity (intensity/pixel). The total intensity at different time points was divided by the intensity at time = 0 h p.i. for normalization. The bar height represents the variation of DNA content compared to the t0 timepoint for different cellular compartments. Red bar: nucleus; green bar: cytoplasm; blue bar: virus factory. B. The increase of total cellular DNA was extrapolated from 0 to 8 h p.i. and fitted with the exponential equation: y = A0.e(Rx). Data showed a high&nbsp;predictability with the exponential growth model (R2 = 0.94).
