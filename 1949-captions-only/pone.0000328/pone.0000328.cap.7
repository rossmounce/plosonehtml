Estimation of the total amount of cellular DNA by fluorescence intensity quantification of DAPI staining in <em>Mimivirus</em> infected (bars) or uninfected amoebae (hatched bars). Total intensity = staining area (pixels) Ã— mean intensity (intensity/pixel). The total intensity at different time points was divided by the intensity at time = 0 h p.i. for normalization. The bar height represents the variation of DNA content compared to the t0 timepoint for different cellular compartments. Red bar: nucleus; green bar: cytoplasm; blue bar: virus factory. B. The increase of total cellular DNA was extrapolated from 0 to 8 h p.i. and fitted with the exponential equation: y = A0.e<sup>(Rx)</sup>. Data showed a high&nbsp;predictability with the exponential growth model (R2 = 0.94).</p>
