Fusion of phagocytic vacuoles (2) and delivery of <em>Mimivirus</em> genetic material into the cell cytoplasm (3). <em>Mimivirus</em> DNA entry into the host nucleus (3), where the first round of DNA replication might begin (4). At 3 h p.i. <em>Mimivirus</em> DNA came out the host nucleus to form the VF replication centre (5). At 5 h p.i. the VF size showed a 50% increase and viral proteins began to be detected. Proviral capsid assembly and viral capsids budding from the VF central core could be observed (6). Empty or DNA filled capsids accumulated nearby the central core, resulting in a growing VF with viral particles free in the cytoplasm (7). Complete viral capsids surrounded by fibrils might be released through cell lysis (8).</p>
