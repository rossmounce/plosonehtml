                Figure 1.  Mutagenesis of ANTXR2.(A) Ribbon model of ANTXR2-PA binding interface (UCSF Chimera; PDB# IT6B) [17]. PA domain 2 (PA-D2) and PA domain 4 (PA-D4) are colored light and dark blue, respectively, and the ANTXR2 I domain is colored dark green. The Mn2+ cation bound by the ANTXR2 MIDAS is shown in magenta. ANTXR2 residues that are not conserved in ANTXR1 and are involved in PA-D2 and PA-D4 contacts are depicted in orange and red stick representation, respectively. (B) Cells transiently expressing ANTXR2-EGFP or mutant ANTXR2-EGFP receptors treated with dGAB for 45 mins at 37°C were incubated with PA63 at 4°C in the presence of dGAB to prevent PA internalization, and pore formation was induced by exposure to low pH buffers before lysing cells. PA pores, which correspond an SDS-resistant high molecular weight species, were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-PA serum followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The high molecular weight, SDS-resistant species on the blot representing PA pore are shown. These data are representative examples of at least three similarly performed independent experiments. (C) Triplicate samples of cells expressing WT ANTXR2-EGFP, and ANTXR2-EGFP with G153E, L154D, and 153–154 mutations were treated with PA and LFN-DTA in the presence or absence of 30 mM NH4Cl and assayed for cell viability as described in materials and methods.
