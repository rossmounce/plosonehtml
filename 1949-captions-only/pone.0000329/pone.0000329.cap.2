Residues 152–154 are depicted in orange stick representation with a mesh space-fill overlay, and those residues (155–157) that may affect display of the upstream contact residues are depicted in yellow sticks. The numbered residues of ANTXR2 are shown in white type. PA is depicted in space-fill representation, where C is grey, N is blue and O is red and the numbered residues are shown in black type. Below is an alignment of the primary sequence for this region in ANTXR2 and ANTXR1. The residues depicted in orange and yellow above are underlined; non-conserved changes in ANTXR1 are highlighted in red; and the ANTXR2 G153 and L154 residues shown to be important in <a href="#pone-0000329-g001">Fig. 1</a> are boxed. (B) PA pore formation was assayed at different pH values on the surfaces of cells transiently expressing ANTXR1-EGFP and mutant ANTXR1-EGFP receptors, as described in <a href="#pone-0000329-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. These data are representative examples of at least three similarly performed independent experiments. (C) Triplicate samples of cells were assayed for intoxication with PA and LF<sub>N</sub>-DTA in the presence or absence of 30 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and analyzed for cell viability as described in <a href="#pone-0000329-g001">Fig. 1C</a>.</p>
