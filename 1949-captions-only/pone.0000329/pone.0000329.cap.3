ANTXR2 residues that are conserved in ANTXR1 and are involved in PA-D2 and PA-D4 contact are depicted in orange and red stick representation, respectively. The PA residues E654 (dark blue) and R344 (light blue) that form salt-bridges with receptor residues K51 and E122, respectively, are also shown in stick representation. The position on the polypeptide backbone of PA residues G342 and D683 is also shown. (B) PA pore formation was assayed at different pH values on the surfaces of cells transiently expressing ANTXR2-EGFP and mutant ANTXR2-EGFP receptors, as described in <a href="#pone-0000329-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. The shaded region of the bar indicates the pH range where complete pore formation was observed, while the striped region of the bar indicates partial pore formation (as seen at pH 5.4 for Q88R and pH 5.6 for G153E in <a href="#pone-0000329-g001">Fig. 1B</a>). The results shown represent pooled data obtained from at least 3 independent experiments except in those cases where no effect (N.E.) was observed. In those cases, the data were collected from at least two independent experiments. PA bound to wild-type ANTXR2 formed pores between 5.0â€“5.2 (grey shaded area); receptors with mutations in this same pH range were determined to have no effect (N.E.).</p>
