                Figure 4.  Receptor residues involved in molecular clamp function.(A) Structural diagram of the contribution of individual residues to the receptor molecular clamp (from the monomeric ANTXR2-PA structure solved at 2.5 Å resolution; PDB# IT6B)[17]. Molecular clamp residues from panel A are colored black if mutation of the residue caused a 0.4–0.6 pH unit shift in pore formation, or grey if the mutation caused a&lt;0.4 pH unit shift in pore formation. (B) Left, Two ANTXR2 I domains bound to a PA63 dimer from the heptameric PA-ANTXR2 structure (solved at 4.3 Å resolution; PBD #ITZN)[18]. PA domains 2 and 4 are depicted in light and dark blue respectively, with the membrane insertion loop (residues 285–340) from PA domain 2 colored red. Right, One ANTXR2 I domain-PA monomer complex. Structural diagram of the contribution of individual residues to the receptor molecular clamp. Molecular clamp residues from panel A are colored black if mutation of the residue caused a 0.4–0.6 pH unit shift in pore formation, or grey if the mutation caused a&lt;0.4 pH unit shift in pore formation.
