                Figure 2.  LVP incubation of iDC does not induce maturation.Cells were incubated with LVP as in figure 1. Analysis were performed on non-treated iDC, 24 h and 48 h LVP-treated iDC. (a) Phenotype of non-treated iDC (filled profile), 24 h LVP-treated iDC (thick line) and 48 h LVP-treated iDC (thin line). Representative results of one experiment out of three. (b) Endocytic capacity of non-treated DC (opened bars), 24 h LVP-treated iDC (hatched bars) and 48 h LVP-treated iDC (filled bars). Mean fluorescent intensities were normalized to 100% uptake for non-treated control iDC. Data from one representative experiment out of three. (c) Cytokine secretion in the supernatant of 24 h (hatched bars) and 48 h LVP-treated DC (filled bars) compared to non-treated iDC (opened bars). Data represent mean secretionÂ±sd from four independent experiments.
