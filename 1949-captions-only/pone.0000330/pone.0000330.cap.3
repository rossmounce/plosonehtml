Control iDC (“iDC”) were obtained at d 7 without any addition. LVP was added to iDC at d 5 and LPS or polyI:C at d 6 for 24 h (“LPS on 24 h LVP-treated DC” or “polyI:C on 24 h LVP-treated DC”). Phenotype and cytokine secretion was analyzed as in <a href="#pone-0000330-g002">figure 2</a>. (a, c) Phenotypic maturation of LVP-treated DC induced by LPS (a) or polyI:C (c). Profiles of control iDC (dotted line), control mature DC (filled profile), and DC treated with LVP 24 h before addition of the maturation agent (thick line). Data from one representative experiment out of three. (b, d) Secretions of cytokines obtained after LPS addition (b) or polyI:C addition (d). Mean secretion±sd of three independent experiments.</p>
