                Figure 4.  LVP interferes with TLR4 but not with TLR3 signaling to induce a Th2-type response.(a) LVP interferes with T responses elicited by DC stimulated by a TLR4 ligand. Control iDC (▪) were obtained at d 7 without addition of LPS. Control mature DC (▴) were obtained at d 7 after addition of LPS at d 6. LVP was added to iDC at d 5 and LPS at d 6 for 24 h (○). DC recovered at d 7 were washed, resuspended in RPMI/10% FCS and then cocultured with T lymphocytes at DC/T cell ratios ranging from 1/10 to 1/40. IL-2, IFNγ, IL-5 and IL-13 were measured by ELISA in supernatants of co-culture. Data represent means±sd of triplicates of one experiment out of eight. (b) LVP does not interfere with TLR3 signaling in DC. Control iDC (“iDC”) were obtained at d 7 without addition of polyI:C. Control mature DC (“polyI:C”) were obtained at d 7 after addition of polyI:C at d 6. LVP was added to iDC at d 5 and polyI:C at d 6 for 24 h (“polyI:C on 24 h LVP-treated DC”). DC recovered at d 7 were washed, resuspended in RPMI/10% FCS and then cocultured with T lymphocytes at DC/T cell ratios ranging from 1/10 to 1/40. IFNγ, IL-5 and IL-13 were measured by ELISA in supernatants of co-culture. Data are shown for 1/40 DC/T cell ratio. Data represent means ± sd of triplicates of one experiment out of four.
