IP-LP were added to iDC at d 5 and LPS at d 6 for 24 h (“LPS on 24 h IP-LP-treated DC”). (a) Phenotypic maturation of IP-LP-treated DC induced by LPS. Profiles of control iDC (dotted line), control LPS-treated DC (filled profile), DC treated with IP-LP 24 h before LPS treatment (thick line). Data from one representative experiment out of three. (b) Cytokine secretion of LPS-treated DC (opened bars) and DC treated with IP-LP 24 h before LPS treatment (hatched bars). Mean secretion±sd of three independent experiments. Secretion was normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC. (c) MLR were conducted as described above with LPS-treated DC (opened bars) and 24 h IP-LP-treated DC matured with LPS (hatched bars). IL-2, IFNγ, IL-5 and IL-13 were measured by ELISA in supernatants of co-culture. Secretion of cytokine was normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC. Data are shown for 1/10 DC/T cell ratio.</p>
