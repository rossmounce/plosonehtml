                Figure 6.  IFNα can restore the ability of LVP-treated DC to induce IFNγ.DC were treated at d 5 with LVP and IFNα or IFNβ, and at d 6 with LPS. MLR were then conducted as described in figure 4 with control LPS-matured DC, 24 h LVP-treated DC matured with LPS, DC treated with IFNα and LVP 24 h before LPS addition, and DC treated with IFNβ and LVP 24 h before LPS addition. IFNγ was measured in supernatants of cocultures by ELISA and normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC.
