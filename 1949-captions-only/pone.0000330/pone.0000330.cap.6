MLR were then conducted as described in <a href="#pone-0000330-g004">figure 4</a> with control LPS-matured DC, 24 h LVP-treated DC matured with LPS, DC treated with IFNα and LVP 24 h before LPS addition, and DC treated with IFNβ and LVP 24 h before LPS addition. IFNγ was measured in supernatants of cocultures by ELISA and normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC.</p>
