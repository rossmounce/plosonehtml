Secretion of cytokine was normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC. IFNγ (a) and IL-5 and IL-13 (b) were measured by ELISA in supernatants of co-culture. Mean±sd are shown. Secretions are in the range of 260–2600 pg/ml for IFNγ, 20–80 pg/ml for IL-5 and 150–370 pg/ml for IL-13. (c, d) MLR were conducted as described in <a href="#pone-0000330-g004">figure 4</a> with control LPS-matured DC (filled bars), LPS-matured DC pre-treated with PD98059 (PD) (grey bars), 24 h LVP-treated DC matured with LPS (opened bars), DC pre-treated with PD before LVP incubation and LPS treatment (hatched bars). Secretion of cytokine was normalized to 100% for control LPS-treated DC. IFNγ (c) and IL-5 and IL-13 (d) were measured by ELISA in supernatants of co-culture.</p>
