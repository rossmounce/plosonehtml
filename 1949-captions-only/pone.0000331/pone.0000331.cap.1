Solid lines are the phase of the mosquito reproductive cycle; dashed lines are the rainfall phase. a) System in which the mosquito reproductive cycle resonates at the rainfall phase forcing; <em>ω<sub>m</sub></em> = 2π/(5 days); <em>ω<sub>r</sub> = </em>2π/(6 days); <em>k</em> = 0.35/day. b) System in which the mosquito reproductive cycle is uncoupled from the rainfall phase forcing; <em>ω<sub>m</sub></em> = 2π/(5 days); <em>ω<sub>r</sub> = </em>2π/(10 days); <em>k</em> = 0.35/day. Phase values range from 0 to 2π.</p>
