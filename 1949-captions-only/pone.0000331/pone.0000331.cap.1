                Figure 1. Plots of phase versus time from Equation 1. Solid lines are the phase of the mosquito reproductive cycle; dashed lines are the rainfall phase. a) System in which the mosquito reproductive cycle resonates at the rainfall phase forcing; ωm = 2π/(5 days); ωr = 2π/(6 days); k = 0.35/day. b) System in which the mosquito reproductive cycle is uncoupled from the rainfall phase forcing; ωm = 2π/(5 days); ωr = 2π/(10 days); k = 0.35/day. Phase values range from 0 to 2π.
