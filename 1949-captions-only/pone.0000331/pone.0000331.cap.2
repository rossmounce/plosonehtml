                Figure 2. Simulation of Cx. nigripalpus response to rainfall events of fixed frequency. a) Log plot of the simulated Cx. nigripalpus parous population (N). The initial population is N = 10,000 at t = 0. ωm = 2π/(10 days); ωr = 2π/12 days; k = 0.47/days, or uncoupling ~40 days; r = 35/hour; d = 0.0044/hour or 10% mortality per day. b) Log plot of the simulated Cx. nigripalpus parous population (N). The initial population is N = 10,000 at t = 0. ωm = 2π/(10 days); ωr = 2π/20 days; k = 0.47/days, r = 35/hour; d = 0.0044/hour. c) Log plot of the maximum number of parous mosquitoes over the course of 150-day runs, plotted as a function of rainfall forcing period (2π/ωr). The initial population of each run is N = 10,000 at t = 0. ωm = 2π/(10 days); k = 0.47/days; r = 35/hour; d = 0.0044/hour.
