                Figure 3. Simulation of Cx. nigripalpus response to rainfall events of varying frequency. a) Plot of mosquito (Φ) and rainfall (θ) phase over the first 150 days of a 300-day simulation. b) Plot of the parous Cx. nigripalpus population over the entire run. The initial population is N = 10,000 at t = 0. ωm = 2π/(10 days); ωr = 2π/(18+5*sin(2πt/40) days); k = 0.47/days, or uncoupling ~40 days; r = 35/hour; d = 0.0044/hour or 10% mortality per day. The time-dependent sine function in the denominator of the rainfall frequency term (ωr) produces a stable mosquito population.
