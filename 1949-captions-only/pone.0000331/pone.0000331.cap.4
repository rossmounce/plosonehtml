                Figure 4. Full model simulation of emergent Cx. nigripalpus population response to measured rainfall frequency. a) Time series of 10–40 period bandpassed rainfall and the phase of this rainfall. Raw rainfall data is from National Climate Data Center records, station Vero Beach 4SE. b) Log transform of both modeled and collected emergent Cx. nigirpalpus. A 5-day moving average has been applied to the collected data. Vertical bars highlight local maxima in the observed record. The simulated emergent time series is discontinuous due to model construct. The emergent population appears when cohorts finish pupation and vanishes as these mosquitoes take their first blood meal and begin egg development. The model was run for 365 days. The initial simulated population is N = 100 at t = 0 (January 1, 1990), ωm = 2π/(10 days); k = 0.47/days; r = 35/hour; d = 0.0068/hour or 15% mortality per day. Both plots are shown for Julian days 151–300 of 1990 (~June–October) during which a St. Louis encephalitis epidemic occurred in Florida. Vero Beach was the epicenter of this epidemic.
