The two groups without a statistical reviewer had a final-initial difference of 4.5 and 4.7 points, equivalent to a final-initial change in one item from very poor to excellent. Indeed, the two groups with a methodological referee changed 9.1 and 11.3, more than a complete reversal in the evaluation of two items. Thus, the effect size of adding a statistical reviewer is computed as the weighted average of the changes in groups CS+CSK minus changes in C+CK.</p>
