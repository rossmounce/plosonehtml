(A) Two stimuli touch skin in rapid succession (filled circles). Reflecting sensorineural imprecision, each stimulus evokes a Gaussian likelihood function, centered on its actual position, with spatial standard deviation σ<sub>s</sub> (vertical arrows: ±1 <em>σ<sub>s</sub></em>). The observer considers slow movement most probable <em>a priori</em>, adopting a Gaussian prior probability distribution for velocity, centered on zero, with standard deviation <em>σ<sub>v</sub></em> (slopes: ±1 <em>σ<sub>v</sub></em>). (B) Candidate trajectories, represented by first stimulus position and velocity (left column) or, equivalently, first and second stimulus positions (right). Intensity represents probability. Prior (top) x likelihood (middle) ∝ posterior probability (bottom). The actual trajectory (red crosshairs in all panels) occupies the position of maximal likelihood, but its velocity exceeds prior expectation. Perception (mode of posterior; red dot) is a compromise between reality and expectation. (C) Actual (filled circles, solid line) and perceived (open circles, dashed line) trajectories. Perceived ISD (<em>l'</em> = 0.67 cm; dotted bar) underestimates actual ISD (<em>l</em> = 2 cm; solid bar), and perceived velocity (v' = 6.7 cm/s) underestimates actual velocity (v = 20 cm/s).</p>
