                Figure 2. Basic Bayesian observer. (A) Two stimuli touch skin in rapid succession (filled circles). Reflecting sensorineural imprecision, each stimulus evokes a Gaussian likelihood function, centered on its actual position, with spatial standard deviation σs (vertical arrows: ±1 σs). The observer considers slow movement most probable a priori, adopting a Gaussian prior probability distribution for velocity, centered on zero, with standard deviation σv (slopes: ±1 σv). (B) Candidate trajectories, represented by first stimulus position and velocity (left column) or, equivalently, first and second stimulus positions (right). Intensity represents probability. Prior (top) x likelihood (middle) ∝ posterior probability (bottom). The actual trajectory (red crosshairs in all panels) occupies the position of maximal likelihood, but its velocity exceeds prior expectation. Perception (mode of posterior; red dot) is a compromise between reality and expectation. (C) Actual (filled circles, solid line) and perceived (open circles, dashed line) trajectories. Perceived ISD (l' = 0.67 cm; dotted bar) underestimates actual ISD (l = 2 cm; solid bar), and perceived velocity (v' = 6.7 cm/s) underestimates actual velocity (v = 20 cm/s).
