The same five data plots shown in <a href="#pone-0000333-g003">Fig. 3</a> (symbols) are reproduced here along with performance of the full model (curves). <em>σ<sub>t</sub></em> was fixed at 5 ms, <em>σ<sub>s</sub></em> set to 1 cm (forearm) or 0.1 cm (finger), and the value of λ adjusted in each case to minimize the mean-squared error between model and human performance. The performance of the full model is very similar to that of the basic model (compare to <a href="#pone-0000333-g003">Fig. 3A–E</a>). However, perception on the finger at 26 ms IST (crosses in E) is better-matched by the nonlinear performance of the full model (arrow; R<sup>2</sup>: 0.95) than by the linear performance of the basic model (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.90; compare <a href="#pone-0000333-g003">Fig. 3E</a>).</p>
