                Figure 7. Human data from five studies and full Bayesian observer's performance on the same tasks. The same five data plots shown in Fig. 3 (symbols) are reproduced here along with performance of the full model (curves). σt was fixed at 5 ms, σs set to 1 cm (forearm) or 0.1 cm (finger), and the value of λ adjusted in each case to minimize the mean-squared error between model and human performance. The performance of the full model is very similar to that of the basic model (compare to Fig. 3A–E). However, perception on the finger at 26 ms IST (crosses in E) is better-matched by the nonlinear performance of the full model (arrow; R2: 0.95) than by the linear performance of the basic model (R2: 0.90; compare Fig. 3E).
