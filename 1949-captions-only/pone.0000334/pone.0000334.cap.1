A. Full-length (FL) normal and mutant huntingtin from human motor cortex interact with copper and elute with peak centered at 128 mM imidazole. FL huntingtin has higher affinity for copper (II) than the copper-binding domain of human soluble APLP2. FL protein migrates at ~350 kDa. B. N-171 fragments of human huntingtin with 17 or 68 glutamines interact with copper (II) and have identical elution profiles. Proteins with C-terminal FLAG tag elute as a single peak at 32 mM imidazole. Non-FLAG protein elutes primarily at 32 mM imidazole, but also at higher concentrations. NSB = non-specific band. C. N-171-flag fragments of wild-type and mutant huntingtin do not interact with iron (III). For iron-IMAC, iron (III) was loaded onto column at pH 3, adjusted to pH 7, then the IMAC procedure performed immediately. D. N-171-17Q fragment (wild-type) was expressed using the pGEX vector and purified (see methods). Coomassie gel analysis reveals high purity. E. Purified N-171-17Q-flag fragment of huntingtin interacts directly with copper (II) and elutes identically to the in-vitro transcription-translation expressed protein (<a href="#pone-0000334-g001">Figure 1B</a>).</p>
