                Figure 3. Copper (II) is reduced by N171-17Q huntingtin and promotes aggregation of cell-free full-length mouse huntingtin. A. N-terminal huntingtin (N-171-17Q) reduces copper (II) as measured by the bathocuproine assay. B. Iron (III) is reduced by N171-17Q to a lesser extent than copper as measured by bathophenanthroline assay. Met = methionine, Phe = phenylalanine, His = histidine, Ins = insulin, VitC = ascorbate. Purified N171-17Q proteins were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in the presence of 20 µM of copper (II) or iron (III) and 360 µM bathocuproine or bathophenanthroline for copper (II) and iron (III) reduction assays, respectively. n = 4. C. Full-length wild-type mouse huntingtin aggregates following incubation at 37°C. Aggregation is promoted by 10 µM copper (II) and inhibited by EDTA and the brain permeable chelator, clioquinol. Aggregation is not inhibited by co-incubation with catalase.
