A–B. Twelve-week-old R6/2 and 12-month-old CAG140 mice represent late stage and pre-clinical HD, respectively. A. Open-field activity of R6/2 transgenic and CAG140 knock-in mice. R6/2 mice at 12-weeks have significantly decreased activity. CAG140 mice at 8–18 months are the same as wild-type littermates consistent with pre-clinical disease. B. Brain weights of 12-week-old R6/2 mice are decreased 12% consistent with severe brain atrophy and late-stage HD. Twelve-month-old CAG140 mouse brain weights are normal (p = 0.2367). C–D. Copper and iron levels in brains of 12-month-old CAG140 HD knock-in mice (pre-clinical HD) as measured by inductively-coupled-plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy. C. Copper levels are unaltered. D. Iron levels are increased 15% in cortex. E–F. Copper and iron levels in brains of 12-week-old R6/2 HD mice (late-stage HD) as measured by ICP spectroscopy. E. Copper levels are significantly increased in striatum and cortex. F. Striatal and cortical iron levels are increased, but not significantly (p-values are 0.2897 and 0.0782, respectively). n = 10–14. Values are shown as mean±SEM. Bars: white = CAG140; cross-hatched = R6/2; gray = wild-type litter mates of R6/2; black = wild-type litter mates of CAG140. p-values: *&lt;0.05, **&lt;0.01, *** = p&lt;0.0001</p>
