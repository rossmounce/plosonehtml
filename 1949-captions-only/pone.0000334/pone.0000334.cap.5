                Figure 5. Mutant huntingtin, copper and iron distribution in biochemical fractions of 12-week-old HD mouse cerebral cortex. A. Copper is increased in soluble and membrane fractions. B. Iron is increased in soluble, membrane and pellet fractions. Metals were measured by ICP-MS. n = 10–11. p-values after Dunn-Šidák correction for multiple testing *&lt;0.05, **&lt;0.01, ***&lt;0.001 C. Distribution of mutant huntingtin in pellet (P), soluble (S) and membrane (M) fractions as determined by Western blotting using a polyglutamine specific antibody (IC2-Chemicon). Pellets were treated with 90% formic acid for 1 hour at 37°C, lyophilized then resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer. Mutant huntingtin is identified by the presence of a band in transgenic mice (Tg) but not wild-type (Wt) mice (red arrow for soluble fraction). WetWtEq = wet weight equivalents.
