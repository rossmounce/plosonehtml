                Figure 6. Decreased L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in R6/2 HD mice is relevant to neurodegeneration. For A and C, black = wild-type, cross-hatched = transgenic. A. Activity of the copper-sensitive enzyme LDH is decreased in forebrains of R6/2 HD mice from 8-weeks. Time points were determined on consecutive generations of mice, thus only within time point comparisons are valid. n = 10. B. Total actin-normalized LDH monomer levels are unaltered (n = 4) but all five LDH isoenzyme activities are decreased at 12-weeks (n = 4, p = 0.0421). C. Lactate levels are increased in striatum and cortex of 12-week-old R6/2 HD mice. D. LDH is exceptionally sensitive to copper, but not iron or manganese, mediated inactivation. Five µg/ml purified LDH (Roche) was incubated with copper (II), iron (III), manganese (II) chloride in chelex-treated PBS for 1 hour at 37°C before LDH analysis. n = 8 Symbols: black circles = copper, white circles = iron, triangles = manganese. P-values: *** = p&lt;0.0001, ** = p&lt;0.001, E. The LDH inhibitor oxamate results in acute degeneration in wild-type mice when delivered intra-striatially, as compared to control treated mice.
