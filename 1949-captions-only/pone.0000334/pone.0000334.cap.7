                Figure 7. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a copper exporting protein, is decreased at the protein but not transcript level in the brains of 12-week-old HD transgenic mice. A–D. Soluble and membrane forms of APP are significantly decreased in striatum and cortex of R6/2 HD transgenic mice. APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) is decreased in striatal soluble fraction only. APLP1 levels are unaffected. β-actin is loading control for soluble fraction. C–D. Expression levels for transgenic mice are shown relative to respective wild-types (normalized to 100%). Black bars = membrane fraction, cross-hatched bars = soluble fraction. n = 11, a = p&lt;0.0001 E–G. Transcripts coding for APP, APLP2 and APLP1 are unaltered in striatum and cortex. n = 10 Gray bars = wild-type, white = R6/2 transgenic. H. Analysis of copper-transporting ATPase expression in HD mice. Menke's-disease protein (ATP7A) expression is unaltered. Wilson's disease protein (ATP7B) is increased in cortex only (p = 0.0174). n = 7–10, WT = wild-type, TG = transgenic.
