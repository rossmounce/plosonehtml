                Figure 1.  Determination and features of rich-clubs.(a) The distributions of the mean rich-club coefficient ρ in protein interaction networks of S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and C. elegans run through significant minimas, ρ (k)&lt;1, indicating the absence of any rich club phenomenon. In particular, the corresponding distributions reach a minimum at k yeast,fly = 70 and k worm = 58. (b) Focusing on a network of experimentally determined protein interactions in the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, we obtain a fundamentally different picture. A considerable increase of ρ at elevated levels of connectivity peaking at k = 45 suggests the presence of an oligarchy of highly interacting and well intertwined proteins. We also observe a minimum at k = 19. Assuming that interactions between proteins in the eukaryotic networks in (a) that have an ortholog in Plasmodium are conserved as well, we observe that the network of interologs lacks this feature. Combining both interaction sets, the rich-club signal we encountered in the experimental interaction network weakly prevails at the same degree cut-off. (c) Since the absence of any rich-club phenomenon points to the presence of well defined sub-networks, we calculate the number of disconnected sub-networks emerging from interactions between proteins with increasing degree cut-offs. We observe that the sub-networks of yeast, fly and worm expectedly break into parts at cut-offs k where ρ (k)&lt;1. Noteworthy, we obtain the largest number of disconnected components at degree cut-offs, where the corresponding distributions of ρ reach a minimum. In turn, sub-networks of experimentally determined protein interactions in P. falciparum keep their integrity. Inheriting this feature from its model organisms, evolutionary conserved protein interactions not only break into two disconnected parts but also keep this characteristic upon combination with experimental interactions in Plasmodium. (d) Although similar in their sizes, interactions in both networks only overlap to a very small but significant extent (P&lt;10−4 by assuming a hypergeometric distribution), while a considerable and significant amount of proteins (in parentheses) appear in both the experimental and evolutionary conserved protein interactions network (P&lt;10−4).
