                Figure 2.  Structure of the rich-club.(a) Combining experimentally and evolutionary conserved interactions in P. falciparum we obtain a network of 5, 458 interactions among 1, 986 proteins. Recalling that overlaps between these two data sets is minimal we obtain a visually striking image by coloring interactions according to their origin, allowing us to observe that both types of interactions appear to be largely separated. (b) Here, we focus on the sub-network that is spanned by proteins that have at least 19 neighbors, a degree cut-off that corresponds to the minimum of the rich-club coefficient in the network of experimentally determined interactions. Confirming our previous observation, we find a strong separation of areas that largely correspond to either experimental or evolutionary interactions. Experimentally determined interactions appear to embed proteins that are part of the rich club (inset). Notably, in the immediate vicinity of the oligarchy of nodes that are strongly connected among each other, we find a relatively small number of proteins in Plasmodium that have a human ortholog. Clarifying, we labeled each protein of Plasmodium with its human ortholog. However, in a small number of steps away from the rich-club, we encounter a lot of proteins with human orthologs, which are largely organized in evolutionary conserved interactions.
