In particular, layer <em>#n</em> refers to all the nodes that can be reached <em>n</em> steps away from the rich club of proteins. Reaching the second layer we already accumulate half of all the proteins in the network. These growing pools of proteins obtained by consecutive layers are the references for the following observations. (b) Analyzing the composition of consecutive layers we find no significant enrichment of human orthologs in experimental interactions, pointing to a random distribution of orthologs in the experimental data set. In contrast, the concentration of human orthologs in a network that combines both experiments and interologs is considerably diluted around the rich club and converges to <em>1</em> by definition throughout the following layers (dotted line). (c) Similarly, we determined the enrichment of proteins participating in the secretome in both the experimental and combined network of interactions in layers around the rich-club proteins. Compared to experimental interactions, we find that the addition of interologs enhances the enrichment of proteins that are secreted into the human host cell upon parasitic invasion. (d) Focusing on experimental interactions alone, we find that such links are predominately enriched in layers around the rich club, all together suggesting that the area around the rich club of proteins is predominately a matter of parasite specific activity.</p>
