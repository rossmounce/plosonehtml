                Figure 1.  Susceptibility to blood-stage infection during monthly prevalence surveys (1998–99); unmatched longitudinal analyses.Diagnosis of Pv and Pf erythrocyte infection was performed by light microscopy (LM) [16]. Light gray line represents A+/A− (n = 11) and dark gray line represents A+/A+ (n = 453). A, Cumulative Pv erythrocyte infection in Duffy A+/A− vs A+/A+ individuals in unmatched analyses (p = 0.026; log-rank test). B, Cumulative Pf erythrocyte infection in Duffy A+/A− vs A+/A+ individuals in unmatched analyses (p = 0.875; log-rank test).
