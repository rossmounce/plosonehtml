C, Diagnosis of Pf erythrocyte infection was performed by LM (<em>p</em> = 0.675; log-rank test). D, Diagnosis of Pf erythrocyte infection was performed by LDR-FMA (<em>p</em> = 0.453; log-rank test). In A through D, light gray lines represent A+/A− (n = 11) and dark gray lines represent A+/A+ (n = 33).</p>
