                Figure 3. #TP at 50% precision (Left) and #TP at 80% precision (Right) with varying amount of PPI edges. At 50% precision, the integration model always wins over the PPI model. However, at 80% precision, the integration model wins only when more than 50% of original PPI edges are present.
