                Figure 1. 
              Unmodified and transgenic human neural progenitor cells secrete neuroprotective factors in vitro. (A) Light microscopic appearance of neurospheres cultured from human prenatal cortical progenitor cells (hNPCctx). Transgenic neurospheres formed following infection of dissociated hNPCctx with a lentiviral vector encoding GDNF had an identical appearance in culture. (B) ELISA results quantifying the release of GDNF, IGF-1 and FGF-2 into conditioned media from hNPCctx and hNPCctx–GDNF cultures. IGF-1 and FGF-2 were secreted by hNPCctx, while GDNF was only detectable in transgenic hNPCctx-GDNF cultures. Data are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3–6 independent samples. (ND: not detectable).
