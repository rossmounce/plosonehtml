              <em>Unmodified and transgenic human neural progenitor cells secrete neuroprotective factors in vitro.</em> (A) Light microscopic appearance of neurospheres cultured from human prenatal cortical progenitor cells (hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>). Transgenic neurospheres formed following infection of dissociated hNPC<sup>ctx</sup> with a lentiviral vector encoding GDNF had an identical appearance in culture. (B) ELISA results quantifying the release of GDNF, IGF-1 and FGF-2 into conditioned media from hNPC<sup>ctx</sup> and hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>–GDNF cultures. IGF-1 and FGF-2 were secreted by hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>, while GDNF was only detectable in transgenic hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>-GDNF cultures. Data are expressed as mean±SEM from <em>n</em> = 3–6 independent samples. (ND: not detectable).</p>
