              Spatial visual acuity is preserved in eyes receiving human neural progenitor cell grafts. Rapid, non-invasive measurements of spatial visual acuity thresholds were obtained using the OptoMotry head tracking apparatus. At approximately P100, eyes receiving subretinal hNPCctx-GDNF (n = 11) or hNPCctx (n = 21) demonstrated superior spatial visual acuity compared to sham-injected eyes (n = 4; ***p&lt;0.001), with best-grafted animals yielding near-normal responses (0.6 c/d). Spatial visual acuity was also significantly better in sham-treated vs. untreated (n = 29; *p&lt;0.05) eyes, reflecting the known “sham effect.” Statistical significance was determined via one-way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls procedure for multiple comparison analysis.
