              <em>Spatial visual acuity is preserved in eyes receiving human neural progenitor cell grafts.</em> Rapid, non-invasive measurements of spatial visual acuity thresholds were obtained using the OptoMotry head tracking apparatus. At approximately P100, eyes receiving subretinal hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>-GDNF (<em>n</em> = 11) or hNPC<sup>ctx</sup> (<em>n</em> = 21) demonstrated superior spatial visual acuity compared to sham-injected eyes (<em>n</em> = 4; ***<em>p</em>&lt;0.001), with best-grafted animals yielding near-normal responses (0.6 c/d). Spatial visual acuity was also significantly better in sham-treated vs. untreated (<em>n</em> = 29; *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) eyes, reflecting the known “sham effect.” Statistical significance was determined via one-way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls procedure for multiple comparison analysis.</p>
