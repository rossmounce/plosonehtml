              Visual field is preserved in eyes receiving human neural progenitor cell grafts. Luminance threshold responses were recorded at approximately P100 from multiple points within the superior colliculus (SC) contralateral to the eye being tested. This method quantifies functional sensitivity to light across the visual field of an eye. The topographical map depicts the luminance threshold responses (measured in log units relative to background illumination of 0.02 cd/m2) at 15 points within the SC opposite the cell-injected eye of a best-performing animal at P104 (right side of figure). SC recordings (16 points) opposite the fellow, untreated eye (left side of figure) served as an internal control. Both hNPCctxâ€“GDNF and hNPCctx transplant recipients were included in the cell-injected group, which consisted of a select population of eyes that displayed superior performance on spatial visual acuity testing. Recordings falling at or below a threshold of 2.0 log units are indicated with unfilled ovals, while recordings above 2.0 are demarcated with filled ovals.
