              <em>Human neural progenitors survive as two distinct populations within the retina and promote photoreceptor rescue.</em> (A) Retinal section obtained from a P150 eye immunostained with human-specific nuclear marker. There is a pigmented RPE-like (RPE-L) layer of donor cells above the host RPE layer, whereas donor cells in the inner retina do not have pigment granules (<em>right-pointing arrows</em>). (B) High power image showing pigment granule-containing donor cells in the RPE-L region that are positive for human nuclear marker (<em>arrows</em>). Photoreceptor inner segments (IS) are visible above the pigmented donor cell layer, demonstrating partial preservation of photoreceptor structure. (C) Retinal section from the same eye used in panel A stained with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealing occasional dividing cells in the RPE-L layer and inner retina at P150 (<em>arrows</em>). (D) High power image showing PCNA-positive cells in the RPE-L layer (<em>arrows</em>). (E) Low power view of a retina section obtained from the same eye used in panel A showing extensive rescue of photoreceptors within the outer nuclear layer (ONL) after subretinal injection of hNPC<sup>ctx</sup>â€“GDNF. The <em>boxes</em> labeled <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> correspond to the high power images depicted in panels F and G, respectively. (F) High power view of <em>box f</em> from panel E showing rescued ONL and the underlying, semi-continuous layer of donor cells between the photoreceptors and RPE (<em>arrow</em>). (G) High power view of <em>box g</em> from panel E showing non-rescued ONL distant from surviving subretinal donor cells. INL: inner nuclear layer; IS: inner segments; ONL: outer nuclear layer; RGC: retinal ganglion cell layer; RPE-L: RPE-like layer.</p>
