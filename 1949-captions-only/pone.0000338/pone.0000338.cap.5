              Human neural progenitors survive as two distinct populations within the retina and promote photoreceptor rescue. (A) Retinal section obtained from a P150 eye immunostained with human-specific nuclear marker. There is a pigmented RPE-like (RPE-L) layer of donor cells above the host RPE layer, whereas donor cells in the inner retina do not have pigment granules (right-pointing arrows). (B) High power image showing pigment granule-containing donor cells in the RPE-L region that are positive for human nuclear marker (arrows). Photoreceptor inner segments (IS) are visible above the pigmented donor cell layer, demonstrating partial preservation of photoreceptor structure. (C) Retinal section from the same eye used in panel A stained with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealing occasional dividing cells in the RPE-L layer and inner retina at P150 (arrows). (D) High power image showing PCNA-positive cells in the RPE-L layer (arrows). (E) Low power view of a retina section obtained from the same eye used in panel A showing extensive rescue of photoreceptors within the outer nuclear layer (ONL) after subretinal injection of hNPCctxâ€“GDNF. The boxes labeled f and g correspond to the high power images depicted in panels F and G, respectively. (F) High power view of box f from panel E showing rescued ONL and the underlying, semi-continuous layer of donor cells between the photoreceptors and RPE (arrow). (G) High power view of box g from panel E showing non-rescued ONL distant from surviving subretinal donor cells. INL: inner nuclear layer; IS: inner segments; ONL: outer nuclear layer; RGC: retinal ganglion cell layer; RPE-L: RPE-like layer.
