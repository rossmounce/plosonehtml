                Figure 6. 
              Transplanted human neural progenitors express nestin in vivo and partially preserve host cone structure. Confocal images of P150 dystrophic retina transplanted with hNPCctx–GDNF and double stained with antibodies against human nuclear antigen (red) and either (A) recoverin, a photoreceptor and cone bipolar cell marker (green), or (B) protein kinase Cα (PKCα), a bipolar cell marker (green). Down arrows point to subretinal donor cell nuclei in panel B, while up arrows point to preserved dendrites of host rod bipolar cells. Note the location of donor cell nuclei in both the inner retina and subretinal space. (C) Confocal image of P150 dystrophic inner retina transplanted with hNPCctx–GDNF and double stained with antibodies against nestin, a neural stem and progenitor cell marker (green) and human nuclear antigen (red). (D) Confocal image of non-dystrophic, control retina stained with cone arrestin antibody (red) showing a normal cone photoreceptor profile (IS: inner segments; ax: axon; arrows point to cone pedicles). (E) P150 dystrophic retina transplanted with hNPCctx–GDNF and stained with cone arrestin antibody showing morphology of rescued cone photoreceptors (arrows point to cone pedicles). (F) Sham-operated retina at P150 stained with cone arrestin antibody (arrows point to rare remaining cone cell bodies). Results at P150 from retina transplanted with hNPCctx were similar to those receiving hNPCctx–GDNF. IPL: inner plexiform layer; ONL: outer nuclear layer; RGC: retinal ganglion cell layer; RPE-L: RPE-like layer.
