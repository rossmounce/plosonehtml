Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IGF-1Rß (H60), and blotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine (pY99) or anti-ubiquitin (p4D1). The graphs represent quantification (% of loading control) of three independent experiments. Means and SDs are shown. Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and re-immunoblotting with anti-IGF-1Rß (C20).</p>
