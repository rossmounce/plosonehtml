                Figure 3.  C-terminal domain is essential for ubiquitination of IGF-1R.After 24-h serum starvation Y1136, Y950F, Δ1245 and Y950F-Δ1245 cells were stimulated for the indicated time points with IGF-1. Determinations of IGF-1R phosphorylation and ubiquitination were performed as described in Fig. 2. The investigated signals from three independent experiments were quantified (% of loading control) and presented in graphs above each blot. Means and SDs are shown.
