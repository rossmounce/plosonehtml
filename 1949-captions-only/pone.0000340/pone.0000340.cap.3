Determinations of IGF-1R phosphorylation and ubiquitination were performed as described in <a href="#pone-0000340-g002">Fig. 2</a>. The investigated signals from three independent experiments were quantified (% of loading control) and presented in graphs above each blot. Means and SDs are shown.</p>
