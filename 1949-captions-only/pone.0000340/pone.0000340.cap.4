                Figure 4.  Ubiquitination of IGF-1R is crucial for ERK signaling.After 24 h serum starvation wt, Y1136F, K1003R, and Î”1245 cells were stimulated with IGF-1 for the indicated times and lyzed. The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt, anti-Erk antibodies to demonstrate equal loading. The experiments were repeated with similar results.
