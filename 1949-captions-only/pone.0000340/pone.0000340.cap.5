Wt, K1003R, and Δ1245 were either untreated (Unt) or pre-incubated with epoxomicin (PI) or chloroquine (LyI) as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>. Cycloheximide (CHX) (50µg/ml) was added and the cells were further incubated for 6 or 12 h. The cells were lyzed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with antibody to IGF-1Rß. The proreceptor and 95 kDa β-subunit of IGF-1R is indicated. B shows quantified data of IGF-1R, as normalized with GAPDH. Means and SDs of three separate experiments are shown. * <em>P,&lt;0.05</em>; **<em>P,&lt;0.005</em>.</p>
