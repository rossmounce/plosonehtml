                Figure 5.  IGF-1R is degraded through both proteasomes and lysosomes.A. Wt, K1003R, and Δ1245 were either untreated (Unt) or pre-incubated with epoxomicin (PI) or chloroquine (LyI) as described in Materials and methods. Cycloheximide (CHX) (50µg/ml) was added and the cells were further incubated for 6 or 12 h. The cells were lyzed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with antibody to IGF-1Rß. The proreceptor and 95 kDa β-subunit of IGF-1R is indicated. B shows quantified data of IGF-1R, as normalized with GAPDH. Means and SDs of three separate experiments are shown. * P,&lt;0.05; **P,&lt;0.005.
