                Figure 6.  Intact Y1136 and Y950 are important for lysosomal degradation of IGF-1R.Y1136F, Y959F, and Y950F-Î”1245 cells were pre-incubated without or with PI or LyI and treated with CHX as described in Fig. 5. After western blotting quantification of IGF-1R, as normalized with GAPDH, was performed. Means and SDs of three different experiments are shown. *P,&lt;0.05; ** P,&lt;0.005.
