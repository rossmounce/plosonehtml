Following training, the Nap group obtained a 60â€“90 min midday sleep period, while the No nap group remained awake across the 8hr delay. b, The nap period was recorded with digitized polysomnography (PSG) using a referenced electrode montage. The electrode montage (represented by blue discs) included EEG sites C3 and C4, covering localized learning regions of interest (motor cortex), together with O1 and O2 sites (referenced to A1 and A2, left and right outer canthi). A bipolar left and right submental array was used for monitoring of EMG (not shown), while left and right EOG channels (L-EOG, R-EOG) were used for eye-movement evaluation. For reference purposes, the electrode array is superimposed on top of the known fMRI changes in activation that occur across a night of sleep (modified from <a href="#pone.0000341-Walker4">[14]</a>; EEG anatomical precision not inferred), demonstrating enhanced activation in the right, contralateral motor cortex (activation strength in red/yellow, display threshold; <em>P</em>&lt;0.05<sup>FWE</sup>).</p>
