                Figure 4. Spindle power and offline motor memory enhancement. a, Spindle event-related time-frequency activity, evaluated across a 2 second epoch (0.5 seconds before spindle onset and the 1.5 seconds after), incorporating a frequency range of 1–30 Hz after band-pass filtering (12–16 Hz, encompassing sigma-band power), in the non-learning hemisphere (electrode site C3) and learning hemisphere (electrode site C4) individually. b, Corresponding correlations between motor memory improvement and mean spindle power. c, Subtracted difference in spindle power between the learning hemisphere versus the non-learning hemisphere (C4–C3). d, Corresponding correlation between motor memory improvement and subtracted spindle power (C4–C3). Spindle power is depicted in µV2 (strength indicated by right side color bar). Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) and corresponding significance (p) are displayed within each correlation window.
