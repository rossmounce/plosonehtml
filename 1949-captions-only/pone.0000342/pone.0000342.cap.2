Cells expressing <em>GAL-MAD3</em> were first synchronised in G1 (with alpha factor) or mitosis (with nocodazole) in raffinose media, and then a pulse of Mad3p expression was induced by 30 minutes of growth in media containing 2% galactose. Cells were then washed with glucose media (YPD) and cycloheximide was added to inhibit new protein synthesis. The G1 and mitotic arrests were maintained, samples taken at the times indicated, and whole cell extracts immunoblotted with anti-Mad3p antibodies to determine the remaining level of Mad3p. B) Mad3p turnover in G1 is APC/C dependent. Cells expressing <em>GAL-MAD3</em> were synchronised in G1 (with α-factor) in raffinose media, and then a pulse of Mad3p expression was induced by 30 minutes of growth in media containing 2% galactose. Cells were then shifted to 36°C (restrictive temperature for <em>cdc16</em>-ts) for 30 minutes, washed with glucose media (YPD) and cycloheximide was added to inhibit new protein synthesis. The G1 arrest was maintained, samples taken at the times indicated, and whole cell extracts immunoblotted with α-Mad3p antibodies to determine the remaining level of Mad3p. C) SCF mutants do not stabilise Mad3p in G1. <em>cdc4</em> and <em>cdc34</em> strains expressing <em>GAL-MAD3</em> were analysed for Mad3p turnover as in B. D) <em>mad3KEN30AAA</em> stabilises Mad3p in G1. <em>mad3Δ</em> cells containing GAL driven wild-type or <em>mad3-ken</em> mutants were arrested in alpha factor, and then Mad3p was induced for 30 minutes with galactose media. Cells were then washed in glucose media and cycloheximide was added to prevent new protein synthesis. Samples were taken at the times indicated, and whole cell extracts immunoblotted with anti-Mad3p antibodies for the level of Mad3p.</p>
