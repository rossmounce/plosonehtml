                Figure 3.  mad3-KEN-AAA mutants are spindle checkpoint defective.A) The mad3-ken mutants failed to complement the benomyl sensitivity of mad3Δ. The constructs indicated were transformed into the mad3Δ strain, and then diluted and plated onto YPD plates containing the indicated concentration of benomyl (µg/ml). Photos were taken after three days growth at 24°C. B) The mad3-ken mutants died rapidly. The strains from above were grown to log phase, synchronised in G1 with α-factor, released and then nocodazole was added to 20 µg/ml. At the times indicated, cells were taken, diluted, plated out and scored for their ability to form colonies on rich media. C) The mad3-ken mutants failed to maintain sister chromatid cohesion. In parallel these strains, which contain GFP-marked chromosomes, were scored for sister chromatid cohesion at 0 (α-factor arrested) and four hours after release into nocodazole-containing media. D) The mad3-ken mutants are unable to prevent securin and cyclin from being degraded. Similar strains to those above, but containing Pds1-Myc13 were synchronised in α-factor, then released into nocodazole media (20 µg/ml). Time points were taken, whole cell extracts made and immunoblotted for Pds1 (anti-myc) and cyclin levels (anti-Clb2p).
