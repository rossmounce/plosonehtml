The constructs indicated were transformed into the <em>mad3Δ</em> strain, and then diluted and plated onto YPD plates containing the indicated concentration of benomyl (µg/ml). Photos were taken after three days growth at 24°C. B) The <em>mad3-ken</em> mutants died rapidly. The strains from above were grown to log phase, synchronised in G1 with α-factor, released and then nocodazole was added to 20 µg/ml. At the times indicated, cells were taken, diluted, plated out and scored for their ability to form colonies on rich media. C) The <em>mad3-ken</em> mutants failed to maintain sister chromatid cohesion. In parallel these strains, which contain GFP-marked chromosomes, were scored for sister chromatid cohesion at 0 (α-factor arrested) and four hours after release into nocodazole-containing media. D) The <em>mad3-ken</em> mutants are unable to prevent securin and cyclin from being degraded. Similar strains to those above, but containing Pds1-Myc<sub>13 </sub>were synchronised in α-factor, then released into nocodazole media (20 µg/ml). Time points were taken, whole cell extracts made and immunoblotted for Pds1 (anti-myc) and cyclin levels (anti-Clb2p).</p>
