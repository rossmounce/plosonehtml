Native extracts were made from the indicated strains, containing Bub3-myc<sub>13</sub>, and Mad3p complexes were immunoprecipitated then immunoblotted for Mad3p and Bub3p (anti-myc). B) <em>mad3-KEN30AAA</em> mutants don't bind to Mad2p or Cdc20p. Cells were arrested in mitosis (with hydroxyurea and nocodazole) and native extracts were made from the indicated strains, containing Cdc20p-myc<sub>13</sub>. Mad3p was immunoprecipitated then immunoblotted for Mad3p, Mad2p and Cdc20p (anti-myc).</p>
