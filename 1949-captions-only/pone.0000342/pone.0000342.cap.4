                Figure 4.  mad3-KEN30AAA fails to form a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC).A) mad3-KEN-AAA mutants can bind Bub3p. Native extracts were made from the indicated strains, containing Bub3-myc13, and Mad3p complexes were immunoprecipitated then immunoblotted for Mad3p and Bub3p (anti-myc). B) mad3-KEN30AAA mutants don't bind to Mad2p or Cdc20p. Cells were arrested in mitosis (with hydroxyurea and nocodazole) and native extracts were made from the indicated strains, containing Cdc20p-myc13. Mad3p was immunoprecipitated then immunoblotted for Mad3p, Mad2p and Cdc20p (anti-myc).
