                Figure 5.  mad3-KEN30AAA stabilises Cdc20p in mitosis.A) Strains were arrested in mitosis (with nocodazole and hydroxyurea), and cycloheximide was added (time 0) to prevent new protein synthesis. Time points were taken and immunoblotted for Cdc20p levels (anti-myc) and Mad3p levels. B) Quantitation of the Cdc20p and Mad3p levels.
