B) Overexpression of Mad3p induces benomyl sensitivity. The over-expression strains were diluted and plated onto rich YPD media with or without the addition of 15 µg/ml of benomyl. Plates were photographed after 3 days growth at 24°C. C) Strains overexpressing Mad3p die quickly in the presence of nocodazole. The indicated strains were pre-synchronised in G1 with alpha factor, released into media containing 20 µg/ml nocodazole, and cells were plated out at indicated times. Viability was scored as the percentage of colonies formed relative to the zero time point. D) Mad3p overexpression has a mild effect on sister-chromatid cohesion. The overexpression strains, which containing GFP marked chromosome V, were synchronised in G1 with alpha factor, then released into media containing nocodazole. Sister-chromatid separation was scored as the percentage of cells containing two clearly separated GFP spots.</p>
