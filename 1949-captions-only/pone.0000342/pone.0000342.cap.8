                Figure 8.  Models of Mad3p KEN box interactions.a) Mad3 KEN box interactions. Mad2p and Mad3-KEN30 are both required for stable Mad3p-Cdc20p binding. b) Cdc20p turnover in mitosis: this is dependent on Mad3-KEN30, and Mad2p, suggesting that this Mad3 KEN box acts “in trans” as a Cdc20p degron. c) Mad3p turnover in G1. Mad3p is degraded in a Mad3-KEN30, Cdh1, and APC/C dependent manner.
