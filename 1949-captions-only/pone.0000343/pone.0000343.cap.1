The rivaling targets were red and green sinusoidal grating patches that subtended 2.5° of visual angle. The gratings had a spatial frequency of 1.6 cycles/deg oriented obliquely at either 45° or 135°. Targets were presented for either 60sec of continual presentation or for 60×1sec presentations over 600 sec (i.e. 1sec on 9sec off). In experiment 2, the same targets were presented in one of 8 locations spaced equally around a circular path with a radius of 4.5° around a 0.3° central fixation point. During the intermittent stimulus conditions targets were presented for 1sec with an inter-stimulus interval 250ms (all 8 locations visited every 10sec). In both conditions the targets were presented on a gray background within a 13.5° white square frame 0.2° thick. (B) Schematic illustration of results for an idealized case of random and strongly biased perceptual dominance (note that any switch in perception is only temporary, suggesting the dominance reflects an onset bias rather than stabilization). For foveal rivalry the data are graphically represented as a sequence of 60 adjacent colored bars corresponding (from left to right) with the perceptual dominance for each of the 60×1sec presentation (in the intermittent case the gap interval is not depicted). In experiment 2, perceptual dominance at each location is illustrated by a color patch corresponding to each of the 8 peripheral target locations. Each successive target loop is represented in increasingly outward rings. In this way, each color patch represents the subject's perceptual dominance at a single point in time and space for the entire trial. The left column represents idealized case for random allocation of dominance, while the right column shows complete localized biases.</p>
