                Figure 3.  Results from experiment 3, 4 and 5.(A) Data from all 4 subjects tested with 3 different speeds of smooth motion of the target around a peripheral trajectory (the same radial distance used in experiment 2). The left column shows smooth motion at a cycle speed of one loop every 10sec, a rate equivalent to experiment 2a–c. Throughout the 2min trial strong localized biases were reported consistently across all 12 cycle loops. The 2nd and 3rd column show a clear decrease in the strength and location specificity of perceptual bias as the target speed slows down to 20 and 100sec per loop. (B) In experiment 4, the 1sec presentation (identical to experiment 2a–c) was used to determine whether the reduction in bias with slower speeds was related to increases in local presentation duration or the elapsed duration between successive presentations at a single location. Data from 2 (of 4) subjects illustrate that localized biases exist independent of the elapsed duration between successive presentations. Local biases are still observed if the inter-stimulus interval is extended to allow cycle rates of 20 and 100sec and at retest 2 weeks later. (C) 2 subjects were tested with 60sec of adaptation to the dominant target (red in both cases) at 4 locations (0° 90° 180° 270°) indicated with the red triangle at the center of the corresponding radial plots. After the adaptation period the adapting stimulus was removed and the rivalry targets were presented 45° preceding the adapting location. The rivalry target then cycled smoothly through the adaptation location for 2 min (12×10sec cycles). Together the plots show that adaptation to one of the rivalry targets will result in dominance of the non-adapted target, however, the spatial and temporal extent of this effect is limited and varies across subject and adaptation location.
