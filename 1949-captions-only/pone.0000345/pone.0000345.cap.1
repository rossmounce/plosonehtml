                Figure 1. a) During mitosis, the parent cell may give rise to daughter cells that are different from the parent ( probability ε) being transferred downstream or, with probability 1−ε, to daughter cells identical to the parent which contribute to repopulate their own compartment. b) Hematopoiesis is maintained by a small group of stem cells that replicate slowly; subsequent steps lead to cell amplification and accelerated replication so that the populations grow exponentially. Contributions of each identified group of cells to hematopoiesis were computed as the weighted average based on the population distribution, being very similar to published estimates (STRC stands for short term repopulating cell, d is time in days and h is time in hours). c) The model parameters r, ε are robust to changes in the size of the active stem cell pool.
