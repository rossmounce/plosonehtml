                Figure 1.  Dendritic stratification pattern of RGCs in Thy-1 mGFP mice.(A) Confocal image of an RGC from whole-mount retina of a mGFP mouse. GFP expression is enhanced with a specific immunostaining. Immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody shows that RGC somata, dendrites and axons are GFP-positive [scale bar = 50 µm]. (B) Schematic representation of the patterning of cholinergic amacrine cell projections (red), which identify the a and b sublaminae of the IPL. An ON- and an OFF-center RGC, with dendrites monostratified in the b or a sublaminae, respectively, and an ON-OFF bistratified RGC are drawn in green. GCL: ganglion cell layer; IPL: inner plexiform layer; INL: inner nuclear layer. (C, D, E): Top row: examples of RGC (green) confocal reconstructed maximum projection images taken from whole-mount retinas from P16 mGFP mice; bottom row: 90 degrees rotation images of the cells displayed above. Red label denotes the immunolabeling pattern of Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive amacrine cells. Confocal microscopy was used to produce stacked images of three-dimensional reconstructed GFP-expressing RGCs and of ChAT positive amacrine cells. ChAT positive cell bodies are respectively in the GCL and in the INL, while their projections form two bands clearly visible in the rotated images (white arrow heads) that run along the sublamina a and b of the IPL. Bistratified RGCs present a double-layered segregated arborization with respect to the two anti-ChAT labeled bands (C, bottom), while monostratified ganglion cells have their dendrites proximal to the cell body and restricted to the ChAT positive band within sublamina b (D, bottom) or distal to the cell body and restricted to the outermost ChAT positive band in sublamina a (E, bottom) [scale bars = 50 µm]. (F, G, H) Examples of RGC (green) confocal images taken from 25 µm vertical retinal sections from P30 mGFP mice. The red bands representing the projections of cholinergic amacrine cells immunolabeled with ChAT, which denote the sublaminae of the IPL, are pointed at with white arrow heads [scale bar = 50 µm].
