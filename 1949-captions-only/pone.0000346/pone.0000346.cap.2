(B) Percentages of monostratified and bistratified RGCs during development in normal non-EE mice between P10 and P30 are respectively 34,2±3,5% at P10 (N = 4), 46,2±3,2% at P16 (N = 4), 69,2±2,9% at P30 (N = 5) for monostratified cells, and 65,8±3,5% at P10, 53,8±3,2% at P16, 30,8±2,9% at P30 for bistratified cells. Vertical bars indicate SEM. There is a significant decline of bistratified RGCs with age (One Way ANOVA, p&lt;0,001). The size of the RGC sample (total number of RGCs analyzed) and the percentage of bistratified RGCs are reported for each retina in <a href="#pone-0000346-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
