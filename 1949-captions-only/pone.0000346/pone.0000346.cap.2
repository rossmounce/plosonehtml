                Figure 2.  RGC stratification during postnatal development in normal non-EE Thy-1 mGFPmice.(A) Schematic representation illustrating the passage from immature to adult state during development of RGC dendritic stratification (cholinergic amacrine cells in red, RGCs in green). (B) Percentages of monostratified and bistratified RGCs during development in normal non-EE mice between P10 and P30 are respectively 34,2±3,5% at P10 (N = 4), 46,2±3,2% at P16 (N = 4), 69,2±2,9% at P30 (N = 5) for monostratified cells, and 65,8±3,5% at P10, 53,8±3,2% at P16, 30,8±2,9% at P30 for bistratified cells. Vertical bars indicate SEM. There is a significant decline of bistratified RGCs with age (One Way ANOVA, p&lt;0,001). The size of the RGC sample (total number of RGCs analyzed) and the percentage of bistratified RGCs are reported for each retina in Table 1.
