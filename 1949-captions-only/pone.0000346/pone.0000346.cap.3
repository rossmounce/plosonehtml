                Figure 3.  EE counteracts DR effects promoting RGC dendritic maturation.(A) The average percentage of bistratified RGCs in normal non-EE (white), DR (black), and EE-DR mice (grey) at P30. The percentage of bistratified RGCs is 30,8±2,9% in non-EE mice (N = 4, data replotted from Fig. 2); DR blocks RGC dendritic stratification (bistratified cells 55,9±5,2% at P30, N = 5 mice, 65/121 cells), while this process takes place normally in EE-DR mice (P30 EE-DR mice: bistratified cells 32,2±1,4%, N = 4, 40/126 cells). One Way ANOVA shows a statistically significant difference between normal non-EE and DR, and between EE-DR and DR mice; EE-DR are not different from non-EE mice (One Way ANOVA, p&lt;0,001; post-hoc Tukey's test). The bars indicate SEM. EE from birth prevents DR effects on the developmental remodelling of RGC dendrites. (B) Percentage of bistratified RGCs and sample size for each retina in DR and EE-DR mice. Data for non-EE mice are in Table 1.
