                Figure 4.  EE affects the maturational refinement of RGC dendrites.(A) Mean percentage of bistratified RGCs in non-EE (black) and EE mice (red) at P10 (non-EE: 65,8±3,5%, N = 4, 79/115 cells; EE: 44,2±3,7%, N = 5, 47/107 cells), P16 (non-EE: 53,8±3,2%, N = 4, 91/169 cells; EE: 36,7±5,7%, N = 5, 66/193 cells) and P30 (non-EE: 30,8±2,9%, N = 5, 54/169 cells; EE: 32,9±3%, N = 3, 44/138 cells). Two Way ANOVA shows a significant effect of age (p = 0,006) and environmental housing condition (p&lt;0,001). Post-hoc Tukey's test reveals a significant difference between EE and non-EE at P10 and P16 (asterisk). The bars indicate SEM. EE accelerates the process of the segregation of RGC arborizations. (B) Mean percentage of bistratified RGCs in non-EE (hatched, black, N = 3, 51,5±0,9%, 48/93 cells) and EE (hatched, red, N = 3, 37,8±4,2%, 37/97 cells) P16 mice obtained from confocal reconstructed images in whole-mount retinas after digital rotation, as exemplified in Fig. 1. Data obtained in retinal vertical sections are replotted from A for direct comparison (solid bars). There is no difference between the results obtained with these two methods of dendritic stratification analysis (Two Way ANOVA, housing×method, housing p = 0,006, method p = 0,911; no significant interaction). The size of the RGC sample and the percentage of bistratified RGCs are reported, for each retina, in Table 1.
