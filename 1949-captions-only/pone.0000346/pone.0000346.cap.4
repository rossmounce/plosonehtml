Two Way ANOVA shows a significant effect of age (p = 0,006) and environmental housing condition (p&lt;0,001). <em>Post-hoc</em> Tukey's test reveals a significant difference between EE and non-EE at P10 and P16 (asterisk). The bars indicate SEM. EE accelerates the process of the segregation of RGC arborizations. (B) Mean percentage of bistratified RGCs in non-EE (hatched, black, N = 3, 51,5±0,9%, 48/93 cells) and EE (hatched, red, N = 3, 37,8±4,2%, 37/97 cells) P16 mice obtained from confocal reconstructed images in whole-mount retinas after digital rotation, as exemplified in <a href="#pone-0000346-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Data obtained in retinal vertical sections are replotted from A for direct comparison (solid bars). There is no difference between the results obtained with these two methods of dendritic stratification analysis (Two Way ANOVA, housing×method, housing p = 0,006, method p = 0,911; no significant interaction). The size of the RGC sample and the percentage of bistratified RGCs are reported, for each retina, in <a href="#pone-0000346-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
