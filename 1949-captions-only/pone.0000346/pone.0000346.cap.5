BDNF immunoreactivity in RGC layer is remarkably lower in DR (center) than in normal non-EE mice (left), while RGC layer of EE-DR mice (right) shows a level of BDNF immunofluorescence similar to that of normal mice. Scale bar: 20 µm. <em>Bottom:</em> Quantitative analysis of BDNF immunofluorescence intensity normalized to background level in the RGC layer of normal non-EE (white), DR (black) and EE-DR mice (grey). BDNF immunofluorescence in the RGC layer of DR mice is significantly lower than in non-EE and EE-DR mice; no difference was found between non-EE and EE-DR mice (ANOVA on Ranks, p&lt;0,001; Dunn's Method). (B) <em>Top</em>: Vertical sections through the retina of P8 mice. Sections are immunostained for BDNF (green) and labelled with a nuclear marker (TOTO, red). BDNF immunoreactivity is lower in the RGC layer of non-EE mice (top) with respect to that in the RGC layer of EE mice of the same age. Scale bar: 20 µm. <em>Bottom</em>: Quantitative analysis of BDNF immunofluorescence intensity normalized to background level in the RGC layer of non-EE (white) and EE mice (red). t-test shows a statistical difference (asterisk) between the two groups (p&lt;0.001). The bars indicate SEM.</p>
