Conventions as for <a href="#pone-0000346-g001">Fig. 1</a>. (B) Average percentage of bistratified RGCs in P16 non-EE mice (white), untreated EE mice (control, black), EE mice treated with BDNF antisense (antisense, vertical line-pattern) and EE mice treated with BDNF sense (sense, horizontal line-pattern). In the retinas of EE mice injected with BDNF antisense oligos (N = 5) the percentage of bistratified RGCs is similar to that of normal non-EE mice of the same age (51,9±2,5%, 43/84 cells <em>versus</em> 53,8±3,2%, 91/169 cells), whereas the control treatment with sense oligos (N = 5) has no effect on the accelerated development produced by EE (32,2±3,5%, 29/88 cells <em>versus</em> 36,9±5,2%, 31/81 cells in EE mice treated with BDNF sense oligos and EE untreated mice, respectively). One Way ANOVA indicates a statistical difference (asterisks) between control EE and antisense treated EE, between sense and antisense treated EE mice and between non-EE and control or sense treated EE mice; no difference is found between untreated (control) and sense treated EE mice and between non-EE and antisense treated EE mice (p = 0,001; <em>post-hoc</em> Tukey's test). The bars indicate SEM. The blockade of BDNF expression blocks the effects of EE on RGC dendritic stratification.</p>
