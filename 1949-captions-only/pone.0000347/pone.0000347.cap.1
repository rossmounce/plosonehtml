MAbs from MHV-68-infected mice were used to stain either untransfected CHO-K1 cells (CHO) or CHO-K1 cells transfected with an ORF4 expression construct (CHO-ORF4). These cells were not cloned. Approximately 50% of them appeared to express ORF4. All ORF4-specific mAbs gave equivalent staining. T3B8 and T2B11 are shown as examples. nil = secondary antibody only. B. BHK-21 cells were either left uninfected (UI) or infected (18 h, 2 PFU/cell) with wild-type (WT) or ORF4-deficient (ORF4<sup>−</sup>) MHV-68. They were then trypsinized and analyzed for mAb binding by flow cytometry. Again, mAbs T2B11 and T3B8 are shown as representative examples. All ORF4-specific mAbs gave similar results except 9C7 (see D). C. Wild-type (WT) or ORF4-deficient (ORF4<sup>−</sup>) viruses were directly recovered from infected cell supernatants (virus) or also purified on density gradients (virions), denatured, resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mAbs 9C7 or 16D2. D. BHK-21 cells were left uninfected (UI) or infected with wild-type (WT) or ORF4-deficient (ORF4<sup>−</sup>) MHV-68 as in B, followed by flow cytometric analysis of mAb binding. E. BHK-21 cells were infected (18 h, 2 PFU/cell) with wild-type MHV-68, then labelled for 1 h with <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine/methionine. Viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with mAbs as indicated plus protein A-sepharose. A6, B12 and B9 are subclones of 9C7. T4C5 is a gH/gL-specific mAb. nil = protein A-sepharose only. The bands corresponding to gH and ORF4 product are indicated.</p>
