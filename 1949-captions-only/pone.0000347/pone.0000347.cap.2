A schematic diagram of ORF4 with its 4 SCR domains, ST domain and membrane anchor, summarizing the information from B on approximate mAb binding sites. B. 293T cells were transfected with GPI-linked ORF4 truncations. 48 h later, the cells were trypsinized and analyzed for mAb binding by flow cytometry. nil = secondary antibody only.</p>
