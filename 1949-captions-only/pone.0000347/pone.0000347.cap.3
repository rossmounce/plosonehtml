NMuMG epithelial cells or BHK-21 fibroblasts were infected with wild-type (WT) or ORF4-deficient (ORF4<sup>−</sup>) MHV-68 (2 PFU/cell). 48 h later, cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (400×g, 10 min) and virions then removed by high speed centrifugation (20,000×g, 3 h). Supernatants were immunoblotted with mAbs 16D2 or 9C7. B. The wild-type virions from A were similarly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Neat and 1/3 diluted lysates are shown. C. Virus from BHK-21 (B) or NMuMG cells (N) was denatured and then left undigested (nil) or treated with PNGase F (N-gase) or sialidase plus O-glycanase (O-gase). All samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mAbs 9C7 or 16D2.</p>
