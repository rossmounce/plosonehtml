Virus from BHK-21 cells was lysed in 1% Triton X-100 (lysate). 10% fetal calf serum is added to stabilize the virus, so albumin appears as a prominent 63 kDa band in the lysate. Pull-downs with heparin-agarose beads alone (-hep) or with additional 1 mg/ml soluble heparin (+ hep) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie R250. The prominent 150 kDa and 70 kDa viral bands are indicated. B. The same samples were immunoblotted with a rabbit serum raised against whole virus. At this exposure, strong signals are seen for only the most immunogenic viral proteins. C. The same samples were immunoblotted for ORF4 with mAbs 16D2 and 9C7, and for gp150, gN and gB with mAbs T1A1, 3F7 and T7H9. T1A1 and 3F7 were combined in one immunoblot because their targets are readily distinguished. The filled arrow marks gp150 and the open arrow gN.</p>
