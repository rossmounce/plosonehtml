                Figure 7.  GAG binding by gp150 truncations fused to GST.A. BHK-21 or L929 cells were incubated with GST alone or GST fused to gp150 ( = M7) amino acid residues 21-151, 41-151, 81-151 or 108-151. Binding was detected with a biotinylated anti-GST pAb plus phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and analyzed by flow cytometry. 1 of 5 equivalent experiments is shown. B. The GST-M7:41-151 fusion was preincubated with soluble heparin as shown before staining BHK-21 cells. These cells were pre-digested or not with heparitinase III. The effect of heparitinase III treatment on cell surface GAGs is shown in the inset. Protein binding was analyzed by flow cytometry as in A. 1 of 3 equivalent experiments is shown. C. Binding of the different GST-M7 fusions to GAG+ and GAGâˆ’ CHO cells was quantitated by flow cytometry. 1 of 3 equivalent experiments is shown.
