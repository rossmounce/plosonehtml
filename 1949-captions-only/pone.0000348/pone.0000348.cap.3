                Figure 3. Social networks of male bottlenose dolphin interactions in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand using headbutting rate to define relationships. The thickness of the lines represents the number of behavioural bouts observed. Numbers of headbutting were standardized to the number of focal follows in which both animals were observed together. The colour of the vertices represents the three clusters identified in Figure 1.
