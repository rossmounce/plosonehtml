                Figure 4.  Endogenous carotenoid gene expression.Transcript levels were measured through Real Time RT-PCR and were first normalized for expression of the housekeeping β-tubulin gene, and then for the expression levels in the Wt. A: tubers. B: leaves. For each construct, two lines with significant carotenoid changes and one “non expressor” line (NE) are shown. The histograms show the average and SE (error bars) of determinations from at least 4 different tubers (or leaves) from 2 different plants. For details see Materials and Methods.
