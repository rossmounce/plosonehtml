                Figure 5.  Schematic representation of metabolite and gene expression changes in “golden” tubers.Boxes represent the metabolic intermediates, arrows represent the genes catalyzing the various reactions. Fold induction or repression with respect to the wild-type - averaged over lines P-YBI 17 and 30 - is represented by different color hues (see legend). Asterisks mark Provitamin A carotenoids (α- and β-carotene).
