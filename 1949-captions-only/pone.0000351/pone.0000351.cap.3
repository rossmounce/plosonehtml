(a) Following 24 hours of social isolation, on PD 30/31, male B6 mice investigated a familiar female stimulus mouse for a greater duration then age-matched BALB males. This strain-dependent pattern was also expressed by (b) male mice that had been raised by a mother of the alternate strain, (c) male mice approaching a female from the alternate strain and (d) male mice approaching a same-strain female after 8–10 days of social isolation. All data are presented as the mean±SEM (** P&lt;0.01, *** P&lt;0.001).</p>
