                Figure 4. Approach behaviors of adolescent mice towards a novel olfactory stimulus and a food source. After 24 hrs of social isolation, (a) BALB and B6 mice investigated a lemon-scented cotton ball for a similar amount of time. Following complete food deprivation during a 24-hr social isolation period, (b) BALB males consumed more food (standard lab chow) than mice from the other groups during a 10-min period. All data are presented as the meanÂ±SEM (* P&lt;0.05 compared to BALB females and B6 mice of both sexes).
