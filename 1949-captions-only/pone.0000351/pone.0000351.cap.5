USV emission was positively associated with the SI responses of early-adolescent (a) B6 and (b) BALB mice. (c) USV production was selectively modulated during social interactions that involved a male test mouse from the BALB strain. (d–d′) Emission rates were similar for mice from both strains when USVs were detected. However, compared to BALB mice, the USVs of B6 mice occurred at (e–e′) higher average frequencies and lasted for (f–f′) shorter durations. Data in Figures d–f and d′–f′ are presented as frequency distributions of the raw acoustic signal that was collected during SI tests on PD 30/31. A portion of the data (&lt;0.5% of the sample from each strain) is not illustrated to keep the abscissa of each distribution within a reasonable size for presentation. Data in <a href="#pone-0000351-g005">Figure 5c</a> are presented as the mean±SEM (* P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01 for BALB vs. B6 mice).</p>
