                Figure 6. Classification of ultrasonic vocalizations into distinct categories. Representative sonograms and descriptive statistics for different types of USV that were emitted by (a–d) BALB and (a′–d′) B6 mice (see Results for classification criteria). Descriptive statistics (mean±std. dev.) are given for the duration of each call type, as well as the beginning and ending dominant frequency. The USV traces are arbitrarily aligned to the 100-msec demarcation on the abscissa of each sonogram. Intensity changes within each representative vocalization are color-coded. (a″–d″) The production of each USV subtype was strain-dependent (* P&lt;0.05, *** P&lt;0.001 for BALB vs. B6 mice).
