(a) B6 mice emitted more punctuated USVs than BALB mice. Four sonographic traces illustrate the varied form of punctuated USVs emitted by early-adolescent mice: (b<sub>1</sub>) a BALB punctuated USV with 2 pitch-jumps, (b<sub>2</sub>) a B6 punctuated USV with 2 pitch-jumps and 2 harmonics corresponding to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> elements of the vocalization, (b<sub>3</sub>) a B6 punctuated USV with 1 pitch-jump and 1 harmonic corresponding to the 1<sup>st</sup> element of the vocalization, and (b<sub>4</sub>) a B6 punctuated USV with 1 pitch-jump. (c) 141 BALB and (d) 140 B6 punctuated USVs were graphed as scatter-plots to illustrate the degree of internal frequency modulation present within individual ultrasonic syllables. Data points lying off the diagonal of each plot represent pitch-jumps. (e) Line graph depicting the number of punctuated USVs emitted during a 5-min interaction between mice that expressed the most punctuated USVs of each strain. The arrow and arrowheads denote pairs of mice that emitted a similar number of punctuated USVs. (f–f′) Data re-plotted from <a href="#pone-0000351-g007">Figures 7c and 7d</a>, respectively. (g) The pitch-jumps of punctuated USVs from one extreme BALB pair. (g<sub>1</sub>′–g<sub>4</sub>′) The pitch-jumps of four B6 pairs that produced punctuated USVs at a rate comparable to the BALB pair illustrated in <a href="#pone-0000351-g007">Figure 7g</a>. (h–h′) Data from <a href="#pone-0000351-g007">Figures 7f and 7f′</a> with pitch-jumps from <a href="#pone-0000351-g007">Figure 7g′</a> subtracted and the pitch-jumps from <a href="#pone-0000351-g007">Figures 7g<sub>1</sub>′–g<sub>4</sub>′</a> added, respectively. (i) The total number of pitch-jumps within individual punctuated USVs for each strain graphed as a relative-density histogram.</p>
