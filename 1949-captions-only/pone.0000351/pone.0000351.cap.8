                Figure 8. Strain-dependent variation in the social conditioned place preference responses of early-adolescent mice. Unconditioned mice from both strains expressed a preference for the paper bedding (control bars) and this natural bias obscured any conditioning effect that might have resulted from pairing social interaction with paper bedding (social plus paper bars). However, there was a robust, strain-dependent SCPP response for B6 mice when the less-preferred aspen bedding was paired with social enrichment (social plus aspen bars). Preference scores were calculated as the time each mouse spent in the aspen bedding-lined environment minus the duration in the paper bedding-lined compartment of the place-preference arena. All data are presented as the meanÂ±SEM (*** P&lt;0.001 for BALB vs. B6 mice).
