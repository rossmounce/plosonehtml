Unconditioned mice from both strains expressed a preference for the paper bedding (control bars) and this natural bias obscured any conditioning effect that might have resulted from pairing social interaction with paper bedding (social <em>plus</em> paper bars). However, there was a robust, strain-dependent SCPP response for B6 mice when the less-preferred aspen bedding was paired with social enrichment (social <em>plus</em> aspen bars). Preference scores were calculated as the time each mouse spent in the aspen bedding-lined environment <em>minus</em> the duration in the paper bedding-lined compartment of the place-preference arena. All data are presented as the meanÂ±SEM (*** P&lt;0.001 for BALB vs. B6 mice).</p>
