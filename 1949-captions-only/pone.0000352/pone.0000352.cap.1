                Figure 1.  Circular representation of the complete genome sequence of FSC198.Predicted coding sequences are colored according to their GC content. The inner circle indicates the positions of SNPs (red) and VNTR differences (blue) relative to the published Schu S4 genome sequence. SNP and VNTR loci are numbered as in table 1.
