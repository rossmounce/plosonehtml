                Figure 1.  MDM2-specific CD8+ T cells are present in the periphery of Agpos mice and express reduced levels of TCR and CD8 but high levels of CD44.(A) Lymph nodes cells from 6–8 week old Agpos and Agneg mice were stained with antibodies against CD4, CD8 and Vβ7 and analysed by flow cytometry. Numbers in quadrants are percentage of live-gated lymphocytes. (B) Lymph node cells were stained with antibodies against CD8, Vβ7 and the activation markers CD44, CD62L, CD69 and CD25. Histograms display gated viable CD8+Vβ7+ cells. Numbers in histograms represent the specific MFI of the activation marker staining for the gated population. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.
