Numbers in quadrants are percentage of live-gated lymphocytes. (B) Lymph node cells were stained with antibodies against CD8, Vβ7 and the activation markers CD44, CD62L, CD69 and CD25. Histograms display gated viable CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> cells. Numbers in histograms represent the specific MFI of the activation marker staining for the gated population. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>
