Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. (B) To measure antigen-specific IL-2 production, splenocytes from Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with pMDM100 peptide (100 µM) or a control peptide, pSV9 (100 µM). After 72 hours, 50 µl of culture supernatant was harvested and murine IL-2 was measured in a CTLL bioassay. Data represent the mean±SD of triplicate values and are representative of two independent experiments. (C) CFSE-labelled splenocytes from Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with pMDM100 or SV9 control peptides for 72 hrs. In the bottom panel, CFSE-labelled T cells were stimulated for 72h with pMDM100 in the presence of unlabelled splenocytes from Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice. (D) CFSE-labelled splenocytes from Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with pMDM100 or SV9 control peptides for 72 hrs. In the bottom panel, CFSE-labelled T cells were stimulated for 72h with pMDM100 in the presence of unlabelled splenocytes from Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice.</p>
