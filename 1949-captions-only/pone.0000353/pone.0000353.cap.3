(B) Splenocytes from Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice were stimulated for 3 days <em>in vitro</em> with pMDM100-coated targets in the presence of 10 U/ml IL-2, 10 ng/ml IL-7, 50 ng/ml IL-15 or 50 ng/ml IL-21 and Bcl-2 expression levels were analysed by intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis. Numbers in histograms represent the specific MFI of the gated CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> population. Following staining of the splenocytes with an appropriate isotype control mAb the MFI of the gated CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> population from the Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice was 98 and 97, respectively. Data in A and B are representative of three independent experiments. (C) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from the spleens of Ag<sup>neg</sup> and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice were stimulated with RMA-S coated with pMDM100 peptide (10 µM) in the presence or absence of 10 U/ml IL-2 and cell death was determined on the indicated days by staining with annexin-V and propidium iodide and flow cytometric analysis.</p>
