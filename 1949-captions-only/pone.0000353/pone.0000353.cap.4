(A) CD43 expression levels on the stimulated T cells was analysed by surface staining and flow cytometric analysis. Numbers in histograms represent the specific MFI of the gated CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> population. (B) Granzyme B expression levels on the stimulated T cells was analysed by intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis. Numbers in histograms represent the specific MFI of the gated CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> population. Following staining with an appropriate isotype control mAb the MFI of the gated CD8<sup>+</sup>Vβ7<sup>+</sup> T cells from the Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice was 398 and 495, respectively. Data in A and B are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Cytolytic activity of stimulated T cells against MDM2-expressing MBL-2 tumor cells and RMA-S targets coated with pMDM100 peptide (10 µM) or a class I binding control peptide, pSV9 (10 µM). Data are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
