                Figure 5.  pMDM100-specific CD8+ T cells from Agpos mice display defects in IFN-γ effector function that can be restored by IL-2.(A) To measure antigen-specific IFN-γ production, splenocytes from Agpos mice and Agneg mice were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with pMDM100 peptide (10 µM) or a control peptide, pSV9 (10 µM). After 72 hours, 50 µl of culture supernatant was harvested and IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Data represent the mean±SD of triplicate values. (B) Antigen-specific IFN-γ production by splenocytes from Agpos mice stimulated with pMDM100 peptide or a control pSV9 peptide in the presence of 10 U/ml IL-2, 10 ng/ml IL-7, 50 ng/ml IL-15 or 50 ng/ml IL-21. After 72 hours, 50 µl of culture supernatant was harvested and IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Data represent the mean±SD of triplicate values. Data in A and B are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Antigen-specific IFN-γ production upon secondary peptide stimulation of IL-2 rescued T cells was measured by intracellular staining for IFN-γ. T cells were re-stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with pMDM100 (10 µM) or an irrelevant control peptide, pSV9 (10 µM), for 5 hours in the presence or absence of 10 U/ml IL-2, followed by intracellular staining for IFN-γ. Comparable results were obtained when IFN-γ production by IL-2 rescued T cells was measured by ELISA in two independent experiments.
