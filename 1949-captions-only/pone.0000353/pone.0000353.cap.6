                Figure 6.  pMDM100-specific CD8+ T cells from Agpos mice display reduced functional avidity.(A) Splenocytes from Agneg mice and Agpos mice were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with titrated concentrations of pMDM100 peptide or an irrelevant control peptide, pSV9, in the presence of 10 U/ml IL-2. After 72 hours, 50 µl of culture supernatant was harvested and IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Data represent mean±SD of triplicate values. IFN-γ produced in response to RMA-S loaded with pSV9 was subtracted from all values. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (B) To measure antigen specific proliferation, splenocytes from Agneg mice (black squares) and Agpos mice (grey circles) were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with titrated concentrations of pMDM100 peptide or an irrelevant control peptide, pSV9, in the presence of 10 U/ml IL-2 for 2 days, and then pulsed with 0.5 µCi 3[H]-thymidine for 24 hours. The maximal proliferative response by splenocytes from the Agneg and Agpos mice was 130480.2±9552.9 CPM and 56225.17±2794.9 CPM (triplicate values), respectively.
