After 72 hours, 50 µl of culture supernatant was harvested and IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Data represent mean±SD of triplicate values. IFN-γ produced in response to RMA-S loaded with pSV9 was subtracted from all values. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (B) To measure antigen specific proliferation, splenocytes from Ag<sup>neg</sup> mice (black squares) and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice (grey circles) were stimulated with RMA-S cells coated with titrated concentrations of pMDM100 peptide or an irrelevant control peptide, pSV9, in the presence of 10 U/ml IL-2 for 2 days, and then pulsed with 0.5 µCi <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine for 24 hours. The maximal proliferative response by splenocytes from the Ag<sup>neg</sup> and Ag<sup>pos</sup> mice was 130480.2±9552.9 CPM and 56225.17±2794.9 CPM (triplicate values), respectively.</p>
