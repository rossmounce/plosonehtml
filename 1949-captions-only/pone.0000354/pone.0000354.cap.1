                Figure 1. Flight patterns and their representations. a) An example flight pattern of a Drosophila within a circular chamber of diameter 1000 mm and depth 600 mm. The trajectory was recorded with a stereo video system at 30 frames per second and lasts for about 11.3 s. There was no odour stimuli and the visual background was uniform and white. b) Representation of a projected flight path as straight-line movements between the positions (•) at which changes in flight direction occurred. A change in flight direction is deemed to have arisen when the direction of the current flight segment (joining two successive recorded positions) and that of the flight segment immediately following the last deemed change in direction, is equal or more than 90°.
