Power-scaling of the structure functions is indicated (dashed line). This scaling was obtained from least squares fitting of logarithms of the structure functions to logarithms of the time intervals, <em>τ</em>, for<em>τ</em>≤1<em>s</em>. b) Scaling-exponents, <em>ζ</em>, obtained in this manner are typically prescribed with a standard error of about ±0.01<em>q</em> and Pearson's correlation coefficient, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.99 Scaling exponents (symbols, o) are well represented by <em>ζ</em> = 0.9<em>q</em> (solid line) (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 1).</p>
