                Figure 2. Structure function analysis. a) Structure functions  characterizing the displacements, ΔXτ, in a time increment τ of hungry Drosophila in an odorless arena with white walls (symbols). Drosophila flights were projected onto the horizontal (x-y) plane. Power-scaling of the structure functions is indicated (dashed line). This scaling was obtained from least squares fitting of logarithms of the structure functions to logarithms of the time intervals, τ, forτ≤1s. b) Scaling-exponents, ζ, obtained in this manner are typically prescribed with a standard error of about ±0.01q and Pearson's correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.99 Scaling exponents (symbols, o) are well represented by ζ = 0.9q (solid line) (R2 = 1).
