                Figure 3. The distribution, nl, of lengths, l, of ‘straight-line flight segments’ (inter-saccade intervals). The sizes of the data collection bins are logarithmically distributed and numbers of straight-line flight segments have been normalised by the bin sizes. The straight line with slope -1.3 constitutes a linear least squares fit to the data for 10&lt;l&lt;100 mm (Pearson's correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.87).
