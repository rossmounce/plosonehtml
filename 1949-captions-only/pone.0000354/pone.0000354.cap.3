The sizes of the data collection bins are logarithmically distributed and numbers of straight-line flight segments have been normalised by the bin sizes. The straight line with slope -1.3 constitutes a linear least squares fit to the data for 10&lt;<em>l</em>&lt;100 <em>mm</em> (Pearson's correlation coefficient, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.87).</p>
