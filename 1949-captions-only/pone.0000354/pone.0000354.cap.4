The straight line with <em>β</em> = 0.5 constitutes a linear least squares fit to the data (Pearson's correlation coefficient, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.90). b) In the conditional analysis a turn is deemed to have arisen only if it is located at least 150 mm from the walls of the chamber. Many turns are that associated with collision avoidance are thereby excluded in the conditional analysis. The straight line with <em>β</em> = 0.85 constitutes a linear least squares fit to the data (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.90). The value of the scaling exponent, <em>α</em>, does not depend sensitively upon the distance of 350 mm and statistically indistinguishable values are obtained for distances in the range 300 to 400 mm.</p>
