                Figure 5. Assessment of the fractal dimension associated with the representations of the Drosophila flights. The average number, nl, of boxes of size lbox required to enclose the representations of the 3-dimensional Drosophila flights is plotted against lbox (dots). A power-law relationship of the form  would be indicative of a scale-free characteristic with fractal dimension D, and here, a linear least squares fit shows that D = 1.2. Fractal scaling is evident for spatial scales between about 5 and 75 mm. The insert shows the same plot for a series of simulated Lévy-flights with μ = 2.
