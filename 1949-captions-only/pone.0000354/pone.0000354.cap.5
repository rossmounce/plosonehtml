The average number, <em>n<sub>l</sub></em>, of boxes of size <em>l<sub>box</sub></em> required to enclose the representations of the 3-dimensional <em>Drosophila</em> flights is plotted against <em>l<sub>box</sub></em> (dots). A power-law relationship of the form <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000354.e009&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> would be indicative of a scale-free characteristic with fractal dimension D, and here, a linear least squares fit shows that D = 1.2. Fractal scaling is evident for spatial scales between about 5 and 75 mm. The insert shows the same plot for a series of simulated Lévy-flights with <em>μ</em> = 2.</p>
