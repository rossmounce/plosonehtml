                Figure 6. An example of the cumulative number of ‘saccade cycles’ made by a Drosophila as a function of the distance, L, flown. One ‘cycle’ corresponds to a series of body saccades in which the animal's heading changes ±360° within the arena. Positive cycles are made in clockwise direction whilst negative cycles are made in an anticlockwise direction. The flight pattern consists of straight-line flight-segments punctuated by saccades (Insert). The locations of the saccades along the flight path are indicated(•).
