The searching efficiency is the reciprocal of the mean distance travelled before first encountering a target. Simulation data are shown <em>λ</em>/<em>r</em> = 100 where r is the range at which a target can be detected for the case when flight-segments are randomly orientated (dashed-line) and for the case when the angle between successive flight segments is 45° and 90° (solid lines). Searching commences from just beyond (r, r). The searching is optimal when <em>μ</em>≈2 and when the turning angle is equal to or greater than 90°. The results of simulations (not shown) reveal that this is also optimal for <em>λ</em>/<em>r</em> = 10 and <em>λ</em>/<em>r</em> = 1000. Spiralling Lévy flights remain optimal if the sense of turning switches back and forth between 90° and −90° after completing two or more turns of the spiral. More frequent switching leads to a searching strategy that is less efficient than Lévy flights with randomly distributed turning angles. b) Simulation data for the optimal searching, efficiency, <em>η<sub>opt</sub></em> = max(<em>η</em>(<em>μ</em>)), as a function of the turning angle, <em>ϑ</em> (•). The solid-line is added to guide the eye. c) <em>μ</em> = 2 Lévy flights with random turns and with 90° turns. The spiralling promotes the revisiting of territory and thereby reduces the probability that nearby targets will be missed. d) A non-optimal Gaussian (<em>μ</em> = 4) spiral flight pattern.</p>
