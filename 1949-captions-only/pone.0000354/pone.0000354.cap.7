                Figure 7. Searching efficiencies and persistent turning. a) Searching efficiencies, η, for the location of targets placed at = the vertices of a square lattice with spacing, λ, as a function of the Lévy exponent, μ, characterising the distribution of flight segment lengths. The searching efficiency is the reciprocal of the mean distance travelled before first encountering a target. Simulation data are shown λ/r = 100 where r is the range at which a target can be detected for the case when flight-segments are randomly orientated (dashed-line) and for the case when the angle between successive flight segments is 45° and 90° (solid lines). Searching commences from just beyond (r, r). The searching is optimal when μ≈2 and when the turning angle is equal to or greater than 90°. The results of simulations (not shown) reveal that this is also optimal for λ/r = 10 and λ/r = 1000. Spiralling Lévy flights remain optimal if the sense of turning switches back and forth between 90° and −90° after completing two or more turns of the spiral. More frequent switching leads to a searching strategy that is less efficient than Lévy flights with randomly distributed turning angles. b) Simulation data for the optimal searching, efficiency, ηopt = max(η(μ)), as a function of the turning angle, ϑ (•). The solid-line is added to guide the eye. c) μ = 2 Lévy flights with random turns and with 90° turns. The spiralling promotes the revisiting of territory and thereby reduces the probability that nearby targets will be missed. d) A non-optimal Gaussian (μ = 4) spiral flight pattern.
