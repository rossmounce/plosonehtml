                Figure 8. Mean times in the local active searching phase, ts, comprised of short flight-segments having length L&lt;30 mm and in the relocation phase, tr (X), comprised of long flight-segment having length L&gt;30 mm. Mean times do not change significantly when the length scale L is increased or decreased by a factor of 2. Mean times for a diverse range of organisms with intermittent locomotion (•) (phorid fly, general locomotion; arctic grayling, food search with small and large prey; cricket, spontaneous walking and in presence of a calling mate; copepod nauplius, general swimming with food present; Drosophila meglanogaster larva, crawling on a non-feeding substrate; octopus, moving over reef while foraging) [30]. The scaling relation tr∝ts2/3 predicted by the Lévy-flight model of optimal searching [5] is shown (solid line).
