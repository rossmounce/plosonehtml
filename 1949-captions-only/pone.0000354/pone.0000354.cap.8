Mean times do not change significantly when the length scale <em>L</em> is increased or decreased by a factor of 2. Mean times for a diverse range of organisms with intermittent locomotion (•) (phorid fly, general locomotion; arctic grayling, food search with small and large prey; cricket, spontaneous walking and in presence of a calling mate; copepod nauplius, general swimming with food present; <em>Drosophila meglanogaster</em> larva, crawling on a non-feeding substrate; octopus, moving over reef while foraging) <a href="#pone.0000354-Kramer1">[30]</a>. The scaling relation <em>t<sub>r</sub></em>∝<em>t<sub>s</sub></em><sup>2/3</sup> predicted by the Lévy-flight model of optimal searching <a href="#pone.0000354-Reynolds1">[5]</a> is shown (solid line).</p>
