Saccades occurring within 100 mm of the odor source are indicated (•). Sustained bouts of short length flights tend to occur in the vicinity of the odor source. The most pronounced of these occur between 50 and 60 s, and between 70 and 80 s (within shaded boxes). These bouts interrupt the Lévy flight searching. b) A projection of the flight pattern. The odor source is hidden in the floor of the arena and is located in the top left-hand quadrant of the projection. c) Structure functions <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000354.e008&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> characterizing the displacements, Δ<em>X<sub>τ</sub></em>, in a time increment <em>τ</em> of the <em>Drosophila</em> flights projected onto the horizontal (x-y) plane. d) Power-scaling of the structure functions is indicated (dashed line). This scaling was obtained from least squares fitting of the structure functions for <em>τ</em>≤1<em>s</em>. Scaling-exponents, <em>ζ</em>, obtained in this manner are typically prescribed with a standard error of about ±0.01<em>q</em> and Pearson's correlation coefficient, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.99 Scaling exponents (symbols, •) are well represented by <em>ζ</em> = 0.9<em>q</em> (solid line) (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 1).</p>
