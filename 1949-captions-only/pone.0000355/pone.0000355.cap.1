                Figure 1. Two plausible alternative loop conformations of the lac repressor-DNA complex. The bidentate repressor, with the two dimers that form the functional tetramer shown in red, simultaneously binds DNA, colored orange, at two sites. The two structures represent two plausible trajectories of the DNA loop and two plausible conformations of the lac repressor (V-shaped and extended).
