                Figure 2. Two-conformation analysis of the in vivo free energy of DNA looping. The in vivo free energy of looping DNA by the lac repressor (blue symbols) was obtained as described in Saiz et al. [10] (see also Methods) from the measured repression levels of Muller et al. [11] for wild type (WT1) and of Becker et al. [22] for wild type (WT2) and a mutant that does not express the architectural HU protein (ΔHU). As repression levels in the absence of looping (see Methods and Saiz et al. [10]) we have used 135 (WT1), 2.3 (WT2), and 1.7 (ΔHU). The thick black continuous lines correspond in each case to the best fit to the free energy ΔGl given by Equations 1 and 2, which considers the contributions of two looped conformations. The contributions of each conformation are shown separately as red () and black () dashed lines. The values of the parameters for the best fit are shown in Table 1.
