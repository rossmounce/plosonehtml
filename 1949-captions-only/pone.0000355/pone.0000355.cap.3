Different types of behavior are obtained by changing two key parameters: the difference in optimal free energies (Δ<em>G</em><sub>0,1–</sub>Δ<em>G</em><sub>0,2</sub>) and optimal phases (<em>L<sub>opt</sub></em><sub>,1</sub>–<em>L<sub>opt</sub></em><sub>,2</sub>). (A) The difference in optimal free energies between the two configurations increases from 0 kcal/mol (blue) to 1.5 kcal/mol (red) in increments of 0.5 kcal/mol whereas the difference in optimal phases is kept fixed at 4.2 bp. (B, C) The difference in optimal phases between the two conformations increases from −5.5 bp (blue) to 0 bp (red) in increments of 5.5/3 bp whereas the difference in optimal free energies is kept fixed at 1 kcal/mol (B) and at 0 kcal/mol (C).</p>
