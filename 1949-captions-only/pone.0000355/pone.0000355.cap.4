Repression levels obtained with Equation 3 using the corresponding free energies of <a href="#pone-0000355-g003">Figure 3</a>. (A) Differences in optimal free energies are varied and the optimal phases are kept fixed. (B, C) Differences in optimal phases are varied and optimal free energies are kept fixed at two different values: 1 kcal/mol (B) and 0 kcal/mol (C).</p>
