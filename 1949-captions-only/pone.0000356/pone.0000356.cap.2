                Figure 2.  Synopsis of transcriptional activity in the Human Hox Clusters.Sense and antisense transcriptions are in red and green respectively. Dark and light shaded boxes represent exon and intron. Mir genes are in blue. The three long transcripts presenting a murine homolog with a conserved exon-exon boundary are headed by **. The 13 TUs (12 antisense and one sense) located at similar position in human and mouse are denoted by an asterisk (*) while the 10 TUs showing conservation are depicted with
