Dark and light shaded boxes represent exon and intron. Mir genes are in blue. The three long transcripts presenting a murine homolog with a conserved exon-exon boundary are headed by **. The 13 TUs (12 antisense and one sense) located at similar position in human and mouse are denoted by an asterisk (*) while the 10 TUs showing conservation are depicted with</p>
