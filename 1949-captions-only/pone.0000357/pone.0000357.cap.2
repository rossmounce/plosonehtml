                Figure 2.  VISUALIZATION OF THE VARIANCE FOR MORPHOLOGY.Discriminant analysis based on meristic characters (x-axis) as a function of genetic class (y-axis). -1 = underrepresented combinations; 0 = combinations present in the expected proportions; 99 = overrepresented combinations other than T5, H5,T4i, Hi4 and H4T, which are represented separately (see the text for more detail). A) Meristic data set; B) Plastic data set on the global data set.
