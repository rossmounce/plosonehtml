                Figure 4.  DEFORMATION GRIDS.Deformation grids for various “mean specimen” comparisons (based on the 21 landmarks). These diagrams are schematic representations of the morphology encountered in allopatric/parapatric zones or in hybrid zones. The points indicate the main deformations observed on the corresponding grid.
