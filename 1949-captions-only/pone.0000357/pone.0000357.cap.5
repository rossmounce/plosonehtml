The circles correspond to 95% of bootstrapped values. H and T correspond to <em>C. n. nasus</em> and <em>C. t. toxostoma</em>, respectively, in the reference populations. The other classes are those of the hybrid zone (T5; H5; -1 = underrepresented hybrid combinations; 0 = hybrid combinations found in the expected proportions; 99 = overrepresented hybrid combinations; T4i = the only hybrid combination for which sufficient specimens were obtained for comparison alone, without pooling). The variance of K is very significantly different (Bartlett B = 63.7; <em>p</em> = 10<sup>âˆ’10</sup>) between classes.</p>
