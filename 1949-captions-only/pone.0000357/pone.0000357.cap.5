                Figure 5.  COEFFICIENT OF CONDITION AND CONFIDENCE SURFACES.Confidence surfaces for mean K-size (a) and mean K-weight (b) plots, based on non-parametric bootstrap (1000 replicates). The circles correspond to 95% of bootstrapped values. H and T correspond to C. n. nasus and C. t. toxostoma, respectively, in the reference populations. The other classes are those of the hybrid zone (T5; H5; -1 = underrepresented hybrid combinations; 0 = hybrid combinations found in the expected proportions; 99 = overrepresented hybrid combinations; T4i = the only hybrid combination for which sufficient specimens were obtained for comparison alone, without pooling). The variance of K is very significantly different (Bartlett B = 63.7; p = 10âˆ’10) between classes.
