                Figure 6.  GENOMIC EVOLUTION THROUGH THE HYBRID ZONE.Global summary of the dynamics of the hybrid zone and main variable interactions (chi-square test and log-linear model) with respect to the various sampling years and stations (see the text for more detail). The percentages of the different categories are shown—from T5 in red to H5 in green, and “hybrids” in yellow—separately for each station and each sampling year.
