Arrows indicate the overall trend for overall changes in snout orientation, “?” indicates that we could not strictly determine the diet of the <em>Chondrostoma</em> specimens in the hybrid zone, * indicates a significant difference, the other tests could not be done because the sample was too small, but we extrapolated a trend. “ΣD12” indicates the sum of degree-days above 12°C for each station (mean established for an 8-year data set) Chappaz (personal communication).</p>
