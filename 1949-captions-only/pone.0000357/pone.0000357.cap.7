                Figure 7.  LIFE HISTORY TRAITS EVOLUTION THROUGH THE HYBRID ZONE.Global summary of changes in ecological and morphological traits in the hybrid zone with respect to the reference populations (see the text for more detail). Arrows indicate the overall trend for overall changes in snout orientation, “?” indicates that we could not strictly determine the diet of the Chondrostoma specimens in the hybrid zone, * indicates a significant difference, the other tests could not be done because the sample was too small, but we extrapolated a trend. “ΣD12” indicates the sum of degree-days above 12°C for each station (mean established for an 8-year data set) Chappaz (personal communication).
