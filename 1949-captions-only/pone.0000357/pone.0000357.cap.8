The graphs show the distribution of individuals for each genome dilution class (x-axis) as a function of i) their probability based on numbers of specimens; y-axis (first graph) ii) their probability based on numbers of combinations; y-axis (second graph). The color gradient (observed values) extends from red (T5) to green (H5). The intermediate morphologies and genomic combinations are shown in yellow-orange, with theoretical values shown in gray (see the text for more detail). The fish morphologies shown are a simplistic representation of the morphological gradient (not all intermediate morphologies are represented).</p>
