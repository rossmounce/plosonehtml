(A) prOTOF-MALDI-MS spectrum of a 1 femtomole mixture of six peptides, obtained in 30 seconds of spectrum acquisition time. The measurements of the m/z values of the peptides were performed using an external instrument calibration. The monoisotopic resolution for the detected ion peaks as well as the calculated (c) and the experimental (e) m/z values are shown. The peptides are bradykinin (fragment 2–9: PPGFSPFR, m/z = 904.468, theoretical value), Substance P (RPKPQQFFGLM-NH2, m/z = 1347.736), neurotensin (pELYENKPRRPYIL, m/z = 1672.918), amyloid β-protein (fragment 12–28: VHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNK, m/z = 1955.014), ACTH (SYSMEHFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYP, m/z = 2932.588), and B chain of oxidized insulin (FVNQHLC(O3)GSHLVEALYLVC(O3)GERGFFYTPKA, m/z = 3494.651). (B) vMALDI-LTQ MS/MS spectra of all 6 detected peptides. All spectra were measured in 2–3 seconds after the automatic collection of the MS/MS spectra. The interpretation of the observed fragmentation spectra and the identity of the observed peptides are indicated in each panel.</p>
