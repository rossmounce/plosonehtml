The APC was purified from ~(2–4)×10<sup>10</sup> cells. (B) A map of neutral losses of 98 Da detected in all MS/MS spectra obtained from APC purified from a large culture of about 10<sup>11</sup> cells. All peaks with signal-to-noise ratios above 10-to-1 were examined by MS/MS and MS/MS/MS to confirm the loss of 98 Da and to identify the phosphopeptides and plausible position of a phosphate group. Peaks indicated with an asterisk were not identified. (C) Summary of the identified phosphopeptides from proteins co-immunopurified with the Cdc16-3xFlag-6xH protein.</p>
