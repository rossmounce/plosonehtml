                Figure 5. (A) An MS/MS spectrum of a phosphopeptide detected at m/z 2789.245. The loss of 98 Da, which is a specific signature of phosphorylation, is indicated. (B) MS/MS/MS of the fragment that lost 98 Da. The identity of the phosphopeptide and the plausible location of the residue which lost the phosphate group are shown in the panel.
