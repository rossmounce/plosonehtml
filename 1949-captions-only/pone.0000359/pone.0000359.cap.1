(a) Alignment of the conserved core between human SPANX-N proteins and homologs in non-primate mammals. With the exception of rat SPANX-N, the core starts immediately at the N-terminus. The plot highlights physiochemical properties, and the sequence conservation is shown as a consensus at the bottom. (b) Polymorphic positions in the human and dog coding sequences (only core shown). Two nonsynonymous changes, N21D and S79N (not shown), were found in the four dog and two wolf alleles analyzed. The five compared SPANX-N2 alleles revealed a nonsynonymous change, T8I, and a synonymous polymorphism in codons 4, 80, and 151. One amino acid replacement, K43N, was found in the two compared SPANX-N3 alleles. The two analyzed SPANX-N4 alleles revealed only one nonsynonymous change, K48N. (c) Substitutions in chimpanzee SPANX-N2 and -N3 coding sequences compared to human homologs. Chimpanzee SPANX-N2 contains four nonsynomous substitutions, two of which are in the core (K43N and Y55H). In addition, there are three synonymous changes and a 65 aa long deletion caused by the deletion of five 39 bp minisatellite units. Chimpanzee SPANX-N3 contains 10 nonsynonymous changes compared to human SPANX-N3, with three in the conserved core (E18K, N21S, and K23E). There is also a single aa deletion, del22K, and two synonymous changes. (d) Phylogenetic relationship of SPANX-N proteins in mammals obtained using the maximum likelihood method. (e) Minisatellite variations in the C-terminal part of primate <em>SPANX-N</em> genes. With the exception of the human <em>SPANX-N4</em> locus, the C-terminal regions contain 39 bp minisatellite arrays (blue). In some cases, the translation termination codon (red) is located after the array, and the repeats encode the C-terminal portion of <em>SPANX-N</em> genes.</p>
