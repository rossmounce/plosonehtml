                Figure 2. Evolution of SPANX-N genes. The probable scheme of evolution of the SPANX-N gene family is based on the pairwise alignments and breakpoint analysis. The exons are marked red in colour, intron regions are marked in pink. Positions relative to the centromere (cen) and telomere (qter) are shown. The numbers near duplication breakpoints indicate positions of the SPANX-N regions in the human genome (hg16; UCSC March 2006 genome version). The most likely scenario is that SPANX-N3 was the original locus.
