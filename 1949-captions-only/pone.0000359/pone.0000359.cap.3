                Figure 3. An evolutionary history of the SPANX gene family. The common ancestor of rodents, canine, and primates apparently had a single SPANX-N subfamily gene. An extensive search for potential divergent members of the SPANX-N family in the mouse, rat, dog and wolf genomes failed to detect any. A single SPANX gene is marked as a grey box. Orangutan and rhesus macaque have three and four copies of SPANX-N genes, correspondingly (boxes in blue). The emergence of the SPANX-A/D gene subfamily (boxes in red) is a more recent event, subsequent to the separation of the hominoid lineage from orangutan and rhesus macaque. Apparently, this subfamily evolved via duplication of one of the SPANX-N genes accompanied by deletion of the distal part of exon 2 (minisatellites) and rapid divergence. SPANX-A/D genes are impeded in segmental duplications (boxes in yellow). African Great Apes (bonobo, chimpanzee and gorilla) have four members of the SPANX-A/D subfamily. Notably, duplication of SPANX-C and amplification of SPANX-B genes from 1 to 14 copies appears to be human lineage specific.
