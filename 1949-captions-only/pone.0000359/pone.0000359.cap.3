The common ancestor of rodents, canine, and primates apparently had a single <em>SPANX-N</em> subfamily gene. An extensive search for potential divergent members of the <em>SPANX-N</em> family in the mouse, rat, dog and wolf genomes failed to detect any. A single <em>SPANX</em> gene is marked as a grey box. Orangutan and rhesus macaque have three and four copies of <em>SPANX-N</em> genes, correspondingly (boxes in blue). The emergence of the <em>SPANX-A</em>/<em>D</em> gene subfamily (boxes in red) is a more recent event, subsequent to the separation of the hominoid lineage from orangutan and rhesus macaque. Apparently, this subfamily evolved via duplication of one of the <em>SPANX-N</em> genes accompanied by deletion of the distal part of exon 2 (minisatellites) and rapid divergence. <em>SPANX-A/D</em> genes are impeded in segmental duplications (boxes in yellow). African Great Apes (bonobo, chimpanzee and gorilla) have four members of the <em>SPANX-A/D</em> subfamily. Notably, duplication of <em>SPANX-C</em> and amplification of <em>SPANX-B</em> genes from 1 to 14 copies appears to be human lineage specific.</p>
