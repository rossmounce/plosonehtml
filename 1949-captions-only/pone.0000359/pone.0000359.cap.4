                Figure 4. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of fixed, permeabilized swim-up spermatozoa with antibodies against SPANX-N proteins (in green). The SPANX-N immunofluorescence is observed in the acrosome of spermatozoa. The SPANX-A/D immunofluorescence is observed in association with nuclear craters in the cytoplasmic droplet at the posterior sperm head, or in both (red dots). DNA staining with DAPI is in blue.
