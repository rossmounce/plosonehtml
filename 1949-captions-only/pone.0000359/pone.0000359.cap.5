The staining is clearly specific for late spermatids and spermatozoa (in pink, a, b). Autofluorescence (i.e., non-specific signal, a, b) is also detectable in red blood cells and can be recognized by the overlapping signals in the green and red wavelengths. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (in blue).</p>
