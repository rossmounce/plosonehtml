                Figure 8. Comparison of human SPANX-A/D and SPANX-N promoters. Detected transcription starts are marked in yellow, the translation initiation codons ATG are marked in green. Noncoding sequences are in lowercase. SPANX-N copies differ from SPANX-A/D genes by the almost complete lack of all CpG dinucleotides in the promoter regions (in orange); however, these CpGs are perfectly preserved in all of the SPANX-A/D copies. CpG sites are marked only on one strand. Sp1 binding consensus in four SPANX-N copies is marked in blue. CTCF-binding sites are marked by red boxes.
