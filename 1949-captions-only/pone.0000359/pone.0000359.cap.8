Detected transcription starts are marked in yellow, the translation initiation codons ATG are marked in green. Noncoding sequences are in lowercase. <em>SPANX-N</em> copies differ from <em>SPANX-A/D</em> genes by the almost complete lack of all CpG dinucleotides in the promoter regions (in orange); however, these CpGs are perfectly preserved in all of the <em>SPANX-A/D</em> copies. CpG sites are marked only on one strand. Sp1 binding consensus in four <em>SPANX-N</em> copies is marked in blue. CTCF-binding sites are marked by red boxes.</p>
