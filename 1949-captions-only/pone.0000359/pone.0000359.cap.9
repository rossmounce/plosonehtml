(a) EMSA was carried out with either control lysate (−) or lysate containing the <em>in vitro</em> translated 11 ZF DNA binding domain of CTCF protein (+). The positions of the bound CTCF-DNA complexes, containing the 11ZF domain, are indicated on the left by arrow (shift). Free DNA probe is also indicated (free). Control: a positive control (c-myc promoter) of the EMSA reaction. (b) A schematic representation of the overlapping fragments of the <em>SPANX-N</em> promoter DNA sequences used in EMSA. The −195 to −43 bp is the smallest fragment showing retarded migration (red box). The ATG is considered as +1. On the right is CTCF binding of the fragments (+ positive; − negative).</p>
