                Figure 1. Most parsimonious tree for the Chrysomelidae based on rrnL, SSU and LSU ribosomal markers from direct optimization [44] under equal weighting (10,105 steps). Numbers above branches represent parsimony bootstrap support values above 50% using a matrix excluding all gapped positions and maximum likelihood boostrap support above 50%. Clades mentioned in the text are highlighted.
