                Figure 1.  Conservation of CIII in phage and bacteria.The multi sequences alignment was done using the ClustalX (version 1.81) program. Conserved or partially conserved residues are colored according to their biochemical properties. The essential region for CIII activity is underlined and the positions predicted coiled coil (by the MARCOIL) is marked above the sequence. (A) Alignment of CIII proteins from different phages and prophages (represented by the phage name or the bacterial strain carrying the prophage, respectively). CIII proteins were collected from the BLAST program by using the lambda CIII sequence as a query for the non-redundant database. A separate search using the HK022 CIII sequence was done. The HK022 CIII sequence is identical to that of HK097A and H-19B. A complete list of all the phages and prophages in which CIII homologs were recognized, is presented in the supplementary material. (B) Alignment of CIII and SpoVM proteins was carried out with the lambda CIII protein aligned with three SpoVM proteins from different Bacillus strains. (C) Alignment of CIII and YjhS hypothetical proteins that carry the DUF1737 and DUF303, was carried out. The three YjhS-like proteins were derived from different Shigella toxin carrying phages. The HP stands for hypothetical protein without a specific name.
