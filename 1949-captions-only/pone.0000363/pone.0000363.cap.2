                Figure 2.  Circular dichroism of CIII.(A) 200 pmol of purified His6-CIII (right lane) were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by Coomassie staining. On the left lane protein size marker was loaded (sizes 49, 38, 28, 14, 6 and 3 kDa). (B) The Circular dichroism spectrum (wavelengths 195–255 nm) of the purified His6-CIII at 3.5 µM (light gray), 27 µM (dark gray) and 40 µM (black).
