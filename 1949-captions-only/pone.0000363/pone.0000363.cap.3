                Figure 3.  Oligomerization of CIII.(A) 10 µl of different concentrations of purified His6-CIII protein were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by western blotting using commercial antibodies against the His6 tag. (B) 10 µM of His6-CIII was incubated in the presence (lanes 2,3) or absence (lane 1) of 0.25% Glutaraldehyde and the cross-linking reaction was stopped after 1 or 5 minutes by 200 mM Glycine (lanes 2 and 3 respectively). The reactions were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by western blotting using commercial antibodies against the His6 tag.
