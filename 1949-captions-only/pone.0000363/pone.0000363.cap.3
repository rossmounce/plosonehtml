(B) 10 µM of His<sub>6</sub>-CIII was incubated in the presence (lanes 2,3) or absence (lane 1) of 0.25% Glutaraldehyde and the cross-linking reaction was stopped after 1 or 5 minutes by 200 mM Glycine (lanes 2 and 3 respectively). The reactions were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by western blotting using commercial antibodies against the His6 tag.</p>
