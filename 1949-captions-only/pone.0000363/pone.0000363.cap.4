                Figure 4.  Purified CIII acts as a competitive inhibitor of FtsH.(A) 4 µM of CII were incubated with 1 µM GST-FtsH at 420C for 5 minutes in the presence of increasing concentrations (as specified) of His6-CIII. The reactions were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by Coomassie stain. First lane indicates the amount of CII at starting time. (B) The CII levels remaining after degradation experiment shown in A, were calculated using the “NIH image” program and plotted versus CIII levels (full diamonds and full lines). A similar experiment with only 1 µM of CII being degraded is shown in empty diamonds and a dotted line. (C) The binding assays were done in the presence of 10mM AMP-PNP as described in the materials and methods. The reactions were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE (invitrogen) and visualized by western blotting using antibodies raised against the CII protein. (D) CII levels bound in complex to GST-FtsH were calculated using the “NIH image” program and average from two different experiments was plotted versus CIII levels. The error bars are +/− SD.
