The promoter activity as function of time of cultures of wild type strain (A, D, G) <em>hflA</em>- strain (B, E, H) or <em>ftsH</em> deleted strain (C, F, I) infected with λ<em>c+</em> (A, B, C), λ<em>cIII<sup>−</sup></em> (D, E, F) and λ<em>cII<sup>−</sup></em> (G, H, I) is shown. All experiments were carried out as described in the <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a> at a MOI of 6.</p>
