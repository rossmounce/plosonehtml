                Figure 5.  FtsH and HflA affect the λ genetic network.CII activity is reported by pE-gfp fusions (blue diamonds), whereas Q activity is reported by pR‘-tR‘-gfp fusions (red circles). The promoter activity as function of time of cultures of wild type strain (A, D, G) hflA- strain (B, E, H) or ftsH deleted strain (C, F, I) infected with λc+ (A, B, C), λcIII− (D, E, F) and λcII− (G, H, I) is shown. All experiments were carried out as described in the materials and methods at a MOI of 6.
