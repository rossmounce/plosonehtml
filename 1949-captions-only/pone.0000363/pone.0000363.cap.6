Promoter activity is given as a function of time of infected cultures carrying the pCTCIII plasmid in the presence or absence of 0.1mM IPTG (B, D, F or A, C, E respectively) with λ<em>c+</em> (A, B), λ<em>cIII<sup>−</sup></em> (C, D), and λ<em>cII<sup>−</sup></em> (E, F). All measurements were carried out as described in the <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a> at a MOI of 6.</p>
