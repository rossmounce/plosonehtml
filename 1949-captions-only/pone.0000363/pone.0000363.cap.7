                Figure 7.  CIII levels affect multiplicity of infection.The total fluorescences obtain from the pE-GFP plasmid, 80 minutes after infection were plotted against the MOI of each experiment. λcIII− infections of bacteria carrying the pCTCIII plasmid were followed in the absence (light blue squares) or presence of 0.1 mM IPTG (blue squares) or of 0.2 mM IPTG (purple squares). λc+ (red×symbol) and λcIII− (orange×symbol) infections of bacteria without the pCTCIII plasmid are shown as reference.
