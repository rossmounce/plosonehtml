The FtsH and HflKC complex regulates CII and CIII levels and CIII controls FtsH/HflKC proteolytic activity. (B) A schematic drawing of the CIII mechanism of inhibition (based on the model presented in <a href="#pone.0000363-Ito1">[16]</a>). In panel 1 in the absence of CIII, CII binds the FtsH protease and is translocated into the enzymatic cavity where it is first unfolded and then degraded. In panel 2, CIII binds the FtsH protease and prevents CII from binding. In panel 3, the CIII protein, which is found as an oligomer, is also subjected to degradation.</p>
