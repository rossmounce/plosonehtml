Each panel shows cumulative proportion of tested birds which had solved the spatial learning task at successive test instances; the criterion for solving the task was five correct choices out of six successive tests, so the smallest number of required tests was five. a, White Leghorn parents. b, Red junglefowl parents. c, White Leghorn offspring. d, Red junglefowl offspring. The differences in cumulative proportions of birds from different treatments solving the task were tested with χ<sup>2</sup> –analysis after five test rounds and onwards, and significant differences are indicated (p&lt;0.05).</p>
