                Figure 2. Correlations between magnitude of differential expression of genes between parents and offspring. Diagrams show M-values for the differential expression (comparing stressed vs control parents, and offspring of stressed vs offspring of control parents) of the 500 most differentially expressed genes (largest log2 difference caused by stress in parents) in (a) red junglefowl, and (b) White Leghorns. Each point represents one spot on the microarray. Positive M-values indicate upregulation and negative downregulation by stress (or by having stressed parents). The average correlation line is shown in both comparisons.
