Diagrams show M-values for the differential expression (comparing stressed vs control parents, and offspring of stressed vs offspring of control parents) of the 500 most differentially expressed genes (largest log<sub>2</sub> difference caused by stress in parents) in (a) red junglefowl, and (b) White Leghorns. Each point represents one spot on the microarray. Positive M-values indicate upregulation and negative downregulation by stress (or by having stressed parents). The average correlation line is shown in both comparisons.</p>
