                Figure 2.  Immunodetection of the outer membrane proteins.The detections were carried out using antisera prepared against OmpC porin (A), OmpF porin (B), antigenic peptide located inside the internal loop 3 porin (C), OmpA (D) and OmpX (E) respectively. Immunodetection were carried out with total cell extracts from non-induced AG100 (1, 2) and 10 mg/mL TET-induced (3, 4) strains grown in LB and MH media (odd and even lanes respectively).
