                Figure 3.  Relative quantification of the expression level of the protease genes.Data from three independent total mRNA extractions of E. coli AG100 physiologically adapted to increasing concentrations of TET compared to its parental non-induced strain grown in absence of TET as described in Materials and Methods. A ratio of 1 corresponds to no alterations in expression compared with untreated control cells. Values were corrected for standard deviation range.
