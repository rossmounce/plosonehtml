                Figure 4.  Tetracycline activation cascade of E. coli resistance physiological adaptation.Broken arrows indicate the activation in 1 and 2 over-expression of specific gene (direct TET pressure effect), in 3, the regulation by induced regulators (second level of control), in 4 the effect of activated genes coding for membrane proteins (third level of effect). Thick arrows (5) illustrate the effect of over-production of OMPs and proteases.
