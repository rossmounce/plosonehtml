                Figure 1. Comparative Sequence Analysis of the GLI3 Locus Detects Conserved Non-coding Sequence Elements. (A) Sequence alignments of the genomic interval containing the human GLI3 locus and flanking human genes INHBA and PSMA2 with orthologous counterparts from representative members of rodent, bird, amphibian, and fish lineages. These are shown as SLAGAN derived VISTA representations. Conserved coding sequences are depicted in blue and conserved non-coding sequences are in pink. Criteria of alignment were 60 bp window and 50% conservation cutoff. Conservation between human and Fugu (scaffold_210 ENSEMBL genome browser) is restricted to the GLI3 gene. Red bars above the conservation plot depict the approximate length of intergenic regions flanking human GLI3. The blue arrow shows the length of the GLI3 gene and the direction of transcription. A graphic representation showing exons and introns of GLI3 is shown below the homology plot. Green vertical lines indicate the positions of alterations affecting the genomic structure of the locus which result in loss of GLI3 function: a translocation event associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) [36], and two insertions (ins) in mouse mutants anterior digit pattern deformity (add) [7], [37] and polydactyly Nagoya (Pdn) [38]. (B) Magnified view of the human/Fugu conservation plot and the genomic structure of human GLI3. The red vertical bars below the plot show the position of human/Fugu highly conserved non-coding sequence elements (CNEs) that were functionally tested as putative enhancers.
