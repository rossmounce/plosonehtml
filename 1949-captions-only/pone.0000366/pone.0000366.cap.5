                Figure 5. Deletion Analysis Reveals a Critical Role of hc-CNE1-125bp for the Regulatory Potential of CNE1. (A) BLASTZ alignment of a human, mouse, chick, frog, and Fugu highly-conserved 125 bp sequence fragment embedded within CNE1 shown with predicted conserved TFBSs (above). (B) SLAGAN alignment plots of human, mouse, chick, frog and Fugu CNE1 using human sequence as the base line. (C) Architecture of CNE1 wild type and deletion constructs, The red bar depicts the highly conserved region, and less well conserved regions are shown in black. Luciferase activity obtained in H661 cells after transient transfection of reporter constructs is shown in the diagram at the right side. Reporter gene expression is driven by CNE1 fragments upstream of the human GLI3 minimal promoter. The red bar depicts luciferase expression (100%) in H661 cells driven alone by the control GLI3 minimal promoter (Prom-GLI3-300), while green bars represent the activity recorded for the vectors containing experimental reporter constructs.
