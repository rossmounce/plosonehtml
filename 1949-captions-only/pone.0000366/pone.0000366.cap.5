(A) BLASTZ alignment of a human, mouse, chick, frog, and <em>Fugu</em> highly-conserved 125 bp sequence fragment embedded within CNE1 shown with predicted conserved TFBSs (above). (B) SLAGAN alignment plots of human, mouse, chick, frog and <em>Fugu</em> CNE1 using human sequence as the base line. (C) Architecture of CNE1 wild type and deletion constructs, The red bar depicts the highly conserved region, and less well conserved regions are shown in black. Luciferase activity obtained in H661 cells after transient transfection of reporter constructs is shown in the diagram at the right side. Reporter gene expression is driven by CNE1 fragments upstream of the human <em>GLI3</em> minimal promoter. The red bar depicts luciferase expression (100%) in H661 cells driven alone by the control <em>GLI3</em> minimal promoter (Prom-<em>GLI3</em>-300), while green bars represent the activity recorded for the vectors containing experimental reporter constructs.</p>
