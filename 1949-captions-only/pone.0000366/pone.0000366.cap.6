                Figure 6. Putative Binding Sites for Individual Trans-Acting Factors are Necessary but not Sufficient for Activating Potential of CNE5. (A) BLASTZ alignment of highly conserved fragments embedded within CNE5 along with predicted conserved TFBSs. (B) CNE5 alignment plot of human, mouse, chick, frog and Fugu sequences using human sequence as the base line. (C) Architecture of wild type and deletion constructs; the red portion of the bar depicts the highly conserved human/fish regions. Luciferase activity obtained in H661cells after transient transfection of reporter constructs is shown in the diagram at the right side. Reporter gene expression is driven by CNE5 fragments upstream of the human GLI3 minimal promoter. The red bar depicts luciferase expression (100%) in H661 cells driven alone by the control GLI3 minimal promoter (PromGLI3-300), while the green bars represent the activity recorded for the vectors containing experimental reporter constructs, i.e. wild type CNE5 (wt 578bp), CNE5 with deleted PBX1, PAX2 and MEIS1 binding module (CNE5Î”50bp), and the 144 bp fragment (hcCNE5-144bp). Deletion of the 50 bp fragment almost entirely extinguishes the strong activating potential of CNE5. The isolated 144 bp fragment cannot activate expression.
