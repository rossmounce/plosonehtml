(A) BLASTZ alignment of the highest conserved 35 bp along with two predicted conserved TFBSs from the human/<em>Fugu</em> conserved block within CNE6. (B) CNE6 alignment plot of human, mouse, chick, frog and <em>Fugu</em> sequences using human sequence as the base line. (C) Architecture of wild type and deletion constructs; the red bar depicts the highly conserved human/fish segment. Luciferase activity obtained in H661 cells after transient transfection of reporter constructs is shown in the diagram at the right side. Reporter gene expression is driven by CNE5 fragments upstream of the human <em>GLI3</em> minimal promoter. The red bar depicts luciferase expression (100%) in H661 cells driven alone by the control <em>GLI3</em> minimal promoter (Prom<em>GLI3</em>-300), whilst the green bars represent the activity recorded for the vectors containing experimental reporter constructs, i.e. wild type CNE6 (wt 862bp), CNE6 with deleted human/<em>Fugu</em> conserved block (<em>CNE6Δh/f-179bp</em>), and the 72% human/fish conserved fragment (<em>CNE6h/f-179bp</em>). <em>CNE6Δh/f-179bp</em> can still enhance reporter gene transcription more than two-fold. The isolated 179 bp fragment cannot activate expression.</p>
