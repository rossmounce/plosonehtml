<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3"></a><p>India has the second largest number of HIV infected people in the world, second only to South Africa.<a href="#pone.0000367-DeCock1">[7]</a> However, it has been reported that HIV prevalence in southern Indian States is on the decline <a href="#pone.0000367-Granade1">[8]</a> Knowledge of sero-status is the cornerstone of HIV prevention, diagnosis and linkages to care and prevention. Many Indians including rural poor, are unaware of their sero-status. <a href="#pone.0000367-National1">[9]</a> Rapid point-of-care HIV tests can greatly aid in knowing sero-status by providing faster and accurate results in minutes. In India, rapid HIV tests currently marketed are blood based tests that are cumbersome, require trained laboratory technicians, and test results are often not available at the point-of-care. Moreover, in rural areas resources are limited, laboratory technicians frequently unavailable, phlebotomy is difficult and culturally less preferred. Therefore, follow up on HIV test results can prove to be very challenging. In such settings, oral fluid-based rapid tests provide a convenient and feasible alternative to blood-based testing.<a href="#pone.0000367-Delaney1">[2]</a> Although oral fluid-based rapid testing has several attractive features, few studies have evaluated the latest versions of the OraQuick Rapid HIV1/2 tests in rural India. We report the results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted in Maharashtra state in India.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>Our study objectives were: 1) to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 tests (performed independently on both oral mucosal transudate (OMT) and finger stick blood specimens) in a parallel testing strategy, 2) to determine client preference for oral fluid-based testing in a rural hospital setting, and 3) to evaluate feasibility of conducting oral fluid tests in a rural resource constrained setting.</p>

<h4>Study setting</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Our study was conducted at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), a rural teaching hospital in Sevagram, Central India. This busy 650-bed tertiary hospital has over 350,000 patient visits each year. Our study was conducted between October 2004 and December 2005. No community-based HIV prevalence data exist for Sevagram. The study was approved by ethics committees at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram, India. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and all HIV tests were done after appropriate counseling.</p>


<h4>Study participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Participants for this study were recruited from both inpatient and outpatient facilities of the departments of internal medicine, and dermatology (which also provides care for patients with sexually transmitted infections). A convenience-based sampling method was employed for recruiting participants. Consenting participants were interviewed and provided pre-test and post-test counseling as per the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), India.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>Participants were administered index and reference standard tests concurrently. Data on demographic characteristics and client preference for various HIV testing modalities was also collected, along with data on risk factors for HIV.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>Participants were eligible if any of the following criteria were met: a) an adult (&gt;18 years of age); and b) presence of signs and/or symptoms of HIV infection (i.e., unexplained weight loss for more than 6 months; unexplained fever for more than 3 months; chronic cough or weight loss for more than 3 months; loose stools for more than 1 month; generalized lymphadenopathy of non malignant origin); c) or, presence of signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections (i.e., pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, candidiasis, <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia, aseptic meningitis, toxoplasmosis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, diarrhea, or Kaposi's sarcoma); d) or, presence of one or more risk factors for HIV infection, (i.e., concurrent sexually transmitted infection, spouse of a known HIV-positive individual, recent unprotected intercourse with a commercial sex worker, intravenous drug user, recipient of multiple unscreened blood products). Participants were excluded if they were: a) pregnant or breast feeding; or b) had chronic debilitating conditions or mental health disorders that would preclude informed consent.</p>


<h4>HIV test methods and lab procedures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>After appropriate pre-test counseling by a trained health worker, all eligible and consenting participants received the following index tests (OraQuick rapid tests performed on oral-fluid as well as finger stick blood specimens) and the reference standard. The reference standard (<a href="#pone-0000367-t001">Table 1</a>) was based on the CDC guidelines for rapid testing. The reference standard used for confirmation of preliminary positives was a combination of repeat enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and Western Blot. For confirmation of preliminary negatives, one ELISA test alone was used as the reference standard.</p>
