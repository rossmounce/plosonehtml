                Figure 1. Micrographs and diagrams of C. neoformans morphology after 24 hours of growth are presented for KN99α and KN99α rom2. A. KN99α cells grown at 30°C and 37°C. Scale bars represent 20 µM. B. The KN99α cells appear to have a round morphology. The left image is a micrograph and the right image is a diagram. C. KN99α rom2 cells grown at 30°C and 37°C cluster together. At 37°C growth conditions, the hyperelongated morphology is also observed. White arrows indicate cells that are “tear” shaped and form a cluster. The black arrow indicated a hyperelongated complex. 100× magnification. D. KN99α rom2 cells appear as a cluster of 3–4 cells per complexes. The left image is a micrograph and the right image is a diagram. E. KN99α rom2 cells also demonstrate a hyperelongated phenotype at 37°C that forms a chain of cell complexes. The arrowhead indicates the region of the hyperelongated cell defective for cytokinesis, indicated by the lack of cell wall formation between to cell complexes. The left image is a micrograph and the right image is a diagram of the cell morphology.
