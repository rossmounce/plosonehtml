                Figure 2. Nuclear defects in hyperelongated cells at high temperature conditions. The light field image on the left shows a hyperelongated cell. The image on the right is a DAPI staining of the same hyperelongated cell complex. The arrowhead indicates the location of the nucleus. Arrows indicate the cell complexes that lack a nucleus.
