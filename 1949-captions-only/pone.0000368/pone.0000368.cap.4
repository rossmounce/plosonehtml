                Figure 4. C. neoformans actin expression at 37°C in KN99α and KN99α rom2. F-actin is identified with rhodamine-phalloidin. Actin is distributed throughout the wild type cell. White arrows indicate actin localization at the cell periphery and at the bud tips of KN99α rom2 hyperelongated cells. The black arrow indicates the region of the cell that is defective for cytokinesis indicated by a lack of cell wall formation between the cell complexes.
