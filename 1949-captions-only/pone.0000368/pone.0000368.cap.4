F-actin is identified with rhodamine-phalloidin. Actin is distributed throughout the wild type cell. White arrows indicate actin localization at the cell periphery and at the bud tips of KN99α <em>rom2</em> hyperelongated cells. The black arrow indicates the region of the cell that is defective for cytokinesis indicated by a lack of cell wall formation between the cell complexes.</p>
