                Figure 5. Microtubule localization at 37°C conditions. Microtubules are distributed throughout wild type cells. Microtubules are found in localized areas of KN99α rom2 hyperelongated cells. The distribution of cellular material between mother and daughter cell is well defined for wild type cells but is enlarged over a greater area in hyperelongated cells. Arrowheads indicate the location of microtubule patches. Microtubules are distributed throughout mother and daughter cells in KN99α. However, microtubules are localized to the neck region and periphery of the hyperelongated KN99α rom2 cells. Arrows indicate microtubule extensions between mother and daughter cells.
