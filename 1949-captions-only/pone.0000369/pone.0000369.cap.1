(a) Schematic location of stimulus presentation and recording sites on the scalp. (b) Successive stimuli were phase shifted by 180°. This moves the locations of maxima and minima by ½ cycle relative to their unshifted values, leaving the envelope (black) unchanged but changing the relative location of maxima and minima in the component frequencies (the fine-structure, blue and red). (c) Difference waveform generated by multiplying the 180° response waveform by −1 and adding it to the 0° response waveform. Since the envelope-related activity near the maxima of the 180° waveform (red) now has the opposite sign from that of the 0° waveform (blue), these two cancel out; fine-structure-related activity now has the same sign for the 180° and 0° waveforms, yielding double the original signal strength. (d) Sum waveform generated by adding the 0° response waveform to the 180° response waveform. Envelope-related activity near the maxima now have the same sign (blue and red), yielding double the original signal strength; fine-structure-related activity now has opposite signs for the 0° and 180° response waveforms, canceling each other out.</p>
