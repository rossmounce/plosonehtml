                Figure 2. Stimulus design and evoked potential responses. (a) Amplitude-time waveforms showing stimulus construction by adding band-passed, random phase noise (top, left) to repeating 3-note tone complexes (top, center) to produce the stimuli used in perceptual testing and for evoked-potential recording. There were five different tone complexes used; each is shown color-coded above its constituent components on an amplitude–frequency plot (bottom), where the components of each tone are overlaid on a common set of axes. (b,c) Amplitude spectra of the evoked potential responses from a single subject for two of the stimulus tones. The sum of the 0° and 180° responses is shown in black (envelope-related), and the difference of the 0° and 180° responses is shown in red or green (fine-structure phase-related). The y-axis is in units of relative amplitude; the corresponding measured values for the highest y-axis marker are 0.38 µV (black) and 0.35 µV (red) for Figure 2b, and 0.26 µV (black) and 0.23 µV (green) for Figure 2c. Colors refer to Figure 2a. (d,e) Mean relative amplitude spectra (n = 22 subjects) of peaks in the fine-structure-related (difference, Figure 2d) and envelope-related (sum, Figure 2e) evoked potential responses, all of which passed criteria for robustness (see Methods). Responses to each stimulus tone have been overlaid on the same set of axes. Colors refer to Figure 2a. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals around the mean value.
