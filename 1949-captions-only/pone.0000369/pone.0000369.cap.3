                Figure 3. Pitch percepts and their relationship to evoked potential responses. (a) Mean pitch percept (10 repetitions) of each stimulus for each of 22 subjects plotted against the frequency shift of each stimulus; units are octave fractions relative to 300 Hz. The equation of the best-fitting regression line and the r2 are also shown. (b) Population mean pitch percepts (22 subjects) plotted against the frequency shift of each stimulus, units as in (a). The error bars show 95% confidence intervals around the mean values. (c,d,e) The mean values (22 subjects) for the proportional amplitude of the difference waveform (fine-structure-phase-related) spectral peaks for the 5 stimuli. The error bars show 1 standard error around the mean values. Bars containing the same symbol are not significantly different from each other; bars containing different symbols are significantly different from each other (see Methods). Colors refer to Figure 2a. (f) Mean pitch percept of each stimulus for each of 22 subjects plotted against their own neural pitch estimates. The equation of the best-fitting regression line and the r2 are also shown. (g) Population mean pitch percepts (22 subjects) plotted against the population mean neural pitch estimate. The error bars show 95% confidence intervals around the mean values for each axis. (Inset) The frequency distribution of distances of population neural pitch estimates from the population pitch percept according to a random model (black) compared with the distance obtained in this study (red cross), showing that the present results are highly unlikely to be obtained by chance (see Methods).
