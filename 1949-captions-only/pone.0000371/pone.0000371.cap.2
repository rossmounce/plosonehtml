(A and B) Schematic drawings of the rostral (A) and caudal (B) brain hemisphere of worker honeybees. Positions of neuron somata are shown in color. (C–J) Expression of <em>kakusei</em> was detected by <em>in situ</em> hybridization using coronal brain sections of control (C, E–G) or seizure-induced (Sz-induced) (D, H–J) bees. Areas corresponding to panels (E–J) are boxed in (C) and (D). (K–O) Subcellular localization of <em>kakusei</em> was investigated by fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridization. Nuclei were visualized by SYTOX Green, which stains DNA. Numbers of each picture indicate time after seizure. <em>Actin</em> mRNA was detected as a control that is translated into protein in the cytoplasm (P). AL, antennal lobe; Class II KCs, class II Kenyon cells; DL, dorsal lobe; dOL, dorsal OL; lKCs, large-type Kenyon cells; MB, mushroom body; OL, optic lobe; PL, protocerebral lobe; sKCs, small-type Kenyon cells; vOL, ventral OL.</p>
