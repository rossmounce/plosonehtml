                Figure 3. Kakusei expression in the brains of bees that exhibited phototaxis. In situ hybridization was performed using thin sections (10 µm) of the brains of nurse bees that did not move to the light side (N = 4, A–D) and foragers that had phototactic behavior (N = 5, E–H). (C and G) Magnified views of boxed regions in panels (B) and (F), respectively. Bars indicate 100 µm. Arrows indicate kakusei-positive cells. Kakusei expression was detected both in the mushroom bodies (A and E) and optic lobes (B, C, F and G) of nurse bees (A–C) and foragers (E–G), and not in the antennal lobes (D and H).
