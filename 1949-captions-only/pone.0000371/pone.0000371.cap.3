(C and G) Magnified views of boxed regions in panels (B) and (F), respectively. Bars indicate 100 µm. Arrows indicate <em>kakusei</em>-positive cells. <em>Kakusei</em> expression was detected both in the mushroom bodies (A and E) and optic lobes (B, C, F and G) of nurse bees (A–C) and foragers (E–G), and not in the antennal lobes (D and H).</p>
