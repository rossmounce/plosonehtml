                Figure 4. Neural activity of the sKCs is prominently increased in the dancer brain. (A and E) Schematic drawings of the caudal hemisphere (A) and MB (E). (B–D and F–H) In situ hybridization of kakusei in the dancer (B and F), follower (C and G), or nurse bee (D and H) brains. (I) Quantification of kakusei-positive cells in various brain regions. Asterisks indicate significant difference from other behavioral groups (*, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01; Tukey-Kramer's test after ANOVA). Arrows indicate the kakusei-expressing neurons.
