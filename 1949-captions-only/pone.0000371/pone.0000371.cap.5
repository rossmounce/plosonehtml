Quantification of <em>kakusei</em> expression in the brains of foragers and dancers. Foragers also showed the sKC-preferential <em>kakusei</em> expression pattern. There was no significant difference in the number of <em>kakusei</em>-positive cells (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05; two-factor ANOVA). Note that we repeated the experiments for the ‘dancer’ group here, and bees used in the ‘dancer’ group for this experiment were different from those used in the previous experiment (<a href="#pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4</a>).</p>
