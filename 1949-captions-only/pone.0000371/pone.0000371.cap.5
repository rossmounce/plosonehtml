                Figure 5. Foragers showed similar kakusei expression pattern to the dancers. Quantification of kakusei expression in the brains of foragers and dancers. Foragers also showed the sKC-preferential kakusei expression pattern. There was no significant difference in the number of kakusei-positive cells (P&gt;0.05; two-factor ANOVA). Note that we repeated the experiments for the ‘dancer’ group here, and bees used in the ‘dancer’ group for this experiment were different from those used in the previous experiment (Figure 4).
