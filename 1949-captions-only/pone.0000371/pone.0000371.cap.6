(Aâ€“D) Representative <em>in situ</em> hybridization pictures of <em>kakusei</em> expression in re-orienting bees and foragers. Arrows indicate the <em>kakusei</em>-positive neurons. Note that <em>kakusei</em> expression pattern is different between the re-orienting bees and foragers. (E) Quantification of <em>kakusei</em> expression in the brains of re-orienting bees and foragers. (F) Ratio of <em>kakusei</em> density in the sKCs to lKCs. (G) Quantitative data of <em>kakusei</em> expression in re-orienting bees and dancers caught from transparent observation hives. Note the different <em>kakusei</em> expression pattern between re-orienting bees and dancers. (H) Ratio of <em>kakusei</em> density in the sKCs to lKCs. Asterisk indicates significant difference between foragers/dancers and the other groups (*, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01; Tukey-Kramer's test after ANOVA).</p>
