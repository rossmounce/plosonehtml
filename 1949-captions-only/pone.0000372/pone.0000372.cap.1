<h4>Data collection</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>The study had been ethically approved by the Guinea-Bissau ministry of health and the institutional review board of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke. Inclusion criteria were age ≥50 years and willingness to give consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of dementia or inability to speak one of the several languages spoken by the interviewers. Participants were recruited from the following areas of Bissau: Pluba, Antula, Santa Luzia, Reno, Cupelom, Luanda, Penha, Pefine, Calequir, Bairro Militar, Amedalai and Rossio. From January to March 2005, compounds were visited one by one to identify individuals aged ≥50 years, who were then asked to participate. If a verbal consent was obtained, a questionnaire was administered in a private setting, generally by an interviewer of the same sex as the respondent. Data were gathered on socio-demographic characteristics, past medical histories, and a limited number of questions on sexual behavior. For participants unable to provide their exact age, this was estimated based on historical events widely known in the country. A finger prick was performed and capillary blood deposited on a filter paper. No names were recorded on the questionnaires and filter papers, identified only by a study number.</p>


<h4>Serological assays</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Blood samples were blotted onto two Whatman no. 3 filter papers, and allowed to air dry. Samples were stored in plastic zip-closure bags at 4°C for 1–2 months and transported to Canada for testing. All samples were screened for HCV antibodies using Detect-HCV v.3 (Adaltis, Montreal, Canada). A 6 mm dried blood spot (DBS) was punched and placed into 250 µl of the specimen diluent provided with the test kit, in a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated on a shaking platform at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then overnight at 4°C. The eluted sample (200 µl) was used to perform all other steps according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-reactive samples were considered HCV-seronegative while reactive samples were further tested with both Ortho HCV 3.0 ELISA Test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, New Jersey) and Monolisa Anti-HCV Plus Version 2 (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). For each test kit, two 6 mm DBS were eluted in respectively 250 µl and 175 µl of the provided specimen diluent (with the same incubation protocol as for Detect-HCV). For Ortho, 170 µl of eluted sample was added to in each reaction well containing 50 µl of specimen diluant, while for Monolisa, 100 µl of eluted sample was used, without adding more specimen diluent. Dually non-reactive samples (Detect-HCV+/Ortho-/Monolisa-) were considered HCV-negative. Repeatedly reactive samples (with all three ELISA tests) were considered HCV positive, while discordant results samples were further tested by INNO-LIA HCV Score (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), using 1 ml of eluted sample (obtained from two 6mm DBS in 1.2 ml of INNO-LIA sample diluent), and the result of the INNO-LIA was considered as definitive. HIV serology was performed using Detect-HIV (Adaltis) as the initial test, followed by Genie II HIV-1/HIV-2 (Bio-Rad) and INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (Innogenetics) as previously described <a href="#pone.0000372-Ppin1">[18]</a>.</p>


<h4>Genotyping</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>For genotyping, PCR amplification of the samples considered to be HCV seropositive was attempted using the NS5B region. RNA was extracted from 8 circles of 3 mm punched from DBS in 400 µl of Trizol containing 60 ng of polyA (Invitrogen, Burlington, On, Canada) and re-suspended in 30 µl of RNase free water. Reverse transcription and an external amplification cycle were performed with 5 µl of RNA extract and primers EF101F TTCTCGTATGATACCCGCTGYTTTGA and HCVNS5Rnb <span class="gene">TACCTGGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAAGGCTC</span> in a final volume of 20 µl C. therm. Polymerase for One-Step RT-PCR System (Roche, Laval, Qc, Canada) for 30 min at 60°C; 2 min at 94°C; then 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 50°C for 45 sec and 72°C for 1 min or 6 min in the last cycle. One µl of the RT-PCR product was amplified in nested PCR under the same amplification conditions using primers HCVNS5F2p (TATGATACCCGCTGCTTTGACTC,G/I,AC), HCVNS5R2c (<span class="gene">CTGGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAAGGCTCTCAGG</span>) and HCVNS5R2d (<span class="gene">CTGGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAAGGCTCGTAGG</span>). Amplification was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were sequenced using the HCVNS5F2p primer by Genome Quebec (Montreal, Qc, Canada). Each sequence was analyzed by HCV-BLAST (<a href="http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/hcv-db/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html">http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/hcv-db/BASIC​_BLAST/basic_blast.html</a>) to define the HCV genotype by the closest matching sequences. Samples were also tested for the 5′ non-coding region of HCV using the Amplicor Hepatitis C Virus Test, version 2.0 (Roche) after extracting RNA from two 3 mm DBS using the Charge Switch total RNA kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, On, Canada) and eluting the RNA in 75 µl of elution buffer.</p>


<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Data were analyzed with Stata 8.0. Proportions were compared with the χ<sup>2</sup> test, or Fisher's exact test when an expected cell number was less than five. Variables significantly associated with HCV in univariate analysis were tested in logistic regression models built up sequentially, starting with the variable most strongly associated with the outcome and continuing until no other variable reached significance. When the final model was reached, each variable was dropped in turn to assess its effect by the likelihood ratio test. We kept in the final model variables that significantly enhanced the fit at the p&lt;0.05 level.</p>

<div id="section3" class="section"><a id="s3" name="s3" toc="s3" title="Results"></a><h3>Results</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.p1"></a><p>Out of 1615 specimens tested, five were considered indeterminate and will not be considered further. Prevalence of HCV infection was 5.1% (69/1347) among the HIV-seronegative participants, 2.5% (5/204) among those infected with HIV-2 and 0% (0/48) among those infected with HIV-1 (p = 0.07).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>In <a href="#pone-0000372-t001">Table 1</a> are shown risk factors for HCV infection amongst all participants (n = 1610). HCV prevalence was 4.4% among women and 5.0% among men (p = 0.76). HCV prevalence increased with age, but did not vary according to marital status. HCV prevalence varied significantly according to ethnic groups, which could be dichotomized into high-risk (Papel, Mancanha, Balanta and Mandjako) and low-risk (all others) groups. HCV prevalence also varied according to region of origin, being lowest in participants from Bafata and Gabu, in the eastern part of the country, and highest among those from the regions of Biombo, Cacheu and Oio, north of Bissau (map). Within these regions, HCV was much more prevalent (24/155 [15.5%] in women, 7/80 [8.8%] in men, 31/235 [13.2%] overall) among individuals who were born and grew up in a small area around Bula, Enchiea and Binar (map) compared to other participants (19/468 [4.1%], p&lt;0.001). HCV prevalence was significantly higher among participants involved in sex work. Most of this association reflected a higher HCV prevalence among men who admitted having ever paid for sexual services (12/118 [10.2%]) compared to those who did not (15/423 [3.5%], p = 0.005); among women, 2/10 (20%) who admitted having sold sexual services were HCV-infected compared to 44/1050 (4.2%) among those who denied such behavior (p = 0.03). Among women, HCV prevalence was 1.8% (9/503) in those who had been excised, compared to 6.8% (38/561) among those who did not undergo excision of the clitoris (p&lt;0.001). Only 19 men were uncircumcised, none of whom were HCV-infected, while 27/523 (5.2%) circumcised men were HCV seropositive (p = 0.62). HCV prevalence was not higher in participants who reported having had traditional scarifications, having been transfused, having been treated for trypanosomiasis or tuberculosis or having received injections of pentamidine for the chemoprophylaxis of trypanosomiasis.</p>
