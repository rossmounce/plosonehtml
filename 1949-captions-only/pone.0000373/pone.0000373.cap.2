                Figure 2.  Open field test and neuronal loss in ischemic brain areas at day 7.Mice receiving NC(4 h) show a reversal of ischemia-induced impairment in number of rears and objects, (A, n = 10) and a significant reduction in neuronal loss in striatum and cortex (B) compared to those receiving PBS (n = 6). Fibroblast infusion 4 h after ischemia does not significantly affect open field impairment and neuronal loss (n = 7). Data are expressed as mean±SEM. One-way ANOVA: (A) rears F: 6.122, p = 0.0002; (A) objects F: 16.10, p&lt;0.0001; (B) striatum F: 17.67, p = 0.0002; (B) cortex F: 37.01, p&lt;0.0001. Posthoc Tukey test: °° p&lt;0.01, °p&lt;0.05 vs isch/PBS; ** p&lt;0.01 *p&lt;0.05 vs controls; §§§ p&lt;0.001 vs isch/NC(4 h).
