                Figure 3.  Open field test and neuronal loss in ischemic brain areas at day 14. Mice receiving NC(4 h), but not those receiving NC(7 d) show a reversal of ischemia-induced impairment in number of rears and objects (A, n = 10) and a significant reduction in neuronal loss in striatum and cortex (B) compared to those receiving PBS (n = 6). Data are expressed as mean±SEM. One-way ANOVA: (A) rears F: 11.46, p&lt;0.0001; (A) objects F: 5.38, p = 0.0056; (B) striatum F: 31.67, p&lt;0.0001; (B) cortex F: 5.06, p = 0.0256. Posthoc Tukey test: °° p&lt;0.01, °p&lt;0.05 vs isch/PBS, ** p&lt;0.01, * p&lt;0.05 vs controls; §§§ p&lt;0.001, § p&lt;0.05 vs isch/NC(4 h).
