                Figure 6.  Confocal analysis of immunoreactivity of NC(4 h) - green - and nestin, GFAP or NG-2 - red - at day 1.Colocalization (arrows) can be observed between NC(4 h) and nestin, NC(4 h) and GFAP, NC(4 h) and NG-2. Images are taken in striatum, in proximity of the ventricular wall where most cells can be found at this time point. Bar: 25 Âµm.
