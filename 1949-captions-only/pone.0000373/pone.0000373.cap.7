                Figure 7.  mRNA expression of cytokines and trophic factors in ischemic cortex at day 1.Data are expressed as fold of induction compared to sham/PBS group (mean±SEM, n = 6). Two-way ANOVA: SDF-1α F: 97.52, p&lt;0.0001; TGF-β1 F: 31.54, p = 0.0001; VEGF-A F: 24.14, p = 0.0004; IGF-1 F: 28.21, p = 0.0002; BDNF F: 19.34, p = 0.0009. Posthoc Bonferroni test: **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 vs sham/PBS; °°°p&lt;0.001 vs isch/PBS; ### p&lt;0.001 vs sham/NC(4 h).
