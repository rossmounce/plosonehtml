                Figure 8.  Quantification of microglia/macrophage activation.The area occupied by CD11b immunopositive cells was measured in striatum of sham-operated or ischemic mice receiving PBS, NC(4 h) or NC(7 d) at different time points (see Experimental design, Fig. 1A and B). Data are expressed as mean±SEM (n = 4–5). Two-way ANOVA: (A) F: 58.05, p&lt;0.0001; (B) F: 10.19, p = 0.0002. Posthoc Bonferroni test: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 vs sham/PBS; °°p&lt;0.01, °°°p&lt;0.001 vs isch/PBS, ##p&lt;0.01, ###p&lt;0.001 vs sham/NC.
