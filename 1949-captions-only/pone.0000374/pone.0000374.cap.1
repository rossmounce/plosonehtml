Dotted lines on this view indicate the level and plane of the sections shown. Sagittal sections are shown with anterior to the left and posterior to the right. Sections A2–A3, B3, C3–C4, C6–C7 are respectively higher magnifications of sections A1, B1, B2, C2, C5. Sections A1–A3, B1–B3, C1–C4, D1–D7, E1–E4 are stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Section B4 shows a high magnification of central posterior margin stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and DAPI. Section C5 is stained with phalloidin. In B3 the arrowhead points to bottle-like cells and the asterix shows the location of elongated cells close to the posterior margin. Scale bar: 500 µm. Abbreviations: ar, archenteron; bl, blastocoele; e, endoderm; m, mesoderm; me, mesendoderm; y, yolk.</p>
