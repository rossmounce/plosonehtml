                Figure 2.  Expression of mesoderm regional markers during axis extension.Animal views of S. canicula embryos after whole-mount in situ hybridization using FoxA2 (a–c), Lim1 (d–f), Wnt8 (g–i), Gata6 (j–l, k'), MafB (m–o) and Bmp4 (p–r) probes. Views are restricted to the territories enclosed in a dotted box on the schemes of the upper panel. In this panel, below the schematic views of embryos, colored bars symbolise the largely exclusive, more and more lateral, expression territories of markers of axial (red), paraxial (purple) and lateral (blue) mesoderm at the posterior margin. A', c', e', f', h', i', l', n', o', r': sections of the embryos shown in a, c, e, f, h, i, l, n, o, r after eosin counterstaining. The planes of sections are indicated by thin lines on the whole-mount view of each embryo. Scale bar: 500 µm.
