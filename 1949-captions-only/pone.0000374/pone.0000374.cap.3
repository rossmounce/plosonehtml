                Figure 3.  Temporal regulation of embryonic axis formation from rostral to caudal level.Animal views of S. canicula embryos after in situ hybridization using Otx1 (a–c), Otx2 (d–f), Gsc (g–i), HoxB1 (j–l), Cdx2 (m,n) and Mox1 (o, p) probes. For each probe, stages are indicated in the upper line. The views are focussed on the territories enclosed in dotted boxes in b, c, e, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p. d', f', g', i', l', m', p': sections of hybridized embryos shown in d, f, g, i, l, m, p after eosin counterstaining. The planes of sections are indicated by thin lines on the whole-mount view of each embryo. Scale bar: 500 µm.
