                Figure 4.  Molecular characterization of the dogfish embryo at pre-gastrula stages.A) Animal views of S. canicula embryos after in situ hybridization using Otx1 (a,h), Otx2 (b,i), Otx5 (c,j), FoxA2 (d,k), Lim1 (e,l,m), Gsc (f, n) and Brachyury (g, o) probes at stage 10 (upper line) and 11 (second line) as indicated. h', i', j', k', l', n' and o' are midline sagittal sections through the embryos shown in h, i, j, k, l, n and o respectively. Scale bar: 500 Âµm. B) Summary of the three main expression territories identified at stage 11 on the basis of gene expression patterns. Left panel: transcript distribution in the upper cell layer of the blastoderm. Right panel: transcript distribution in the lower layer of the posterior overhang. C) Phenotypes of Xenopus embryos injected with dogfish Otx mRNAs. Embryos at four-cell stage were dorsally-injected with 100 pg dogfish Otx mRNA. They were cultured to stage 35 for score of phenotypes. (a) An uninjected embryo. (b) A dogfish Otx1-injected embryo. (c) A dogfish Otx2-injected embryo. (d) A dogfish Otx5-injected embryo. Overexpression of all three dogfish Otx proteins leads to very similar phenotypes. D) Expression of mesoderm and cement gland markers in dogfsih Otx-injected Xenopus embryos. The embryos shown in the second, third and fourth column were respectively injected with 100 pg of dogfish Otx1, Otx2 and Otx5 mRNA, controls are shown in the first column. The embryos hybridized with Xnot2 (first line), chordin (second line) and Xbra (third line) were injected in the dorsal region at the four-cell stage and developed until stage 11, those hybridized with the XCG probe (fourth line) were injected in the ventral region and developed until stage 25. (a) Control embryo showing Xnot2 expression in the dorsal mesoderm. (b, c, d) Injection of dogfish Otx1 (b), Otx2 (c) and Otx5 (d) inhibits Xnot2 expression. (e) Control embryo showing chordin expression. (f, g, h) Injection of dogfish Otx1 (f), Otx2 (g) and Otx5 (h) did not affect chordin expression. (i) Control embryo showing Xbra expression in the entire maginal mesoderm. (j, k, l) Injection of dogfish Otx1 (j), Otx2 (k) and Otx5 (l) inhibits Xbra expression at the sites of injection. (m) Control stage 25 embryo showing XCG1 expression in the cement gland. (n, o, p) Injection of dogfish Otx1 (n), Otx2 (o) and Otx5 (p) strongly induced ectopic XCG1 expression in the ventral region.
