Scale bar: 500 Âµm. B) Summary of the three main expression territories identified at stage 11 on the basis of gene expression patterns. Left panel: transcript distribution in the upper cell layer of the blastoderm. Right panel: transcript distribution in the lower layer of the posterior overhang. C) Phenotypes of <em>Xenopus</em> embryos injected with dogfish <em>Otx</em> mRNAs. Embryos at four-cell stage were dorsally-injected with 100 pg dogfish <em>Otx</em> mRNA. They were cultured to stage 35 for score of phenotypes. (a) An uninjected embryo. (b) A dogfish <em>Otx1</em>-injected embryo. (c) A dogfish <em>Otx2</em>-injected embryo. (d) A dogfish <em>Otx5</em>-injected embryo. Overexpression of all three dogfish Otx proteins leads to very similar phenotypes. D) Expression of mesoderm and cement gland markers in dogfsih <em>Otx</em>-injected <em>Xenopus</em> embryos. The embryos shown in the second, third and fourth column were respectively injected with 100 pg of dogfish <em>Otx1</em>, <em>Otx2</em> and <em>Otx5</em> mRNA, controls are shown in the first column. The embryos hybridized with <em>Xnot2</em> (first line), <em>chordin</em> (second line) and <em>Xbra</em> (third line) were injected in the dorsal region at the four-cell stage and developed until stage 11, those hybridized with the <em>XCG</em> probe (fourth line) were injected in the ventral region and developed until stage 25. (a) Control embryo showing <em>Xnot2</em> expression in the dorsal mesoderm. (b, c, d) Injection of dogfish <em>Otx1</em> (b), <em>Otx2</em> (c) and <em>Otx5</em> (d) inhibits <em>Xnot2</em> expression. (e) Control embryo showing chordin expression. (f, g, h) Injection of dogfish <em>Otx1</em> (f), <em>Otx2</em> (g) and <em>Otx5</em> (h) did not affect chordin expression. (i) Control embryo showing Xbra expression in the entire maginal mesoderm. (j, k, l) Injection of dogfish <em>Otx1</em> (j), <em>Otx2</em> (k) and <em>Otx5</em> (l) inhibits <em>Xbra</em> expression at the sites of injection. (m) Control stage 25 embryo showing XCG1 expression in the cement gland. (n, o, p) Injection of dogfish <em>Otx1</em> (n), <em>Otx2</em> (o) and <em>Otx5</em> (p) strongly induced ectopic XCG1 expression in the ventral region.</p>
