                Figure 5.  Expression profiles of signalling molecules in the dogfish from pre- to early gastrulation stages.a–n: animal views of dogfish embryos hybridized with Vg1 (a, f, k), Wnt8 (b, g, l), Nodal (c, h, m), Lefty (d, i, n), Bmp4 (e, j, o) probes. f', l', h', n', j' are sagittal sections through the embryos shown in f, l, h, n, j respectively, after eosin counterstaining. The planes of sections are indicated by thin lines on the whole-mount view of each embryo. h” is a higher magnification of h at the level of the posterior margin. Similarly the view in m is restricted to the posterior margin. Scale bar: 500 µm.
