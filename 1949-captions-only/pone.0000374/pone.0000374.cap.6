                Figure 6.  Early polarities at blastula stages in the dogfish.A. a–f: animal views of early dogfish embryos hybridized with Otx5 (a,d) , Bmp4 (b, e) and Nodal (c, f) probes. g: double in situ hybridization using Bmp4 (blue) and Otx5 (brown) probes at stage 9. h: sagittal section through a stage 7/8 dogfish embryo stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue). At this stage, the embryo consists in a mass of round-shaped cells lying on top of the vitellus. A single layer of elongated cells is visible at the level of the blastocoele roof. Scale bar: 500 µm. B. Abnormal expression of anterior markers in Bmp4 null mutant embryos. Lateral views of wild-type (WT: a, c) and Bmp4tm1Blh/Bmp4tm1Blh (Bmp4-/- :b, d) 6.5 dpc mouse embryos, hybridized with Otx2 (a, b) and Dkk1 (c, d) probes. In Bmp4-/- embryos, Otx2 transcripts are not restricted anteriorly and a distal extension of the Dkk1 territory in the anterior visceral endoderm is visible. e: Higher magnification of the embryo in e, showing the absence of Otx2 transcripts in the distal part. Scale bar: 100 µm.
