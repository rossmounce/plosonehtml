Regionalisation of the site of mesoderm internalisation : comparison between the dogfish, xenopus and chick. Axial (red), paraxial (purple) and lateral (light blue) presumptive mesoderm components show the same relative location along the dogfish posterior arms, xenopus marginal ring and chick primitive streak. An additional minor mesoderm cell population, proposed to contribute to extraembryonic blood islands, is also internalised at lateral and anterior levels of the dogfish blastoderm margin (dark blue). We suggest that this cell population may be evolutionary related both to the presumptive ventral mesoderm, located to the ventral part of the marginal ring in xenopus, and extraembryonic mesoderm, internalised at the posterior part of the primitive streak in amniotes. A, anterior; P, posterior; V, ventral; D, dorsal (refer to the nomenclature paragraph in the <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a> section for the use of these terms in the manuscript). B. Similarities in the relative organisation of extraembryonic and embryonic territories between the dogfish and amniotes at blastula and early gastrula stages. Columns 1, 2, 3 and 4 show proposed territory homologies between the dogfish and the vertebrate model organisms at early blastula (1), late blastula (2), early gastrula (3) and mid-gastrula (4) stages respectively. A single blastula stage is shown in xenopus and zebrafish, since the conservation of the temporal sequence of gene expression inductions is less clear with these species. At early blastula stages, the dogfish blastoderm shows a partitioning into two territories, which on the basis of <em>Bmp4</em>, <em>Nodal</em> and <em>Otx</em> expressions, can be related to dorsal (orange) and ventral (yellow) territories of early zebrafish or xenopus embryos, as well as to inner cell mass (orange) and trophectoderm (yellow)-derived territories of the mouse egg cylinder. In the dogfish, this early polarity can be aligned with the later antero-posterior axis of the embryo proper (schematised on the right of the figure). At late blastula stages (column 2), homologous dorsal territories (shown in gray) expressing <em>Gsc</em>, <em>Lim1</em> and <em>Otx</em> are induced at the level of the dogfish posterior margin, chick Koller's sickle, mouse embryonic visceral endoderm. Comparisons between the three species suggest that a posterior expansion of the blastula <em>Bmp4</em> positive extraembryonic territory has taken place in amniotes (columns 1, 2, 3). Whether a remnant of the site of posterior fusion hypothesized by this evolutionary model (dotted line in columns 2, 3, 4) may persist in amniotes remains an opened question. The early organizer (red) is induced concomitantly with the anterior displacement of the hypoblast/AVE homologs (green, column 3). The site of mesoderm internalisation (column 4) is depicted as in A. Prox., proximal; Dist., distal.</p>
