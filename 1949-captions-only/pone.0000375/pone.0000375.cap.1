                Figure 1.  Activation of the Tor pathway produces synaptic growth and enhanced physiological function.The morphology of the third instar larval NMJ was visualized with the presynaptic marker anti-cysteine string protein (CSP) and confocal microscopy. Images shown are stacks of 20 or more optical sections. Neuronal (elav-Gal4) expression of either Rheb (B) or Pi3K (C) increased the size of the synapse compared to control animals bearing the elav-Gal4 transgene alone (A). Numbers of synaptic boutons/muscle area are quantified in D. Expression of either UAS-Rheb (n = 41) or UAS-Pi3K (n = 41) produced a significant increase in the number of boutons/muscle area compared to controls (n = 44), while expression of UAS-Rheb in the muscle (driven by G14-Gal4, n = 18) produced a reduction. Neuron-specific expression of Rheb also produced electrophysiological changes at the NMJ, determined by intracellular recordings from abdominal muscle 6 in third instar larvae. The amplitude of the EJP was significantly increased in animals expressing UAS-Rheb (n = 21) compared to controls with elav-Gal4 alone (n = 12). Examples of EJP voltage traces are shown in E, and mean EJP values are quantified in F. Quantal content, a measure of the number of synaptic quanta released in a single firing of the motoneuron, was nearly doubled by neuron-directed expression of Rheb compared to controls (I). Mini-EJP amplitude was decreased in these animals (H), while mEJP frequency showed no significant change (G). In this and all subsequent figures, *** denotes p-values less than 0.00005 using a student t-test comparison with controls, ** denotes p-values less than 0.005, and * denotes p-values less than 0.05. The scale bar is 50 microns in panel A.
