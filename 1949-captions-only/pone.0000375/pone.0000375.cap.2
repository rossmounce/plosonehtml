Reduction of <em>Rheb</em> function produced by either neuron-directed expression of <em>Tsc1</em> and <em>Tsc2</em> (n = 22) or mutation of <em>Rheb</em> (n = 40) significantly reduced synapse size compared to controls with <em>elav-Gal4</em> alone (n = 44) or animals heterozygous for a <em>Rheb</em> mutation (n = 17), as measured by the number of synaptic boutons/muscle area (D). Panel E shows sample EJP traces for wild-type and <em>Rheb</em> mutant NMJs, as well as baseline recordings from these preparations showing the size and frequency of mini-EJPs. Panels F, G, and I show reductions in EJP amplitude, mini-EJP frequency, and quantal content for <em>Rheb</em> mutant synapses (n = 29) compared to wild-type controls (n = 10). Mini-EJP amplitude did not show a significant change (H). The scale bar in A is 50 microns.</p>
