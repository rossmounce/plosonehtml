                Figure 3.  Rapamycin does not block Rheb-mediated synapse growth.Panels Aâ€“C show anti-CSP staining of NMJ synaptic boutons, demonstrating that the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin does not block synapse growth in control animals or in larvae with neuron-directed expression of Rheb (elav-Gal4&gt;UAS-Rheb). Panels D and E provide quantification of bouton numbers/muscle area and numbers of motoneuron branches, respectively, for elav-gal4 controls (n = 44), animals with neuronal expression of Rheb (n = 41), control animals treated with rapamycin (n = 26), and Rheb expressing animals treated with rapamycin (n = 29). The scale bar is 50 microns.
