Panels D and E provide quantification of bouton numbers/muscle area and numbers of motoneuron branches, respectively, for <em>elav-gal4</em> controls (n = 44), animals with neuronal expression of <em>Rheb</em> (n = 41), control animals treated with rapamycin (n = 26), and <em>Rheb</em> expressing animals treated with rapamycin (n = 29). The scale bar is 50 microns.</p>
