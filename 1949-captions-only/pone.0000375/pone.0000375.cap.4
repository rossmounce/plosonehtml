                Figure 4.  Rheb-mediated synapse expansion and physiological function is BMP-signaling dependent.Anti-CSP staining of synaptic boutons (panels Aâ€“C) shows the effects of wit on synapse growth (B), and the effects of neuron-directed expression of Rheb on wit mutant NMJs (C) compared to wild-type (A). Synapse size, measured by either the number of boutons/muscle area (D) or the number of motoneuron branches (E), is dramatically reduced in wit mutants (n = 20) compared to wild-type (n = 12), and is partially rescued by neuron-directed expression of Rheb (elav-Gal4&gt;UAS-Rheb, n = 24). Reductions in EJP amplitudes (F), mini-EJP amplitudes (H), and quantal content (I) mediated by loss of wit (n = 8) are not rescued by neuron-directed expression of Rheb (n = 16) (n = 10 for wild-type). The decrease in mini-EJP frequency of wit mutants, a measure of spontaneous vesicle release, is rescued to a significant degree by expression of Rheb in the motoneuron (G). The scale bar represents 50 microns.
