Synapse size, measured by either the number of boutons/muscle area (D) or the number of motoneuron branches (E), is dramatically reduced in <em>wit</em> mutants (n = 20) compared to wild-type (n = 12), and is partially rescued by neuron-directed expression of <em>Rheb</em> (<em>elav-Gal4&gt;UAS-Rheb</em>, n = 24). Reductions in EJP amplitudes (F), mini-EJP amplitudes (H), and quantal content (I) mediated by loss of <em>wit</em> (n = 8) are not rescued by neuron-directed expression of <em>Rheb</em> (n = 16) (n = 10 for wild-type)<em>.</em> The decrease in mini-EJP frequency of <em>wit</em> mutants, a measure of spontaneous vesicle release, is rescued to a significant degree by expression of Rheb in the motoneuron (G). The scale bar represents 50 microns.</p>
