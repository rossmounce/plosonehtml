                Figure 6.  Effects of mutations that downregulate the Tor pathway on photoreceptor axon guidance, and genetic epistasis with Tsc1.Optic lobes from third instar larvae (A–C) and 40h pupae (D–F) stained with MAb24B10. (A) Larvae heteroallelic for a hypomorphic combination of Rheb alleles show abnormal photoreceptor patterning and contain thick axon bundles that extend into the medulla (arrowhead). (D) At the 40 h pupal stage, Rheb mutants display axons that bypass their normal targets in the R7/R8 termination zones (arrowhead). (B) Larvae homozygous for a hypomorphic Tor allele show fairly normal photoreceptor patterning, but at the pupal stage (E) misrouted axons can be seen in the medulla (arrowheads). (C) S6k null homozygous larvae show thick axon bundles projecting past the lamina (arrowhead), while S6k pupae (F) display misrouted axons that initially bypass the R7/R8 termination zone (arrowhead). (G, H) Animals doubly mutant for Tor and Tsc1 do not show the severe photoreceptor defects seen when axons are mutant for Tsc1 alone (compare to Figure 5B, F, F′), although mild defects similar to those in Tor mutants are still apparent (arrowhead). (I) S6k-Tsc1 double homozygous mutants display a severe phenotype dissimilar to mutants for either S6k or Tsc1 alone. The scale bar is 25 microns in panel A, 50 microns in panel D.
