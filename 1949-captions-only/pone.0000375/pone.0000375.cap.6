(A) Larvae heteroallelic for a hypomorphic combination of <em>Rheb</em> alleles show abnormal photoreceptor patterning and contain thick axon bundles that extend into the medulla (arrowhead). (D) At the 40 h pupal stage, <em>Rheb</em> mutants display axons that bypass their normal targets in the R7/R8 termination zones (arrowhead). (B) Larvae homozygous for a hypomorphic <em>Tor</em> allele show fairly normal photoreceptor patterning, but at the pupal stage (E) misrouted axons can be seen in the medulla (arrowheads). (C) <em>S6k</em> null homozygous larvae show thick axon bundles projecting past the lamina (arrowhead), while <em>S6k</em> pupae (F) display misrouted axons that initially bypass the R7/R8 termination zone (arrowhead). (G, H) Animals doubly mutant for <em>Tor</em> and <em>Tsc1</em> do not show the severe photoreceptor defects seen when axons are mutant for <em>Tsc1</em> alone (compare to <a href="#pone-0000375-g005">Figure 5B, F, F′</a>), although mild defects similar to those in <em>Tor</em> mutants are still apparent (arrowhead). (I) <em>S6k-Tsc1</em> double homozygous mutants display a severe phenotype dissimilar to mutants for either <em>S6k</em> or <em>Tsc1</em> alone. The scale bar is 25 microns in panel A, 50 microns in panel D.</p>
