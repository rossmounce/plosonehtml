                Figure 1.  Task description, study design and Retrieval performance.(A)Task description and (B) study design. Subjects learned word-triplets (A-B-C) in the evening starting at 22:00 h. After three successive presentations of all 32 triplets, learning performance (Test of Learning) was determined as a baseline measure for half of the triplets in forward direction. Afterwards the sleep group went to bed whereas the wake group remained awake throughout the night and the following day. In the night afterwards both groups slept normally and returned to the laboratory in the following morning at 8:00 h for retrieval testing. Probed recall testing was performed either in forward direction or in backward direction. (C) Retrieval performance. Percentages of retrieved words with reference to baseline determined at the Test of Learning in the sleep (n = 13) and wake (n = 13) group for forward and backward retrieval (for items not previously used at Test of Learning). Subjects in the sleep group were distinctly better in the retention of the forward associations than the subjects in the wake group specifically for the 1st transition. Note also the pronounced improvement in the sleep group in forward associations compared with backward associations again especially for the 1st transition. ** p&lt;0.01, two-tailed pairwise comparisons.
