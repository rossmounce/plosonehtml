Δ Vif HIV-1 particles were produced in presence of different doses of wt APOBEC3G-HA (A3G), or with the highest dose of the R122A and W127L mutants of APOBEC3G-HA. The infectivity of these particles was determined by titration on P4.2 indicator cells. The doses d1 to d4 of APOBEC3G correspond respectively to a molar ratio of APOBEC3G-HA plasmid to virus plasmid of 0.6:1, 1.3:1, 2.7:1 and 5.5:1. The graph is made from one duplicate experiment, and is representative of a total of at least 4 independent duplicate experiments. Panel B. The presence of wt APOBEC3G-HA or the R122A and W127L mutants in ΔVif HIV-1 virions was assessed by western blot. The PCNA and capsid western blots serve to check for consistent loading of cellular and virion extracts, respectively. Representative of at least two independent experiments.</p>
