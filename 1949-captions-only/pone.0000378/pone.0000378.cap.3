                Figure 3.  Mapping of functional and evolutionary informative residues at the molecular surface of N-CDA.Panel A, Mapping of functional residues. The color gradient (dark red&gt;red&gt;orange&gt;yellow) reflects the role of various mutations in abolishing anti-HIV activity (see Table 1) ranging from no antiviral activity (dark red) to normal activity (yellow). Panel B. Mapping of evolutionary informative residues at the molecular surface. Green color identifies amino acids under positive selective pressure in primate APOBEC3G. The positive selection cluster includes T98, K99, R102, D128, and P129. Blue color identifies the pseudoâ€“active site.
