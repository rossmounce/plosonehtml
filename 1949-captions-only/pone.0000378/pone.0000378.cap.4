                Figure 4.  Mapping potential to molecular surface.Zoomed in view on the functional surface region within the N-CDA. Panel A, wild-type huAPOBEC3G N-CDA. Panel B-D, effect of mutations R122A, W127L, and D128K on surface charge and shape. The red color represents negative potential, the blue color expresses positive potential, and the white color expresses zero potential.
