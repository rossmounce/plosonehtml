                Figure 3. Teleost V1r1 and V1r2 genes are clustered in the genome. Relative positions and orientations of V1r1 and V1r2 genes in Dr, Dm, Ol, Ga, Tr and Tn. V1r2 was not found in the tetraodontidae species. The grey square represents the position of the conserved V1r1 5â€²UTR region. Horizontal lines above the zebrafish sequence represent the position and size of the RNA probes used for the in situ hybridizations (probes I, II and III) (see Figure 5). The V1r1 transcription start site is indicated by an asterisk.
