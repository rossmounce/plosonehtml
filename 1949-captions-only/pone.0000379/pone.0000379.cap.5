                Figure 5. Dr V1r1 and V1r2 are expressed in the olfactory rosette. (a) RT-PCR indicating transcription of V1r1 and V1r2 in olfactory rosette extracts. OMP (olfactory marker protein) and βactin were used as positive controls. (b) In situ hybridization of a horizontal olfactory rosette section with an anti-sense Dr V1r1 probe (probe III in Figure 3). (c) In situ hybridization with anti-sense Dr V1r2 probes (probe I in Figure 3). (d) In situ hybridization with an antisense 5′UTR V1r1 probe (probe II in Figure 3). Arrows indicate cells reacting to the probes. Asterisks and empty squares correspond respectively to luminal and cartilaginous parts of the rosette. Scalebar: 40 µm.
