                Figure 6. Teleost V1r1 and V1r2 exhibit different evolutionary rates. (a) Phylogenetic analysis of teleost V1r genes. A rooted DNA tree was generated, based on an alignment of 24 teleost V1r sequences and three mouse V1rs (V1rf3, V1re4 and V1rb2). Similar ω were obtained for each V1r family using two-or three-ratio models. The V1r1 clade ω value was 3×times higher than the one of the V1r2 clade (see Table 2). Positive selection was detected on branches A–F and asterisks indicate branches in which positively selected sites were identified. (b) Unrooted tree based on the amino acid alignment of the 24 teleost V1r receptors.
