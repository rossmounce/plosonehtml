(a) Phylogenetic analysis of teleost V1r genes. A rooted DNA tree was generated, based on an alignment of 24 teleost V1r sequences and three mouse V1rs (<em>V1rf3, V1re4</em> and <em>V1rb2</em>). Similar ω were obtained for each V1r family using two-or three-ratio models. The V1r1 clade ω value was 3×times higher than the one of the V1r2 clade (see <a href="#pone-0000379-t002">Table 2</a>). Positive selection was detected on branches A–F and asterisks indicate branches in which positively selected sites were identified. (b) Unrooted tree based on the amino acid alignment of the 24 teleost V1r receptors.</p>
