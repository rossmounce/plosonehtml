                Figure 1.  The CDKN2A locus.The genomic map covers about 55 kb around CDKN2A according to Ensemble [59]. CDKN2A/B is located at chromosome 9p21 and their RNA products are encoded by the reverse strand. CDKN2A encodes 2 proteins (p16INK4A and p14ARF) that share the same exons 2 and 3. The first exons of INK4A and ARF are about 20 kb apart. CDKN2B encodes p15INK4B that is homologous to p16INK4A. In addition to transcripts, the map also shows repetitive sequences (Repeat) and available BAC clone (Human tilepath clones), RP11-149I2.
