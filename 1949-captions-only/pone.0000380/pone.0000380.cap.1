The first exons of <em>INK4A</em> and <em>ARF</em> are about 20 kb apart. <em>CDKN2B</em> encodes p15<sup>INK4B</sup> that is homologous to p16<sup>INK4A</sup>. In addition to transcripts, the map also shows repetitive sequences (Repeat) and available BAC clone (Human tilepath clones), RP11-149I2.</p>
