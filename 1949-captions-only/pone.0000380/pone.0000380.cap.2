                Figure 2.  Primer Approximation Multiplex PCR (PAMP).The efficiency of PCR amplification is inversely related to the distance of upstream and downstream primers. In this example, primers to amplify genomic sequences around the locus of interest (LOI) are divided into 20 groups: 10 each for forward (F1–F10) and reverse (R1-R10) groups (A). While all of the possible forward and reverse primer pairs are too far to each other for PCR amplification in wild type genome, certain pair of primers is brought closer (“approximated”) due to deletion (F3 and R3) in mutated genome. Multiplex PCR reactions are set and represented as a matrix to include one forward and one reverse primer group. The expected PCR results are shown as gray scale shadows in the matrix (B). This example shows that only group pairs close to breakpoint give PCR products (F3-R3, F3-R4, F4-R3).
