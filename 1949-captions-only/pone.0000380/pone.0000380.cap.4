The procedure has been briefly described in <a href="#pone-0000380-g003">Figure 3</a>. The products were labeled and used for array hybridization: F<sub>A</sub>-R<sub>Y</sub> for array 25; F<sub>A</sub>-R<sub>Z</sub> for array 26; F<sub>B</sub>-R<sub>Y</sub> for array 27 and F<sub>A</sub>-R<sub>Z</sub> for array 28. Aliquots of the individual PAMP samples were also pooled together and labeled for array hybridization (array 29, its array image is shown in <a href="#pone-0000380-g003">Figure 3B</a>). The results are presented with ratio signal intensity (Y-axis) of samples from Detroit 562 (mutant) and HEK293 (control) against the probe location (X-axis). The breakpoints can be identified through this plot by finding the two peaks that are analogous to the bright green spots in <a href="#pone-0000380-g003">Figure 3B</a>.</p>
