                Figure 4.  Pooling of individual PAMP reactions for single array hybridization.Four groups (FA, FB, RY and RZ) of primers were used for four PAMP reactions each by pairing all of the possible forward and reverse primer groups using Detroit 562 (mutant) and HEK293 (control) as templates. The procedure has been briefly described in Figure 3. The products were labeled and used for array hybridization: FA-RY for array 25; FA-RZ for array 26; FB-RY for array 27 and FA-RZ for array 28. Aliquots of the individual PAMP samples were also pooled together and labeled for array hybridization (array 29, its array image is shown in Figure 3B). The results are presented with ratio signal intensity (Y-axis) of samples from Detroit 562 (mutant) and HEK293 (control) against the probe location (X-axis). The breakpoints can be identified through this plot by finding the two peaks that are analogous to the bright green spots in Figure 3B.
