                Figure 5.  Breakpoint mapping of Detroit 562 cell line.To map the exact breakpoint, a nested set of PCR primers were designed for uniplex PCR based on the previous PAMP results (Figures 3 and 4). The PCR products were used for labeling and hybridized on the array and also for agarose gel electrophoresis. The array data is shown as the same plot in Figure 4. A single major band on the agarose gel was excised and purified for sequencing (B). The breakpoint is indicated (from #21975226 to #21960809 according to NCBI human genome sequence build 36).
