The PCR products were used for labeling and hybridized on the array and also for agarose gel electrophoresis. The array data is shown as the same plot in <a href="#pone-0000380-g004">Figure 4</a>. A single major band on the agarose gel was excised and purified for sequencing (B). The breakpoint is indicated (from #21975226 to #21960809 according to NCBI human genome sequence build 36).</p>
