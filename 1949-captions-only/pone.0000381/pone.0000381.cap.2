                Figure 2.  Sequence comparison between SENP8 and its homologs in human pathogenic bacteria.Multiple sequence alignment of the catalytic core region of human SENP8 (NCBI protein sequence identifier GI: 33942066, shown are residues 100–165) with the homologs in C. trachomatis (CT868, GI: 76789615, residues 199–284) [23], E. coli (elaD, GI: 15832411, residues 228–319), L. pneumophila (GI: 52843101, residues 189–265), and S. typhi (sseL, GI: 29141091, residues 197–264) [42]. The arrows indicate active-site histidine, aspartate (or asparagine), the catalytic cysteine, and the oxyanion-stabilizing group. Predicted secondary structures are shown at the bottom and have been confirmed with the solved structure of SENP8 [27].
