All probes were tested for activity with <em>bona fide</em> substrates (not shown) <a href="#pone.0000381-Hemelaar1">[14]</a>. Mutation of the active-site cysteine at position 313 to serine abolishes adduct formation of elaD to electrophilic probes. Samples were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Indicated at the right is the molecular mass in kDa.</p>
