Expression of recombinant elaD and elaD<sub>C313S</sub> in bacteria.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec2.fig4.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.fig4.caption1.p1"></a><p>Coomassie staining of a 10% SDS-PAGE, showing the relatively higher expression levels of elaD<sub>C313S </sub>, compared to wildtype elaD. The purity of elaD was increased to 30â€“40% after a second round of size exclusion chromatography (not shown). Similar to <em>in vitro</em> translated elaD, the bacterially expressed protein also reacts with ubiquitin-VME. Molecular mass indicated at the left (in kDa). B. Biochemical assay for hydrolytic activity of elaD. His-tagged elaD was expressed in and purified from <em>E. coli</em> and incubated with fluorogenic substrates based on ubiquitin, SUMO1 and Nedd8. No hydrolytic activity of elaD was observed on SUMO1-AMC and Nedd8-AMC (data not shown). In contrast, the C-terminal peptide bond of ubiquitin-AMC is efficiently cleaved by elaD, leading to release and dequenching of the fluorophore AMC. Depicted is a representative experiment in which variable concentrations of purified elaD were incubated with 500 nM ubiquitin-AMC for 40 min. The C313S mutant of elaD has no proteolytic activity and wildtype elaD can be inhibited by alkylation of its active-site cysteine with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown). The y-axis shows relative fluorescence units, the x-axis represents the time scale with measurements every 2 minutes.</p>
