                Figure 2.  Variation of chemokine expression in the uterus during the mouse estrus cycle and pregnancy.Relative levels of (a) CCL3, (b) CCL4, (c) CCL22 and (d) CX3CL1 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR performed on total uterine mRNA, normalised to HPRT on the same sample set used in Fig. 1. Levels for the 4 estrus cycle phases are shown in chronological order and compared to the levels in pregnant mice. Each point corresponds to one animal. Horizontal bars represent the mean of each data set. Dotted lines indicate the maximal and minimal values detected for pregnant mice.
