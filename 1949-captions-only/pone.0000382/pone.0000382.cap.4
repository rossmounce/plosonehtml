                Figure 4.  Foxp3 and chemokine expression level fluctuations during the estrus cycle and pregnancy.Plots of the variation of the mean relative expression of Foxp3, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL22 and CX3CL1 during the estrus cycle phases and pregnancy (same sample set used in Figs. 1 and 2). Estrus cycle phases are arranged in chronological order: (d) diestrus&gt;(p) pro-estrus&gt;(e) estrus&gt;(m) met-estrus&gt;(d) diestrus etc. After 2 full cycles, a cycle were estrus is followed by (P) pregnancy is shown. Dots represent the mean of each data set. Sinusoidal functions (black lines) were fitted to the estrus cycle data (see methods). In the cases where the sinusoidal function did not fit the data, a line connecting the means is shown (red line). Dotted lines join the mean of the estrus phase of the last cycle with the mean of the levels detected during pregnancy.
