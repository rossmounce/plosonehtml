Estrus cycle phases are arranged in chronological order: (d) diestrus&gt;(p) pro-estrus&gt;(e) estrus&gt;(m) met-estrus&gt;(d) diestrus etc. After 2 full cycles, a cycle were estrus is followed by (P) pregnancy is shown. Dots represent the mean of each data set. Sinusoidal functions (black lines) were fitted to the estrus cycle data (see <a href="#s4">methods</a>). In the cases where the sinusoidal function did not fit the data, a line connecting the means is shown (red line). Dotted lines join the mean of the estrus phase of the last cycle with the mean of the levels detected during pregnancy.</p>
