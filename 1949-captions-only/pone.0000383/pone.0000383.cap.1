Dotted lines (e.g. those connecting A1 with A2 and A3, or B1 with B2) represent putative in-paralog relationships within each species, identified using the ‘reciprocal better hit’ rule. Putative co-ortholog relationships, indicated by dashed gray lines, connect in-paralogs across species boundaries (e.g. A3 and B2).</p>
