                Figure 1.  OrthoMCL graph construction between two species, including the establishment of co-ortholog relationships.Solid lines connecting A1 and B1 represent putative ortholog relationships identified by the ‘reciprocal best hit’ (RBH) rule. Dotted lines (e.g. those connecting A1 with A2 and A3, or B1 with B2) represent putative in-paralog relationships within each species, identified using the ‘reciprocal better hit’ rule. Putative co-ortholog relationships, indicated by dashed gray lines, connect in-paralogs across species boundaries (e.g. A3 and B2).
