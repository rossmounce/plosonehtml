                Figure 3.  False positive and false negative rates for multiple orthology/homology detection methods.Shaded diamonds present bivariate residual (BVR) statistics calculated based on the orthology data (see Figure 2) and the 2LC model, showing conditional dependence between the ten methods under study. For benchmarking purpose, the CFactor 2LC model is applied to all orthology detection methods to correct for these dependencies (see Figure S2). FP and FN estimates for each method and the overall orthology probability (estimated to be 0.48) are calculated based on the average frequency table from 100 sampling replicates. Those replicates exhibiting a good fit to the CFactor 2LC model (L-square&lt;170) are plotted as colored circles (for illustrative purposes only; FP and FN rates in the table are based on all replicates).
