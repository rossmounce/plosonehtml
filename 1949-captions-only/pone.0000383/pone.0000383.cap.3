For benchmarking purpose, the CFactor 2LC model is applied to all orthology detection methods to correct for these dependencies (see <a href="#pone.0000383.s002">Figure S2</a>). FP and FN estimates for each method and the overall orthology probability (estimated to be 0.48) are calculated based on the average frequency table from 100 sampling replicates. Those replicates exhibiting a good fit to the CFactor 2LC model (L-square&lt;170) are plotted as colored circles (for illustrative purposes only; FP and FN rates in the table are based on all replicates).</p>
