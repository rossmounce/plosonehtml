                Figure 4.  The effects of parameter alteration on orthology detection performance.Panel A: Phylogeny-based methods. Varying the orthology bootstrap cutoff indicates that the cross-over point where FP = FN occurs at a lower cutoff than the suggested default (50%; gray bar). Panel B: BLAST-based methods. The effect of changing E-value cutoff for various methods (the bit score cutoff used by Inparanoid is transformed into E-value cutoff) is shown. Single data point is provided for KOG, which could not be readily rerun under diverse conditions. Panel C: Markov clustering methods. The effect of varying the MCL inflation index is shown. The inflation index of 1 corresponds to single-linkage (SL) clustering. In panels Aâ€“C, FP and FN error rates are represented by solid and dashed lines, respectively. Panel D: An ROC curve representing the range of FP and FN error rates observed in panels A &amp; B. Default or recommended settings for each method are indicated by circles.
