                Figure 5.  Comparison of protein domain content similarity for OrthoMCL and KOG groups.The distribution of Domain Content Similarity (DCS) values for non-identical KOG and OrthoMCL groups is shown. Shading is used to represent group size (number of taxa). In general, OrthoMCL groups are smaller, and exhibit more consistency in protein domain architecture.
