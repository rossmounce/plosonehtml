OrthoMCL uses normalized BLAST scores <a href="#pone.0000383-Li1">[18]</a>, and clustering is based on the identification of (co-)orthologs and in-paralogs (<a href="#pone-0000383-g001">Figure 1</a>), rather than simply homologs defined by BLAST. <em>Panel B:</em> Colored vertical bars correspond to OrthoMCL groups; colored horizontal bars indicate conserved domains assigned by MKDOM2 <a href="#pone.0000383-Gouzy1">[35]</a>.</p>
