                Figure 6.  Example of KOG vs OrthoMCL clustering.Group KOG2550 is split by OrthoMCL into two groups that are more consistent with respect to both EC annotation and protein domain architecture. Panel A: Edge lengths in these two BioLayout graphs [40] indicate BLAST similarity relationships, and node colors represent different OrthoMCL groups (note that one protein, shown in gray, is not clustered by OrthoMCL). OrthoMCL uses normalized BLAST scores [18], and clustering is based on the identification of (co-)orthologs and in-paralogs (Figure 1), rather than simply homologs defined by BLAST. Panel B: Colored vertical bars correspond to OrthoMCL groups; colored horizontal bars indicate conserved domains assigned by MKDOM2 [35].
