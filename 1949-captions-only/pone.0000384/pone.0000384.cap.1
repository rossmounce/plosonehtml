                Figure 1.  Molecular divergence times and evolutionary rates of placental mammals.A and B show the MVS-FIR and ML-FLOG trees, respectively. The numbers 1–61 denote the ancestral nodes. The red numbers 1–8 indicate the internal nodes with fossil constraints which are as follows: 1, 49–61; 2, 52–58; 3, 45–63; 4, 43–60; 5, &lt;63; 6, &gt;12; 7, 36–55; 8, 54–65 (all in mya) [see 4], [15]. The colors of the branches denote inferred evolutionary rates (in units of ×10−9/site per year) as follows: black, &lt;0.2; dark blue, 0.2–0.3; light blue, 0.3–0.4; green, 0.4–0.5; brown, 0.5–0.6; yellow, 0.6–0.7; and red, &gt;0.7.
