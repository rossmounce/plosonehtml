                Figure 2.  Evolutionary rate changes from the root to the fin whale.Figures A and B, respectively, trace the estimated rates along edges on analyses using MVS and ML branch lengths. The root time of of the FADD analysis in Figure A and B was set at a large value (400 mya) because the numerical calculation continues towards an infinite root time.
