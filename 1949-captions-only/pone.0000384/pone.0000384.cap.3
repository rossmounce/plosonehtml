At present, such quantitative data are limited to the well-studied North American record. The red circles represent the chronological distribution of node density (or splits) on the MVS-F<sub>IR</sub> tree (<a href="#pone-0000384-g001">Figure 1A</a>). The green triangles represent split frequency on the ML-F<sub>LOG</sub> tree (<a href="#pone-0000384-g001">Figure 1B</a>). The node density is given by the number of nodes in an 8 myr sliding window. A scaling constant for the molecular frequencies was calculated via a least-squares fit to the fossil data in the period 85â€“50 mya.</p>
