The blue numbers show the branch index, as used on <a href="#pone-0000384-g005">Figure 5</a>, of outliers. Note, all the outliers are internal branches ancestral to the four lineages undergoing convergent evolution or are ancestral to the sister group to these lineages. Branch lengths ancestral to the groups undergoing convergent evolution are underestimated by the ML and NJ methods, whereas those ancestral to their sister taxa are overestimated.</p>
