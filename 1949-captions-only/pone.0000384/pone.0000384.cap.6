                Figure 6.  Branch lengths estimated by MVS, NJ, and ML for the example of convergent evolution in figure 5.The tree topology inferred by these methods was identical to the tree that generated the data, so the estimated branch lengths are plotted against their true values. The blue numbers show the branch index, as used on Figure 5, of outliers. Note, all the outliers are internal branches ancestral to the four lineages undergoing convergent evolution or are ancestral to the sister group to these lineages. Branch lengths ancestral to the groups undergoing convergent evolution are underestimated by the ML and NJ methods, whereas those ancestral to their sister taxa are overestimated.
