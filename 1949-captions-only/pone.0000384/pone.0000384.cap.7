Because the root age estimated by function F<sub>ADD</sub> was going to infinity, it was set to 200 mya for illustrative purposes. Figure A is a single example from a tree simulated under the scenario of random auto-correlated changes of rate moving towards the tips, strongly biased towards a deceleration of evolutionary rates as time progresses (from the set of simulations used for <a href="#pone-0000384-t003">Table 3</a>). The true age of the root was 100 mya. Figure B shows the results using the MVS tree derived from the mitochondrial sequences of placental mammals. The dotted line indicates the 95% confidence interval of the estimated age of the root using the sum-of-squares approach described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>.</p>
