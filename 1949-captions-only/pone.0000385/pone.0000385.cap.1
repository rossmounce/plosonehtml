(A and B) Chromatograms and corresponding spectra of ESI-MS-MS fragmentation of the molecular ions [M+H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 180 and 235 derived from lysates of OCT2-transfected HEK-293 cells versus empty vector transfected HEK-293 cells after 30 min of incubation with 100% fetal bovine serum (pH 7.4, 37°C) following 60 min preincubation in buffer solution. Specific fragment masses are indicated in red and assigned to the proposed fragment ion structures; the parent ions are shown in blue. (C and D) Concentration dependence, maximal transport rate V<sub>max</sub> (mean (s.e.m.)) and Michaelis-Menten constant K<sub>m</sub> (mean (s.e.m.)) of specific uptake of cyclo(his-pro) or salsolinol into HEK-293 cells transfected with OCT2 or the related cation transporters OCT1 and EMT after 1 min of loading (left panel); time dependence and influx clearance Cl<sub>in</sub> (mean (s.e.m.)) of specific uptake after incubation with 10 µmol/l of cyclo(his-pro) or salsolinol (right panel) (n = 3 independent experiments each). N-methylation of intracellular salsolinol was negligible (maximal 2.5% of salsolinol concentration after 60 min of incubation).</p>
