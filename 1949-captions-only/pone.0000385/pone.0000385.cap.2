                Figure 2. Selectivity of cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol as endogenous substrates of the organic cation transporter OCT2. (A and B) Accumulation of selected compounds in HEK-293 cells expressing OCT2 (black bars) compared to cells expressing empty vector (open bars) after 5 min of incubation with 10 µmol/l each (n = 3, mean±s.e.m.; ***P&lt;0.001). Substances showing significantly higher accumulation in OCT2 than in control cells (specific OCT2-mediated transport) are depicted in blue; substances with equal accumulation in OCT2 and control cells (unspecific OCT2-independent transport) are shown in red, and substances without detectable uptake in OCT2 or control cells are shown in black. (1: tertaethylammonium; 2: cyclo(his-pro); 3: salsolinol; 4: N-methyl-salsolinol; 5: tyramine; 6: histamine; 7: 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline; 8: 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline; 9: salsolidine; 10: tryptamine; 11: norharmane; 12: 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline​;13: melatonin; 14: tetrahydropapaveroline; 15: carnosine; 16: thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH); 17: pyroglutamate; 18: 4-hydroxy-proline; 19: prolylalanine; 20: proline; 21: prolineamide; 22: glycylproline; 23: pyroglutamyl-histidine; 24: cyclo(tyr-pro)). (C) The overlay of energy minimized conformations (MM2 computation, Chem3D Pro software) of native cylo(L-his-L-pro) (enol tautomer, endo-conformation)[24] and R-salsolinol uncovers close structural similarities, suggesting a planar ring system, an electrophilic center, and a nucleophilic moiety with H-donor properties at a constant distance (of 6.5±0.3 Å) as key properties of a OCT2-specifc substrate.
