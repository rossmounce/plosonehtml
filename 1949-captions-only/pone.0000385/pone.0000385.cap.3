                Figure 3. OCT2, cyclo(his-pro), and salsolinol in brain. Uptake of cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol (10 µmol/l, 5 min incubation) into human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells (A) and human glioblastoma cells (HTZ-146) (B) was not different from control conditions when coincubated with selective inhibitors of dopamine (GBR12909, 10 µmol/l) or norepinephrine (desipramine, 10 µmol/l) transport, but was almost abolished after specific inhibition of organic cation transport via OCT1, OCT2, and EMT with phenoxybenzamine (10 µmol/l) or decynium-22 (1 µmol/l)[25] (n = 3, mean±s.e.m.; ***P&lt;0.001). OCT2 expression was similar in SH-SY5Y and HTZ-146 cells showing 35% and 32% of the level in substantia nigra respectively. Levels of mRNA expression of DAT, NET, OCT1, and EMT in SH-SY5Y cells were 4.63%, 1.64%, 0.04%, and 0%, and in HTZ-146 cells 0%, 0.05%, 0.70%, and 0.37% of the respective OCT2 expression ( = 100%). Hence, neither the neuronal catecholamine transporters nor the isotypic cation transporters OCT1 and EMT can account for a significant fraction of total uptake of cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol in brain cells. (C) Concentration of cyclo(his-pro) in rat brain divisions was highest in mesencephalon encompassing the dopaminergic region substantia nigra. In comparison, in rat kidney (with the highest OCT2 expression)[15], cyclo(his-pro) concentration was lower, and in liver (lacking OCT2)[15], no cyclo(his-pro) was detected (n = 6, mean±s.e.m.; levels were not different between male (3) and female (3) rats; b.l.d.: below limit of detection). (D) Relative quantitative real-time expression of OCT2 mRNA in distinct areas of normal human brain and neuroepithelial tumors (TaqMan Assay) normalized to GAPDH. Expression was highest in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and is given relative to an equally pooled sample derived from 30 normal donors aged 23–68 years (relative expression = 100%; black bar). Specimens of other normal brain areas were derived from a male donor aged 63 years; n.e. indicates no expression of OCT2. The expression profile of the organic cation transporters and DAT in SNc with 0.048% (OCT1), 0.023% (EMT), and 3.66% (DAT) respectively of the mRNA level of OCT2 ( = 100%) resembled that of SH-SY5Y cells which therefore represent an adequate model of OCT- and DAT-mediated transport in SNc. (E) Correlation of OCT2, DAT, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression (relative to OCT2 in pooled SNc ( = 100%)) with intracellular concentrations of cyclo(his-pro), salsolinol and N-methylsalsolinol in microdissection preparations of total SNc, the SNc adjacent crus cerebri (right section), and ventrolateral (VL), ventromedial (VM), and dorsolateral (DL) regions of SNc (left section) derived from a female donor aged 70 years. The neuron-specific expression profile of DAT and TH reflects the characteristic differences in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNc regions with normal aging.[26]
