Cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assay; resulting formazane formation was determined by absorbance at 568 nm. (A) After 48 h exposure to different concentrations of salsolinol, HEK-293 cells expressing OCT2 showed higher cell loss than HEK-293 cells expressing empty vector, OCT1 or EMT. The respective EC<sub>50</sub> values (95% confidence intervals) for salsolinol were 192 (174 to 212), 1112 (900 to 1375), 627 (525 to 748), and 998 (780 to 1277) µmol/l. 12 h of incubation with cyclo(his-pro) (10 µmol/l) prior to salsolinol treatment prevented degeneration of OCT2-transfected HEK-293 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 763 (655 to 889) µmol/l), but had no effect on empty vector transfected HEK-293 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1073 (870 to 1324) µmol/l) (n = 24–48; mean±s.e.m.; *P&lt;0.05, ***P&lt;0.001). (B and C) Cytotoxicity of salsolinol and its protection by pretreatment with cyclo(his-pro) (10 and 100 µmol/l) were confirmed in endogenously OCT2-expressing SH-SY5Y and HTZ-146 cells. The EC<sub>50</sub> values in non-pretreated, and for 1 h with 10 µmol/l and 100 µmol/l cyclo(his-pro) pretreated SH-SY5Y cells were 49 (44 to 56), 1054 (888 to 1251), and 6568 (5313 to 8119) µmol/l of salsolinol, and the respective values in HTZ-146 cells were 138 (120 to 160), 318 (268 to 377), and 2176 (1727 to 2741) µmol/l of salsolinol. (D and E) Cyclo(his-pro) prevented SH-SY5Y and HTZ-146 cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. EC<sub>50</sub> values for glutamate were 389 (323 to 467) vs. 6461 (4132 to 10102) µmol/l in SH-SY5Y cells, and 585 (490 to 699) vs. 4768 (3660 to 6211) when comparing non-pretreated cells with cells pre-treated for 1 h with 10 µmol/l cyclo(his-pro). Cell death caused by glutamate (D and E) as well as salsolinol (B and C) was also attenuated in the presence of a specific inhibitor of NMDA receptor-operated calcium channels ((+)-MK-801, 10 µmol/l), indicating that blockage of excitotoxic calcium entry may contribute to the protective mechanism of cyclo(his-pro). The EC<sub>50</sub> values for glutamate were 1986 (1744 to 2261) in SH-SY5Y and 2316 (1723 to 3112) µmol/l in HTZ-146 cells, and the EC<sub>50</sub> for salsolinol was 475 (430 to 524) in SH-SY5Y and 242 (202 to 291) µmol/l in HTZ-146 cells (n = 16–32; mean±s.e.m.; *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001).</p>
