                Figure 5. Impact of the R400C polymorphism of OCT2 on transport kinetics. (A) Concentration dependence, maximal transport rate Vmax, and Michaelis-Menten constant Km of specific uptake of cyclo(his-pro) or salsolinol into HEK-293 cells transfected with wild-type (wt) 400R or mutant (mt) 400C variant after 1 min of loading (n = 3, mean±s.e.m). (B) Time dependence and influx clearance Clin of specific uptake after incubation with 10 µmol/l of cyclo(his-pro) or salsolinol (n = 3, mean±s.e.m). For cyclo(his-pro), transport efficiency (Vmax/Km) and clearance of 400C were lower, achieving 48% (P = 0.0017) and 70% (P = 0.002) of the 400R reference respectively. For salsolinol, transport efficiency and clearance showed no significant differences between 400R and 400C (P = 0.995 and 0.591 respectively). (C) Viability of HEK-293 cells expressing the OCT2 wild-type 400R or mutant 400C variant was assessed by MTT reduction assay after 48 h exposure to different concentrations of salsolinol following 12 h of incubation with cyclo(his-pro) (10 µmol/l). The 400C variant was less protected by cyclo(his-pro) against salsolinol-induced cell loss with an EC50 (95% confidence interval) of 406 (321 to 513) µmol/l compared to 763 (655 to 889) µmol/l (P&lt;0.001) for 400R (n = 24–48; mean±s.e.m.; *P&lt;0.05, ***P&lt;0.001).
