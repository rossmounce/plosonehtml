The substrates: calf thymus bulk histones (BH), chicken polynucleosomes (Nuc), calf thymus histone H3 (H3) and recombinant H3 (rH3) along with their sites of lysine (K) methylation are indicated below the panels. Control indicates a mock TAP-tag purification from the wild type strain. hLSD1 was recombinant <em>E. coli</em> expressed human LSD1 protein and GST-Swm1 was recombinant <em>E. coli</em> expressed Swm1.</p>
