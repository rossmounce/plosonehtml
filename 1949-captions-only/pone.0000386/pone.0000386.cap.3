                Figure 3. Global analysis of the gene expression profile in swm1 vs wild type cells. A moving average plot (window size = 150 genes, step size = 1 gene) of the median gene expression ratio, swm1Î”/wt, plotted as a function of the average transcription levels of 11 wild-type cell cultures in mid-logarithmic growth.
