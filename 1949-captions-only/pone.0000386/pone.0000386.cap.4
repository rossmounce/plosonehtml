                Figure 4. Genome wide analysis of histone methylation and gene expression in swm1 cells, and binding of Swm1/2. A) A comparison of increased H3K9me2 and altered gene expression in swm1 deletion cells. The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K9me2 in swm1 deletion cells (using a cutoff value of 2.0 ), and a list of genes, which showed altered expression in swm1Δ (using a cutoff value of 1.5). Left: 8.2% of total S. pombe genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K9me2 levels in swm1Δ. Middle: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes up-regulated in swm1Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K9me2. Right: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes down-regulated in swm1Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K9me2. The inserted table shows a list of 10 genes down-regulated in swm1 deletion cells, which also show high H3K9me2 ORF levels in swm1Δ (Swm1/2 binding targets are indicated in bold). B) A comparison of increased H3K4me2 and altered gene expression in swm1 deletion cells. The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K4me2 in swm1 deletion cells (using a cutoff value of 2.0 ), and a list of genes, which showed altered expression in swm1 (using a cutoff value of 1.5). Left: 3.8% of total S. pombe genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels in swm1Δ. Middle: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes up-regulated in swm1Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K4me2. 9.8% of swm1 up-regulated genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels, which is significantly more than expected from the genome average (CHI square, P&lt;0.01; indicated). Right: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes down-regulated in swm1Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K4me2. C) Comparison of Swm1/2 binding targets (determined by Nicolas et al., (2006)), H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 levels, as well as gene expression changes in swm1 deletion cells. Top: The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 levels (as indicated) in swm1 deletion cells, and a list of Swm1/2-binding targets. 13.4% of Swm1/2 binding targets showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels, which is significantly more than expected from the genome average (CHI square, P&gt;0.001; indicated). Bottom: The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between the list of Swm1/2-binding targets and gene expression changes in swm1 deletion cells. Bottom right: A significant proportion of swm1 down-regulated genes (hypergeometric P value indicated) were defined as Swm1/2-binding targets. (Note that our microarray contains only 143 of the 175 targets published by Nicolas et al., (2006).)
