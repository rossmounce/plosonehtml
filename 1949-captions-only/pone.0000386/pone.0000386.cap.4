A) A comparison of increased H3K9me2 and altered gene expression in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells. The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K9me2 in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells (using a cutoff value of 2.0 ), and a list of genes, which showed altered expression in <em>swm1</em>Δ (using a cutoff value of 1.5). Left: 8.2% of total <em>S. pombe</em> genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K9me2 levels in <em>swm1</em>Δ. Middle: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes up-regulated in <em>swm1</em>Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K9me2. Right: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes down-regulated in <em>swm1</em>Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K9me2. The inserted table shows a list of 10 genes down-regulated in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells, which also show high H3K9me2 ORF levels in <em>swm1</em>Δ (Swm1/2 binding targets are indicated in bold). B) A comparison of increased H3K4me2 and altered gene expression in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells. The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K4me2 in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells (using a cutoff value of 2.0 ), and a list of genes, which showed altered expression in <em>swm1</em> (using a cutoff value of 1.5). Left: 3.8% of total <em>S. pombe</em> genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels in <em>swm1</em>Δ. Middle: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes up-regulated in <em>swm1</em>Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K4me2. 9.8% of <em>swm1</em> up-regulated genes showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels, which is significantly more than expected from the genome average (CHI square, P&lt;0.01; indicated). Right: The Venn diagram shows the fraction of genes down-regulated in <em>swm1</em>Δ having high IGR or ORF H3K4me2. C) Comparison of Swm1/2 binding targets (determined by Nicolas et al., (2006)), H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 levels, as well as gene expression changes in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells. Top: The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between lists of IGR and ORF regions having high H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 levels (as indicated) in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells, and a list of Swm1/2-binding targets. 13.4% of Swm1/2 binding targets showed high IGR or ORF H3K4me2 levels, which is significantly more than expected from the genome average (CHI square, P&gt;0.001; indicated). Bottom: The Venn diagrams illustrate the degree of overlap between the list of Swm1/2-binding targets and gene expression changes in <em>swm1</em> deletion cells. Bottom right: A significant proportion of s<em>wm1</em> down-regulated genes (hypergeometric P value indicated) were defined as Swm1/2-binding targets. (Note that our microarray contains only 143 of the 175 targets published by Nicolas et al., (2006).)</p>
