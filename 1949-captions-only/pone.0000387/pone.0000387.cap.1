Mice were evaluated and clinical score (A) and hind paw thickness (B) were assessed every second day. Data represents the mean+1 SEM (n = 9). The epicutaneous immunization had a highly significant effect on disease severity as analysed by two-way ANOVA. The entire <em>in vivo</em> experiment was repeated twice with very similar results. (•) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▴) = sham-treated CCIA controls.</p>
