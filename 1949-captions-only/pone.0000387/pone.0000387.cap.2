                Figure 2.  Histopathological damage of joints is reduced following epicutaneous immunization.Hind paws from healthy mice, CCIA control mice and epicutaneously treated mice were sectioned and stained with H&amp;E (A). One representative example is shown. Note that skin and muscle remain unaffected in CCIA mice. Histological sections were evaluated and arbitrary scores assigned in 5 categories (4 being the most severe score) for extent of inflammatory infiltrate, cartilage and bone erosion. The number of affected hind paws assigned each severity score is shown (B). The mean histopathological severity score was significantly lower in treated mice, p&lt;0.003 (n = 18). Healthy = un-CFA-immunized non-arthritic littermate, CCIA (▪) = sham-treated arthritic mouse, Treated (▪) = epicutaneously immunized mouse.
