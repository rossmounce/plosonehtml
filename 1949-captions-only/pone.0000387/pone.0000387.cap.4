                Figure 4.  CII-driven production of IL-4 correlates inversely with severity of arthritis.The linear correlation between Th2/Th1 cytokine production and severity of arthritis following epicutaneous immunization was analysed using linear regression. Production of IL-4 was negatively correlated to the clinical score (A) while production of IFN-γ was positively correlated to clinical score (B). Each point represents one mouse. (•) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▴) = sham-treated CCIA controls.
