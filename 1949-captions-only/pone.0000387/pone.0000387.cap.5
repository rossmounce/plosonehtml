                Figure 5.  Epicutaneous immunization inhibits development of CII-specific IgG2a and IgG.CII-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a as well as total IgE were measured in serum at the end of the experiment. Serum samples were diluted 1:1500 for IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a and 1:20 for IgE prior to analysis. Each bar represent mean antibody level+1 SEM (n = 9). (▪) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▪) = sham-treated CCIA controls.
