Total number of cells in the culture was kept constant. Cocultures were stimulated with 50 µg CII/ml and CII-specific splenocyte proliferation was assayed as in <a href="#pone-0000387-g003">Figure 3</a>. Black bars demonstrate the expected proliferation [cpm] in the culture, calculated by the formula: [cpm] = a f+b(1−f), where a = [cpm] with 100% control cells, b = [cpm] with 100% treated cells, f = fraction of control cells in the culture. The observed [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation is shown in white bars and represents the mean of triplicate cultures. Similar results were obtained in four individual experiments. Production of IFN-γ and IL-4 in 1:1 ratio cocultures of splenocytes from control and treated mice were assessed by ELISA and results are expressed as mean pg/ml+1 SEM (n = 4) (B). No cytokines were produced in response to a control antigen or when cells were not stimulated. The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in freshly isolated splenocytes (C) from CCIA control or epicutaneously immunized mice and after 90 h <em>in vitro</em> stimulation with 50 µg CII/ml (D) were assessed by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as the mean [%] CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells out of the total CD4<sup>+</sup> population+1 SEM (n = 9). (▪) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▪) = sham-treated CCIA controls.</p>
