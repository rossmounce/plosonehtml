                Figure 7.  Treatment with epicutaneous immunization ameliorate ongoing arthritis.Arthritis were induced in Tg mice by injection of CII in CFA and 1 week later mice were treated with epicutaneous CII. Mice were evaluated and clinical score (A) and hind paw thickness (B) were assessed every second day for 49 days. Data represents the mean+1 SEM (n = 9). Treatment by epicutaneous immunization had a significant effect on disease severity as analysed by two-way ANOVA. (•) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▴) = sham-treated CCIA controls.
