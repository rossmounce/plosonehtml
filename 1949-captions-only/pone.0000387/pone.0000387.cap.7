Mice were evaluated and clinical score (A) and hind paw thickness (B) were assessed every second day for 49 days. Data represents the mean+1 SEM (n = 9). Treatment by epicutaneous immunization had a significant effect on disease severity as analysed by two-way ANOVA. (•) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▴) = sham-treated CCIA controls.</p>
