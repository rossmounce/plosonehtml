CII-driven proliferation (A) and production of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10 and TGF-β (B) were assayed as described in <a href="#pone-0000387-g003">Figure 3</a>. Results are expressed as mean+1 SEM (n = 9). (□) = un-immunized healthy controls, (▪) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▪) = sham-treated CCIA controls.</p>
