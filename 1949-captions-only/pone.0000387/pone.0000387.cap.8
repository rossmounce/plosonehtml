                Figure 8.  Treatment with epicutaneous immunization reduces CII-driven proliferation and IFN-γ production while IL-4 production is enhanced.Splenocytes were collected from all mice on day 49 after induction of disease and cultured with CII or control antigen for 90 h. CII-driven proliferation (A) and production of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10 and TGF-β (B) were assayed as described in Figure 3. Results are expressed as mean+1 SEM (n = 9). (□) = un-immunized healthy controls, (▪) = treated with epicutaneous CII, (▪) = sham-treated CCIA controls.
