                Figure 2. Proliferating cells in culture showed features of radial glia and upon differentiation generated neurons and astroglial cells. A–D; Proliferating cultures expressed Nestin (A), RC2 (B), BLBP (C) D; Overlay of the three markers Nestin (green), RC2 (red) and BLBP (blue). E–G; Precursor cells also immunostained for GLAST (E) and Sox2 (F), overlay of GLAST and Sox2 (G). H; RT-PCR analysis of mRNA from precursor cells further corroborated the suggestive radial glia-like phenotype: Nestin, GFAP, Vimentin, BLBP, Pax6, Sox2. I,J; Under differentiation conditions precursor cells generated neurons and astroglia (bIII-tubulin (green) GFAP (blue) and NG2 (oligodendrocyte precursors). K,L; Addition of BrdU before the transfer to differentiation conditions revealed BrdU (green) in neurons expressing Map2ab (red), confirming that the neuron-like cells originated from a proliferating precursor cell.
