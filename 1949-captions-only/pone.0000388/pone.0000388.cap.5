A; Individual neural precursor cells proliferated and gave rise to neurosphere-like colonies. B; Single sphere-like colonies in proliferation conditions contained a mixture of cells at different stages of development and differentiation. Larger clusters showed a differentiated core that lacked nestin expression (Green) but was positive for astrocytic marker GFAP (Blue). Neuronal differentiation as judged by the Doublecortin (Red). In small spheres, Nestin was also found in the center of the agglomerate. C; Upon transfer into differentiation conditions, the cells differentiated into the three neural lineages: neurons (β-III-tubulin, Red), astrocytes (GFAP, Blue), oligodendrocytes (CNPase; Green). D; Under differentiation conditions, single-cell derived sphere-like colonies up-regulated both neuronal and glial genes (RT-PCR for NeuroD and GFAP).</p>
