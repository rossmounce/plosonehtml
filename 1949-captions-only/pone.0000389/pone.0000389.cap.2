                Figure 2.  PCA factor loads.Relative contributions of reactivity bands to the first two PCA factors calculated on unadjusted profiles of IgG immunoreactivity to brain proteins separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. A. PCA factor 1. B. PCA factor 2. C. localisation of the band-0 on Western blot profile obtain after the computer analysis of membrane NÂ°5. Bands are ordered from high to low molecular weight (between about 230 kDa and 20 kDa).
