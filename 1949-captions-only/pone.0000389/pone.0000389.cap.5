                Figure 5.  Mass fingerprinting.Proteins from human brain extract were separated on a 10% acrylamide gel. After Coomassie staining, three bands corresponding to reactive bands detected by Western blot were cut and their protein contents analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting as described in the material and methods section. Three independent experiments were carried out and conducted to identical protein identifications. Results in figure 5 correspond to those obtain in one typical experiment.
