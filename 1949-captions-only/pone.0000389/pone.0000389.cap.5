After Coomassie staining, three bands corresponding to reactive bands detected by Western blot were cut and their protein contents analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting as described in the <a href="#s2">material and methods</a> section. Three independent experiments were carried out and conducted to identical protein identifications. Results in <a href="#pone-0000389-g005">figure 5</a> correspond to those obtain in one typical experiment.</p>
