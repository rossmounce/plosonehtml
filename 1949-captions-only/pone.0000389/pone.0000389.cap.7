Positive correlation between PCA factor 1 and TNFα concentrations in the CM group, indicated by dashed regression line. B. Positive correlation between unadjusted reactivity to band 0 and TNFα levels. C. High band-0 reactivity was observed most frequently in CM patients with TNFα levels above 100 pg/mL (indicated as high-TNFα in a separate group on the right). Horizontal bars indicate medians. Only children over the age of 1 year are shown.</p>
