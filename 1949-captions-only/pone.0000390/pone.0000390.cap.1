                Figure 1. In vivo implant device permits defined stimulation of the bone marrow tissue. (A) A motion device, consisting of an intra-osseous, pin-shaped implant (im), held in place by a subcutaneous fixation plate is secured to the mouse tibia by two screws (dotted line is approximate skin level). An O-ring placed between the head of the implant and the center column of the fixation plate acts as a spring to return the implant to its starting position after axial displacement. (B) In vivo setting of micromotion device on murine tibia. (C) A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) and load cell connected to the implant head and fixation plate allows the application and recording of displacement (~150 Âµm) and the force (~1N) required to produce motion.
