(A) On post-surgical d3, cells in the stimulated peri-implant space are densely packed within a proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix (blue). (B) In the stationary environment, cells are loosely organized with no evidence of a mineralized extracellular matrix. (C) By d7, a thick (250 µm), fully mineralized bony sheath encapsulates the stimulated implant. (D) The tissue surrounding the stationary implant is absent of any bone matrix. (E) By d14, the bony encasement is more organized and still retains its original thickness. (F) The stationary tissue exhibits first sign of mineralization (90 µm thick) after 14 days. Scale bar: 100 µm.</p>
