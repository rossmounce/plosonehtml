(A,B) PCNA staining reveals no differences in cell proliferation between unloaded and loaded samples. (C) In stimulated and (D) stationary implants <em>sox9</em> is diffusely expressed throughout the surrounding bone marrow cavity. (E) <em>Runx2</em> is broadly and strongly expressed in the peri-implant region in unstimulated samples, (F) whereas physical stimulation induces restriction of the <em>runx2</em> transcripts to the cells adjacent to the implant. (G) Finite element modeling shows strain concentrations (tensile strain (t), compressive strain (c)) at the circumferential ridges and at the bottom of the implant (for illustration purposes, tensile strains were plotted on the right and compressive strains on the left). (H,I) µCT was used to record displacement of Tantalum particles, and principal strains were calculated by digital image correlation. Implant displacement generated a range of strain fields concentrated around circumferential ridges (cr)(*). (J,K) Picrosirius red staining in conjunction with polarized light microscopy reveals that in loaded samples, the peri-implant collagen fibrils (yellow-red) are abundant, tightly packed, and aligned parallel to the displacement trajectory, (L) whereas in unloaded samples, the collagen fibrils are unorganized.
