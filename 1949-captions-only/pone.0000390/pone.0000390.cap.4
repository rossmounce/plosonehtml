(A) <em>Col I</em> expression marks peri-implant cells, (B) including those juxtaposed to the implant (im). (C) The schematic indicates the genomic structure of floxed FAK mice; crossing these mice with Cre mice carrying a 2.3Kb osteoblast-specific <em>Col1a1</em> promoter resulted in Col1Cre<sup>+/+</sup>;FAK<sup>fl/fl</sup> (FAK mutant) mice. PCR was used to identify deletion of the <em>fak</em> allele in the animal. (D) In wildtype animals, seven days of stimulation result in abundant bone formation. (E) High magnification (Aniline blue) shows newly deposited bone matrix (blue) interlaced with blood vessels. (F) In FAK mutant mice, mechanical stimulation failed to induce osteogenesis. Note that FAK mutants were able to regenerate bone in unstimulated regions, as seen on the right periosteal surface. (G) Aniline blue staining shows complete absence of mineralized tissue in the peri-implant site. (H) Vascular ingrowth is not impeded by the deletion of FAK. (I,J,K,L) FAK mutant cells express <em>sox9, runx2, col I</em> and <em>osteocalcin</em> indicating that loss of FAK does not hamper the recruitment of osteochondroprogenitor cells to the peri-implant site. (M) Quantitative histomorphometric assessment of newly deposited bone matrix in unstimulated wild type (wt) bone marrow cavities (white), in stimulated wt bone marrow cavities (light gray), stationary FAK mutant bone marrow (gray), and in stimulated FAK mutant bone marrow cavities (black). * (P&lt;0.1), # (p&lt;0.001) indicates significant difference. Scale bar in A,D and F: 300 µm; in B,E and G–L: 100 µm.</p>
