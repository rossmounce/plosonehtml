Lipids were extracted and analyzed by 1D (A) or 2D TLC (B–E). A: The cholesterol content of each fraction was determined by 1D TLC followed by densitometric analysis. For comparison, total BHK cells were also submitted to Triton solubilization, Optiprep flotation gradients and cholesterol analysis. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). B: After pooling fractions 1 and 2 from the top of the Optiprep gradient (corresponding to the DRMs), lipids were extracted and analyzed by 2D TLC. I: unidentified lipid, PI: phosphatidylinositol, PS: phosphatidylserine, SM: sphingomyelins, PE: phosphatidylethanolamine, PC: phosphatidylcholine, LBPA: Lysobiphosphatidic acid. C–D: The amount of each phospholipid in fractions 1+2 (C) and fraction 6 (D) were quantified by densitometry. Each phospholipid is expressed as percentage of the total amount of phospholipids on the TLC plate. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). E: In order to evaluate the distribution of SM, PS, PC, LBPA and I4 through out the Optiprep gradient, the content of these lipids in fractions 1+2 and in fraction 5+6 was determined. For each lipid, the distribution between these two pools was plotted.</p>
