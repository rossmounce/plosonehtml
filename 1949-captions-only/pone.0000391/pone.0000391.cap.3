                Figure 3.  Detection of two types of late endosomal DRMs.Late endosomes from BHK cells were submitted to solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 either at 4°C or at 37°C. The lysat was subsequently analyzed on an Optiprep gradient and 6 fractions were collected from the top. The total of each fraction was submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect flotillin-1 or to an aerolysin overlay to reveal GPI-anchored proteins.
