                Figure 4.  Distribution of lipid metabolism-related proteins and raft markers in late endosomes.Late endosomes were purified from BHK cells and submitted to sub-organellar fractionation after breaking the organelle by cycles of freezing and thawing followed by sucrose density gradients. 12 fractions were collected from the top and analyzed for the presence of LBPA using an ELISA assay (A) or by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for the presence NPC1, MLN64, flotillin-1 and ApoE (B). GPI-anchored proteins were detected by aerolysin overlay (B).
