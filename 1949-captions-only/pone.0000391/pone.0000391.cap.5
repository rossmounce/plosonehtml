Sections were labeled with antibodies to flotillin-1 and 15 nm protein A-gold and then overlaid with aerolysin-biotin followed by 10 nm anti-biotin-gold. Aerolysin labeling for GPI-anchored proteins is mainly within the internal membranes of the late endosomes. In contrast, flotillin-1 labeling (large arrowheads) is predominantly associated with the limiting membrane (small arrowheads). Bars, 100 nm.</p>
