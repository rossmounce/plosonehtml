                Figure 1.  Detection of Sulf expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumors.A: Representative serial sections of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were stained with Sulf-1, Sulf-2 and control IgG. Benign ducts were compared to areas of invasive carcinoma on the same section. B: Quantitative tabulation of Sulf immunohistochemistry results in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases (0 = no or trace staining,1 = moderate staining,2 = strong staining, ND = not determined). C: RNA was isolated from 24 adenocarcinoma cell lines, cDNA was prepared, and subjected to PCR with primers for SULF1 and SULF2 and Î²-ACTIN as loading control. D: Immunoblots were performed on cell lysates and conditioned medium (CM) using antibodies against Sulf-1 (upper panel) and Sulf-2 (middle and lower panel). Only Sulf-2 protein was detected in the CM.
