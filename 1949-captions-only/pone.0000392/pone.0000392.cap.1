Benign ducts were compared to areas of invasive carcinoma on the same section. B: Quantitative tabulation of Sulf immunohistochemistry results in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases (0 = no or trace staining,1 = moderate staining,2 = strong staining, ND = not determined). C: RNA was isolated from 24 adenocarcinoma cell lines, cDNA was prepared, and subjected to PCR with primers for <em>SULF1</em> and <em>SULF2</em> and Î²-<em>ACTIN</em> as loading control. D: Immunoblots were performed on cell lysates and conditioned medium (CM) using antibodies against Sulf-1 (upper panel) and Sulf-2 (middle and lower panel). Only Sulf-2 protein was detected in the CM.</p>
