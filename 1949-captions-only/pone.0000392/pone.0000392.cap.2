                Figure 2.  Autocrine Wnt signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines.The indicated pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were transfected with sFRP-2 cDNA (sFRP-2) or control vector (ctrl) and the TOP/FOPflash reporter system. Wnt activity was determined by luciferase activity. The values shown are the meansÂ±SD's for 3 independent determinations. Differences between sFRP and control were significant in the Student t-test with p values of&lt;0.002 for BxPC-3, HS766T and L3.6sl.
