                Figure 3.  The effects of inactive Sulfs on Wnt signaling on Wnt signaling and cell growth.A: Four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines as indicated were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding either a catalytically inactive form of Sulf-1 (“S1ΔCC”) or a catalytically inactive form of Sulf-2 (“S2ΔCC”) or with the empty vector (“control”). The mutants were made by replacing two adjacent cysteines with alanines. Wnt signaling was determined by utilizing the TOP/FOPflash reporter system. The values shown are the means±SD's for 4 independent determinations and differences between mutant and control cells were statistically significant with p values&lt;0.02 for BxPC-3, HS766T and L3.6sl cells (Student t-test). B: The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were cultured with conditioned medium derived from each of the following: parental HEK-293 cells (“control”), HEK 293T cells stably expressing wild-type Sulf-2 (denoted “Sulf-2”), or expressing a catalytically inactive form of Sulf-2 (“S2ΔCC”). Wild-type Sulf-2 protein and the mutant were present in the conditioned medium of the two producing cells at approximately equivalent levels. Wnt signaling was determined as before with the TCF-luciferase reporter assay. The values shown are the means±SD's for 3 independent determinations and differences between Sulf-2 mutant and control were statistically significant for BxPC-3 (p = 0.002), HS766T (p = 0.01) and L3.6sl (p = 9×10−6) (Student t-test). C: The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were cultured in a transwell system over feeder layers consisting of: medium alone (“Medium”); parental HEK 293T cells (“HEK 293T”); HEK 293T cells stably producing wild-type Sulf-2 (“Sulf-2”); or a catalytically inactive form of Sulf-2 (“S2ΔCC”). Cell growth was monitored by hemacytometer counting for 4 days. The values shown are the means±SD's for 3 independent determinations.
