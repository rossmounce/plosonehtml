The cells were then incubated with BrdU for one hour and BrdU incorporation was detected by flow cytometry analysis. The values shown are the mean +/- SD's for 2 independent experiments. The differences in BrdU uptake between ctrl and Sulf-2 silenced cells were statistically significant for BxPC-3 (p&lt;0.005), L3.6sl (p&lt;0.007) and HS766T (p&lt;0.001). B: BxPC-3 and L3.6sl pancreatic cells were transduced with control (pLV-ctrl) or Sulf-2 shRNA (pLV-1413, pLV-1143) were harvested and incubated with PE-conjugated annexin V. Subsequently cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The differences between between ctrl and Sulf-2 silenced cells were statistically significant with p-values of 0.0001 for BxPC-3 and p&lt;0.004 for L3.6sl. C and D: L3.6sl cells were transduced with either pLV-1413, pLV-1143 or pLV-ctrl and mixed populations of siRNA and non-siRNA expressing cells were co-cultured. Ratios of transduced to non-transduced cells were measured over time by GFP expression. BxPC-3 cells were transduced with either pSico-ctrl or pSico-1413 and transiently transfected with cre-recombinase to activate expression of the shRNA. The resulting mixed populations of cells with activated (GFP-) and inactivated (GFP+) shRNA expression were co-cultured. Ratios of GFP+ to GFP- cells, using flow cytometry were analyzed as a function of time. Expression of GFP did not have any effect on cell growth in the control population.</p>
