A: L3.6sl derived tumors harvested from mice after 17 days of growth B: Tumor size was monitored over time and values represent the mean (+/-SEM) of 4 mice for L3.6sl cells and 6 (pLV-ctrl) or 5 (pLV-1413) mice for BxPC-3 cells. C: Animals were sacrificed and tumor weight was examined. The difference in tumor weights between the two groups was significant for L3.6sl cells with a p-value of 0.01 and for BxPC-3 cells with a p-value of 0.029 (Student t-test).</p>
