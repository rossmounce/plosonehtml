                Figure 1.  Trypomastigote-induced parasitemia in C57BL/6 mice challenged with different doses of trypomastigotes of T. cruzi.C57BL/6 mice were infected i.p. with 102,103, 104 or 105 bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi. Parasitemia was followed daily from days 0 to 14 after challenge. The results represent the mean of 5–6 mice±SD. At the peak of infection, the parasitemia of mice infected with each different dose was compared by One-way Anova and Tukey HSD tests. The results of the comparisons were as follows: i) 102×103, Non-Significant (NS); ii) 102×104, P&lt;0.01; iii) 102×105, P&lt;0.01; iv) 103×104, P&lt;0.05; v) 103×105, NS; vi) 104×105, NS. Results are representative of two independent experiments.
