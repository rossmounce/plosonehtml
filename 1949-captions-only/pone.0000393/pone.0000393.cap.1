Parasitemia was followed daily from days 0 to 14 after challenge. The results represent the mean of 5–6 mice±SD. At the peak of infection, the parasitemia of mice infected with each different dose was compared by One-way Anova and Tukey HSD tests. The results of the comparisons were as follows: i) 10<sup>2</sup>×10<sup>3</sup>, Non-Significant (NS); ii) 10<sup>2</sup>×10<sup>4</sup>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01; iii) 10<sup>2</sup>×10<sup>5</sup>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01; iv) 10<sup>3</sup>×10<sup>4</sup>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; v) 10<sup>3</sup>×10<sup>5</sup>, NS; vi) 10<sup>4</sup>×10<sup>5</sup>, NS. Results are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
