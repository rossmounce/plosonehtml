Panels A to E - At the indicated days, the <em>in vivo</em> cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined as described in the Methods Section. The results represent the mean of 4 mice±SD per group. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences when we compared <em>T. cruzi</em> challenged with control mice (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05). Panel F- At the indicated days, IFN-γ producing spleen cells specific to the peptide VNHRFTLV were estimated by the ELISPOT assay. The results represent the mean number of peptide-specific spot forming cells (SFC) per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes±SD (n = 4). Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.</p>
