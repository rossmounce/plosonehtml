                Figure 3.  Kinetics of specific CD8+ T-cell mediated immune responses following challenge with T. cruzi.Groups of C57BL/6 mice were challenged or not i.p. with 102,103, 104 or 105 bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi. Panels A to E - At the indicated days, the in vivo cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined as described in the Methods Section. The results represent the mean of 4 mice±SD per group. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences when we compared T. cruzi challenged with control mice (P&lt;0.05). Panel F- At the indicated days, IFN-γ producing spleen cells specific to the peptide VNHRFTLV were estimated by the ELISPOT assay. The results represent the mean number of peptide-specific spot forming cells (SFC) per 106 splenocytes±SD (n = 4). Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.
