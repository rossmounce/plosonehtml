At the indicated days, the <em>in vivo</em> cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide TsKb-18 or TsKb-20 was determined as described in the Methods Section. The results represent the mean of 4 miceÂ±SD per group. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences when we compared <em>T. cruzi</em> challenged with control mice (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05). ND = Not done. Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.</p>
