                Figure 4.  Kinetics of CD8+ T-cell mediated immune responses specific for sub-dominant epitopes in C57BL/6 mice.Groups of C57BL/6 mice were challenged or not i.p. with 102,103, 104 or 105 bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi. At the indicated days, the in vivo cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide TsKb-18 or TsKb-20 was determined as described in the Methods Section. The results represent the mean of 4 miceÂ±SD per group. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences when we compared T. cruzi challenged with control mice (P&lt;0.05). ND = Not done. Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.
