A) Fifteen days after challenge, the <em>in vivo</em> cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined. The results represent the mean of 4 mice±SD per group. B) Fifteen days after challenge, IFN-γ producing spleen cells specific to the peptide VNHRFTLV were estimated by the ELISPOT assay. The results represent the mean number of SFC per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes±SD (n = 4). Asterisks denote statistically significant differences (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05) when we compared mice challenged with irradiated or non-irradiated trypomastigotes of <em>T. cruzi</em>. Results are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
