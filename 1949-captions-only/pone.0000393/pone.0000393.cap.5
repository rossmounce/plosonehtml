                Figure 5.  Specific cytotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice challenged with irradiated or non-irradiated trypomastigotes of T. cruzi.Groups of C57BL/6 mice were challenged or not i.p. with 103 or 104 irradiated or non-irradiated bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi. A) Fifteen days after challenge, the in vivo cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined. The results represent the mean of 4 mice±SD per group. B) Fifteen days after challenge, IFN-γ producing spleen cells specific to the peptide VNHRFTLV were estimated by the ELISPOT assay. The results represent the mean number of SFC per 106 splenocytes±SD (n = 4). Asterisks denote statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) when we compared mice challenged with irradiated or non-irradiated trypomastigotes of T. cruzi. Results are representative of two independent experiments.
