Ten days after challenge, the <em>in vivo</em> cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined. The results represent the mean of the above indicated number of mice±SD per group. The <em>in vivo</em> cytotoxicity was compared by One-way Anova and Tukey HSD tests. The results of the comparisons were as follows: i) WT C57BL/6×MHC-II KO (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01); ii) WT C57BL/6×Perforin KO (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01); iii) WT C57BL/6×CD4 KO (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01); iv) WT C57BL/6×IL-12 KO (NS); v) WT 129×IFN-I receptor KO (NS). Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.</p>
