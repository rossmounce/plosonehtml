                Figure 6.  Specific cytotoxicity in WT or genetically deficient mice challenged with T. cruzi.Groups of WT C57BL/6 (n = 4), WT 129 mice (n = 4), MHC-II KO (n = 4), perforin KO (n = 8), CD4 KO (n = 4), IL-12 KO (n = 4), and IFN-I receptor KO (n = 4) were challenged or not i.p. with 105 bloodstream trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi. Ten days after challenge, the in vivo cytotoxic activity against target cells coated with peptide VNHRFTLV was determined. The results represent the mean of the above indicated number of mice±SD per group. The in vivo cytotoxicity was compared by One-way Anova and Tukey HSD tests. The results of the comparisons were as follows: i) WT C57BL/6×MHC-II KO (P&lt;0.01); ii) WT C57BL/6×Perforin KO (P&lt;0.01); iii) WT C57BL/6×CD4 KO (P&lt;0.01); iv) WT C57BL/6×IL-12 KO (NS); v) WT 129×IFN-I receptor KO (NS). Results are representative of two or more independent experiments.
