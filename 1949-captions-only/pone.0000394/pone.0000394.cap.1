                Figure 1.  The basic parameters in the model.A: Multiagent computer simulation of the “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” mechanisms. Cells migrate and divide in the same way in the two models, and cell death is a function of the local cell density. The phenotypic switch of each cell is either dependent on the local cell density in the “extrinsic” (left) or a fixed probability in the “intrinsic” (right) model.” N” is the number of neighbours in the circle with a radius “R”; “pd” is the probability of division; p1 and p2 are the probabilities of the A and B type cells to change their phenotype in the “intrinsic” model; Nex is the threshold, given by the number of neighbours. B: Characteristics of the cell migration in the computer model and in vitro, as observed in the cultures of the C2C12 cell line. The trajectories of a single cell simulated in silico (left) and its in vitro counterpart (right, determined by video microscopy), are shown. C: The exponential distribution of the cumulative velocity magnitudes in the simulation (left) and in vitro, as determined experimentally (right).
