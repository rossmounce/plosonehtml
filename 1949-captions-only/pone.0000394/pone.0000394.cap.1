Cells migrate and divide in the same way in the two models, and cell death is a function of the local cell density. The phenotypic switch of each cell is either dependent on the local cell density in the “extrinsic” (left) or a fixed probability in the “intrinsic” (right) model.” N” is the number of neighbours in the circle with a radius “R”; “p<sub>d</sub>” is the probability of division; p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> are the probabilities of the A and B type cells to change their phenotype in the “intrinsic” model; N<sub>ex</sub> is the threshold, given by the number of neighbours. <strong>B</strong>: Characteristics of the cell migration in the computer model and <em>in vitro</em>, as observed in the cultures of the C2C12 cell line. The trajectories of a single cell simulated <em>in silico</em> (left) and its <em>in vitro</em> counterpart (right, determined by video microscopy), are shown. <strong>C</strong>: The exponential distribution of the cumulative velocity magnitudes in the simulation (left) and <em>in vitro</em>, as determined experimentally (right).</p>
