                Figure 2.  The “intrinsic” model.A: Results of the “intrinsic” model simulations for large values for pBtoA. Note corresponding increase in proportion of type A cells (in red) and their random distribution. B: Analysis of type A (left panel) and type B (right panel) cell distributions in the “intrinsic” model as a function of average migration velocity using the standardized nearest neighbour distance (w). If w = 1, the cells are randomly distributed. Small standardized nearest neighbour distances (w&lt;1) indicate clustering; this is only observed for B cells with very low average migration velocities (&lt;0.2). In these examples pAtoB = 0.7 and pBtoA = 0.02, but similar results were obtained for other values of p.
