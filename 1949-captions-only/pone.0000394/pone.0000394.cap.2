Note corresponding increase in proportion of type A cells (in red) and their random distribution. <strong>B</strong>: Analysis of type A (left panel) and type B (right panel) cell distributions in the “intrinsic” model as a function of average migration velocity using the standardized nearest neighbour distance (<em>w</em>). If <em>w</em> = 1, the cells are randomly distributed. Small standardized nearest neighbour distances (<em>w</em>&lt;1) indicate clustering; this is only observed for B cells with very low average migration velocities (&lt;0.2). In these examples p<sub>AtoB</sub> = 0.7 and p<sub>BtoA</sub> = 0.02, but similar results were obtained for other values of p.</p>
