                Figure 4.  The “extrinsic” model.A: Simulations with the “extrinsic” model using increasing values of Nex. Note the increasing proportion and clustering of type A (red) cells with increasing Nex. In all simulations Nmax death = 40 was used. B: Analysis of type A cell distribution as a function of average migration velocity and varying Nex using the standardized nearest neighbour distance. Type A cells were clustered (w&lt;1) at all but small average velocity values at all Nex values analysed.
