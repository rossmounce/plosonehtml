                Figure 5.  Localization of the SP cells in the growing population of C2C12 cells.A: The SP cells were identified on the basis of their capacity to exclude the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. Four representative images (a, b, c and d) are shown from regions with different cell densities. The nuclei are shown in false color (red for SP cells and green for MP cells). B: The frequency distribution of the number of neighbours is significantly different for SP and MP cells (upper and lower panel). The average number of neighbours is shown on the left side of each panel. Note the bimodal distribution for SP cells. The number of neighbours for each cell in a circle of R = 15 Âµm was calculated on the basis of the digitalized images. The two distributions were found to be significantly different (p&lt;0.001) as analysed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test. C: Analysis of the spatial randomness of SP cell distribution using Ripley's L statistics of the four images shown in Fig. 5A. The red lines indicate the L-functions for the SP cells over a range of r = 100. The black lines show the upper and lower limits of the envelope functions for the images analysed. The c and d patterns are significantly different from a random pattern, because the values of the observed L-function are larger than the upper envelope function while the two other L-functions (panels a and b) indicate homogeneously distributed SP cells on the corresponding images.
