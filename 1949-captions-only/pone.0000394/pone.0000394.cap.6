The phenotypic switch of each cell is dependent on the local cell density as in the “extrinsic” model, but the cells encountering a favourable microenvironment undergo phenotypic change with probabilities p<sub>AtoB</sub> and p<sub>BtoA</sub>. B: Results of a typical simulation of the “hybrid” model during the growth phase and at equilibrium. Note the simultaneous presence of small clusters and dispersed single type A cells. p<sub>AtoB</sub> = 0.7 and p<sub>BtoA</sub> = 0.4. C: The distribution of the number of neighbours around the A and B cells (left and right respectively) in the hybrid model. The average number of neighbours and the standard deviation are indicated for each panel. Note the more dispersed distribution of type A cell neighbours. D: Analysis of the spatial distribution randomness of SP and MP cells using Ripley's L statistics. The upper panel shows the type A cell L-function (red line) with values larger than 0 and outside the range defined by the upper-and lower-envelope functions (black line) (this indicates significant clustering of type A cells at small R distances). The type B cells (green line) are randomly distributed, because the L(h) values are close to 0 at all scales (R).</p>
