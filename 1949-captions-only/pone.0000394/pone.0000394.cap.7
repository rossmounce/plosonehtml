                Figure 7.  Clonal population derived from a human primary myoblast.A: The cells were fixed and immunostained with an anti-desmin antibody. A series of 55 pictures were obtained and compiled into a single picture showing the whole population. The variation in the intensity of desmin immunostain is higher at the periphery of the growing population. The left panel shows 4 high resolution images of different parts of the population pointed by the blue arrows. B: Colour coded image of the same population as on the A panel. The colour code is based on the intensity of the pixels (red: low, green: high intensity). On the left are shown 2 high resolution images with the same color code. In the upper left, a region of interest is indicated in white with the corresponding pixel histogram shown beneath. Two additional histograms show the pixel intensities of two regions of interest: high-(green) and a low-desmin expressing cells (red). Note that the low desmin expressing cells are more frequent at the periphery of the culture.
