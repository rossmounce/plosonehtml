(A) A large amount of IGs appear in precipitates purified from the trophocytes. Scale bar, 1 Âµm. (B) Purified IGs enclosed with lipid-bilayer membranes (arrowhead). Scale bar, 100 nm. (C) EDX spectrum is obtained from an IG in the purified precipitates. Iron (Fe), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) are present in an IG. STEM mode of 100-kV accelerating voltage was used; counts were made for 100 seconds. (D) EDX spectrum of spurr's resin is devoid of IGs in the purified precipitates. The experimental conditions are the same as in C. (E) Size distribution of purified IGs calculated from the TEM pictures (N = 274). N, total number of granules used in this calculation.</p>
