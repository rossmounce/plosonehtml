(A) MGs (arrowhead) appear as tiny black particles under low magnification in the live trophocytes. Arrow indicates oil body. Scale bar, 8 µm. (B) MGs (arrowhead) appear as black granules under high magnification in the live trophocytes. The images of MGs are obtained without the application of 1 Gauss magnetic field. Arrow indicates oil body. Inset shows a magnified MG. Scale bar, 1 µm. (C) The same images obtained by the application of 1 Gauss magnetic field in the live trophocytes. White arrow indicates the direction of magnetic field. Arrowhead indicates MGs. Arrow indicates oil body. Inset shows a magnified MG. Scale bar, 1 µm. (D) MGs (arrowhead) appear as tiny black particles under low magnification in the dead trophocytes. Scale bar, 8 µm. (E) MGs (arrowhead) appear as black granules under high magnification in the dead trophocytes. The images of MGs are obtained without the application of 1 Gauss magnetic field. Inset shows a magnified MG. Scale bar, 1 µm. (F) The same images obtained by the application of 1 Gauss magnetic field in the dead trophocytes. Arrowhead indicates MGs. White arrow indicates the direction of magnetic field. Inset shows a magnified MG. Scale bar, 1 µm.</p>
