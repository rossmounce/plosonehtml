(A) Temperature dependence of the resonance linewidth of the HF. The solid line is the best fit of the HF data according to Eq. 1, with Δ<em>H</em><sup>0</sup> = 1791±37 Oe and Δ<em>E</em>/2<em>k</em><sub>B</sub> = 50.8±2.6 K. (B) Temperature dependence of the resonance field of HF and LF. Note that the HF and LF curves are almost parallel to each other, with the field shifting by an average value of about 2496±50 Oe. (C) Anisotropy fields calculated from the resonant field's values, using Eq. 2 for the HF lines.</p>
