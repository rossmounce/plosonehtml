                Figure 6. The resonance linewidth and anisotropy fields of the broad resonance lines (HF) of purified IGs. (A) Temperature dependence of the resonance linewidth of the HF. The solid line is the best fit of the HF data according to Eq. 1, with ΔH0 = 1791±37 Oe and ΔE/2kB = 50.8±2.6 K. (B) Temperature dependence of the resonance field of HF and LF. Note that the HF and LF curves are almost parallel to each other, with the field shifting by an average value of about 2496±50 Oe. (C) Anisotropy fields calculated from the resonant field's values, using Eq. 2 for the HF lines.
