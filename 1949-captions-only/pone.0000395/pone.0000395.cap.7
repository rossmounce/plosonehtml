(A) When honeybees fly in the direction paralleled to external magnetic field, MG expands due to the repellent force of SM. When honeybees fly in the perpendicular direction to external magnetic field, MG contracts in the same direction due to the attractive force of SM. (B) The direction of magnetic field of SM is parallel to the direction of Earth's magnetic field at flower 1. SM would be in a side-by-side position, creating repulsion and subsequent expansion of the MGs. At the flower 3, the direction of magnetic field of SM is vertical to the direction of Earth's magnetic field. SM would be positioned end-to-end, creating attraction and subsequent contraction of the MGs. This contraction induces the tensing of cytoskeletons and triggers the increase of [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]i in trophocytes. At flower 2, the relaxing and tensing of cytoskeletons is a mixture of flower 1 and flower 3. The direction of magnetic field of SM at the flower 1 is the same as flower 5. Flower 2 is the same as flower 6, and so on. The distinction in both cases is dependent on the direction of waggle dance.</p>
