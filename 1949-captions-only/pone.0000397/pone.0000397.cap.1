Each monkey is identified by the color of the circle on his head (green, M1; red, M2). On each trial, we placed a food item at one of four locations in position A and one of three locations in position B and C, indicated by circles on the table. Each circle on the table is a pie chart that depicts each monkey's success ratio for food retrieval in that table location. D. Recording tracks are indicated by blue dots on the brain. The size of each circle centered on the track indicates the number of MR neurons recorded from the track. Green dots indicate the locations of lesion markers for reconstruction.</p>
