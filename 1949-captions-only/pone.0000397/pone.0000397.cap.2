Rows A and B indicate, respectively, the neuronal responses of M1's and M2's MR neurons. The asterisks indicate the monkey from which we recorded activity. Results are separately presented for each relative position. The identification of each monkey is the same as in <a href="#pone-0000397-g001">Figure 1</a>. The size of a hand that corresponds to 20% is shown at lower right.</p>
