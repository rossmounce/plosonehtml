                Figure 2.  Schematic depiction of the proportion of MR neurons in positions Aâ€“C.The size of each hand indicates the percentage of parietal MR neurons that responded to corresponding arm movements. Rows A and B indicate, respectively, the neuronal responses of M1's and M2's MR neurons. The asterisks indicate the monkey from which we recorded activity. Results are separately presented for each relative position. The identification of each monkey is the same as in Figure 1. The size of a hand that corresponds to 20% is shown at lower right.
