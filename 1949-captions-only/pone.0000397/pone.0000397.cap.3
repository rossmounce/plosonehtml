                Figure 3.  Normalized firing ratio of MR neurons in positions Aâ€“C.Bars represent the averaged normalized neural firing rates for four motion factors in three positions. Top (green) represents averaged normalized firing ratio of 33 of M1's MR neurons, and bottom (red) represents 58 of M2's. Error bars indicate standard error.
