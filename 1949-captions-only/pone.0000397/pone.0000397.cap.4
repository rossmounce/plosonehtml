                Figure 4.  Associations between categories of MR neurons described by four motion factors and categories described by Actor/Action Indices.Using four motion factors, MR neurons were categorized into sixteen groups (of which only fifteen are shown here). Response combinations of the categories are shown in the top table. Numbers shown in the top table indicate group numbers. Each row represents a single motion factor. Grey dots indicate that the group showed positive response to the corresponding motion factor. One group out of the original sixteen that did not show any response has been omitted. The bottom table indicates how Actor/Action Indices describe the fifteen groups above. Each dot's color represents Actor/Action Indices (“Self”, red; “Other”, blue; “Left”, orange; “Right”, purple; and “nsp”, green). For instance, group four only responded to self-right motion, so the Actor and Action Indices of the group were “Self” (red) and “Right” (purple) respectively.
