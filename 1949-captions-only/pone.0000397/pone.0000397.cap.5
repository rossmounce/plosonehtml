                Figure 5.  Proportion of MR neurons classified by Actor and Action Indices in positions A–C.M1's and M2's MR neurons (Rows A and B, respectively) were classified into nine groups using the Actor Index and Action Index. Each bar represents the proportions of the corresponding indices. Columns represent positions A–C. Proportions were calculated relative to the total number (shown on top of each graph) of MR neurons in each position. Bars in red indicate statistically significant modulation of that group of neurons in that position compared with the activity of the same group of neurons in position A.
