                Figure 6.  Schematic top views of relative positions and reachable space in positions A, A1 and A2.In all three positions the monkeys were seated at opposite ends of the table. M1 and M2 are discriminated by colored circles (M1, green; M2, red) shown on each head. Each monkey's reachable space is shown on the table by a color-filled curve. Hence, the green area indicates M1's reachable space and the red area indicates that of M2. In position A1, both monkeys were given rake tools; in position A2, only M2 used a rake.
