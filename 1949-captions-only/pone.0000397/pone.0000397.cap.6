M1 and M2 are discriminated by colored circles (M1, green; M2, red) shown on each head. Each monkey's reachable space is shown on the table by a color-filled curve. Hence, the green area indicates M1's reachable space and the red area indicates that of M2. In position A1, both monkeys were given rake tools; in position A2, only M2 used a rake.</p>
