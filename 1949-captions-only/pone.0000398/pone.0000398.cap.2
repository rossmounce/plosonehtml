(A) <em>bmp4</em> is expressed in the non-chamber myocardium of the heart, the OFT, the AVC and the IFT. (B, C, D) The expression pattern of <em>bmp4</em> is normal in 42 hpf <em>tbx3b</em>, <em>tbx2a</em> and double morphants. (E) <em>notch1b</em> is expressed in the whole endocardium of the heart tube, but becomes restricted to the endocardium at the level of the OFT and AVC upon looping. (F, G, H) Expression of <em>notch1b</em> is maintained in the endocardium at the level of the chamber myocardium in 48 hpf <em>tbx3b</em>, <em>tbx2a</em> and double morphants, in contrast to wild type. (I) <em>bmp10</em> is expressed exclusively in chamber myocardium at 42 hpf (J, L, M) In 42 hpf <em>tbx3b</em> and <em>tbx2a</em> morphants <em>bmp10</em> is expressed in the chamber myocardium and is downregulated in the AVC, as is the case in wild type, but it is not downregulated from the AVC in double morphants. Red arrow indicates the AVC. a, atrium; h, heart; v, ventricle.</p>
