                Figure 3.  Heart morphology in embryos overexpressing Tbx3 and Tbx2.Side views (A–C) and ventral views (D–F) of wild type embryos (A, D) and embryos injected with 100 pg capped mRNA for mouse Tbx3 (B, E) or human TBX2 (C, F). (A, B, C) mlc2a::GFP embryos at 60 hpf; (D, E, F) 48 hpf. (B, C) 44.5% of Tbx3-injected embryos and 60% of Tbx2-injected embryos present a pipe-like heart that lacks chamber growth and looping. (D, E, F) Zebrafish bmp10 is strongly expressed in the chamber myocardium in wild type embryos, but is significantly downregulated from the heart in Tbx3- or Tbx2-injected embryos. a, atrium; v, ventricle.
