(C, D) At E10.5, the most affected <em>Tbx3</em> mutant embryos display obvious heart defects, including lack of the constriction in the AVC and absence of looping in a swollen pericardiac cavity (D), compared to wild type (C). (E, F) E11.5 <em>Tbx3</em> null homozygous embryos present a significant delay in heart looping and pericardiac swelling compared to wild type. (G–O) Whole mount <em>in situ</em> hybridization analysis at E9.5; ventral views (G, H) and lateral views (I–O). (G, H) Upon looping initiation, <em>Bmp10</em> starts to be expressed in the chamber myocardium. However, <em>Bmp10</em> was ectopically expressed in the non-chamber myocardium of the heart of <em>Tbx3</em> mutant embryos (arrow in G, H). (I, J) <em>Bmp2</em> is expressed in the AVC myocardium at E9.5 and was not altered in <em>Tbx3</em> mutant embryos. (L, M) <em>TGF</em>β<em>2</em> is normally expressed in the non-chamber myocardium of the looping heart. In <em>Tbx3</em> mutant embryos, expression of <em>TGF</em>β<em>2</em> is downregulated in the heart. (N, O) <em>Smad6</em> is expressed in the endocardium at the level of the OFT and AVC at E9,5. However, in <em>Tbx3</em> mutant embryos, expression of <em>Smad6</em> is absent. (P) Consecutive NKE and TBE binding sites are found in the human <em>BMP10</em> promoter, between 9800 and 10100 bp upstream the ATG codon. a, atrium; lv, left ventricle; o, outflow tract; pc, pericardiac cavity; rv, right ventricle; sa, sinoatrial region.</p>
