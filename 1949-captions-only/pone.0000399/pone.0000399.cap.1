A) Diagram of the CpG island promoter (GenBank accession no. X58075, nucleotide position 108–520 bp) associated with the full length LINE-1. Each vertical line represents a single CpG site. The 3′UTR, 5′UTR and two ORFs of LINE-1 are shown at the top. Arrows indicate the location of primers used for bisulfite PCR (R-biot and F) and pyrosequencing (S). B) Representative LINE-1 pyrograms for normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and breast cancer cell lines (MB-468 and SKBR3). The pyrogram quantitates C for methylated and T for unmethylated DNA. The shaded region represents the CpG site quantitated in LINE-1 elements, and the percent methylation is shown above the peak.</p>
