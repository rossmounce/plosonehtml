A) Colorectal tumor DNA and their normal appearing adjacent mucosa from sixty patients were evaluated for LINE-1 methylation. These tumors were previously evaluated for CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), using a panel of single-copy genes methylation analysis, and microsatellite instability (MSI) status, resulting in the identification of three CIMP/MSI groups. In normal appearing mucosa (top) little variation in LINE-1 methylation is observed between samples and CIMP/MSI groups (average methylation = 64.3%), while in tumor (bottom) several samples undergo high LINE-1 demethylation (25/60 tumor samples have methylation density bellow 55%), most notable in CIMP+/MSI-and CIMP-/MSI-groups. B) Relative LINE-1 demethylation in CRCs. Relative demethylation was calculated as the percent change of LINE-1 methylation in tumor compared to its normal appearing mucosa. Both CIMP+/MSI-and CIMP-/MSI-samples presented in average 16% demethylation for LINE-1, while no significant changes were observed for the CIMP+/MSI+samples. For the CIMP+group, 4â€“9% increase of methylation density for LINE-1 was observed for a small fraction of samples, most of them identified as CIMP+/MSI+samples.</p>
