                Figure 1.  Abp1 knock down selectively results in increased axon length.(A–D) Primary hippocampal neurons transfected with pRNAT-GFP (control; A), with a pRNAT-driven Abp1 RNAi construct (sequence #1; B), and with GFP-N-WASP CA (Arp2/3 complex inhibition; C), respectively, at day 2 in culture. The cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy at day 3. Quantitative evaluations (D) show that neurons (as evidenced by MAP2 staining) expressing the pRNAT-driven Abp1 RNAi sequences #1 and #2 both show highly significantly (p&lt;0.001, ***) elongated axons when compared to controls (transfection with pRNAT, pEGFP and nonsilencing RNAi) and to cells in rescue experiments, in which Abp1 RNAi and an RNAi-insensitive Abp1 construct were cotransfected. Effects almost identical to those caused by Abp1 RNAi were observed when Arp2/3 complex functions were impaired by overexpression of GFP-N-WASP CA (C, D) and Arp3 RNAi (D), respectively. Morphological data were normalized to pRNAT-control and are represented as mean (in percent)±SEM. Bar = 10 µm.
