                Figure 2.  Full-length Abp1 and its SH3 domain alone both stimulate actin polymerization in vitro.GST-fusion proteins attached to glutathione sepharose 4B beads were incubated with high speed supernatants of brain extracts supplemented with an energy regenerating mix and Alexa Fluor® 568 G-actin. Actin polymerization is detected on the surface of beads coated with N-WASP PWA (A), full-length Abp1 (B, C) and the Abp1 SH3 domain (D). No polymerization was observed when the beads were coated with a mutated version of the Abp1 SH3 domain (E). Left panels (A–E), actin fluorescence of Alexa Fluor® 568 G-actin; right panels (A′–E′), phase contrast. Bars (A and D) = 10 µm; bars (B, C and E) = 25 µm.
