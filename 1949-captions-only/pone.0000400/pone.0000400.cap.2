Actin polymerization is detected on the surface of beads coated with N-WASP PWA (A), full-length Abp1 (B, C) and the Abp1 SH3 domain (D). No polymerization was observed when the beads were coated with a mutated version of the Abp1 SH3 domain (E). Left panels (A–E), actin fluorescence of Alexa Fluor® 568 G-actin; right panels (A′–E′), phase contrast. Bars (A and D) = 10 µm; bars (B, C and E) = 25 µm.</p>
