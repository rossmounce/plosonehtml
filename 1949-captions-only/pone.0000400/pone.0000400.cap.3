(A–D, I–L) and 21 d.i.v. (E–H, M–P) primary hippocampal neurons were immunostained with anti-Abp1 antibodies (B, F, J, N), anti-Arp3 antibodies (C, G), anti-N-WASP antibodies (K, O) and phalloidin, to visualize F-actin (A, E, I, M). Labelling of images reflects the color of the fluorescence signal in the merged images (D, H, L, P; colocalization appears white). Colocalization at growth cones from young neurons (D, L) and at sites within the periphery of the neuronal network from mature neurons that may represent synaptic contacts (H, P) are magnified and marked with arrows. In mature neurons, Abp1 (F, N), N-WASP (O), as well as the Arp2/3 complex (G) were additionally observed to colocalize at actin-rich structures (E, M) of the cell body and dendritic shafts, as marked by arrowheads in the magnified insets. Bars = 25 µm.</p>
