                Figure 4.  Abp1 interacts specifically and directly with N-WASP and such Abp1/N-WASP complexes exist in vivo.(A) Comparison of the domain structure of yeast Abp1p (yAbp1p) and mouse Abp1 (mAbp1/SH3P7) proteins. (B) Schematic representation of the mouse Abp1 fragments used throughout this study. (C) Immobilized GST-Abp1 SH3 domain is required and sufficient to affinity purify endogenous N-WASP from rat brain cytosol. (D) Blot overlay analyses. 1.5 µg affinity-purified Flag-tagged full-length N-WASP blotted to nitrocellulose membranes was directly bound by GST-Abp1 SH3 but not by GST probes (left panel). N-WASP was additionally visualized by anti-Flag immunostaining (right panel). (E) Schematic representation of the N-WASP fragments used throughout this study. (F) Affinity purifications of overexpressed GFP-tagged N-WASP and fragments thereof with immobilized GST-Abp1 SH3 domain reveal that Abp1 associates with N-WASP fusion proteins containing the PRD. (G) Endogenous N-WASP was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Abp1. An equal amount of brain extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with unrelated rabbit IgGs as a control. (H–P) HA-N-WASP (I) was corecruited by the Mito-GFP-Abp1 SH3 domain (H) to mitochondria. (K-P) Mitochondrially targeted N-WASP recruits Abp1 in an SH3 domain-dependent manner. Upon coexpression of Mito-GFP-N-WASP (L, O), wild type Abp1 C-terminus (flex/SH3) adopted a mitochondrial localization (K) whereas its mutated version flex/SH3mut was distributed diffusely (N) and did not colocalize with mitochondria enriched for N-WASP (O). Labelling of images reflects the color of the fluorescence signal in the merged images (J, M and P; colocalization appears yellow). Bars = 15 µm.
