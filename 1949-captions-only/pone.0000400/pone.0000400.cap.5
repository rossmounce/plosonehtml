(B–D) In vitro reconstitutions of actin nucleation and polymerization were analyzed by the fluorescence increase of pyrene-labeled actin. Fluorescence intensities were plotted against time. The results shown are representative of three different experiments. Polymerization induced by Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP WA (80 nM) are shown for comparison. (B) Dose-response effect of the Abp1 SH3 domain. N-WASP/Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization was examined in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the Abp1 SH3 domain (actin, 2 mM; pyrene-actin, 0,2 mM; Arp2/3 complex, 10 nM and Flag-tagged N-WASP, 80 nM). The Abp1 SH3 domain (200 nM) does not activate actin polymerization in absence of N-WASP. (C) Without the Arp2/3 complex activator N-WASP, full-length Abp1 (150 nM GST-Abp1) is unable to functionally interface with the Arp2/3 complex and actin kinetics are indistinguishable from that of 2 mM actin plus 10 nM Arp2/3 complex and actin plus Arp2/3 complex plus 150 nM GST, respectively. (D) Addition of GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 resulted in a partial activation of N-WASP. GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 (400 nM) acts in concert with the Abp1 SH3 domain (50 nM) in activating N-WASP.</p>
