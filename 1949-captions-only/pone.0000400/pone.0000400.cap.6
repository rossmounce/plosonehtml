Labelling of individual panels is in the color of the respective signal in the merged images (D, H, M, N). Cooverexpression of Mito-GFP-N-WASP (E) together with dominant negative Cdc42 (Cdc42 N17) (F) caused a reduction in this mitochondrial F-actin association (G). Flag-tagged Abp1 flex/SH3 (J), cooverexpressed in addition to Mito-GFP-N-WASP (I) and Cdc42 N17 (K), restored and even increased the number of transfected cells that presented F-actin (L) on mitochondria. M corresponds to a merge of I and L. N shows I, J and L merged. (O) Quantification of the amount of cells with actin polymerized on mitochondria. Data are represented as mean±SEM (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01). Bars = 10 µm.</p>
