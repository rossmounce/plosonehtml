The number and branching of MAP2-immunopositive neurites (B, D, F, H, J) are markedly increased upon N-WASP overexpression, as also evident from quantitative analyses (K). This N-WASP effect was completely suppressed by Cdc42 N17 coexpression and reduction of Abp1 levels, respectively (K). Data are represented as mean±SEM (***, p&lt;0.001). Bars = 10 µm.</p>
