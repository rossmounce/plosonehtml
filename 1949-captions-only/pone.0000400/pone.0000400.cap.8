                Figure 8.  N-WASP mutants deficient for Abp1 or Cdc42 binding and N-WASP RNAi cause increased axon lengths.Primary hippocampal neurons overexpressing GFP-N-WASP PWA (A) and GFP-N-WASP ?PRD (B) show significantly (***, p&lt;0.001) elongated axons when compared to control neurons expressing GFP alone (C). Similarly, N-WASP RNAi (D) leads to elongated axons in comparison to control. E, quantitative evaluations of axon length. Data were normalized to control and are represented as mean (in percent)±SEM. Bar = 10 µm.
