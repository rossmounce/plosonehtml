                Figure 3.  Epidemic severity vs. intervention policy.The speed and severity of an epidemic can be reduced by implementation of travel restriction and vaccination policies.

(A) Worldwide daily number of infected individuals. (B) Worldwide cumulative number of influenza cases. (C) U.S. daily number of infected individuals. (D) U.S. cumulative number of influenza cases.
