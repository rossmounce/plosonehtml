                Figure 4.  Interaction between disease seasonality and travel restriction.The timing of an outbreak can greatly influence the effects of international travel restrictions on the severity of the epidemic in a region such as the United States. Results are shown for epidemics with R0 = 1.7 beginning in Hong Kong on either January 1 or July 1. For an epidemic beginning in January, the initial epidemic wave in the United States is suppressed, although without other interventions, the second epidemic wave would be more severe. It is thus important to implement additional measures during the time gained. For an epidemic beginning in July, the delay in the epidemic is much smaller, but the overall severity is reduced.

(red: January 1 epidemic start in Hong Kong with no intervention, blue: January 1 start in Hong Kong with sequential 95% restriction of international travel, green: July 1 epidemic start in Hong Kong with no intervention, orange: July 1 start in Hong Kong with sequential 95% restriction of international travel)
