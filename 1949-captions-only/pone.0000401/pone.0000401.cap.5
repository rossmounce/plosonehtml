                Figure 5.  Potential synchronization of local epidemics depending on the rate of disease transmission.Screenshots showing that with higher values of R0, individual cities' epidemic peaks are more clustered in time and the number of infected persons is much higher. (A) Time series diagram for major metropolitan areas for an uncontrolled influenza epidemic with R0 = 1.4. (B) Time series diagram for an epidemic with R0 = 2.0.
