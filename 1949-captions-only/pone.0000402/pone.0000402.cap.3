                Figure 3. The result of cluster-analyses (PAHC) of vegetation data and demographic data of Alluaudia procera from plots 20Ã—20 m in regenerating (n = 5) and dense mature forests (n = 4) in northern central Androy. The distance is based on average group linkages. Variables included in the model: height, diameter, proportion of juveniles (&lt;2 m) of Alluaudia procera and abundance estimates of woody species&gt;1 m height. The analysis was used for validation of the forest classification in the Landsat images.
