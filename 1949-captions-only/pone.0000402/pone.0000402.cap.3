The distance is based on average group linkages. Variables included in the model: height, diameter, proportion of juveniles (&lt;2 m) of <em>Alluaudia procera</em> and abundance estimates of woody species&gt;1 m height. The analysis was used for validation of the forest classification in the Landsat images.</p>
