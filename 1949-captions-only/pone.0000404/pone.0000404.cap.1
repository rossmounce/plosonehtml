                Figure 1.  Neural population activities obtained from hippocampal recordings and simulated cortical responses to face presentation/arm movement.A) Neural population responses to a 30 cm drop are indicated by spike rasters of 250 simultaneously recorded CA1 hippocampal neurons starting from 2 s before and ending 8 seconds after the startle event, indicated by the vertical red line. B) Average frequency changes during the startle events indicate the existence of non-responsive neurons (48%) as well as neurons that respond to all startle (1–23), 3 types only (24–46), 2 types (47–85) or only to a single type of events (86–135) (the maximum change is normalized to be 1). The caricature images displayed on the top of the colormap correspond to each startle type: sound, air blow, drop and shake. C) Average responses of simulated neural responses to presentation of four human faces (famous face #1 Halle Berry, famous face #2 Einstein, non-famous face #3-female, non-famous face # 4–male). Out of a total of 250 neurons, we choose 50 to be responsive to all four faces, 20 to famous faces, 20 to the two female faces and 20 to the next two male faces. Finally, four populations of 10 neurons are assumed to respond to each individual face, with the rest of the 100 neurons being unresponsive. D) Simulated motor cortex population responses to arm movements at different angles θЄ{45°, 90°, 135°, 270°}; the stimulation angles are indicated by the green, blue, magenta and cyan arrows on top of the colormap. For ease of visualization neurons were sorted along the vertical axis by their tuning width, with 55 neurons responding to all faces, 40 and 30 units being more and less broadly tuned, respectively, and 25 units being very sharply tuned around their responsive angle, while the remaining 100 units are unresponsive.
