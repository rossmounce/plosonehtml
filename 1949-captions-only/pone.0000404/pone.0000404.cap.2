The probability distributions that best fit the selected points are too tight and introduces classification errors (red stars, for the green class). B) The probability distributions corresponding to the regularized covariance matrices yield better generalization and allow all data points to be classified classified correctly. The new 2σ boundaries are plotted in black for each class. Minimization of quantity F = log(E1)+log(E2)+log(E3), the log of error terms for self, opposite class and between-class separations, permits the selection of regularization parameters at the minimum for C) blue class at λ = 0.76 and for D) green class at λ = 0.52.</p>
