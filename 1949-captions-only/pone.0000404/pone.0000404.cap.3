                Figure 3.  Class membership evaluation for a three-category example.A) Two-dimensional example illustrates the assignment to the closest cluster for a three-class membership (blue, green and red). We used the regularized covariance matrices to generate the 2σ boundaries for the under-sampled data points. B) The errors, or generalized distances away from the center of the blue cluster are plotted for all data points. Note that the blue points are characterized by low distances with a small standard deviation, in contrast to the green or blue points. The other error plots are similar in nature. C) Evaluation functions for determining the first class assignment. Data points with small and large errors are deemed to belong to the blue or other classes, respectively. D) Color plots indicating the distribution of probabilities throughout a region containing all data points. Each shade in the color gradation indicates an increase/decrease in probability above the chance levels (grey shade represents equal low probability for all three classes). The colors of the original data points and the original 2σ boundaries have been changed to increase their visibility.
