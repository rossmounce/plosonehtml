The order of best performers is MDA&gt;PCA&gt;ANN&gt;MGD. B) The accuracy of classification for face perception data set is plotted against the magnitude of the noise term. The relative ordering in test performances (MDA&gt;PCA&gt;ANN&gt;MGD) is generally maintained among the different statistical methods with the exception of MGD which outperforms ANN at low noise levels. C) Results on the arm movement simulated data sets display similar trends to the face perception data set. D) Performances of all methods increase towards their asymptotical values as the number of sampled face perception training data points become larger. This increase of the training data set benefits most the lower performers, MGD and ANN, although their maximum performances do not reach the larger levels of PCA and MDA.</p>
