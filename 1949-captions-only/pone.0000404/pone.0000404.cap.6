Second MDA dimension separates perception of female faces 1 (green, circles) and 3 (magenta, stars) from the male faces 2 (blue, triangles) and 4 (cyan, diamonds). B) Third MDA dimension separates famous faces 1 and 2 from faces 3 and 4. Fourth MDA dimension further increase the separation between classes 1 and 2 and between 3 and 4. C) Average weighting factors for MDA, with dimension number represented on the horizontal axis and with type of neurons represented on the vertical axis, starting from neurons responsive to all faces (line 1), to famous faces (line 2), to female faces 1 and 3 (line 3), male faces 2 and 4 (line 4), 1 only (line 5), 2 only (line 6), 3 only (line 7) and 4 only (line 8), and to non-response neurons (line 9) indicate that discriminating dimensions reflect the hierarchical structure used to generate the data. D) Individual weighting factors are also reflective of the different discriminating procedures implemented by these dimensions (general 1–50, famous 51–70, male 71–90, female 91–110, first face 111–121, second face 121–130, third face 131–140, fourth face 141–150, non-responsive neurons 151–250).</p>
