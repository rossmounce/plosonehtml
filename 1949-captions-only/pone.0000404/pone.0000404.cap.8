                Figure 8.  Hierarchical and categorical structure in the populations of neurons encoding:A) Episodic events, B) Face perception, and C) Arm movement. The neurons at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid represent a common encoding block with broad tuning properties, responding to the most general and abstract features. The next layers of encoding neurons respond to sub-general, yet still multi-feature, properties of the episodic/perception/movement events. The neurons at the top encode the most specific features, allowing for the highly specific discrimination of a particular event, face, or movement direction.
