                Figure 4. Association between post-oviposition burdens of the Coxiella sp., as estimated by fusA/MIF gene ratios, and reproductive fitness, as estimated by the ratio of viable larvae to non-viable larvae and unhatched eggs, in female A. americanum after injection of PBS (blue X) or rifampin (red circle). The ratios have been log-transformed. The blue and red ellipses correspond to bivariate standard deviations of the means of the x and y variables for each treatment group, respectively.
