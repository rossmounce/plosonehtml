Each gene has nine exons (illustrated for <em>KIR3DL1</em>) and is roughly 10–16 kb in length, with short and equally homologous intergenic sequences of about 2 kb separating each pair of genes. The organisation of the exon-intron structure of the different <em>KIR</em> genes is fairly consistent with the following basic arrangement: the signal sequence is encoded by the first two exons (in grey), each Ig domain (D0, D1, D2) corresponds to a single exon (exons 3–5, respectively, in blue), the linker (in yellow) and transmembrane (in white) regions are each encoded by a single exon (exons 6 and 7, respectively), and the cytoplasmic domain is encoded by two final exons (8 and 9, in red). Two systems have been generated for naming <em>KIR</em> genes. The first follows the CD nomenclature system as CD158a, CD158b, etc., based on an approximate centromerictelomeric order of the genes on chromosome 19 <a href="#pone.0000406-Andre1">[58]</a>. As the CD nomenclature is not used routinely since it does not reflect structure, function, expression or localization, the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature will be used throughout this report (<a href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/kir.html">www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefami​ly/kir.html</a>). The HUGO nomenclature system, accounts for KIR protein structure and consists of four major subdivisions based on two features: the number of extracellular Ig domains (2D or 3D) and the length of the cytoplasmic tail (L: long or S: short). This latter information determines their functions: inhibitory (L) or activating (S). The boxes in bold indicate the activating <em>KIR</em> genes, and the dotted boxes correspond to the pseudogenes. The two boundary genes of the <em>KIR</em> cluster, <em>KIR3DL3</em> and <em>KIR3DL2,</em> and the centrally situated <em>KIR3DP1</em> pseudogene and <em>KIR2DL4</em> are present in almost all individuals and are therefore considered to be framework (or anchor) genes (shown in white) <a href="#pone.0000406-Parham1">[59]</a>. <em>KIR3DL3</em> and <em>KIR3DP1</em> delimit the centromeric part of the <em>KIR</em> locus, whereas <em>KIR2DL4</em> and <em>KIR3DL2</em> delimit the telomeric part. A 14 kb stretch of unique sequence separating <em>KIR3DP1</em> from <em>KIR2DL4</em> is the preferred site for reciprocal recombination, a mechanism resulting in the formation of new haplotypes by the reassortment of centromeric and telomeric genes. Apart from these framework genes, <em>KIR</em> gene content is highly variable in terms of both the number and type of genes present. Although initially considered to be separate genes, <em>KIR2DL2</em> and <em>KIR2DL3</em> segregate as alleles of the same locus. Similarly, <em>KIR3DS1</em> segregates as an allele of the inhibitory <em>KIR3DL1</em>. Overall, there are nine variable genes—<em>KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2/2DL3, KIR2DL1, KIR3DS1/3DL1, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3, KIR2DS5, KIR2DS1, KIR2DS4</em>—and one variable pseudogene (<em>KIR2DP1</em>). <em>KIR2DL5</em> <em>KIR2DS3</em> and <em>KIR2DS5</em> may be found in both parts of the locus. We decided to represent these genes in the telomeric part of the cluster in this figure. Two major <em>KIR</em> haplotype groups, A and B, are classically described. The A haplotype is defined as containing the <em>KIR3DL3, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1, KIR2DS4</em> and <em>KIR3DL2</em> genes. <em>KIR</em> gene polymorphism adds further diversity to the <em>KIR</em> region, with multiple alleles known for each <em>KIR</em> locus. Allele identification was performed for <em>KIR2DL4, KIR2DS4</em> and <em>KIR3DS1/3DL1</em> (indicated in red). This makes it possible to subdivide haplotype A further, according to the presence of the two common forms of <em>KIR2DS4</em>—the wild type <em>KIR2DS4wt</em> (haplotype A1) or the deletion variant <em>KIR2DS4del,</em> identical to <em>KIR2DS4wt</em> except for a 22 base-pair deletion causing a frame shift in translation (haplotype A2). B haplotypes are more variable and are characterised by the presence of more than one activating <em>KIR</em> gene. Genes that can be present in both group A and group B <em>KIR</em> haplotypes are shown in brown, and genes and/or alleles specific to group B <em>KIR</em> haplotypes are shown in green.</p>
