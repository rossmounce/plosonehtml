                Figure 1.  Organisation of the human KIR cluster.The Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes are organised in a head-to-tail fashion on human chromosome region 19q13.4. Each gene has nine exons (illustrated for KIR3DL1) and is roughly 10–16 kb in length, with short and equally homologous intergenic sequences of about 2 kb separating each pair of genes. The organisation of the exon-intron structure of the different KIR genes is fairly consistent with the following basic arrangement: the signal sequence is encoded by the first two exons (in grey), each Ig domain (D0, D1, D2) corresponds to a single exon (exons 3–5, respectively, in blue), the linker (in yellow) and transmembrane (in white) regions are each encoded by a single exon (exons 6 and 7, respectively), and the cytoplasmic domain is encoded by two final exons (8 and 9, in red). Two systems have been generated for naming KIR genes. The first follows the CD nomenclature system as CD158a, CD158b, etc., based on an approximate centromerictelomeric order of the genes on chromosome 19 [58]. As the CD nomenclature is not used routinely since it does not reflect structure, function, expression or localization, the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature will be used throughout this report (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefami​ly/kir.html). The HUGO nomenclature system, accounts for KIR protein structure and consists of four major subdivisions based on two features: the number of extracellular Ig domains (2D or 3D) and the length of the cytoplasmic tail (L: long or S: short). This latter information determines their functions: inhibitory (L) or activating (S). The boxes in bold indicate the activating KIR genes, and the dotted boxes correspond to the pseudogenes. The two boundary genes of the KIR cluster, KIR3DL3 and KIR3DL2, and the centrally situated KIR3DP1 pseudogene and KIR2DL4 are present in almost all individuals and are therefore considered to be framework (or anchor) genes (shown in white) [59]. KIR3DL3 and KIR3DP1 delimit the centromeric part of the KIR locus, whereas KIR2DL4 and KIR3DL2 delimit the telomeric part. A 14 kb stretch of unique sequence separating KIR3DP1 from KIR2DL4 is the preferred site for reciprocal recombination, a mechanism resulting in the formation of new haplotypes by the reassortment of centromeric and telomeric genes. Apart from these framework genes, KIR gene content is highly variable in terms of both the number and type of genes present. Although initially considered to be separate genes, KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 segregate as alleles of the same locus. Similarly, KIR3DS1 segregates as an allele of the inhibitory KIR3DL1. Overall, there are nine variable genes—KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2/2DL3, KIR2DL1, KIR3DS1/3DL1, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3, KIR2DS5, KIR2DS1, KIR2DS4—and one variable pseudogene (KIR2DP1). KIR2DL5 KIR2DS3 and KIR2DS5 may be found in both parts of the locus. We decided to represent these genes in the telomeric part of the cluster in this figure. Two major KIR haplotype groups, A and B, are classically described. The A haplotype is defined as containing the KIR3DL3, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1, KIR2DS4 and KIR3DL2 genes. KIR gene polymorphism adds further diversity to the KIR region, with multiple alleles known for each KIR locus. Allele identification was performed for KIR2DL4, KIR2DS4 and KIR3DS1/3DL1 (indicated in red). This makes it possible to subdivide haplotype A further, according to the presence of the two common forms of KIR2DS4—the wild type KIR2DS4wt (haplotype A1) or the deletion variant KIR2DS4del, identical to KIR2DS4wt except for a 22 base-pair deletion causing a frame shift in translation (haplotype A2). B haplotypes are more variable and are characterised by the presence of more than one activating KIR gene. Genes that can be present in both group A and group B KIR haplotypes are shown in brown, and genes and/or alleles specific to group B KIR haplotypes are shown in green.
