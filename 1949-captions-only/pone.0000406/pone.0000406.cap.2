                Figure 2.  Phenotypic distribution of KIRs in Hodgkin's lymphoma cases.The proportion (percentages) of present KIR genes, as determined by KIR gene content analysis are presented for the index HL cases (n = 90). Eleven KIR genes are presented in the figure. Two pairs of KIR genes are allelic: KIR3DL1/3DS1, and KIR2DL2/2DL3.
