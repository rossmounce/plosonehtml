                Figure 3.  Genotypic reconstruction.KIR gene content analysis provides only binary phenotyping results for each KIR (absent or present), rather than complete genotypic information. Thus, for genotype analysis (i.e. the number of copies of each KIR gene), genotypic reconstruction in two successive steps was required. The first step combined the results of KIR gene content analysis, knowledge of allelic forms of KIRs, the additional allele typing carried out for three KIR genes, and the analysis of intra-familial segregation. KIR gene content made it possible to determine genotype unambiguously only in individuals with a negative phenotypic result. For example, an individual with a negative KIR2DS2 phenotype has no copy of the gene, and its genotype can be deduced and denoted KIR2DS2(−,−). Conversely, an individual with a positive phenotype for KIR2DS2 may have either one copy of the gene, denoted KIR2DS2(+,−), or two copies of the gene, denoted KIR2DS2(+,+). Two of the nine variable KIR genes have known allelic forms: KIR2DL2/2DL3 and KIR3DS1/3DL1. We defined as (+,+) the KIR3DS1/3DL1 genotype of subjects homozygous for the presence of KIR3DS1 (phenotype KIR3DS1+, KIR3DL1−) and as (−,−) the genotype of subjects homozygous for the absence of KIR3DS1 (phenotype KIR3DS1−, KIR3DL1+). An individual with the KIR3DS1+, KIR3DL1+ phenotype has one copy of each gene and is therefore heterozygous at the locus, with genotype KIR3DS1/3DL1(+,−). The genotypes of KIR2DL2/2DL3 followed the same principle. Additional KIR allele typing was especially useful for the analysis of familial gene segregation. In particular, for KIR2DS4, it made it possible to distinguish between the two common forms, 2DS4wt and 2DS4del (Figure 1). The second step of the reconstruction was based on the KIR haplotype determination of individuals in each family. We first estimated the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern between KIR genes in our families, using the genotypic information obtained from the first step of reconstruction (see statistical analysis). Perfect and complete LD between pairs of KIRs made it possible to infer certain genotypes. For the few remaining unsolved KIR genotypes, haplotypic reconstruction was based on previously described haplotypes [26], [33].
