Thus, for genotype analysis (i.e. the number of copies of each <em>KIR</em> gene), genotypic reconstruction in two successive steps was required. The first step combined the results of <em>KIR</em> gene content analysis, knowledge of allelic forms of <em>KIRs</em>, the additional allele typing carried out for three <em>KIR</em> genes, and the analysis of intra-familial segregation. <em>KIR</em> gene content made it possible to determine genotype unambiguously only in individuals with a negative phenotypic result. For example, an individual with a negative <em>KIR2DS2</em> phenotype has no copy of the gene, and its genotype can be deduced and denoted <em>KIR2DS2</em>(−,−). Conversely, an individual with a positive phenotype for <em>KIR2DS2</em> may have either one copy of the gene, denoted <em>KIR2DS2</em>(+,−), or two copies of the gene, denoted <em>KIR2DS2</em>(+,+). Two of the nine variable <em>KIR</em> genes have known allelic forms: <em>KIR2DL2/2DL3</em> and <em>KIR3DS1/3DL1</em>. We defined as (+,+) the <em>KIR3DS1/3DL1</em> genotype of subjects homozygous for the presence of <em>KIR3DS1</em> (phenotype <em>KIR3DS1</em>+, <em>KIR3DL1</em>−) and as (−,−) the genotype of subjects homozygous for the absence of <em>KIR3DS1</em> (phenotype <em>KIR3DS1</em>−, <em>KIR3DL1+</em>). An individual with the <em>KIR3DS1</em>+, <em>KIR3DL1</em>+ phenotype has one copy of each gene and is therefore heterozygous at the locus, with genotype <em>KIR3DS1/3DL1</em>(+,−). The genotypes of <em>KIR2DL2/2DL3</em> followed the same principle. Additional <em>KIR</em> allele typing was especially useful for the analysis of familial gene segregation<em>.</em> In particular, for <em>KIR2DS4,</em> it made it possible to distinguish between the two common forms, <em>2DS4wt</em> and <em>2DS4del</em> (<a href="#pone-0000406-g001">Figure 1</a>). The second step of the reconstruction was based on the <em>KIR</em> haplotype determination of individuals in each family. We first estimated the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern between <em>KIR</em> genes in our families, using the genotypic information obtained from the first step of reconstruction (see statistical analysis). Perfect and complete LD between pairs of <em>KIRs</em> made it possible to infer certain genotypes. For the few remaining unsolved <em>KIR</em> genotypes, haplotypic reconstruction was based on previously described haplotypes <a href="#pone.0000406-Hsu1">[26]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000406-Uhrberg1">[33]</a>.</p>
