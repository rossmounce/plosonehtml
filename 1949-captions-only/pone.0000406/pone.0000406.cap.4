Each square represents the magnitude of pairwise LD between <em>KIR</em> genes, as measured by D' (panel A) or r<sup>2</sup> (panel B). Red squares represent a |D'| or r<sup>2</sup> value of 1.0, corresponding to complete and perfect LD, respectively. Orange, yellow, and white squares indicate |D'| or R<sup>2</sup> values of [0.75-1[, [0.5-0.75[, and&lt;0.5, respectively.</p>
