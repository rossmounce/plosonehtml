                Figure 4.  Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between KIR genes in the family sample.This analysis was based on the genotypes reconstructed after the first step, without using any information about LD pattern between KIR genes. Each square represents the magnitude of pairwise LD between KIR genes, as measured by D' (panel A) or r2 (panel B). Red squares represent a |D'| or r2 value of 1.0, corresponding to complete and perfect LD, respectively. Orange, yellow, and white squares indicate |D'| or R2 values of [0.75-1[, [0.5-0.75[, and&lt;0.5, respectively.
