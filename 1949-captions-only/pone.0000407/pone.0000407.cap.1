                Figure 1.  Generation of extra DTCs from the sister cells of DTCs in cye-1 mutants.(A and B) Structure of gonads in a wild-type animal (A) and cye-1(eh10) mutant (B) at the L3 stage. The DTCs are marked by arrowheads. The gonad is outlined with dotted lines. Anterior is to the left; ventral is to the bottom. Anterior gonads were out of focus. Scale bar, 20 µm. (C) The lineages of the Z1 and Z4 cells during the L1 stage in wild-type animals are indicated on the left and right sides. A schematic drawing of the gonad with the positions and division axes of somatic gonadal cells is shown in the center. The Z2 and Z3 cells are primordial germ cells. The DTCs are indicated by black circles. (D–I) Laser ablation experiments in wild-type animals and cye-1(os66) mutants. Lineage diagrams with the ablated cells marked by an X are shown in the upper part of each panel. The lower parts of each panel show the percentages of animals that had the numbers of DTCs indicated on the left. Panel I includes animals in which Z1.a, Z1.p, Z4.a, and Z4.pp were ablated.
