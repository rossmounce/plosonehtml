Merged GFP and Nomarski images. The gonad is outlined with dotted lines. The original DTC (Z1.aa) and its sister cell (Z1.ap) are marked by an arrowhead and arrow, respectively. The extra <em>lag-2::GFP</em>-positive cells produced from Z1.ap (J) or Z1.p (K) are indicated by asterisks. Scale bar, 10 µm. (A–H) Real-time analyses of <em>lag-2::GFP</em> expression in wild type (A–C), <em>cye-1(os66)</em> mutants (D–F), and <em>hs::cki-1</em> animals after heat shock (G and H) from the late L1 to early L2 stage. Each vertical set of panels represents the same animal over time. The expression about 3 hours (A and D), 5 hours (B, E and G), and 8 hours (C, F and H) after division of the Z1.a cell is shown. (I–K) <em>lag-2::GFP</em> expression in <em>cdk-2(RNAi)</em> (I) and <em>cki-1(RNAi)</em> animals (J and K).</p>
