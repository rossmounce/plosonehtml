                Figure 2.  Transformation of quiescent cells to DTCs after their divisions in cye-1 mutants.(A–K) Anterior is to the left; ventral is to the bottom. Merged GFP and Nomarski images. The gonad is outlined with dotted lines. The original DTC (Z1.aa) and its sister cell (Z1.ap) are marked by an arrowhead and arrow, respectively. The extra lag-2::GFP-positive cells produced from Z1.ap (J) or Z1.p (K) are indicated by asterisks. Scale bar, 10 µm. (A–H) Real-time analyses of lag-2::GFP expression in wild type (A–C), cye-1(os66) mutants (D–F), and hs::cki-1 animals after heat shock (G and H) from the late L1 to early L2 stage. Each vertical set of panels represents the same animal over time. The expression about 3 hours (A and D), 5 hours (B, E and G), and 8 hours (C, F and H) after division of the Z1.a cell is shown. (I–K) lag-2::GFP expression in cdk-2(RNAi) (I) and cki-1(RNAi) animals (J and K).
