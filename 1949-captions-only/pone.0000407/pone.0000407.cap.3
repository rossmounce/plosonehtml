                Figure 3.  Expression of cye-1, cki-1, lit-1 and rnr::GFP in the Z1.a daughters at the late L1 stage.(A–L) Anterior is to the left; ventral is to the bottom. Merged GFP and Nomarski images. The gonad is outlined with dotted lines. Scale bar, 10 µm. The nucleus (A, B, G, H and I–L) or cell membrane (C–F) of Z1.aa (arrowhead) and Z1.ap (arrow) is outlined by white and purple lines, respectively. The expression of CYE-1::GFP in wild type (A) and wrm-1(ne1982) mutants (B). CYE-1::GFP containing the full-length CYE-1 sequence was localized mainly to the nucleus. Expression of cki-1::GFP in wild type (C) and wrm-1(ne1982) mutants (D). cki-1::GFP does not include the cki-1 coding sequence [16] and was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Expression of cye-1 promoter::GFP (cye-1p::gfp) in wild type (E) and cye-1(os66) mutants (F). Expression of GFP::LIT-1 in wild type (G) and cye-1(os66) mutants (H). Expression of rnr::GFP in wild type (I and K) and cki-1(RNAi) animals (J and L). GFP was detected just after the division of Z1.a (I and J) and disappeared after 2hr in wild type (K), but not in cki-1(RNAi) animals (L).
