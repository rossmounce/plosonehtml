Merged GFP and Nomarski images. The gonad is outlined with dotted lines. Scale bar, 10 µm. The nucleus (A, B, G, H and I–L) or cell membrane (C–F) of Z1.aa (arrowhead) and Z1.ap (arrow) is outlined by white and purple lines, respectively. The expression of CYE-1::GFP in wild type (A) and <em>wrm-1(ne1982)</em> mutants (B). CYE-1::GFP containing the full-length CYE-1 sequence was localized mainly to the nucleus. Expression of <em>cki-1::GFP</em> in wild type (C) and <em>wrm-1(ne1982)</em> mutants (D). <em>cki-1::GFP</em> does not include the <em>cki-1</em> coding sequence <a href="#pone.0000407-Hong1">[16]</a> and was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Expression of <em>cye-1</em> promoter::GFP (<em>cye-1p::gfp)</em> in wild type (E) and <em>cye-1(os66)</em> mutants (F). Expression of GFP::LIT-1 in wild type (G) and <em>cye-1(os66)</em> mutants (H). Expression of <em>rnr::GFP</em> in wild type (I and K) and <em>cki-1(RNAi)</em> animals (J and L). GFP was detected just after the division of Z1.a (I and J) and disappeared after 2hr in wild type (K), but not in <em>cki-1(RNAi)</em> animals (L).</p>
