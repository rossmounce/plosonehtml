                Figure 4..  A model for the function of CKI-1 and CYE-1/CDK-2.In the Z1.aa/Z4.pp cells, highly expressed cki-1 strongly represses the low CYE-1/CDK-2 activity, blocking proliferation and permitting differentiation into DTCs. In the Z1.ap/Z4.pa cells, the low level of CKI-1 blocks cell division by inhibiting the CYE-1/CDK-2 complex, but sufficient CYE-1/CDK-2 remains to repress terminal differentiation. In cki-1(RNAi) animals, a high level of CYE-1 drives the cells towards proliferation.
