Sy: syncytial cell. Se: seam cells. Dotted lines indicate the time after hatching the phenotype was scored (8 hrs for T and 20 hrs for V6.p). (C–F) Confocal images of AJM-1::GFP expression. T.ap and V6.pap were outlined by the fluorescence in wild-type animals (C and E) but not in <em>cye-1(os66)</em> mutants (D and F). The lack of AJM-1::GFP signal indicates that these cells fused with the hypodermal syncytium. In <em>cye-1</em> mutants, daughters of the T.p cell (arrows in D) often did not divide further. Scale bar, 10 µm.</p>
