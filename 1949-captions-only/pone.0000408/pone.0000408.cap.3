                Figure 3.  Typical examples of distributions of KaiC states, P(Ri,t) = XiR/X and P(Ti,t) = XiT/X.(a) Distributions at t = 18 hours (black line) and t = 22 hours (red line) calculated with the standard parameter set consistent with the autocatalytic increase of KaiC population in R states. (b) Distributions at t = 10 hours (black line) and t = 14 hours (red line) calculated with the transition rate from T6 to R6 increased 100-fold from its standard value.
