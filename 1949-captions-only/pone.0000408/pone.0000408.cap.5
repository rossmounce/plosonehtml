                Figure 5.  Concentration dependence of the simulated time course of KaiC phosphorylation level, p(t).(a) p(t) for the standard mixture (red) and p(t) calculated with the concentrations of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC increased 2.5-fold (blue), 5-fold (purple) or decreased to 1/10 (orange), 1/20 (yellow), and 1/40 (green) of their standard values. (b) p(t) calculated with the KaiA concentration decreased to 2/3 (blue) or 1/4 (green) of its standard value (red). (c) p(t) calculated with the KaiB concentration decreased to 2/3 (blue) or 1/3 (green) of its standard value (red).
