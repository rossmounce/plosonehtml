                Figure 7.  Interplay of the KaiC-KaiA and KaiC-KaiB association and the phosphorylation level of KaiC.The amount of associated KaiC is shown in solid lines as percentage of the total number of KaiC hexamers, whereas the phosphorylation level, p(t), is shown in dashed lines. (a) KaiC with p(0) ~95% is incubated with KaiA, (b) KaiC with p(0) ~5% is incubated with KaiA, (c) KaiC with p(0) ~95% is incubated with KaiB, and (d) KaiC with p(0) ~5% is incubated with KaiB.
