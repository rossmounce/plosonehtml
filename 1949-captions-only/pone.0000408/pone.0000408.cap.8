                Figure 8.  Monomer shuffling between KaiC hexamers.(a) KaiC hexamers composed of tagged monomers and those composed of untagged monomers were mixed in the ratio of 1:1 in the absence of KaiA or KaiB (real line), in the presence of KaiB (dashed line), or in the absence of KaiA (dotted line). The amounts of tagged KaiC hexamers normalized by its initial amount are shown. (b) The phosphorylation level p(t) (dashed line) and the amount of tagged KaiC hexamers normalized by its initial amount (solid line) in the presence of KaiA and KaiB.
