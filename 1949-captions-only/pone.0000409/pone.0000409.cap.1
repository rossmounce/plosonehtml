Untreated cells are shown in the top row and cells treated with either BTO-1 or BI-2536 are shown in the middle and bottom rows, respectively. Time (minutes) after anaphase onset is shown in the bottom right corner of each image. B) Degree of furrow contraction in the presence or absence of Plk1 inhibitors. The measured width of the furrow is normalized to the pre-anaphase width. The half-time of furrow ingression for the control cells is 15.32±2.77 minutes. No ingression was observed in cells treated with BTO-1 or BI-2536. T<sub>1/2</sub> is shown±SD. Each curve represents the average of multiple timelapse recordings (Control n = 10, BTO-1 n = 10, and BI-2536 n = 10).</p>
