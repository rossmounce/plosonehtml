                Figure 2.  Plk1 inhibition blocks anaphase B spindle elongation.A) Fluorescence images taken from timelapse recordings of GFP-Tubulin expressing PtK2 cells in the presence or absence of Plk1 inhibitor. Time shown in lower right had corner represents minutes after anaphase onset. Untreated cells are shown in the top row and BTO-1 treated cells are shown in the bottom row. B) Degree of anaphase B inhibition in PtK2 cells treated with BTO-1. Spindle length is normalized to the length of the pre-anaphase spindle. The half-time of spindle elongation for untreated PtK2 cells is 6.57±0.58 minutes. None of the cells treated with BTO-1 achieved greater than a 10% increase in spindle length. Curves represent an average of Control (n = 22) and BTO-1 (n = 10) recordings. C) Degree of anaphase B inhibition in HeLa cells treated with BTO-1 or BI-2536. Graphs are as described in B (Control n = 10, BTO-1 n = 10, BI-2536 n = 10). The half-time of spindle elongation untreated HeLa cells is 2.31±0.66 minutes. No spindle pole separation was observed in Plk1 inhibited cells. All measurements are shown±SD.
