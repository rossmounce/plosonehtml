Time shown in lower right had corner represents minutes after anaphase onset. Untreated cells are shown in the top row and BTO-1 treated cells are shown in the bottom row. B) Degree of anaphase B inhibition in PtK<sub>2</sub> cells treated with BTO-1. Spindle length is normalized to the length of the pre-anaphase spindle. The half-time of spindle elongation for untreated PtK<sub>2</sub> cells is 6.57±0.58 minutes. None of the cells treated with BTO-1 achieved greater than a 10% increase in spindle length. Curves represent an average of Control (n = 22) and BTO-1 (n = 10) recordings. C) Degree of anaphase B inhibition in HeLa cells treated with BTO-1 or BI-2536. Graphs are as described in B (Control n = 10, BTO-1 n = 10, BI-2536 n = 10). The half-time of spindle elongation untreated HeLa cells is 2.31±0.66 minutes. No spindle pole separation was observed in Plk1 inhibited cells. All measurements are shown±SD.</p>
