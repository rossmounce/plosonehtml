                Figure 3.  Reversibility of Plk1 inhibition of cytokinesis and anaphase B.A) DIC images from a timelapse video of HeLa cells treated with BTO-1 for 15 minutes after anaphase onset. Inhibitor was removed at 15 minutes, second panel represents first timelapse image after inhibitor removal. Time in minutes after anaphase is shown in the lower right hand corner. B) Normalized spindle length in cells after inhibitor washout. Control data is the same data shown previously in Figure 2C for reference. BTO-1 washout (closed triangles) represents an average of 5 timelapse recordings. C) Normalized furrow width showing cytokinesis recovery after BTO-1 washout (closed triangles) (n = 5). Dashed lines represent time of washout. The half-time of furrow ingression following BTO-1 washout is 23.46±3.72 minutes post anaphase onset. T1/2 is shown±SD.
