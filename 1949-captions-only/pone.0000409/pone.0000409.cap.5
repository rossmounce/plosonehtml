Top row shows localization of Rho, Tubulin and DNA in untreated cells and bottom row shows localization after BI-2536 treatment. B) Localization of Rho-GEF as described for A. C) Localization of Rho-GAP (MgcRacGAP) as described for A. D) Localization of MKLP1 as described for A. Scale bar represents 5 Âµm.</p>
