                Figure 5.  Plk1 inhibition blocks the localization of Rho and Rho-GEF but not Rho-GAP or MKLP1.A) Fluorescence images of control or BI-2536 treated HeLa cells. Top row shows localization of Rho, Tubulin and DNA in untreated cells and bottom row shows localization after BI-2536 treatment. B) Localization of Rho-GEF as described for A. C) Localization of Rho-GAP (MgcRacGAP) as described for A. D) Localization of MKLP1 as described for A. Scale bar represents 5 Âµm.
