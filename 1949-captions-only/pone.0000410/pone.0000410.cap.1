                Figure 1.  Stimuli used in the experiment.A–E. Four flickering Gabors were presented at one of five eccentricities; the standard deviation of each Gabor's contrast envelope was incrementally skewed by ~0.19 deg toward (A–B) or away (D–E) from the fovea. The Gabors in (E) are skewed away from the Gabors in (A) by 0.77 deg (see Materials and Methods).
