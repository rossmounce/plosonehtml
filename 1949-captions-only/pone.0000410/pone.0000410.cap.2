The abscissa on the graph shows the difference in the eccentricity between any two of the five conditions (e.g., the difference in skew between <a href="#pone-0000410-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</a> was 0.19 deg, while the difference between <a href="#pone-0000410-g001">Fig. 1A and 1E</a> was 0.77 deg). The ordinate shows discrimination (d-prime, calculated from the 5AFC classification data <a href="#pone.0000410-MacMillan1">[54]</a>). When two stimulus conditions were similar (e.g., <a href="#pone-0000410-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</a>), subjects had difficulty classifying which condition they were viewing, resulting in a lower d-prime. Conditions that were separated by greater eccentricities yielded higher discrimination ability. For all subjects, discrimination improved with an increasing difference in the skew of the envelope. Overall ability varied between subjects, but the trend was consistent across subjects, and was significant for each subject (least significant log fit to the data was for subject MC, F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 9.67, P&lt;0.01).</p>
