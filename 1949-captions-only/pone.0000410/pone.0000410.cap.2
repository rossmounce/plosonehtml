                Figure 2.  Psychophysical results for six subjects.While in the scanner, subjects reported which condition they were viewing on each trial (5AFC classification task). The abscissa on the graph shows the difference in the eccentricity between any two of the five conditions (e.g., the difference in skew between Fig. 1A and 1B was 0.19 deg, while the difference between Fig. 1A and 1E was 0.77 deg). The ordinate shows discrimination (d-prime, calculated from the 5AFC classification data [54]). When two stimulus conditions were similar (e.g., Fig. 1A and 1B), subjects had difficulty classifying which condition they were viewing, resulting in a lower d-prime. Conditions that were separated by greater eccentricities yielded higher discrimination ability. For all subjects, discrimination improved with an increasing difference in the skew of the envelope. Overall ability varied between subjects, but the trend was consistent across subjects, and was significant for each subject (least significant log fit to the data was for subject MC, F(1,18) = 9.67, P&lt;0.01).
