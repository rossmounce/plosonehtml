                Figure 3.  Cortical surface maps for three representative subjects showing regions of positive (yellow-red) and negative (blue-green) BOLD activity.The maps were generated by fitting a general linear model to the data and contrasting all of the flickering Gabor stimuli (Fig. 1) to a fixation baseline; the threshold for these maps was set at t = 5.6, P(Bonf)&lt;0.001.
