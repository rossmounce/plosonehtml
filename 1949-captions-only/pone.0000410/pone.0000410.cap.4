Cortical surface for one subject showing visual area V1 (outlined), measured in separate retinotopic mapping runs (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). B. Negative BOLD ROI in V1 for the representative subject. C. Positive BOLD ROI in V1 for the representative subject. D–E. Event-related average timecourses were measured separately for positive and negative BOLD ROIs. Positive BOLD ROI (red line, squares) and the negative BOLD ROI (blue line, circles) for a representative subject (D) and for the group of subjects (E). F–G. Positive and negative BOLD ROI responses averaged across visual areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, VP, and V4 for one representative subject (F), and for the group of subjects (G). The gray filled region in each graph shows the stimulus presentation (10 s). Error bars, ±s.e.m.</p>
