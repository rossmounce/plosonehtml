                Figure 6.  Position discrimination within the negative BOLD ROI of one representative subject's visual area V1.Within the negative BOLD ROI (circled in white dashed line), the pattern of responses to each of the five stimulus conditions (Fig. 1) were cross-correlated (the analysis from Fig. 5 was repeated for every pair of stimulus conditions). All correlations were converted to Fisher z scores and normalized to (subtracted from) the highest correlation (ordinate). Zero on the ordinate therefore indicates a high spatial correlation. The abscissa shows the difference in the eccentricity of any pair of conditions (ranging from 0.19 deg to 0.77 deg, as in Fig. 1). The graph indicates that as the eccentricity of the Gabor conditions is increasingly separated, the correlation across the spatial pattern of activity decreased (indicated by a positive slope in the data). A linear regression revealed a significant effect of Gabor separation on the spatial correlation (f(x) = 2.2xâˆ’0.08; F(1,8) = 43.6, P&lt;0.001).
