All correlations were converted to Fisher z scores and normalized to (subtracted from) the highest correlation (ordinate). Zero on the ordinate therefore indicates a high spatial correlation. The abscissa shows the difference in the eccentricity of any pair of conditions (ranging from 0.19 deg to 0.77 deg, as in <a href="#pone-0000410-g001">Fig. 1</a>). The graph indicates that as the eccentricity of the Gabor conditions is increasingly separated, the correlation across the spatial pattern of activity decreased (indicated by a positive slope in the data). A linear regression revealed a significant effect of Gabor separation on the spatial correlation (<em>f(x)</em> = 2.2<em>x</em>âˆ’0.08; F<sub>(1,8)</sub> = 43.6, P&lt;0.001).</p>
