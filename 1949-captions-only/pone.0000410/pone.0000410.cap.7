                Figure 7.  Position discrimination in V1.A. Position discrimination in the negative BOLD ROI across all seven subjects. A linear regression revealed a significantly positive position discrimination slope (slope of 1.34; F(1,26) = 52.9, p&lt;0.01). B. Within each subject's V1, the same analysis was applied to the positive BOLD ROIs (open circles). The slope of the position discrimination function in the positive BOLD ROI in V1 was 2.15 (F(1,26) = 202.1, P&lt;0.001). Although the regions that display a positive BOLD response are better able to discriminate object position (F(1,6) = 49.3, P&lt;0.01), the regions that display a negative BOLD response are still able to discriminate object position with remarkable precision.
