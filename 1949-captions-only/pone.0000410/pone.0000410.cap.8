Representative cortical surface map for one subject. B. The position discrimination slope for the negative (blue) and positive (red) BOLD ROIs within each visual area for the representative subject shown in (A). The position discrimination slope for each ROI was calculated as in <a href="#pone-0000410-g006">Fig. 6</a>. C. The position discrimination slope averaged across all seven subjects. For the positive BOLD ROIs (red bars), there was a significantly positive position discrimination slope across visual areas V1 through V4, indicating that all of these visual areas are topographically precise (i.e., they can detect 0.19 deg shifts in the position of an object at 9 deg eccentricity). The same was true for the negative BOLD ROIs as well. Of all the areas tested here, the least significant position discrimination was in the negative BOLD ROI in V3A (t<sub>(5)</sub> = 3.2, P&lt;0.05). Error bars, ±1 s.e.m.</p>
