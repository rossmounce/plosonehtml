                Figure 9.  Regions of the visual cortex that were most sensitive to stimulus position.A. The positive (red-orange) and negative (green-blue) BOLD response to the flickering Gabors for a representative subject. B. Position discrimination slopes (as in Fig. 7) were measured for every possible 5 mm3 ROI in the occipital lobe (see Materials and methods). Those overlapping ROIs that showed the steepest position discrimination slopes are shown in dark blue and outlined with a dashed white line. Notice that the region of the visual cortex that is most sensitive to stimulus position (within the white dashed line) falls between the positive and negative BOLD regions in (A). This supports the idea that the edges of the object representation, where the BOLD response changes from positive to negative, are especially important for object localization [37], [48].
