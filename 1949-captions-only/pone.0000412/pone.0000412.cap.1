                Figure 1.  EAST can associate with Polytene Chromosomes.(A) Live intact salivary glands expressing EAST-GFP (green) were exposed to photobleaching. A rapid recovery (see Figure 3E) indicates a high mobility in the nucleoplasm. (B-D) Larval salivary glands expressing EAST-GFP (green) were fixed and counterstained with TOPRO3 (white) to visualize DNA. (B) In untreated cells, EAST-GFP is localized to extrachromosomal nuclear regions. (C) In larval salivary permeabilized with a saponin containing detergent buffer, EAST-GFP rapidly relocates to the polytene chromosomes. (D) In detergent treated and squashed preparations of polytene chromosomes, EAST-GFP shows a high degree of co-localization with DNA bands. The chromocenter is indicated (arrow head). EAST-GFP represents full length EAST with a C-terminal eGFP tag that was expressed by the GAL4 system using the smid-Gal4 driver. Bars correspond to 10 Âµm in all panels.
