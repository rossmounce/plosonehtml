Run-on transcription was visualized using BrUTP (red). TOPRO3 (white) was used to label DNA. (B) In <em>east</em><sup>hop7</sup> mutants, like in wildtype, regions of high BrUTP incorporation (arrow) are found in interbands. Note that the banding pattern shows less contrast compared to EAST-GFP overexpressing or wildtype (not shown) cells. Bars correspond to 10 Âµm in all panels.</p>
