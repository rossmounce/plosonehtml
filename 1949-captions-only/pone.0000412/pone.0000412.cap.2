                Figure 2.  EAST-GFP accumulates in chromosome regions of low transcriptional activity.(A) EAST-GFP (green) is excluded from highly transcribed chromosome regions (arrow) in detergent treated larval salivary glands cells. Run-on transcription was visualized using BrUTP (red). TOPRO3 (white) was used to label DNA. (B) In easthop7 mutants, like in wildtype, regions of high BrUTP incorporation (arrow) are found in interbands. Note that the banding pattern shows less contrast compared to EAST-GFP overexpressing or wildtype (not shown) cells. Bars correspond to 10 Âµm in all panels.
