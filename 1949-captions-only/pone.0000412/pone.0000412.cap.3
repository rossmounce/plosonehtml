At 100 mM, the distribution is mostly chromosomal, at 150 mM chromosomal and nucleoplasmic and at 200 mM no chromosomal-like pattern is detectable. (B-D) The mobility of EAST-GFP was assessed by FRAP. (B, C) Increasing the salt concentration lowers the affinity to chromatin. An increase in salt from 50 mM (B) to 100 mM (C) leads to a faster recovery of fluorescence after bleaching chromosome regions bound by EAST-GFP. (D) Removing the C-terminal residues 1535-2301 of EAST leads to an increase in mobility. At a salt concentration of 50 mM, the truncated version of EAST associates with a lower affinity than the full-length version. (E) The diagram shows the recovery in seconds after bleaching the indicated nuclear regions for 4 seconds at a laser intensity of 100%. The two different variants of EAST-GFP were expressed using the <em>ftz-GAL4</em> driver. Cells were permeabilized in buffers containing 50 mM NaCl supplemented with varying amounts of KCl to reach the indicated salt concentrations. The recovery of the non detergent treated cell (non-perm) in <a href="#pone-0000412-g001">Figure 1A</a> is indicated for comparison. The Bar in A represents 10 Âµm and applies to all panels.</p>
