                Figure 4.  east corresponds to suppressor of white-spotted.All flies shown are homozygous for wsp1. (A) In male pharates dissected out of pupal cases, the mutations easthop7 and su(wsp)1 suppress the loss of eye pigmentation resulting from the white mutation wsp1. (B) The mutations easthop7 and su(wsp)1 show complementation. Like su(wsp)1/su(wsp)1, the combination easthop7/su(wsp)1 restores eye pigmentation to almost wildtype levels. Heterozygous flies of each mutation display intermediate eye pigmentation.
