                Figure 5.  Change of localization of EAST-GFP during apoptosis.(A) In a 13 h APF old pupa, EAST-GFP (green) shows mainly extrachromosomal localization. The nuclear lamina (red) is still intact. DNA (blue) was labeled with TOPRO-3. (B) Co-localization of EAST-GFP with intact polytene chromosomes can be observed in a 19 hour APF old pupa. The destruction of the lamina indicates that part of the apoptotic program is executed. Note the barely detectable anti-lamin staining in salivary glands compared to neighboring diploid cells (arrow). The Bar in A represents 10 Âµm and also applies to B.
