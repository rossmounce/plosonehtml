                Figure 1.  Transcriptional regulation of collectrin gene by HNF-1β.Panel a: Western blot analysis, RT-PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Endogenous mRNA expression of HNF-1β but not HNF-1α in mIMCD3 cells is detected by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. The specific binding of HNF-1β and HNF-1α to putative binding site is indicated by antibody mediated supershift (arrow). Panel b: Luciferase reporter gene assay. The mIMCD3 cells are co-transfected with pcDNA3.1/HNF-1α and/or pcDNA3.1/HNF-1β with pGL3-collectrin reporter and pBIND vector. A dose dependent increase in the reporter activity is observed (n = 6, *p&lt;0.05 and **p&lt;0.01 versus pcDNA3.1(+) treated control) Panel c: Western blot analyses of collectrin using whole kidney lysates of DN-HNF1β transgenic mouse. In two transgenic mouse founders, the expression of DN-HNF1β mutant transgene tagged with V5 and FLAG epitope is indicated by percentage of highest expression, 6% and 100%. (Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody, n = 3 separate measurements, *p&lt;0.05 and **p&lt;0.01 versus non-transgenic littermate indicated by 0%) Panel d: Localization of collectrin and HNF-1β deletion mutant protein in epithelia lining the cyst shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Collectrin is visualized as red, HNF-1β deletion mutant with V5 tag as green, and nuclei as blue. Arrows indicate the absence of collectrin expression on the apical surface of epithelial cells where HNF-1β deletion mutant product is expressed in the nucleus. Scale bar, 20 µm.
