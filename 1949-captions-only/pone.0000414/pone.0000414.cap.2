Collectrin antibody detected a single band of ~40 kDa. <em><span class="underline">Panel b:</span></em> N-glycosidase (N) and O-glycosidase (O) treatment generates ~30 kDa and ~35 kDa respective bands. <em><span class="underline">Panel c:</span></em> Immunoreactivity of collectrin is detected by confocal microscopy; five layers (1 to 5) are shown and collectrin is seen in cytoplasm (2 to 5 cuts) and apical membrane (1 cut). <em><span class="underline">Panel d:</span></em> Apical view of mIMCD3 cells. Collectrin (green) and acetylated α-tubulin (red), a primary ciliary marker, are depicted. <em><span class="underline">Panel e:</span></em> Higher magnification shows that acetylated α-tubulin (red) and collectrin (green) co-localize. <em><span class="underline">Panel f:</span></em> Collectrin (green) is seen surrounding the γ-tubulin, a marker for the basal body (red). <em><span class="underline">Panel g:</span></em> Immunoelectron microscopy shows gold particles localized mainly in microvesicles around the basal body of the primary cilium (arrow heads), whereas few gold particles are observed at the peripheral region of proximal centriole. Scale bars, 20 µm for panels c, d, e, and f and 500 nm for panel g.</p>
