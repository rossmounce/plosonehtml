                Figure 3.  Primary cilium formation in mIMCD3 cells.Panel a: Expression of collectrin in mIMCD3 cells over-expressing collectrin (n = 4; clone 11, 13, 15 and 18) and mIMCD3 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) (n = 2; clone c1 and c2)(mIMCD3 cells). (*p&lt;0.05 versus mIMCD3 cells) Panel b: Western blot analysis of collectrin in mIMCD3 cells treated with control siRNA (CON-siRNA) or Collectrin siRNA. (Data represent 3 independent experiments, *p&lt;0.01 versus CON-siRNA) Panel c: Immunofluorescence of collectrin in mIMCD3 cells, CON-siRNA and Collecrin siRNA treated cells, and Collectrin stable cells. Panels d &amp; e: mIMCD3 cells double-stained with collectrin (green) and acetylated α-tubulin (red). Cilia are present in every polarized cell, but ~40% of cells are without detectable cilia with the treatment of collectrin siRNA. AV, apical view. (n = 300 from separate three experiments, *p&lt;0.05 versus CON-siRNA) Panel f: Cilium length is also reduced in cells after collectrin siRNA transfection (~4.5 µm) compared with CON-siRNA group (~7.8 µm). (n = 300 from three independent experiments, *p&lt;0.05 versus CON-siRNA) Panel g: Electron micrographs of mIMCD3 cells treated with CON-siRNA and Collectrin siRNA. Cilium with disorganized microtubule structure (arrow heads), bulging cilium (arrows), and stunted cilium (asterisk) are seen in mIMCD3 cells transfected with Collectrin siRNA. Scale bars, 20 µm for panels c and d and 500 nm for panel g.
