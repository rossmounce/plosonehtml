(*p&lt;0.05 versus mIMCD3 cells) <em><span class="underline">Panel b:</span></em> Western blot analysis of collectrin in mIMCD3 cells treated with control siRNA (CON-siRNA) or Collectrin siRNA. (Data represent 3 independent experiments, *p&lt;0.01 versus CON-siRNA) <em><span class="underline">Panel c:</span></em> Immunofluorescence of collectrin in mIMCD3 cells, CON-siRNA and Collecrin siRNA treated cells, and Collectrin stable cells. <em><span class="underline">Panels d &amp; e:</span></em> mIMCD3 cells double-stained with collectrin (green) and acetylated α-tubulin (red). Cilia are present in every polarized cell, but ~40% of cells are without detectable cilia with the treatment of collectrin siRNA. AV, apical view. (n = 300 from separate three experiments, *p&lt;0.05 versus CON-siRNA) <em><span class="underline">Panel f:</span></em> Cilium length is also reduced in cells after collectrin siRNA transfection (~4.5 µm) compared with CON-siRNA group (~7.8 µm). (n = 300 from three independent experiments, *p&lt;0.05 versus CON-siRNA) <em><span class="underline">Panel g:</span></em> Electron micrographs of mIMCD3 cells treated with CON-siRNA and Collectrin siRNA. Cilium with disorganized microtubule structure (arrow heads), bulging cilium (arrows), and stunted cilium (asterisk) are seen in mIMCD3 cells transfected with Collectrin siRNA. Scale bars, 20 µm for panels c and d and 500 nm for panel g.</p>
