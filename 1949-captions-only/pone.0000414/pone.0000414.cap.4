                Figure 4.  Expression and localization of polycystin-2 in mIMCD3 cells treated with collectrin siRNA.Panel a: Western blot analyses show down regulation of polycystin-2 in mIMCD3 cells transfected with collectrin siRNA (Collectrin siRNA). Collectrin expression is not altered in mIMCD3 cells treated with control siRNA (CON-siRNA) and mIMCD3 cells over-expressing collectrin (Collectrin stable). (Data represent 3 independent experiments, *p&lt;0.05 versus CON-siRNA) Panel b: mIMCD3 cells double-stained with anti-collectrin antibody and organella markers. Golgi 58K protein (58K-9) (red) and collectrin (green) are co-localized in cytoplasm of mIMCD3 cells. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, protein disulfide isomerase (red), and collectrin (green) show partial colocalization. Panel c: mIMCD3 cells double-stained with polycystin-2 (green) and collectrin (red) showing co-localization. Panel d: mIMCD3 cells double-stained with polycystin-2 and acetylated α-tubulin. Polycystin-2 is highly expressed in primary cilia and the apical membrane of mIMCD3 cells, CON-siRNA treated and Collectrin stably transfected cells, whereas polycystin-2 is not detected in the cilia of most of the cells transfected with collectrin siRNA. AV, apical view. Scale bars, 10 µm for panels b, c, and d.
