                Figure 5.  Collectrin and interacting proteins.Panel a: Immunoprecipitation indicates interaction between collectrin and polycystin-2, and between collectrin and polaris. Panel b: Collectrin co-precipitates with snapin, SNAP-23, and syntaxin-4. Panel c: Tandem affinity tag purification using collectin as a bait followed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOF MS analysis revealed that the major two bands are nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A and γ-actin. Immunoprecipitation study shows collectrin, myosin II-A, γ-actin, tropomyosin, and polycystin-2 forms protein complex.
