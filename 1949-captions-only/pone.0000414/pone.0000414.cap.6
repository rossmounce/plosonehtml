PCNA positive cells increase in mIMCD3 cells treated with collectrin siRNA compared with control siRNA treated cells (CON-siRNA) and mIMCD3 cells over-expressing collectrin (Collectrin stable). <em><span class="underline">Panel c:</span></em> The increased proliferation of cells is observed in collectrin siRNA group by BrdU assay. <em><span class="underline">Panels d &amp; e:</span></em> Apoptosis assay using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Increased number of apoptotic cells is observed in collectrin siRNA group. <em><span class="underline">Panel f:</span></em> The viability of the cells is not altered in all groups revealed by MTT assay. <em><span class="underline">Panel g:</span></em> Imunofluoresence and confocal micrographs of EGFR. EGFR is observed in basolateral membrane of mIMCD3 cells, control siRNA group, and collectrin stable cells, whereas apical membrane expression of EGFR is detected in collectrin siRNA group. <em><span class="underline">Panel h:</span></em> Western blot analyses of EGFR. EGFR is up-regulated in collectrin siRNA group and down-regulated in cells stably transfected with collectrin. Scale bars, 20 Âµm for panel f. N = 300 from separate three experiments for panels b, c and e. Data are from 3 independent experiments for panel g, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 versus CON-siRNA.</p>
