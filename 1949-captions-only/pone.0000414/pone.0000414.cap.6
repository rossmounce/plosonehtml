                Figure 6.  Proliferation, apoptosis, and mislocalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in mIMCD3 cells treated with collectrin siRNA.Panels a &amp; b: Cellular proliferation assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining. PCNA positive cells increase in mIMCD3 cells treated with collectrin siRNA compared with control siRNA treated cells (CON-siRNA) and mIMCD3 cells over-expressing collectrin (Collectrin stable). Panel c: The increased proliferation of cells is observed in collectrin siRNA group by BrdU assay. Panels d &amp; e: Apoptosis assay using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Increased number of apoptotic cells is observed in collectrin siRNA group. Panel f: The viability of the cells is not altered in all groups revealed by MTT assay. Panel g: Imunofluoresence and confocal micrographs of EGFR. EGFR is observed in basolateral membrane of mIMCD3 cells, control siRNA group, and collectrin stable cells, whereas apical membrane expression of EGFR is detected in collectrin siRNA group. Panel h: Western blot analyses of EGFR. EGFR is up-regulated in collectrin siRNA group and down-regulated in cells stably transfected with collectrin. Scale bars, 20 Âµm for panel f. N = 300 from separate three experiments for panels b, c and e. Data are from 3 independent experiments for panel g, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 versus CON-siRNA.
