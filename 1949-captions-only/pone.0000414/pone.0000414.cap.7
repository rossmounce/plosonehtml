                Figure 7.  Collectrin antisense experiments in mouse metanephric organ culture system.Panels aA &amp; aB: Addition of EGF (12.5 µg/ml) (EGF) into culture media induces hypertrophy of the fetal kidney without cyst formation compared with nonsense ODN (oligodeoxynucleotide)-treated control explants (CON). Panels aC &amp; aD: The formation of cleft-like cysts (arrows) in the ureteric bud branches are seen in collectrin antisense ODN treated groups at concentrations of 1.5 µM (COLL-1.5) and 2.5 µM (COLL-2.5). Panels aG &amp; aH: The formation of multiple cleft-like cysts is accentuated in metanephroi treated with HNF-β antisense ODN at concentrations of 1.5 µM (HNF-β-1.5) and 2.5 µM (HNF-β-2.5). Panels aE &amp; aF: Similar effect, although somewhat less, is seen in HNF-1α antisense ODN treated group at concentrations of 1.5 µM (HNF-α-1.5) and 2.5 µM (HNF-α-2.5). Panel b: mRNA expression of collectrin and the genes regulated by HNF-1α and HNF-1β including Pkhd1, Pkd2, Umod, and Tg737/Polaris. Scale bars, 200 µm for panel a.
