Numerous renal cysts are formed in kidneys of HNF1βΔC transgenic mice. (Masson-Trichrome) <em><span class="underline">Panel b:</span></em> Immunoperoxidase staining of collectrin. Abundant expression of collectrin is seen in nontransgenic mice P52. Collectrin immunoreactivity is readily seen in normal portion of collecting duct cells (arrow head) but not seen in the epithelia lining the cysts (arrow) in HNF1βΔC transgenic mice. <em><span class="underline">Panel c:</span></em> Collectrin immunoperoxidase staining in kidney tissues form normal human and ADPKD patients. Abundant expression of collectrin is seen in normal collecting duct cells. In ADPKD patients, collectrin expression is observed in normal collecting duct cells (arrow head); however immunoreactivity of collectrin is not seen in both single-layered (arrow) and multilayered cysts. Scale bars, 1 mm for panel a, 50 µm for panels b and c.</p>
