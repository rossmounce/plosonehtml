                Figure 1.  Expression of a Gag/Δpp65 fusion protein in yeast.(A) Schematic outline of Gag/Δpp65 before and after in vivo assembly into chimeric yeast VLPs. (B) SDS-PAGE and anti-pp65 immunoblot of crude extracts from yeast expressing either Δpp65 (lane 1), Gag (lane 2), or Gag/Δpp65 (lane 3). To ensure in vivo translation initiation of N-terminally truncated Δpp65 (24.9 kDa), a methionine residue was added to the N-terminus of Δpp65 [M, prestained PAGE Ruler, Fermentas].
