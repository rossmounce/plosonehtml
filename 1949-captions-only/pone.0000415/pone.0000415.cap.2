                Figure 2.  Sedimentation profile and electron microscopy of Gag/Δpp65 expressed in yeast demonstrate in vivo assembly into isometric VLP chimeras.(A) Western analysis of chimeric Gag/Δpp65 particles and natural L-A virions assembled in yeast and purified by ultracentrifugation through a linear sucrose gradient. Aliquots of each gradient fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with monoclonal anti-pp65 and polyclonal anti-Gag, respectively [GP, gradient pellet; M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham]. (B) Electron micrograph of sucrose-gradient-purified Gag/Δpp65 after negative staining with uranyl acetate/methyl cellulose [magnification 150,000; arrows indicate Gag/Δpp65 particles].
