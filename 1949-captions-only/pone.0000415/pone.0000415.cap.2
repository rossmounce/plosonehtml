Aliquots of each gradient fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with monoclonal anti-pp65 and polyclonal anti-Gag, respectively [GP, gradient pellet; M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham]. (B) Electron micrograph of sucrose-gradient-purified Gag/Δpp65 after negative staining with uranyl acetate/methyl cellulose [magnification 150,000; arrows indicate Gag/Δpp65 particles].</p>
