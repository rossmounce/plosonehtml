Aliquots (20 µl each) of the indicated VLP preparation were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie-Blue staining and western analysis probed with anti-Gag and/or anti-pp65 [M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham]. (B) Frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 and (C) CD8 T cell activation after stimulation by sucrose cushion-purified yeast Gag and Gag/Δpp65 particles. Activated T cells were identified as CD69/IFN-γ double-positive lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Antigen samples were added to whole blood from HCMV seropositive donor 1. A VLP-free sample containing PBSE buffer was included as negative control (NC), a lysate from HCMV-infected fibroblasts served as positive control (PC). The threshold of significant T cell responses (0.05% of counted lymphocytes <a href="#pone.0000415-Breinig2">[15]</a>) is indicated as dashed line.</p>
