                Figure 4.  Purified Gag/Δpp65 chimeras induce an extensive human CD8 T cell response.(A) SDS-PAGE and anti-pp65 immunoblot of sucrose gradient purified Gag and Gag/Δpp65 particles expressed and assembled in yeast [Coomassie-Blue staining and BSA (2.7 µg) were used for semi-quantitative signal detection; M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham]. (B and C) Whole blood cells from three HCMV seropositive donors were stimulated by the addition of either Gag or Gag/Δpp65 (5 µg each), and specifically activated CD4 (B) and CD8 (C) T cells were quantified as CD69/IFN-γ double-positive lymphocytes by flow cytometry. A lysate from HCMV-infected fibroblasts served as positive control (PC), whereas a lysate from noninfected fibroblasts, a VLP-free buffer sample as well as blood cells from HCMV seronegative donor 5 were used as negative controls (NC). The threshold of significant T cell responses (0.05% of counted lymphocytes [15]) is indicated as dashed line.
