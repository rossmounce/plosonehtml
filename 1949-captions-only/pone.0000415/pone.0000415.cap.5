                Figure 5.  Chimeric Gag/K28α particles displaying the toxic α-subunit of the K28 virus toxin assemble into yeast VLPs that induce an in vivo antibody response in rabbit.(A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-Blue staining of recombinant Gag/K28α particles expressed and assembled in yeast and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. (B) Western analysis of the α/β heterodimeric K28 virus toxin probed with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against chimeric Gag/K28α VLPs assembled in yeast. Positions of the heterodimeric K28 toxin (α/β) and its tetrameric derivative [α/β]2 that forms spontaneously under conditions of a non-reducing SDS-PAGE are indicated (PI, pre-immune serum).
