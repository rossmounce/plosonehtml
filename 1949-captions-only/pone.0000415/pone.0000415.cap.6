The particular function of each domain within the protein fusion is indicated. (B) SDS-PAGE and anti-GFP western analysis of recombinant GTXG particles assembled in yeast and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. (C) Release of GFP from GTXG particles by factor X<sub>a</sub> cleavage [rGFP, recombinant GFP; M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham]. (D) Single-step purification of GFP obtained after factor X<sub>a</sub> treatment and ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation (S, supernatant; P, pellet) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a HIC column. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-GFP and/or anti-T7. (E) Coomassie-Blue staining of pooled GFP-containing HIC fractions after Amicon ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa cut-off membrane [rGFP, recombinant GFP; M, full range rainbow marker, Amersham].</p>
