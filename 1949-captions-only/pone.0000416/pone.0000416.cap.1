Apoptosis was evaluated by the APOPercentage assay and the apoptotic cells are stained as pink. (B,C) Passage 3 MSCs were plated on 60-cm2 dishes at 50 and 1,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The cells were harvested and counted up to 10 days. (B) Total cell numbers per 60-cm2 dish and (C) fold increase are shown. Data are expressed as mean±standard deviation (n = 3). (D) Passage 3 MSCs were plated at 100 cells/60-cm2 dish, cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 10 or 14 days, and stained with Crystal Violet to give total colony count. Colony numbers, which indicate colony-forming efficiency (%), are shown. Data are expressed as mean±standard deviation (n = 3). (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t test).</p>
