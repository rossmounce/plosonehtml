(A) Total colonies stained with Crystal Violet (upper two panels) and osteogenic colonies stained with Alizarin Red-S (lower two panels). (B) The panel shows the numbers of Alizarin Red-S and Oil Red-O-positive colonies after culture in osteogenic and adipogenic induction media, respectively. Data are expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation (n = 3). (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t test). (C) Cells were plated at 10,000 cells/cm2, and then cultured in adipogenic induction media under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Oil Red-O staining was performed at 2 weeks after induction to visualize the level of fat production in the cells (red stain).</p>
