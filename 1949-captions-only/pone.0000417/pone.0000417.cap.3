Distribution of intrinsic (A), dye-related (B) and filtered intrinsic (C) signals during an episode of rhythmic activity. The signals in A and C were obtained in an unstained slice which was subsequently stained with the voltage sensitive dye NK2671 to provide the VSD signals shown in B. The data were acquired at an interval of 0.42 ms. The signals in A were unfiltered and those in B were low pass filtered at 100Hz. The signals shown in D were obtained by bandpass (0.1–10 Hz) filtering the signals in A. Data in A is from a complete episode, while the signals shown in B and C were from 3 cycles from within the episode. Note that the dye signals and the filtered intrinsic signals exhibit a similar distribution of rhythmicity with the highest amplitude in the ventrolateral part of the cord. DR-dorsal root; VR-ventral root. D. The upper two traces compare the time course of the slow electrical activity (black trace) with the intrinsic optical signal recorded over the lateral motor column (red trace). Note that the peak of the optical signal is delayed with respect to the peak of the slow electrical signal. The lower traces are the cycle-averaged electrical (grey-integrated neurogram; black-low pass filtered slow potential) and optical (red-lateral motor column optical signal) responses generated from the cycles identified by the asterisks. The average was triggered from the peak of the slow potential as indicated by the vertical dotted grey lines. Data obtained from an E11 embryo.</p>
