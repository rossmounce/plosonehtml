                Figure 6.  Summary of the timing of activity in different cycles within episodes evoked by a stimulus to the dorsal root.A. Sequence of activity for the first cycle in 5 experiments in which the dorsal optical activity preceded the onset of the electrical activity. B. Average delays of the optical signals measured from the onset of the ipsilateral electrical activity for 7 experiments. Time 0 corresponds to the onset of slow electrical activity recorded from the ipsilateral ventral root. The color code is the same as in the previous figures. Data are meanÂ±SEM.
