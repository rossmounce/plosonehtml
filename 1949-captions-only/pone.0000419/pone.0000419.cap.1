                Figure 1.  Rooted phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA3) genes of 15 representative influenza A/H3N2 isolates and reference strains.(A) phylogenetic tree generated using sequences obtained from RPM v.1, (B) phylogenetic tree generated using de novo sequences from the same set of the isolates. Reference sequences were obtained from GenBank and indicated in underlined, bold font. Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap values from 1000 replicates. Note: ***-the A/Wyoming/3/03 (with IS)-like isolate. Bootstrap values above 50% were shown at branches. Scale near the bottom of each panel relates the length of a branch to the number of nucleic acid substitutions.
