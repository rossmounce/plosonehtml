Reference sequences were obtained from GenBank and indicated in underlined, bold font. Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap values from 1000 replicates. Note: ***-the A/Wyoming/3/03 (with IS)-like isolate. Bootstrap values above 50% were shown at branches. Scale near the bottom of each panel relates the length of a branch to the number of nucleic acid substitutions.</p>
