The cores and virions are fenestrated in the front to visualize the inner components. A, In intact virus the viral core is dumbbell shaped, the spikes are arranged into small hexagonally arranged crystallites, the DNA is condensed and aligns along the core membrane, the outer membranes are tightly wrapped around the core. The lateral bodies (LB) are seen on both sides of the core. A', upon detachment of the outer membranes by spontaneous rupture or DTT-treatment, the core changes its shape, the spikes appear disordered, but the DNA remains condensed. In disrupted cores the condensed pieces of DNA seemingly pass through openings in the core. B, upon interaction with the plasma membrane the outer membranes and lateral bodies detach from the core. The core becomes ovoid-shaped, the DNA detaches from the core membrane and spreads throughout the core-space. C, upon delivery in to the cytoplasm the core size, shape as well as spikes and DNA do not visibly change their structure as compared to B. We presume that at this stage early transcription may occur. D, the core opens up on one side and the DNA is released as whole in the cytoplasm, a process that is preceded by early transcription and early protein synthesis.</p>
