A, shows several EM grid bars, whereas B is a higher magnification. Bars: 20 µm. C, low magnification electron microscopy images of Ptk2 cells cultivated on an EM-grid. Bar: 2 µm. D, intermediate magnification (typically used for recording tomographic tilt series) EM images of the Ptk2 cells, infected with VV for 5 min. arrows–actin, arrowheads-extracellular virions. Bar: 200 nm</p>
