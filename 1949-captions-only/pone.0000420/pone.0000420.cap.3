Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 500 for 30 min at 37°C, before vitrification in liquid ethane. A, a section (12 nm thick) through a tomogram (see <a href="#pone.0000420.s001">Movie S1</a>) with an extra-cellular virion (V) attached to the plasma membrane (PM); in the tomograms the DNA is randomly distributed (arrow–contact sites of the outer viral membranes with the PM–magnified in C). B, surface rendered representation of the particle in A (green-actin). C, surface rendered representation of the area marked by an arrow in A, showing close contact sites (yellow) between the outer viral membrane and the plasma membrane (magnification 3× as in A and B). D, the virion reveals tubular membrane structures inside the core. E, one of the pore-like structures (arrow) in the core of the particle seen in A (cross-section and surface rendered).
