A, a 30 nm thick section through the tomogram (see <a href="#pone.0000420.s002">Movie S2</a>) showing a virion (V) attached to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane as in <a href="#pone-0000420-g003">Figure 3A</a>; and a core (C) in the cytoplasm. After internalization all of the core-features (including arrangement of spikes and DNA) are similar to particles seen before internalization. Actin stress fibers and microtubules (MT) are in the vicinity of the core, (PMâ€“plasma membrane). B, surface rendered core seen in A. C, the pores (arrow) in the core membrane (section and surface rendering). D, a section through the face view of the viral core reveals the random distribution of the spikes in the palisade layer. E and F, a section (30 nm thick) (see <a href="#pone.0000420.s003">Movie S3A</a>) and surface rendered views (see <a href="#pone.0000420.s004">Movie S3B</a>) of the cytoplasm 60 min. after infection. The VV core is opened on one side and releases the genome (arrow, DNA) as an entity. Around the core a number of cellular structures can be observed (PM-plasma membrane, MT-microtubules, ER-endoplasmic reticulum, if-intermediate filaments). G, cross-section and surface rendered views through the core showing one of the 7 nm pores. Bars-100 nm</p>
