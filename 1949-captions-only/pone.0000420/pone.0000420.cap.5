                Figure 5.  Structure of intact, disrupted and DTT-treated VV.A, projection image of isolated particles after rapid freezing; V-intact virion, C-core without outer membranes. B, Tomography-section (left half) and surface rendered view (right half, using AMIRA visualization program) showing an intact virion from its broad side, exposing the dumbbell-shaped core (the colour code explained in Figure 1), studded with spikes. The virion is surrounded by outer membrane layers connected to the core by the lateral bodies. C, reconstruction of the core in A, two views-perpendicular to each other. The core is ovoid-shaped, the spikes display a random distribution but the DNA remains condensed and aligned along the inner core membrane. D, an isolated particle treated for 30 min at 37Â°C with 40mM DTT, showing the outer membrane layers and two lateral bodies (arrows) detached from the underlying core (c). The lateral body appears to mark the membrane boundaries. E, section through the tomogram and F, surface rendering of a core obtained after DTT treatment. The core has an opening on one side (arrow) through which condensed DNA is extruded (arrowhead). Insert: the core opening viewed from the outer surface of the core, through which a piece of DNA is extruded. G, a piece dissected from the palisade layer of intact virions (SV; upper part); the periodic arrangement of the spikes is depicted graphically by dots in the lower panel. H, random arrangement of spikes of cores (SC) with detached or released outer membranes. Bars-100 nm.
