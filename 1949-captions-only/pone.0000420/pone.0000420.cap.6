                Figure 6.  Structural change of the virus particle by conventional EM.A, isolated and intact VV after embedding in Epon and sectioning. B, VV attached to the plasma membrane (PM) and two intracellular cores (c). The image shows two extracellular virions attached to two different cells that lie next to each other (the plasma membrane (PM) of both cells is indicated). Upon cell surface attachment the extracellular virions changes their shape. In some profiles the detachment of the lateral bodies (LB; arrows) from the underlying core becomes apparent. C, intracellular cores after Epon embedding and sectioning. Shown is a selection of an Epon section displaying a collection of intracellular cores (c). Bar-200 nm.
