                Figure 1.  Distribution of the dynamic connectivity in a protein-derived network.The dynamic connectivity (df) observed in the T4 lysozyme protein (2LZM) is plotted against the probability of finding residues with such dk (P(dk)). In this type of plot, multiple residues are represented in a single dk value.
