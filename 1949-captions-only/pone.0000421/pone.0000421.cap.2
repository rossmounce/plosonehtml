                Figure 2.  Sensitivity vs. Specificity of JAMMING in the T4L-TEM-HIVP set.The average sensitivity (axis labeled &lt;Sensitivity&gt;) and average specificity (axis labeled &lt;Specificity&gt;) over all the 3 proteins included in the T4L-TEM-HIVP set are presented for the predictions performed by JAMMING. Every point corresponds to a different network model according to Table 1: Dcriterion = once is an empty symbol, Dcriterion = average is a filled symbol, pairing hydrophobic residues is represented by a square, pairing complementary charged residues is represented by a triangle, pairing complementary charged residues and hydrophobic residues is represented by a rhombi and pairing every residue at the specified Dcriterion is represented as a circle. The labels (e.g., 0-5) on each symbol in the graph, indicate the minimum and maximum distance used to establish the connections among the residues (see Methods and table 1). For instance, a 0-5 labeling an empty circle corresponds to the sensitivity and specificity obtained from networks derived from the T4L-TEM-HIVP set where any two residues were paired (symbol is a circle) if at least one atom between these residues (Dcriterion = once, represented by an empty symbol) is within 0-5  distance (label 0-5).
