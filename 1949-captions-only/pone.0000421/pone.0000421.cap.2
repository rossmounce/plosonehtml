Every point corresponds to a different network model according to <a href="#pone-0000421-t001">Table 1</a>: D<sub>criterion</sub> = once is an empty symbol, D<sub>criterion</sub> = average is a filled symbol, pairing hydrophobic residues is represented by a square, pairing complementary charged residues is represented by a triangle, pairing complementary charged residues and hydrophobic residues is represented by a rhombi and pairing every residue at the specified D<sub>criterion</sub> is represented as a circle. The labels (e.g., 0-5) on each symbol in the graph, indicate the minimum and maximum distance used to establish the connections among the residues (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> and <a href="#pone-0000421-t001">table 1</a>). For instance, a 0-5 labeling an empty circle corresponds to the sensitivity and specificity obtained from networks derived from the T4L-TEM-HIVP set where any two residues were paired (symbol is a circle) if at least one atom between these residues (D<sub>criterion</sub> = once, represented by an empty symbol) is within 0-5 <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000421.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> distance (label 0-5).</p>
