Every point corresponds to a different network model according to <a href="#pone-0000421-t001">Table 1:</a> D<sub>criterion</sub> = once is an empty symbol, D<sub>criterion</sub> = average is a filled symbol, pairing hydrophobic residues is represented by a square, pairing complementary charged residues is represented by a triangle, pairing complementary charged residues and hydrophobic residues is represented by a rhombus and pairing every residue at the specified D<sub>criterion</sub> is represented as a circle.

For instance, a 0-4 labeling an filled circle corresponds to the sensitivity and specificity obtained from networks derived from the FSSP128 set where any two residues were paired (symbol is a circle) if on average every atom between these residues (D<sub>criterion</sub> = average, represented by a filled symbol) is within 0-4 <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000421.e006&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> distance (label 0-4).</p>
