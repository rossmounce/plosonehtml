                Figure 3.  Sensitivity vs. Specificity of JAMMING in the FSSP128 dataset.The average sensitivity (axis labeled &lt;Sensitivity&gt;) and average specificity (axis labeled &lt;Specificity&gt;) over all the FSSP128 set are presented for the predictions performed by JAMMING. Every point corresponds to a different network model according to Table 1: Dcriterion = once is an empty symbol, Dcriterion = average is a filled symbol, pairing hydrophobic residues is represented by a square, pairing complementary charged residues is represented by a triangle, pairing complementary charged residues and hydrophobic residues is represented by a rhombus and pairing every residue at the specified Dcriterion is represented as a circle. For simplicity, only the results for distance separations of 0-3 , 0-4 , 0-5  and 0-6  are presented. For instance, a 0-4 labeling an filled circle corresponds to the sensitivity and specificity obtained from networks derived from the FSSP128 set where any two residues were paired (symbol is a circle) if on average every atom between these residues (Dcriterion = average, represented by a filled symbol) is within 0-4  distance (label 0-4).
