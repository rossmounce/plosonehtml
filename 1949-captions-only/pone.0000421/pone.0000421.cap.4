The triangles represent the data including 2 low-frequency modes (modes 10 and 11, see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> section); the squares represent the 2 lowest-frequency modes (modes 30 and 31, see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>); the circles represent the data including 5 normal modes. Each mode was used to generate 10 perturbed models from the initial PDB structure (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> section), so the average values in this plot represent 44 (triangles), 44 (squares) and 165 (circles) protein structures. For comparison, the sensitivity and specificity obtained using a single protein structure for each protein in this set is represented in an empty rhomb.</p>
