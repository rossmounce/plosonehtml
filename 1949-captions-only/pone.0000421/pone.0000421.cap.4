                Figure 4.  Sensitivity vs. Specificity of JAMMING using multiple protein structures.The average sensitivity (axis labeled &lt;Sensitivity&gt;) and average specificity (axis labeled &lt;Specificity&gt;) over all the 3 proteins included in the T4L-TEM-HIVP set and its normal mode perturbed models are presented. The triangles represent the data including 2 low-frequency modes (modes 10 and 11, see Methods section); the squares represent the 2 lowest-frequency modes (modes 30 and 31, see Methods); the circles represent the data including 5 normal modes. Each mode was used to generate 10 perturbed models from the initial PDB structure (see Methods section), so the average values in this plot represent 44 (triangles), 44 (squares) and 165 (circles) protein structures. For comparison, the sensitivity and specificity obtained using a single protein structure for each protein in this set is represented in an empty rhomb.
