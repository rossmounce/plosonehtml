                Figure 2.  The effect of interaction between hood presence and predation risk treatment on male attractiveness.The attractiveness (female visits/visits+passes, meanÂ±SE) of males with hoods was higher than that of males without hoods regardless of treatment. Under high predation risk (red circle) males with hoods were more attractive than they were under low predation risk (blue square). The attractiveness of males without hoods was not influenced by risk treatment.
