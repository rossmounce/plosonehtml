                Figure 1.  EST Analysis and Unigene Process.The raw sequence reads of the Expressed Sequence Tags were first purged of poor quality sequence (arrows to right of starting point). The resulting 3,896 reads were deposited to NHLBI GenBank and further analyzed for similarities to genes and gene products in the UNI-PROT_TREMBL databases using BLASTn and BLASTx and putative function with BLAST2GO and KASS. The raw reads were then processed using an iterative scheme to form the unigene set starting with a primary screen to purge sequences originating from the cloning vector, rat host and bacteria, followed by a trimming of the sequence ends to reduce poor quality sequence, using an in house program (qTrim). After trimming, the sequences were again purged of contaminants using BLASTn and BLASTx, then assembled using the CAP3 assembly program. After another round of contaminant removal, 1,632 cDNA clones representing putative unique genes were selected for full sequencing. These sequences were then subjected to the same qTrim program, then assembled by CAP3. The primer design program, Primer3 was used to design primers to close gaps in those clone sequence that did not represent full sequences. After another round of assembly, the cDNA sequences were compared to one another for sequence identity using BLASTn, to identify any redundant gene sequences. This resulted in a set of 1042 unique sequences (both contigs and singletons) of which 994 had significant similarities (E≤10−6) to genes within the UNI-PROT_TREMBL and 48 did not have significant similarities to existing genes (E≥10−6). The unigene set was then analyzed for putative functions by BLAST2GO and KAAS.
