                Figure 1.  Stimuli and Experiment 1 conditions.a) Examples from the set of three dimensional objects employed for Experiments 1 and 2. In both fMRI experiments, on each trial the stimuli were the same and the tasks varied. Stimuli were 3D Plexiglas rectangles that varied in length and pattern but were of constant width and depth. b) Examples from the four conditions in Experiment 1. Subjects viewed two objects presented simultaneously and performed one of four different tasks. In the grasping task, subjects grasped one of the two stimuli along the long axis with the index finger and thumb. In the reaching task, subjects had to touch one of the two objects with their knuckles but without forming a grip. In both tasks, subjects used their right hand. On alternate trials, actions were directed to the left or the right target. For the size discrimination task, subjects had to decide if the two objects were the same in length by pressing a button held in their left hand. For the pattern discrimination task subjects had to decide if the pattern superimposed onto the two objects were the same or different by pressing the same button. In sum, we used 2×2 design contrasting action tasks with perceptual tasks, and tasks that require strong/critical size processing with tasks that required weak/incidental object size processing. In each example, the two illuminated stimuli, the grasparatus and the fixation point are shown from the subject’s point of view. Differently from the pictures, the subjects were not able to see their own hands since the experiment was performed in complete darkness (except for the illumination of the fixation point).
