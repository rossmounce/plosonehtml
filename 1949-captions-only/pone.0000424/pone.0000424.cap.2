                Figure 2.  Individual activation maps and % BOLD signal change (% BSC) in the anterior intraparietal (AIP) sulcus for Experiment 1.a) The exact position of the left AIP localized by comparing grasping versus reaching is shown in the most clear transverse slice for each of the nine subjects. In each subject, AIP (highlighted by a yellow arrow) lay at the junction of the anterior end of the intraparietal sulcus (dotted line) and the inferior segment of the postcentral sulcus (PCS - plain line). Note that in five of the nine subjects AIP is also visible in the right hemisphere. b,d) Bar graphs display the magnitude of peak activation in % BSC in each experimental condition at the level of single subject and group average (the rightmost bars) for left and right AIP. For two of the nine subjects, the peak activation was not computed in the left AIP because no activity was found in that area. c,e) Line graphs indicate the event-related averaged time course in % of BSC for the four experimental conditions in the right and left AIP with time zero indicating the onset of the visual stimuli. Both magnitude of peak activation and event-related averaged time courses show that activation for grasping was higher than that for reaching and that the activation associated with size discrimination did not differ from that associated with pattern discrimination. L = left, R = right, P = posterior.
