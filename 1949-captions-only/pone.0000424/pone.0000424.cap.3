                Figure 3.  Percent of BOLD signal change (% BSC) for Experiment 2 in the left AIP (a,d), in the right AIP (b,e) and in the left LO (c,f) localized by Experiment 1.a,b,c) Line graphs indicate the event‚Äêrelated averaged time courses in % BSC with time zero indicating visual stimuli onset. d,e,f) Bar graphs display the magnitude of peak activation in %BSC in each of the three experimental conditions at the level of single subject and group average (the rightmost bars). Right and left AIP (a,b,d,e) responded to grasping, reaching, and passive viewing, even though higher for grasping. LO (c,f) was equally activated by grasping, reaching, and passive viewing.
