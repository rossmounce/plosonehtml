                Figure 4.  Overlaid activation maps for AIP in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.Selected clusters of voxel activity for grasping versus reaching in the vicinity of AIP for Experiment 1 (depicted in orange) and for Experiment 2 (depicted in light blue) are overlapped on the same axial slice for each subject and for the averaged group data (rightmost slice). Data for two of the nine subjects (s3 and s4) could not be reported because the passive viewing condition was included in Experiment 1 rather than Experiment 2.
