                Figure 5.  Individual activation maps and percent BOLD signal change (% BSC) in the left lateral occipitotemporal (LO) cortex for Experiment 1.a) The exact position of the left LO localized by comparing size discrimination versus pattern discrimination is shown in the clearest sagittal slice for each of the nine subjects. In each subject, LO was below the posterior end of the inferior temporal sulcus (ITS, dotted line). Note that in 2 of the 9 subjects, LO was activated by the reverse contrast of pattern versus size discrimination (reported in blue). b) Bar graphs display the magnitude of peak activation in %BSC in each experimental condition at the level of single subject and group average (the rightmost bars). c) Line graphs indicate the event‐related averaged time courses in % BSC with time zero indicating visual stimuli onset. Both magnitude of peak activation and event‐related averaged time courses showed that size discrimination was higher than pattern discrimination and moreover that grasping did not differ from reaching.
