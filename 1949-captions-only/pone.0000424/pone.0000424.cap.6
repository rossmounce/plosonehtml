The group activation map is based on the Talairach averaged group results shown on group‐averaged. <strong>b</strong>) Event‐related averaged time courses measured in each area for Experiment 1. <strong>c</strong>) Event‐related averaged time courses for Experiment 2 in each of the brain regions localized by Experiment 1. Brain activation is measured in % BSC and time zero indicates visual stimuli onset. For both experiments, Talairach coordinates for the activated areas and p values for the relevant statistical comparisons are shown in <a href="#pone-0000424-t001">Table 1</a>.
