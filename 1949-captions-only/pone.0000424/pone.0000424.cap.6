                Figure 6.  Group activation maps and percent BOLD signal change (% BSC) for grasping minus reaching in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.a) Brain areas activated by comparing grasping vs. reaching in Experiment 1: left primary motor cortex (M1, within the central sulcus), left primary somatosensory cortex (S1, within the postcentral sulcus), the left superior postcentral sulcus (sPCS), the left and right anterior intraparietal sulcus (lAIP and rAIP), the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS), the parieto‐occipital cortex (PO) and early visual cortices (V). The group activation map is based on the Talairach averaged group results shown on group‐averaged. b) Event‐related averaged time courses measured in each area for Experiment 1. c) Event‐related averaged time courses for Experiment 2 in each of the brain regions localized by Experiment 1. Brain activation is measured in % BSC and time zero indicates visual stimuli onset. For both experiments, Talairach coordinates for the activated areas and p values for the relevant statistical comparisons are shown in Table 1. L=left, R=right, P=posterior.
