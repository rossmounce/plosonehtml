The group activation map is based on the Talairach averaged group results shown on group-averaged for clarity on a single subjectâ€™s anatomical (which is not representative of sulcal patterns for all subjects). b) Event-related averaged time courses form each area for Experiment 1. c) Event-related averaged time courses for Experiment 2 in each of the brain regions localized by Experiment 1. Brain activation is measured in % BSC and time zero indicates visual stimuli onset. L = left, R = right, P = posterior.</p>
