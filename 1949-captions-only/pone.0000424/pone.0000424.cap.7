                Figure 7.  Group activation maps and percent BOLD signal change (% BSC) for size minus pattern discrimination in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.Brain areas activated by comparing size versus pattern discrimination in Experiment 1: the left LO, the left posterior end of the IPS (pIPS), the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). The group activation map is based on the Talairach averaged group results shown on group-averaged for clarity on a single subjectâ€™s anatomical (which is not representative of sulcal patterns for all subjects). b) Event-related averaged time courses form each area for Experiment 1. c) Event-related averaged time courses for Experiment 2 in each of the brain regions localized by Experiment 1. Brain activation is measured in % BSC and time zero indicates visual stimuli onset. L = left, R = right, P = posterior.
