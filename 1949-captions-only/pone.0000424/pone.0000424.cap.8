                Figure 8.  Overlaid activation maps for size versus pattern discrimination separated for go and no-go trials in Experiment 1.Brain areas activated for the comparison of size versus pattern discrimination in go trials (depicted in pink), no-go trials (depicted in light blue) and averaged go and no-go trials (depicted in yellow). When go trials and no-go trials were averaged, the contrast of size versus pattern discrimination produced activations in the left LO, the left posterior end of the IPS (pIPS), the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). When only go trials were taken into account, the contrast of size versus pattern discrimination produced quite similar activation in the left LO, the left posterior end of the IPS (pIPS), the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). When no/go trials alone were taken into consideration, the contrast of size versus pattern discrimination produced activations only in the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL).
