                Figure 3.  Classification results of the different classifiers tried.Each panel in the figure corresponds to a different phenotypic difference, according to panel captions. The horizontal axis in each panel corresponds to the one-dimensional projection calculated by the classification algorithm, that signifies distance between biological samples, according to the multi dimensional pathway metrics. The vertical axis is a jitter scatter of the samples to enable a clear view of the separation.
