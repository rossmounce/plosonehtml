                Figure 4.  Examples of the stratification of survival plots and their immediate connections to pathway activity/consistency.(A) (1) Kaplan-Meier survival plot of breast cancer patients from [15], stratified according to clustering based on pathway activity. Panel (2) in (A) shows the activity score of the Sonic hedgehog pathway colored according to affiliation with either of the accordingly colored survival curves in (1); (B) The same analyses done with breast cancer patients from [15], based on the pathway Bone Remodeling (see text for pathway choice). (C) Kaplan Meier survival plots of lung cancer patient data from [17], stratified according to activity of the Csk pathway and the (D) NFKÎ² pathway. In every panel, the (2) sub-panel shows the most influential pathway metric out of the group of stratifying pathways. This does not mean that the pathway represented is responsible for the entire separation into two groups.
