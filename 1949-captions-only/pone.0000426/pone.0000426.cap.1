Genes listed in red were sequenced only in genomic DNAs from 217 tumors (“Group 1”). Genes listed in blue were sequenced only in WGA-treated DNA tumor samples (“Group 2”). Genes in black were sequenced in both groups. Gene nomenclature is as reported in GenBank as of December 2006. See Supplemental <a href="#pone.0000426.s003">Table S3</a> for clinical characteristics of all tumors sequenced.</p>
