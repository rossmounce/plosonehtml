                Figure 2.  Schematic of overall results.A putative variation was defined as a sequence variation compared to a reference sequence in GenBank. After visual inspection and exclusion of known SNPs and silent changes, there were 239 tumor sequences with a variation representing 174 distinct types of variations. The sequence variations were further divided into three groups: 135 variations (99 distinct types) within exons encoding the kinase domains of respective genes, 82 variations (69 types) in exons encoding areas outside the kinase domains of respective kinase genes, and 22 variations (6 types) in RAS family genes. Non-synonymous variations confirmed by sequence analysis of a 2nd PCR were either somatic mutations or variants found in matched normal tissue (listed in Supplemental Table S4). The significance of two novel variants, ERBB2 (exon 20, Arg784Cys) and MAPK6 (exon 4, Val262Ile), is unclear, because we could not determine if the variants were also found in DNA from corresponding normal tissue.
