The glutamic acid residue at position 681 in FGFR4 (boxed) is highly conserved amongst the various kinases. Amino acids affected by mutations and reported in the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database appear in yellow. The analogous Glu914 residue in ERBB2 (boxed) has been found to be mutated in a glioblastoma. Figure adapted from a screenshot of the “Mutagrator” bioinformatics tool developed for this study. The previously reported Pro712Thr mutation in FGFR4 was also identified by the Mutagrator tool but is not shown. See <a href="#s2">methods</a> for more details.</p>
