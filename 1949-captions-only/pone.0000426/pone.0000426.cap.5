The FGFR4 WT and E681K mutant structures are predicted using the PROTINFO software (38) provided by the (PS)2 server (National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan). These predictions are based on crystallographic structure for FGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain (PDB accession 1FGK) (33), as no FGFR4 structure is available, and visualized using VMD (39). FGFR4 Glu681 (yellow), ATP binding site (pink), activation loop (green) and catalytic loop (white). Glu681 (yellow) is nestled between the TK activation and catalytic loops. B. 3D close-up of the surfaces of Glu681 (yellow), Arg650 (green) in the activation loop, and Ala615 (white) in the catalytic loop. Since Glu681 is strongly negatively charged and Arg650 is strongly positively charged, ionic bonding between these two closely juxtaposed residues may be assumed. C. 3D close-up of the surfaces of mutated Lys681 (orange), Arg650 and Ala615. The glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 681 could structurally and functionally alter the kinase domain by flipping the charge of residue 681 and disrupting ionic bonds with neighboring residues, particularly the closely juxtaposed Arg650.</p>
