Binding reactions performed in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold competitor RNAs (with molar excess of 30, 60, 90 and 120 fold, as indicated by the gradients above the gel lanes) were fractionated on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The schematic representation of the RNAs is depicted as in <a href="#pone-0000427-g001">Figure 1</a>. The positions of free RNA and bound complexes are shown. Comparable results were obtained in two independent experiments.</p>
