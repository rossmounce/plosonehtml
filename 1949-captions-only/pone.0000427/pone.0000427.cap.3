Following UV cross-linking and RNAse A/T1 digestion, <sup>32</sup>P labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. B) Cross-linking of <sup>32</sup>P labeled D90 RNA was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of cold competitor RNAs (10 and 30 fold molar excess, as indicated by the gradients above the gel lanes). C) Coomassie–stained SDS-PAGE separated SR proteins (7 µg). Comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments.</p>
