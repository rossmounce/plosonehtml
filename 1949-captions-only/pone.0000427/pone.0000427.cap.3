                Figure 3.  UV cross-linking of a 40 kDa SR protein to exon 23.A) Different 32P labeled RNAs represented as in Figure 1 were incubated at 30°C for 10 min with purified SR proteins. Following UV cross-linking and RNAse A/T1 digestion, 32P labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. B) Cross-linking of 32P labeled D90 RNA was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of cold competitor RNAs (10 and 30 fold molar excess, as indicated by the gradients above the gel lanes). C) Coomassie–stained SDS-PAGE separated SR proteins (7 µg). Comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments.
