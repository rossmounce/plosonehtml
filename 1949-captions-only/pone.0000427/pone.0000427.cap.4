Northern blot analysis was carried out on total RNA prepared 24 hr after transfection, as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Band intensities, quantified by phosphorimager analysis, were normalized for transfection efficiency and RNA recovery to the level of the co-expressed neomycin mRNA (neo). Normalized values were expressed as a percentage of wt mRNAs that were defined as 100. The schematic structure of the substrates is shown on the right part of both panels A and B. Dystrophin exons are identified as in <a href="#pone-0000427-g001">Figure 1</a>. β-globin exons are shown as gray boxes while the 5′ and 3′ UTRs as white thinner boxes. (A) Two exon mini-genes carrying dystrophin exons 22 and 23. (B) Three exon mini-genes carrying dystrophin exon 22 and 23 and 24, chimeric constructs, and the β-globin system (β−globin wt and β−globin 39 carrying a nonsense mutation at codon 39) used as a reference <a href="#pone.0000427-LykkeAndersen1">[81]</a>. Comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Left panel: autoradiogram of a representative quantitative RT-PCR performed as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. The upper bands correspond to RT-PCR products from dystrophin mRNA obtained with primers located in exons 22 and 24; the lower bands correspond to the neomycin gene used as an internal control. −and+lanes correspond to reactions carried out in absence or presence of reverse transcriptase. Right panel: non-quantitative RT-PCR performed as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Mobility of the predicted splicing products is shown on the right. The PCR product deriving from skipping of exon 23 was not detected.</p>
