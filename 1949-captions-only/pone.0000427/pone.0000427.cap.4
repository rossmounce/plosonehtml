                Figure 4.  Splicing of dystrophin mini-genes in vivo.Cos 7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing different portions of the genomic region of the dystrophin gene spanning from exon 22 to exon 23/24. Northern blot analysis was carried out on total RNA prepared 24 hr after transfection, as described in Materials and Methods. Band intensities, quantified by phosphorimager analysis, were normalized for transfection efficiency and RNA recovery to the level of the co-expressed neomycin mRNA (neo). Normalized values were expressed as a percentage of wt mRNAs that were defined as 100. The schematic structure of the substrates is shown on the right part of both panels A and B. Dystrophin exons are identified as in Figure 1. β-globin exons are shown as gray boxes while the 5′ and 3′ UTRs as white thinner boxes. (A) Two exon mini-genes carrying dystrophin exons 22 and 23. (B) Three exon mini-genes carrying dystrophin exon 22 and 23 and 24, chimeric constructs, and the β-globin system (β−globin wt and β−globin 39 carrying a nonsense mutation at codon 39) used as a reference [81]. Comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Left panel: autoradiogram of a representative quantitative RT-PCR performed as described in Materials and Methods. The upper bands correspond to RT-PCR products from dystrophin mRNA obtained with primers located in exons 22 and 24; the lower bands correspond to the neomycin gene used as an internal control. −and+lanes correspond to reactions carried out in absence or presence of reverse transcriptase. Right panel: non-quantitative RT-PCR performed as described in Materials and Methods. Mobility of the predicted splicing products is shown on the right. The PCR product deriving from skipping of exon 23 was not detected.
