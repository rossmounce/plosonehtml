                Figure 1.  Pre-fusion (PDB code 1oke) and post-fusion (PDB code 1ok8) conformations of Dengue virus E protein and the ligand-binding pocket for virtual screening.(A) Dengue virus E protein structures in pre-fusion (gray) and post-fusion (blue) states and the position of the binding regions (black strand representing Dâ€², k, l in pre-fusion state, colored strand representing the post-fusion state). (B) The conformation rearrangement of the binding areas. Higher-order structures and domains I, II, and III are defined according to Modis et al. [11].
