The reference spectrum (red color) is an average from three spectra obtained for mixtures of equal aliquots of 15 urine samples from 5 animals per strain (animals #1–5, 6–10 and 11–15, respectively). Spectra obtained for mixtures of equal aliquots of the 15 urine samples from each strain (black color) were aligned to the reference spectrum. The figure shows a section of the entire chromatogram plotting the total ion current on a logarithmic scale against the retention time. The peaks evaluated in the quantitative analysis are marked (compare <a href="#pone.0000429.s003">Table S1</a>).</p>
