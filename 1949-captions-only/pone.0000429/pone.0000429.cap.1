                Figure 1.  Comparison of GC/MS spectra from mouse urinary volatiles.A total of 45 urine samples were collected from B6J, B6F and ß2mJ mice (15 animals per strain). The reference spectrum (red color) is an average from three spectra obtained for mixtures of equal aliquots of 15 urine samples from 5 animals per strain (animals #1–5, 6–10 and 11–15, respectively). Spectra obtained for mixtures of equal aliquots of the 15 urine samples from each strain (black color) were aligned to the reference spectrum. The figure shows a section of the entire chromatogram plotting the total ion current on a logarithmic scale against the retention time. The peaks evaluated in the quantitative analysis are marked (compare Table S1).
