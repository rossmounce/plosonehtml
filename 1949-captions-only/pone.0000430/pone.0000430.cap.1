Superimposition of images showing GFP and YFP distribution (green) and cell outlines stained with PI (red). Dying cells are bright red due to PI uptake. A.: Cyclin B1;1 time-course after IR. After 24 h, loss of the transition zone results in a reduced meristematic zone still containing division-inactive cells next to a large zone of differentiated cells without CYCB1;1 expression. B.: Distribution of Histone H2B-YFP-stained nuclei. In controls, the rectangle (enlarged in insert) shows (from bottom to top) typical examples of condensed chromatin of G2-like nuclei, early prophase (loss of spherical shape) and metaphase plates. Circled areas show large differentiating cells with high DNA content far from root tip in controls and close to root tip after IR. C.: Epifluorescence microscope image showing expression of DR5-GFP in living root tips 24 h after IR. (Bars = 50 Âµm).</p>
