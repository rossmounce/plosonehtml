                Figure 2.  CLSM optical longitudinal sections of WT and atm stem cells and QC post-IR.Arrowheads point to QC cells and arrows on columella initials. The drawing shows the QC, which contains cells that rarely divide in WT surrounded by initials of stele (brown), endodermis and cortex (green), epidermis and lateral root cap (violet), and columella (pink). WT QC and initials have a normal structure after IR showing periclinally-orientated cells (A, C, E). Anticlinal division of 1 QC cell occurred 1 d post-IR in atm (white arrowhead, F–I) but not 5 h after IR (D). QC cells were either surrounded by dividing cortex and endodermis (green arrowhead) and columella (black arrowhead) initials (G) and/or differentiation of these initials (green and white arrows, respectively) in atm (F–I). Bars = 50 µm.
