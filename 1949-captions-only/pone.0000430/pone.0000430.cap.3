A, G, D, J are CLSM optical longitudinal sections of FDA-stained roots, and the other images are fluorescence micrographs. Arrows show abnormal (E) and incorrect positioning (F) of lateral roots in <em>atm</em>. (D) typical irradiated <em>atm</em> root, the morphology of which is similar to <em>short root, korrigan, shepherd, tonsoku</em>, and brefedin A-treated <em>scd1-1</em> mutants, propyzamide-treated WT, or <em>cyclin B1;1</em> dominant negative mutant (A) to (K) bars = 150 µm; (L) bar = 1500 µm. Red vertical bars indicate the lateral root cap zone, the size of which correlates with root meristem survival.</p>
