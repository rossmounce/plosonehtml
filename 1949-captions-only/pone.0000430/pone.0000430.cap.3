                Figure 3.  WT and atm root development time-course after IR.At the indicated times post-IR, seedlings were stained with PI and either FDA (green cytoplasm) or sytogreen (green nuclei). A, G, D, J are CLSM optical longitudinal sections of FDA-stained roots, and the other images are fluorescence micrographs. Arrows show abnormal (E) and incorrect positioning (F) of lateral roots in atm. (D) typical irradiated atm root, the morphology of which is similar to short root, korrigan, shepherd, tonsoku, and brefedin A-treated scd1-1 mutants, propyzamide-treated WT, or cyclin B1;1 dominant negative mutant (A) to (K) bars = 150 µm; (L) bar = 1500 µm. Red vertical bars indicate the lateral root cap zone, the size of which correlates with root meristem survival.
