(A) : Experimental design for the time course of transcript profiling in WT and <em>atm</em> (genotype) after IR. IR, irradiated seedlings; NIR, non-irradiated seedlings. (B) : Clustering by K-means with Genesis software (all other ratios with any Bonferroni p-values). (C): Manual clustering (all ratios with Bonferroni p-value≤0.05). Ratio scale is on top of each image. Genes of clusters K1–K8 are listed in <a href="#pone.0000430.s007">Tables S1.1 and Table S1.2.</a> (K1–K3) : genes upregulated in WT, and either upregulated (K1), invariant (K2), or downregulated (K3) in <em>atm</em>. (K4–K6): Genes downregulated in WT and either downregulated (K4), invariant (K5), or upregulated in <em>atm</em> (K6). (K7–K8): genes invariant in WT and either upregulated (K7) or downregulated (K8) in <em>atm</em>. (D). Relative distribution of invariant (grey), up- (red), and downregulated (green) genes in WT and <em>atm</em>. All unique genes are compiled in <a href="#pone.0000430.s009">Table S3-A</a>. The gene clustering methodology is described in <a href="#pone.0000430.s003">Fig. S3</a>.</p>
