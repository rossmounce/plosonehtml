Combinations of samples A–D are indicated on top of columns in <a href="#pone.0000430.s008">Tables S2, S2.2, and S2.3</a>. (B) Clustering of 1352 unique genes from two independent biologic samples containing approximately 200 (expt.1) and 100 (expt.2) roots, whose average sizes was 7.1+/−0.8 and 7.3+/−0.9 mm for <em>atm</em> and WT, respectively. (D) Clustering of 475 unique genes from one experiment done with 100 WT or <em>atr</em> roots. Clusters M and R unique genes are listed in <a href="#pone.0000430.s009">Table S3-A</a>. The gene clustering methodology is described in <a href="#pone.0000430.s003">Fig. S3</a>.</p>
