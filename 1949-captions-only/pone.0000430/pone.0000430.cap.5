                Figure 5.  Radiomodulated genes in WT, atm, and atr roots 1 h after IR.(A and C) Experimental design of WT and atm (A), or atr (D) root transcript profiling. Combinations of samples A–D are indicated on top of columns in Tables S2, S2.2, and S2.3. (B) Clustering of 1352 unique genes from two independent biologic samples containing approximately 200 (expt.1) and 100 (expt.2) roots, whose average sizes was 7.1+/−0.8 and 7.3+/−0.9 mm for atm and WT, respectively. (D) Clustering of 475 unique genes from one experiment done with 100 WT or atr roots. Clusters M and R unique genes are listed in Table S3-A. The gene clustering methodology is described in Fig. S3.
