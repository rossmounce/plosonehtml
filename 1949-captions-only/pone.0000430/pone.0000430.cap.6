                Figure 6.  Distribution of radiomodulated genes in roots and seedlings.Venn diagrams show the extent of overlap between roots [3 experiments (M and R clusters)] and seedlings [8 experiments (K) clusters)]. (Red and green) : Up -and downregulated genes. (Blue): Genes with stochastic expression in atm roots. Minimal cores of genes for which expression was lost in atm (diagrams on top) were extracted in Table S3-B as follows: Group A included 74 (up) and 20 (down) genes regulated in all experiments; Group B (42 and 19 genes, respectively) and Group C (54 and 20 genes, respectively) included genes regulated at least once in seedlings and at least once in roots; and Group D&nbsp;included 62 (up) and 5 (down) genes regulated in root experiments only.
