(Red and green) : Up -and downregulated genes. (Blue): Genes with stochastic expression in <em>atm</em> roots. Minimal cores of genes for which expression was lost in <em>atm</em> (diagrams on top) were extracted in <a href="#pone.0000430.s009">Table S3-B</a> as follows: Group A included 74 (up) and 20 (down) genes regulated in all experiments; Group B (42 and 19 genes, respectively) and Group C (54 and 20 genes, respectively) included genes regulated at least once in seedlings and at least once in roots; and Group D&nbsp;included 62 (up) and 5 (down) genes regulated in root experiments only.</p>
