                Figure 7.  Hallmark genes in IR-and ATM-mediated transcript profiling.IR induces DNA lesions resulting in different types of chromatin alterations that also occur through genetic or physiologic disturbance. Examples of downregulated (italics) and upregulated genes (bold) in each functional class (1â€“8) are shown. Examples of misregulated (up or down) genes (standard font) and constitutively deregulated genes (no arrow) in atm or atr. Genes are extracted from Table S3-A.
