Examples of downregulated (italics) and upregulated genes (bold) in each functional class (1â€“8) are shown. Examples of misregulated (up or down) genes (standard font) and constitutively deregulated genes (no arrow) in <em>atm</em> or <em>atr</em>. Genes are extracted from <a href="#pone.0000430.s009">Table S3-A</a>.</p>
