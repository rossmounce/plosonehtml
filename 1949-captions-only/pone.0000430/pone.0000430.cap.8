Cell cycle is severely delayed after activating ATM-mediated DNA damage checkpoints by numerous inhibitors and regulators of proliferation. Cell growth and repair is enabled by upregulation of KRP6 and CYCB1;1, which regulate specific activities of CDKs. Transcriptional, translational, and/or posttranslational regulation of E2F-DPs and other TFs (cell death hMIZ-like, proliferation TCP20/TCP4), hormone (auxin)-responsive groups (ANT, ARGOS, ARF2, AXR2), development group (<em>e.g.</em>, TOPLESS, SCARECROW) in coordination with similar regulation of chromatin modifiers results in specific transcription IR- and S-phase specific patterns. Translesion synthesis, replication, and HR genes indicate an increase in replication HR repair activity. At the organ level, an increase in auxin is associated with disturbance of the whole hormones titration, cell death in the provascular system, and development patterns. Dashed arrows indicate putative links. Except for the group that includes histones, only upregulated genes are shown.</p>
