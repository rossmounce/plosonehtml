                Figure 9.  Putative hallmark regulation steps in stem cell maintenance and transcription response after IR.After IR, both the CDKF;1 pathway and WEE1 are regulated leading to inactive CDKA;1. WEE1, in addition to halting the basal transcription while disrupting in particular HDT/RBR/E2F complexes might specifically drive appropriate transcription as in human cells [152]; both are mediated by ATM. In addition, CDKF;1 is possibly deregulated, resulting in CDKA;1 inactivation. This might be promoted by stabilizing KRP6 by kinases, such as the AtMHK. Only KRP6 was upregulated after IR, however other KRPs might be involved. KRP6 might interact with CYCD3s or CYCD2-CDKs. In irradiated atm, transcription control might be lost due to misegulation of WEE1 and RBR/HDT and division of stem cells (white arrows) is promoted by deregulation of stem cell-maintaining RBR pathway, in addition to PAS2 deregulation and CDKF;1 misregulation. A competition between KRP/CYC/CDK and other regulators in stem cells might also lead to the differentiation of stem cells (green arrows) through ATM-dependent and independent (ATR, others) regulation of pre-existing factors at the time of IR [140]. After ectopic division due to checkpoint abrogation, atm stem cells accumulated high amounts of unrepaired DNA and/or small amounts of DNA lesions that require ATM-Artemis-related DNA repair functions resulting in meristem consumption similar to irradiated human ataxia telangiectasia-cells. Dashed arrows indicate unknown regulators or pathways. Other regulators shown in Fig. 7 were not shown and images are extracted from Fig. 2.
