The CRE is underlined. B: Presence of the CRE-Luc construct in founder and offspring mice was detected by Southern blotting using genomic DNA from tail biopsy. DNA was digested with <em>Bgl</em>II, electrophoresed, and immobilized on a Nylon membrane by capillary blotting. DNA was probed with a [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled 1.6-kb <em>Xba</em>I luciferase gene fragment. Shown is a typical blot with the 1.6 kb bands indicating the transgene. As control served genomic DNA from a luciferase reporter mouse generated previously<a href="#pone.0000431-Beimesche1">[52]</a>.</p>
