                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the DNA construct used to generate transgenic mice.A: Four copies of the rat somatostatin gene promoter CRE (SomCRE) (5′-GATCCTCCTTGGCTGACGTCAGAGAGAGAGTA-3′) were fused with a truncated thymidine kinase promoter (−81 to+52) and the firefly luciferase gene[19]. The CRE is underlined. B: Presence of the CRE-Luc construct in founder and offspring mice was detected by Southern blotting using genomic DNA from tail biopsy. DNA was digested with BglII, electrophoresed, and immobilized on a Nylon membrane by capillary blotting. DNA was probed with a [α-32P]-labeled 1.6-kb XbaI luciferase gene fragment. Shown is a typical blot with the 1.6 kb bands indicating the transgene. As control served genomic DNA from a luciferase reporter mouse generated previously[52].
