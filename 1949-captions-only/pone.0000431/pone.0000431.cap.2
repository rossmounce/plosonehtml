Luciferase antibody binding was visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining on sagittal sections (brown reaction product in A to D); the section in D was counter stained with cresyl violet. Note that Luciferase immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation (Hip) of the transgene mouse (A) is stronger than in the control (B). In the cerebellum (Cer in C), the molecular (mol) and the granule cell layer (gcl) as well the interposed nuclei (int) show moderate immunoreactivity. In the locus coeruleus (LC in D), distinct cells (brown) are moderately stained by the antibody. Abbreviations: cc, corpus callosum; CA1 and CA3, hippocampal regions cornu ammonis 1 and 3; DG, dentate gyrus; scp, superior cerebellar peduncle; Me5, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus; me5, mesencephalic trigeminal tract; 8n, vestibulocochlear nerve. Scale bars: 500 µm (in A, B, C) and 200 µm (in D).</p>
