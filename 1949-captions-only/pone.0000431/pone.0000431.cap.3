A coronal brain section was covered with the substrate luciferin and emitted light was visualized with a slow scan CCD camera system (pseudocolour image with red representing strong and blue representing low enzymatic activity). Luciferase activity was detected predominantly in cortex (cort) and to lesser extend in the hypothalamus (HT). Shown is a representative section on a level with the optic chiasm. Scale bar: 2 mm. B: Quantification of luciferase expression in different brain regions. Luciferase enzyme activity was measured in homogenates of different brain regions and normalized to protein concentrations. Highest enzyme activity was detected in cortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Values are means±SEM (standard error of the mean) from 6 animals. C. Forskolin-induced reporter gene expression. Coronal vibratome sections of fresh brains (interaural from 0–6) from CRE-Luc mice were incubated with 10 µM forskolin for 6 h and luciferase activity was determined. Forskolin treatment resulted in a 1.93 fold increase of luciferase activity (means±SEM from 7 independent experiments). Significant difference **: p&lt;0.01; Wilcoxon test for paired samples.</p>
