                Figure 4.  Effect of chronic social stress on reporter gene expression.Male CRE-Luc mice were either not treated (open bars) or exposed daily to social stress for 25 days (black bars). A: Luciferase activity was measured in homogenates of different brain regions, normalized to protein contents and expressed as percentage of the mean value in controls (unstressed littermates) (±SEM from 7 animals). Stress increased luciferase activity in all brain regions reaching statistical significance in cerebellum, pons, colliculi and hippocampus. Significant differences *, p&lt;0.05; ***, p&lt;0.001; #, p = 0.059 as determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's post hoc test. B: Quantification of CREB and phospho-CREB levels by western blot analysis. Homogenates of the respective regions were submitted to immunoblotting using specific CREB and phospho-CREB antibodies. Intensity of specific bands was determined densitrometrically and ratios between CREB and phospho-CREB were calculated. Unstressed littermates served as controls. Values are means±SEM from 3 animals. Significant differences *, p&lt;0.05; ***, p&lt;0.001; #, p = 0.078 as determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's post hoc test. PFC: prefrontal cortex
