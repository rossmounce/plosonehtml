                Figure 5.  Effect of imipramine on the stress-induced increase in CRE/CREB-directed luciferase expression.Male CRE-Luc mice were either solvent treated (white bars) or exposed to chronic social stress for 25 days and treated with imipramine for 21 days (black bars) while the daily stress exposure continued. Luciferase activity was measured in homogenates of different brain regions and normalized to protein contents and expressed as percentage of the mean value in controls (solvent-treated littermates) (Â±SEM from 9 animals). In all brain regions, imipramine reversed the stress-induced increase in luciferase activity resulting in data close to control. PFC: prefrontal cortex
