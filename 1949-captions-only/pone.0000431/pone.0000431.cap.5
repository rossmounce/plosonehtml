Luciferase activity was measured in homogenates of different brain regions and normalized to protein contents and expressed as percentage of the mean value in controls (solvent-treated littermates) (Â±SEM from 9 animals). In all brain regions, imipramine reversed the stress-induced increase in luciferase activity resulting in data close to control. PFC: prefrontal cortex</p>
