                Figure 6.  Effect of imipramine on stress-induced CREB phosphorylation.Male CRE-Luc mice were exposed to chronic psychosocial stress with or without concurrent imipramine treatment for 21 days. Homogenates of whole brains were submitted to immunoblotting using specific CREB and phospho-CREB antibodies. Intensity of specific bands was determined densitrometrically and ratios between CREB and phospho-CREB were calculated. Solvent-treated littermates served as controls. Values are meansÂ±SEM from 5 animals. Significant difference: *:p&lt;0.05; Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Schaich Hamerle-post hoc test.
