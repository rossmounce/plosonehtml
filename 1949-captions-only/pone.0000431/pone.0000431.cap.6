Homogenates of whole brains were submitted to immunoblotting using specific CREB and phospho-CREB antibodies. Intensity of specific bands was determined densitrometrically and ratios between CREB and phospho-CREB were calculated. Solvent-treated littermates served as controls. Values are meansÂ±SEM from 5 animals. Significant difference: *:p&lt;0.05; Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Schaich Hamerle-<em>post hoc</em> test.</p>
