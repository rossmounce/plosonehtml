The most likely cyclin partner of Lsk1p based on this analysis, SPCC530.13, is shown in red. The phylogeny was created by MEGA version 3.1 software using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Sp, <em>Schizosacharomyces pombe</em>; Dm, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>; Hs <em>Homo sapiens</em>; Mm <em>Mus musculus</em>; Sc <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. (B) ClustalW alignment comparing <em>S. pombe</em> SPCC530.13, <em>S. cerevisiae</em> Ctk2p, and human cyclin T. (C) Ten-fold serial dilutions of logarithmically growing cultures were plated onto YES plates containing 0.5 µM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) and incubated at 32°C for 3 days. (D) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase at 32°C and then treated with 0.3 µM LatA for 5 hours before being fixed and stained with DAPI (nuclei) and aniline blue (cell wall/septa). Bar, 10 µM. (E) Cells of the indicated genotype were freshly streaked to YES plates and incubated for 24 hours at 36°C. Bar, 50 µM.</p>
