                Figure 1.  Strains bearing the lsc1Δ or lsk1-K306R mutations display highly similar cytokinesis defects as compared to lsk1Δ mutants.(A) A phylogeny analyzing the relationship between S. pombe cyclins (black type) and the cyclin partners of Lsk1p relatives in budding yeast, mouse, human, and Drosophila (blue type). The most likely cyclin partner of Lsk1p based on this analysis, SPCC530.13, is shown in red. The phylogeny was created by MEGA version 3.1 software using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Sp, Schizosacharomyces pombe; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Hs Homo sapiens; Mm Mus musculus; Sc Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (B) ClustalW alignment comparing S. pombe SPCC530.13, S. cerevisiae Ctk2p, and human cyclin T. (C) Ten-fold serial dilutions of logarithmically growing cultures were plated onto YES plates containing 0.5 µM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) and incubated at 32°C for 3 days. (D) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase at 32°C and then treated with 0.3 µM LatA for 5 hours before being fixed and stained with DAPI (nuclei) and aniline blue (cell wall/septa). Bar, 10 µM. (E) Cells of the indicated genotype were freshly streaked to YES plates and incubated for 24 hours at 36°C. Bar, 50 µM.
