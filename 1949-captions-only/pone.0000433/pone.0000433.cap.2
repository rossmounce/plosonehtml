Bar, 3 µM. (B) Wild-type, Lsk1-HA, Lsc1-myc, and Lsk1-HA Lsc1-myc cells were grown to mid-log phase and lysed under native conditions. A portion of the lysates were subjected to anti-HA and anti-myc immunoprecipitations. Both total lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the myc epitope. (C) Cells of the indicated genotype, carrying integrated GFP tagged versions of Lsk1p or Lsc1p under the control of their native promoter, were grown to mid-log phase in YES media, fixed, and then stained with DAPI (nuclei) and antibodies specific for microtubules and GFP. Bar, 3 µM. (D) Lsk1-HA, Lsk1-K306R-HA, Lsk1-HA Lsc1-myc, and Lsk1-K306R-HA Lsc1-myc cells were grown to mid-log phase in YES and lysed under native conditions. A portion of the lysates were subjected to anti-HA and anti-myc immunoprecipitations. Both total lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the myc epitope.</p>
