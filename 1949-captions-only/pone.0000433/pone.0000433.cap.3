Total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the unphosphorylated form of the CTD (8WG16), the Ser-5 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H14), the Ser-2 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H5), as well as antibodies specific for the Arp3 protein (loading control). Arrowheads indicate bands of increased mobility derived from <em>rpb1-12xCTD</em> and <em>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</em> mutants, while arrows indicate Rpb1p protein bands derived from the wild-type <em>rpb1</em> locus.</p>
