                Figure 3.  Lsk1p and Lsc1p are required for Ser-2 phosphorylation of the heptad repeats found in the carboxy-terminal domain of the Rpb1p sub-unit of RNA pol II.Cells were grown to mid-log phase in YES, and then treated either with 0.3 ÂµM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) for 2 hours. Total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the unphosphorylated form of the CTD (8WG16), the Ser-5 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H14), the Ser-2 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H5), as well as antibodies specific for the Arp3 protein (loading control). Arrowheads indicate bands of increased mobility derived from rpb1-12xCTD and rpb1-12xS2ACTD mutants, while arrows indicate Rpb1p protein bands derived from the wild-type rpb1 locus.
