                Figure 4.  Over-expression of the CTD phosphatase, Fcp1p, causes defects in cytokinesis.(A) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase in minimal media containing thiamine and then re-cultured in the presence or absence of thiamine for a further 18 hours. Cells were then treated with 0.3 µM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) for 5 hours and subsequently fixed and stained with DAPI (nuclei) and aniline blue (cell wall/septa). Bar, 10 µM. (B) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase in minimal media containing thiamine and then re-cultured in the presence or absence of thiamine for a further 18 hours. Cells were then treated with 0.3 µM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) for a further 2 hours. Total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the unphosphorylated form of the CTD (8WG16), the Ser-5 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H14), the Ser-2 phosphorylated form of the CTD (H5), as well as antibodies specific for the Arp3 protein (loading control).
