                Figure 6.  Mutation of Ser-2 to alanine in the heptad repeats of the carboxy-terminal domain of Rpb1p results in cytokinesis defects.(A) Ten-fold serial dilutions of logarithmically growing cultures were plated onto YES plates containing 0.5 µM LatA or DMSO (solvent control) and incubated at 32°C for 3 days. (B) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase at 32°C and then treated with 0.3 µM LatA for 5 hours before being fixed and stained with DAPI (nuclei) and aniline blue (cell wall/septa). Bar, 10 µM. (C) Cells of the indicated genotype were freshly streaked to YES plates and incubated for 24 hours at 34°C. Bar, 50 µM. (D) Cells of the indicated genotype were grown to mid-log phase at 24°C and then shifted to 34°C for 5 hours before being fixed and stained with DAPI (nuclei) and aniline blue (cell wall/septa). Bar, 10 µM.
