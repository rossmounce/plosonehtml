Plotted are for different values of noise strength, σ = 0.01,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.1, 0.2 with different color. Hereafter we mainly present the numerical results for <em>M</em> = 64 and <em>k</em> = 8. At each generation there are <em>N</em> individuals. <em>N<sub>s</sub></em> = <em>N</em>/4 networks with higher values of <em>F̅</em> are selected for the next generation, from which mutants with a change in a single element <em>J<sub>ij</sub></em> are generated. For the average of fitness, <em>L</em> runs are carried out for each. Unless otherwise mentioned, we choose <em>N</em> = <em>L</em> = 300, while the conclusion to be shown does not change as long as they are sufficiently large. (We have also carried out the selection process by <em>F</em> instead of <em>F̅</em>, but the conclusion is not altered if <em>N</em> is chosen to be sufficiently large.) Throughout the paper, we use <em>β</em> = 7.</p>
