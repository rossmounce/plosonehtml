                Figure 1.  Evolutionary time course of the fitness F̅.The highest (a) and the lowest (b) values of the fitness F̅ among all individuals that have different genotypes (i,e., networks Jij) at each generation are plotted. Plotted are for different values of noise strength, σ = 0.01,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.1, 0.2 with different color. Hereafter we mainly present the numerical results for M = 64 and k = 8. At each generation there are N individuals. Ns = N/4 networks with higher values of F̅ are selected for the next generation, from which mutants with a change in a single element Jij are generated. For the average of fitness, L runs are carried out for each. Unless otherwise mentioned, we choose N = L = 300, while the conclusion to be shown does not change as long as they are sufficiently large. (We have also carried out the selection process by F instead of F̅, but the conclusion is not altered if N is chosen to be sufficiently large.) Throughout the paper, we use β = 7.
