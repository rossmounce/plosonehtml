The minimal fitness is computed from the time average of the least fit network present at each generation (green, from 100 population, and light blue from 300). The evolution speed is plotted, measured as the inverse of the time required for the top individual to reach the maximal fitness 0. <em>V<sub>g</sub></em> is computed as the variance of the distribution <em>P</em>(<em>F̅</em>) at 200th generation.</p>
