                Figure 2.  Average fitness &lt;F̅&gt;, lowest average fitness F̅min, evolution speed, and variance of the fitness Vg are plotted against the noise strength σ.&lt;F̅&gt;, the average of the average fitness F̅ over all individuals is computed for 100–200 generations (red cross, from the simulation with population of 100 individuals, and purple square from 300 individuals). The minimal fitness is computed from the time average of the least fit network present at each generation (green, from 100 population, and light blue from 300). The evolution speed is plotted, measured as the inverse of the time required for the top individual to reach the maximal fitness 0. Vg is computed as the variance of the distribution P(F̅) at 200th generation.
