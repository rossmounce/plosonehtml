                Figure 3.  Distribution P(F̅) after 200 generations, for population of 1000 individuals.Inset is the magnification for −0.2&lt;F̅&lt;0. For high σ (red, with σ = 0.1), the distribution is concentrated at F̅ = 0, while for low σ (green, with σ = 0.006), the distribution is extended to large negative values, even after a large number of generations.
