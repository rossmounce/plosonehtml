                Figure 4.  Relationship between Vg and Vip. Vg is computed from P(F̅) at each generation, and Vip by averaging the variance of p(F; gene) over all existing individuals.(We also checked by using the variance for such gene network that gives the peak fitness value in P(F̅), but the overall relationship is not altered). Plotted points are over 200 generations. For σ&gt;σc≈.02, both decrease with generations.
