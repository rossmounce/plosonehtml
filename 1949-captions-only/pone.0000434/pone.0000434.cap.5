Then we simulate this network under new noise strength <em>σ</em>′ from the initial condition −1,−1,…,−1 over 10000 runs, to check how many of them reach the target pattern (i.e., <em>x<sub>i</sub></em>&gt;0 for <em>i</em> = 1 to 8). Plotted is the fraction of such runs against the noise strength <em>σ</em>′. Different color corresponds to the value of the original noise strength <em>σ</em> used for the evolution of the network.</p>
