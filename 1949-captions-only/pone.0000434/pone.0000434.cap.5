                Figure 5.  Dependence of the fraction of the runs that reach the target expression pattern. Networks that had the top fitness value under noise σ were simulated at a different noise σ′.We first generate a network as a result of evolution over 200 generations under the noise strength σ, and select such network Jij that has the top fitness value. Then we simulate this network under new noise strength σ′ from the initial condition −1,−1,…,−1 over 10000 runs, to check how many of them reach the target pattern (i.e., xi&gt;0 for i = 1 to 8). Plotted is the fraction of such runs against the noise strength σ′. Different color corresponds to the value of the original noise strength σ used for the evolution of the network.
