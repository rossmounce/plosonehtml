                Figure 6.  Distribution of the fitness value when the initial condition for xj is not fixed at −1, but is distributed over [−1,1]. We choose the evolved network as in Fig. 5, and for each network we take 10000 initial conditions, and simulated the dynamics (1) without noise to measure the fitness value F after the system reached an attractor (as the temporal average 400&lt;t&lt;500). The histogram is plotted with a bin size 0.1.
