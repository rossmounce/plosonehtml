We choose the evolved network as in <a href="#pone-0000434-g005">Fig. 5</a>, and for each network we take 10000 initial conditions, and simulated the dynamics (1) without noise to measure the fitness value <em>F</em> after the system reached an attractor (as the temporal average 400&lt;<em>t</em>&lt;500). The histogram is plotted with a bin size 0.1.</p>
