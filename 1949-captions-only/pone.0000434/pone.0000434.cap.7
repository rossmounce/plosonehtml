                Figure 7.  Schematic representation of the basin structure, represented as a process of climbing down a potential landscape.Î” is the magnitude of perturbation to jump over the barrier to a different attractor from the target. Smooth landscape is evolved under high level noise (above), and rugged landscape is evolved under low level noise (below).
