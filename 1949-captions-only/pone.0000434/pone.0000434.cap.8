                Figure 8.  Schematic representation of an orbit in the phase space.The solid curve is an original orbit from the initial condition (I) to the target attractor (T). Dashed curves are orbits perturbed by noise. When orbits encounter turning points, they escape the original basin of attraction and may be caught in another attractor. Mutations, on the other hand, are able to move the position of turning points.
