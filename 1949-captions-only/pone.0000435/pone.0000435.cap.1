                Figure 1.  Western blot analysis of short-time incubation experiments.a) Western blot detection of PrPC extracted from soil mixed with non-infectious brain homogenate (5% pork brain in German standard soil). Several different buffers and solutions were used for extraction. Lane 1: water; lane 2: Triton X-100; lane 3: 1% urea; lane 4: 1% SDS; lane 5: Zwittergent; lane 6: RIPA buffer; lane 7: NP-40; lane 8: Na-sarcosyl. b) Western blot detection of PrP27-30, the proteinase K-resistant core of PrPSc, extracted by using 1% SDS from soil contaminated with 263 K scrapie brain homogenate from hamsters after 1 h of incubation (dilution series). PrPSc could be detected in soil samples containing 1.25 Âµg or higher amounts of scrapie brain tissue after extraction with 1% SDS-solution. Samples were digested with proteinase K prior to Western blotting.
