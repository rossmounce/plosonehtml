Lane 1: PK-digested 263K scrapie hamster brain homogenate containing 5×10<sup>−7</sup> g of brain tissue (positive control); lanes 2–10: PrP27-30 extracted at time point 0 (lane 2), after 1 month (lane 3), after 3 months (lane 4), after 6 months (lane 5), after 12 months (lane 6), after 18 months (lane 7), after 21 months (lane 8), after 26 months (lane 9) and after 29 months (lane 10). b) Deglycosylated PrP27-30 extracted from prion contaminated soil. Lane 1: PK-digested 263K scrapie hamster brain homogenate containing 5×10<sup>−7</sup> g of brain tissue (positive control); lane 2: soil-extracted PrP27-30 after 21 months; lanes 3 and 4: deglycosylated soil-extracted PrP27-30 after 21 months (lane 3) and after 18 months (lane 4). c) PMCA amplification of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> extracted from contaminated soil. Lane 1: PK-digested 263K scrapie hamster brain homogenate containing 5×10<sup>−7</sup> g of brain tissue (positive control); lanes 2–6: sample signals after 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 cycles of PMCA, respectively.</p>
