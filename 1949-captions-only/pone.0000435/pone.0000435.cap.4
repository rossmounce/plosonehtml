Lane 1: negative control hamster; lane 2: hamster H19 fed 12 times with aqueous extracts of soil samples from month 26 and 29; lane 3: hamster H4B fed 12 times with soil samples from month 26 and 29; lane 4: scrapie-contaminated soil (18 months); lane 5: scrapie-contaminated soil (21 months); lane 6: negative soil sample. b) Western blot typing of electrophoretic mobilities and glycosylation characteristics of PrP27-30 from different hamster-adapted TSE reference isolates, and from hamsters perorally challenged with 263K scrapie-contaminated soil. Lane 1: ME7-H scrapie agent; lane 2: hamster-adapted BSE-isolate (BSE-H); lane 3: 263K scrapie agent, lane 4: H10 (hamster 10, fed 12 times with soil samples from months 26 and 29); lane 5: H7 (hamster 7 fed 12 times with soil samples from month 26 and 29).</p>
