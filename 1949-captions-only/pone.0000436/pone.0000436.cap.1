                Figure 1.  Analysis of SDHB R46X mRNA mutation.A. The SDHB gene has 843 bp coding nucleotides spread to 8 exons within ~35 kb at chromosome band 1p36.13. The 5â€²- portion of the gene shows the position of the R46X mutation and the mitochondrial signal peptide cleavage site (filled circle). B. Sequence chromatograms of RT-PCR products show samples that have high (top), low (middle), or undetectable (bottom) amounts of mutant R46X sequences. C. Quantification of the mutant fraction involved TaqI RE digestion of fluorescently-labeled RT-PCR products and capillary gel electrophoresis. The red peaks denote the molecular weight marker. D. The agarose gel electrophoresis shows variable fractions of mutant RT-PCR products from normal PBMCs detected by TaqI RE digestion, which releases two bands 159 and 126 bp in size from the wild-type sequence (also see Fig. S1A). E. Fractions of TaqI RE resistant transcripts in the purified PBMC cell types are shown in an agarose gel. The negative image is presented to enhance the visibility of mutant transcripts.
