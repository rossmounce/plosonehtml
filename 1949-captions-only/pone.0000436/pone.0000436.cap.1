The <em>SDHB</em> gene has 843 bp coding nucleotides spread to 8 exons within ~35 kb at chromosome band 1p36.13. The 5â€²- portion of the gene shows the position of the R46X mutation and the mitochondrial signal peptide cleavage site (filled circle). B. Sequence chromatograms of RT-PCR products show samples that have high (top), low (middle), or undetectable (bottom) amounts of mutant R46X sequences. C. Quantification of the mutant fraction involved <em>Taq</em>I RE digestion of fluorescently-labeled RT-PCR products and capillary gel electrophoresis. The red peaks denote the molecular weight marker. D. The agarose gel electrophoresis shows variable fractions of mutant RT-PCR products from normal PBMCs detected by <em>Taq</em>I RE digestion, which releases two bands 159 and 126 bp in size from the wild-type sequence (also see <a href="#pone.0000436.s001">Fig. S1A</a>). E. Fractions of <em>Taq</em>I RE resistant transcripts in the purified PBMC cell types are shown in an agarose gel. The negative image is presented to enhance the visibility of mutant transcripts.</p>
