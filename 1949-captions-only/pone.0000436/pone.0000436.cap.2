                Figure 2.  The steady-state fraction of mutant SDHB cDNAs resistant to TaqI RE digestion.Each circle represents a sample from a different subject (total indicated by n) except for those in the PHA stimulated PBMCs which were obtained from two normal donors, stimulated by 2.5 µg/ml and 5.0 µg/ml concentrations of PHA and tested at days 2, 5 and 8 for a total of 12 samples. The value corresponding to each circle was derived from three RT-PCR reactions. Two outlier PBMC values were shown at the top with their mutant transcript fractions in parentheses. Boxes and the vertical lines denote the means and their 95% confidence intervals of samples sets. “PBMC mutation carrier” group contains 5 SDHC and 24 SDHD mutation carriers. The leukemic cell lines were derived from B cells (n = 3), T cells (n = 9), NK cells (n = 1) and monocytes (n = 2).
