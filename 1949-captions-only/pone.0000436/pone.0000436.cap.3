B. Gel electrophoresis of <em>Taq</em>I RE-digested (mutation) enrichment PCR (<span class="underline">e</span>PCR) products shows variable amounts of mutant gDNAs at 233 bp size (pointed by an arrow head), which are confirmed to be primarily composed of c.136C&gt;T by sequencing (<a href="#pone-0000436-t001">Table 1</a>). <em>Taq</em>I digestion of wild-type <span class="underline">e</span>PCR products gives two bands at sizes, 101 and 132 bp (shown by a star). C. <span class="underline">e</span>PCR analyses of leukemic cell lines demonstrate the presence of mutant gDNA in the MOLT-4 cell line (pointed by an arrow head) but not in other leukemic cell lines in this experiment. D. Direct sequence analysis of a gDNA <span class="underline">e</span>PCR product shows selective enrichment of the R46X mutation. E, F. Sequence chromatograms of the heterozygous DNA mutations detected in two T-ALL cell lines are shown.</p>
