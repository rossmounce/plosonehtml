                Figure 4.  SDH genetic downregulation as a mechanism for early detection of hypoxia.Data from PGL research suggest that SDH normally inactivates a messenger(s) critical for downstream hypoxia-signaling. Consequently, heterozygous SDH germ line mutations over-activate the hypoxia signaling pathways in PGL. Loss of the wild-type allele by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) leads to constitutive hypoxic signaling and tumorigenesis in PGL. Transcript mutations, genomic imprinting, balancing selection or germ line mutations are postulated to reduce SDH activity and change the hypoxia-detection threshold from a lower oxygen concentration (a) to higher oxygen concentrations (b, c), thus leading to earlier detection of impending hypoxia.
