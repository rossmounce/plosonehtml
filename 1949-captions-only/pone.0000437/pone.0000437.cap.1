RT-PCR using aldolase and <em>IFT20</em> primers (positions indicated by arrowheads) on total RNA from IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells grown with (+) or without (−) tetracycline for 72 hours, showing <em>IFT20</em> RNA silencing. B. Growth curve of induced (+) and non-induced (−) IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells. C. Field of IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 72 h and stained with MAb25 (axoneme [AXO] marker, green) and DAPI (blue) showing cells without flagella or with a flagellum of shorter length. D. Proportion of cells with a flagellum during induction of RNAi silencing in IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> or in DHC1b<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> (extent of <em>DHC1b</em> RNAi knock-down has been previously demonstrated <a href="#pone.0000437-Kohl3">[17]</a>) E. Scanning electron micrographs of IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 72 h illustrating three kinds of cells: with a normal flagellum (a), with a short flagellum (b) and without flagellum at all (c). F. Length of the new flagellum (when present) in bi-nucleated cells of the indicated cell lines. Cells were grouped in categories according to the indicated flagellar length. G–I. Bi-nucleated cells from non-induced (G) and 72h-induced IFT20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells (H–I) stained with MAb22 (basal body marker [BB], yellow), MAb25 (axoneme [AXO] marker, green) and DAPI (blue).</p>
