                Figure 3.  FAZ restricts basal body migration.A. Non-induced (a) or 48h-induced (b) DHC1bRNAi cells treated with calcium, leading to de-polymerisation of the microtubule corset but not of the FAZ filament. Samples were stained with L6B3 (FAZ marker, red), KMX (anti-tubulin, axoneme [AXO] marker, green) and DAPI (blue). Contacts between old and new FAZ filaments are visible (orange arrow), even in the absence of a new flagellum. The position of the FC on the non-induced cell (top panels) is indicated by a white arrow. B. Length of the new FAZ relative to that of the new flagellum in the indicated cell lines (n&gt;100). FAZ length was measured using the DOT-1 or the L3B2 monoclonal antibody in IFT20RNAi and DHC1bRNAi cells respectively. Please note that spots corresponding to IFT20RNAi cells without a flagellum are hidden by the corresponding spots from DHC1bRNAi cells. C. Basal body migration relative to FAZ length in the same cells as in H (excepted for IFT20RNAi cells where basal body migration was measured in a separate experiment).
