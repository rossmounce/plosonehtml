RT-PCR using <em>TBBC</em> and aldolase primers demonstrates specific <em>TBBC</em> RNA silencing as described at <a href="#pone-0000437-g001">Fig. 1A</a>. B. Western blot analysis of TBBC<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells grown with tetracycline for the indicated periods of time. The same membrane was probed with antibodies against the indicated proteins. C. Immunofluorescence of TBBC<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 72 h with the anti-TBBC antibody (yellow) stained with DAPI (blue) showing two bi-flagellated cells, one with normal TBBC staining (left) and one without labelling (right, see insets). Lack of flagella connection is exclusively observed in the latter category. D. Scanning electron micrograph of bi-flagellated cells from TBBC<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 48 h. The tip of the new flagellum is free and the flagellum is detached at early (a) and late (b) stages of elongation. E. Glutaraldehyde fixation of similar cells coming from the same population but analysed after DAPI staining. F. The proportion of cells with a deconnected and detached new flagellum (n = 100) during the course of induction (analysed by scanning electron microscopy [SEM] or phase contrast optics [PC]). G–H. Cross-sections of attached (G) or detached (H) flagella from TBBC<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 72 h revealing similar ultra-structural organisation. I–K. Detergent-extracted cytoskeletons of 72h-induced TBBC<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells. When the new flagellum is still connected to the old (I), a clear FC structure is visible (arrowhead). By contrast, no FC is recognised when the new flagellum is not connected, no matter flagellum length (J–K). J. L3B2 staining revealing interactions between old and new FAZ (yellow arrow).</p>
