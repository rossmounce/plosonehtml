                Figure 8.  Inhibition of tip-to-base motility leads to multiple cell cycle defects.A. Phase contrast images of methanol-fixed PF16RNAi cells induced for 24, 48 and 72 h (left to right) stained with DAPI (blue). Arrows point at kinetoplast aberrantly positioned and stars indicate detached flagella. Bâ€“C. Distribution of cells according to kinetoplast (K) and nucleus (N) number in PF16RNAi cells (B) and PF20RNAi cells (C) grown in the presence of tetracycline for the indicated number of days.
