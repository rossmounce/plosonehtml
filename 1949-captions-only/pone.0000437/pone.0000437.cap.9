Paraformaldehyde-fixed PF16<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cell induced for 48 h stained with DAPI (blue) and ROD-1 (PFR, green). Only one kinetoplast is visible with two nuclei, two flagella and un-segregated basal bodies. B. Scanning electron micrograph revealing the presence of the FC at the distal end of the detached but not de-connected new flagellum. C. Flagellum attachment and basal body migration in bi-flagellated cells in the indicated cell lines during the course of RNAi silencing (n&gt;50). Dâ€“E. PF16<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells induced for 48 h with a detached new flagellum (a), with a detached <span class="underline">and</span> de-connected new flagellum (b) and a uniflagellated cell whose flagellum is not positioned properly (c). D. Scanning electron micrographs. E. Detergent-extracted cytoskeletons stained with MAb22 (basal body [BB] marker, yellow), L3B2 (FAZ marker, red, and DAPI (blue, left panel) or with ROD-1 (PFR marker, that is found in the flagellum as soon as it emerges from the flagellar pocket, green), L3B2 (FAZ marker, red) and DAPI (blue, right panels). F. FAZ length measured using the L3B2 antibody is reduced in PF16<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> or PF20<em><sup>RNAi</sup></em> cells with a detached new flagellum at all stages of flagellum elongation (n&gt;100). Grey shows control cells (see <a href="#pone-0000437-g002">Fig. 2</a>). G. Basal body migration compared to FAZ elongation in the same cells.</p>
