                Figure 1.  Proportion of 454 pyrosequencing DNA fragments that exhibited SNPs.No match indicates a DNA fragment not from M. mulatta. A near match indicates a DNA fragment with at least a 98% match to M. mulatta but unsuitable for SNP detection. A perfect match indicates a DNA fragment with a 100% match with M. mulatta. A SNP indicates a DNA fragment with a near perfect match with M. mulatta and suitable sequence for SNP detection.
