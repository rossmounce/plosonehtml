A near match indicates a DNA fragment with at least a 98% match to <em>M. mulatta</em> but unsuitable for SNP detection. A perfect match indicates a DNA fragment with a 100% match with <em>M. mulatta</em>. A SNP indicates a DNA fragment with a near perfect match with <em>M. mulatta</em> and suitable sequence for SNP detection.</p>
