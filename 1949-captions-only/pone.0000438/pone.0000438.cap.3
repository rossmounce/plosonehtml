<h4>Confirmation of Candidate SNPs</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>We were able to confirm the presence of 26 high-frequency SNPs (63.4%) out of the 41 loci sequenced in a pooled sample of four rhesus macaques (<a href="#pone-0000438-t001">Table 1</a>). Five of the 21 high-frequency SNPs were found in regions characterized as homologues to genes in humans. Based on the small number of individuals in the pooled sample the SNP frequencies should be considered as approximations. It is likely that most of the remaining 15 SNPs are of low-frequency but some may be useful as population specific markers for ancestry identification. A subset of three SNPs confirmed in the pooled sample was also confirmed with 100% accuracy in the DNA sequences of individuals used in the pooled sample. These results suggest that a majority of the candidate SNPs identified using this method will be high frequency and will be useful genetic markers for mapping QTLs, genetic management <a href="#pone.0000438-Kanthaswamy1">[8]</a>, and determining relatedness.</p>
