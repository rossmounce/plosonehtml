                Figure 1.  Spontaneous bursting activity in the leech and hippocampal networks.(A) Left: isolated leech ganglion with eight suction pipettes recording from different roots. Right: Extracellular recordings showing the spontaneous electrical activity monitored from four different roots. (B) Left: close-up of dissociated hippocampal neurons grown on MEA. The black dot corresponds to an individual electrode. Right: spontaneous activity recorded from four extracellular electrodes (out of 60). (Câ€“D) Network firing rate binned at 500 ms for a representative leech network (C) and a representative hippocampal network (D). Note the presence of large peaks corresponding to concerted bursts of electrical activity and the difference between the two spike scales.
