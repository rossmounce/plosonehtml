                Figure 10.  Bursts statistics in the presence of synaptic blockers.Bursts size and duration distributions for leech (reddish lines) and hippocampal (bluish lines) networks obtained using burst definition 1. (A–B) In the presence of APV, the number of large bursts decreased. The black dashed line has a slope of −1.5 in (A) and of −2 in (B), as in the right and left column of Figure 9, respectively. (C–D) In the presence of GABAA receptor blockers (PTX/bicuculline), peaks corresponding to large bursts appeared (indicated by the arrows). Traces were shifted to superimpose peaks of each preparation. In hippocampal networks, intermediate size bursts are absent as shown by the discontinuity of the distributions.
