Data binned at 20 ms are fitted by a Poisson distribution. Data binned at 500 ms are fitted by a lognormal distribution. (C–D) Network correlation coefficient <em>ρ̅</em> as a function of the bin width for 10 leech (C) and 10 hippocampal networks (D) showing a bin width-dependent growth. Each symbol corresponds to a different preparation.</p>
