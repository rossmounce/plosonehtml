                Figure 2.  Network firing correlation.(A–B) Spikes per bin distribution of the network firing rate binned at 20 ms (filled symbols) and 500 ms (open symbols), in leech (A) and hippocampal networks (B). Data binned at 20 ms are fitted by a Poisson distribution. Data binned at 500 ms are fitted by a lognormal distribution. (C–D) Network correlation coefficient ρ̅ as a function of the bin width for 10 leech (C) and 10 hippocampal networks (D) showing a bin width-dependent growth. Each symbol corresponds to a different preparation.
