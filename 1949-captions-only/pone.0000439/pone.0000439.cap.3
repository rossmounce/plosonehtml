                Figure 3.  Single neurons dynamics.(A and E) Extracellular recording from a single electrode in the leech (A) and in the hippocampal network (E) showing the activity of neurons with periodic (A), Poissonian (E) and bursting (A and E) firing. (B and F) ISI distribution of identified neurons with exponential dynamics for leech (B) and hippocampal (F) network. Black dashed lines indicate exponential fit. (C and G) ISI distribution of identified neurons with bi-exponential dynamics for leech (C) and hippocampal (G) network. Black dashed lines indicate bi-exponential fit. (D and H) ISI distribution of identified neurons with periodic dynamics for leech (D) and hippocampal (G) network. Label T indicates the position of the peak, corresponding to the period of the firing.
