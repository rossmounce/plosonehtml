Each line of the raster plot represents the activity of a single neuron. Bi-exponential neurons have been clustered and are indicated by the black vertical bar. (C–D) Fraction of neurons displaying bi-exponential ISI distribution as a function of the network correlation coefficient for leech (C) and hippocampal networks (D). Each point represents a different experiment. Black dashed lines indicate linear regression.</p>
