                Figure 4.  Single neurons dynamics and network bursts.(A–B) Network firing rate (upper panel) and raster plot (lower panel) for leech (A) and hippocampal (B) network. Each line of the raster plot represents the activity of a single neuron. Bi-exponential neurons have been clustered and are indicated by the black vertical bar. (C–D) Fraction of neurons displaying bi-exponential ISI distribution as a function of the network correlation coefficient for leech (C) and hippocampal networks (D). Each point represents a different experiment. Black dashed lines indicate linear regression.
