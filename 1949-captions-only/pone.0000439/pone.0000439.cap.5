                Figure 5.  Single neurons and network frequency analysis.(A–B) Power spectral density (PSD) of representative neurons in different green shades from leech (A) and hippocampal networks (B). The PSD of the firing of a single neuron ranges from an almost flat behavior to very high power associated to low frequencies. (C–D) PSD of the network firing rate for representative experiments from leech (C) and hippocampal networks (D). Black dashed lines correspond to 1/f slope, describing the PSD for frequencies smaller than 1 Hz. In both panels, higher and lower traces are vertically shifted for clarity, by factors 1.2 and 0.8 respectively.
