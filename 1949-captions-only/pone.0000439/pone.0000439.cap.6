                Figure 6.  Effects of synaptic blockers on the network activity.(A–B) Changes in the network firing rates binned at 500 ms for leech (A) and hippocampal (B) networks, in control (black trace), in the presence of 20 µM APV (blue trace) and 10 µM PTX (red trace, panel A) or bicuculline (red trace, panel B). Note the residual spiking activity between periods of synchronous activity in the hippocampal network (inset, right red trace; large peaks have been truncated for clarity).
