                Figure 7.  Effects of synaptic blockers on single neurons dynamics.(A–B) Neurons from leech (A) and hippocampal (B) networks, having a bi-exponential ISI distribution in control (black trace), and an exponential ISI distribution in the presence of 20 µM APV (blue trace). (C–D) Neurons from leech (C) and hippocampal (D) networks, having an exponential ISI distribution in control (black trace), and a bi-exponential ISI distribution in the presence of 10 µM PTX (red trace, panel C) or bicuculline (red trace, panel D).
