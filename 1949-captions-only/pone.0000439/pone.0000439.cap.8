(C–D) Spikes per bin distribution of the network firing rate in leech (C) and hippocampal (D) networks. Data were fitted by a lognormal function in normal conditions (grey symbols). In the presence of 20 µM APV (blue symbols) data were fitted by a Poisson distribution for the leech network and by a lognormal distribution for the hippocampal network. Note the reduction of skewness in the presence of APV in both preparations (see text). Red symbols correspond to spike per bin distribution in the presence of 10 µM PTX (C) and bicuculline (D). (E–F) PSD of the network firing rate in control (black trace), in the presence of APV (blue trace), PTX (E, red trace) or bicuculline (F, red trace). Black dashed lines have 1/f slope.</p>
