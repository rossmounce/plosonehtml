Data from representative experiments obtained in leech (reddish lines) and hippocampal networks (bluish lines). Bursts size (on the left) and duration (on the right) distributions are calculated according to definition 1 (A, B), definition 2 (C, D), and definition 3 (E, F). Black dashed lines are power laws with a slope of −1.5 in the left column and −2 in the right column. Note the power law behavior of bursts size distribution of hippocampal networks for 3 log units.</p>
