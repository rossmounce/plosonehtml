                Figure 9.  Burst statistics.Probability distributions of burst size and duration computed according to 3 different burst definitions. Data from representative experiments obtained in leech (reddish lines) and hippocampal networks (bluish lines). Bursts size (on the left) and duration (on the right) distributions are calculated according to definition 1 (A, B), definition 2 (C, D), and definition 3 (E, F). Black dashed lines are power laws with a slope of −1.5 in the left column and −2 in the right column. Note the power law behavior of bursts size distribution of hippocampal networks for 3 log units.
