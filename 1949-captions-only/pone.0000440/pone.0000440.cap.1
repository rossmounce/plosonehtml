                Figure 1.  Design and plasma membrane expression of VSFP2s.A: A pair of CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) is attached to the 4-transmembrane-voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of Ci-VSP. B, C: Confocal fluorescence (B) and transmission images (C) of PC12 cells transfected with VSFP2D. Note the targeting of the fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. Scale bar is 30 Î¼m.
