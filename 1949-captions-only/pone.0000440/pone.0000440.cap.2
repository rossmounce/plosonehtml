                Figure 2.  Fluorescence signals induced by membrane depolarization in PC12 cells.A: Sample traces of cyan fluorescence, yellow fluorescence and the ratio of yellow/cyan fluorescence (average of 27 traces). Lower traces indicate times of shutter opening and membrane depolarization from −70 mV to 150 mV. B: Average changes in cyan fluorescence and yellow fluorescence induced by depolarization to 150 mV. Labels A–D indicate VSFP2A (11 cells), VSFP2B (7cells), VSFP2C (7cells), VSFP2D (7 cells). C: Average changes in the ratio of yellow and cyan fluorescence induced by depolarization to 150 mV. (D) Ratio of yellow/cyan fluorescence versus test membrane voltage. Lines are Boltzmann fits. Bars in B–D are SEM.
