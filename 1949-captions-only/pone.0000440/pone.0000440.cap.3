Traces are grand averages over average responses from 6 cells. (B) Ratio of yellow/cyan fluorescence versus test membrane voltage. Connected symbols are data from individual cells. Red line is Boltzmann fit with V<sub>1/2</sub> value of −68.4 mV. (C) Voltage dependence of on and off time constants.</p>
