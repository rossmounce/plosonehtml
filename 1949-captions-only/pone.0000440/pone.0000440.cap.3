                Figure 3.  Characteristics of VSFP2.1. Response-voltage relationship and kinetics of VSFP2.1 at 35°C.(A) Ratio of yellow/cyan fluorescence during a family of 500 ms voltage steps from a holding potential of −70 mV to test potentials of −140 mV to +40 mV (20 mV increments). Traces are grand averages over average responses from 6 cells. (B) Ratio of yellow/cyan fluorescence versus test membrane voltage. Connected symbols are data from individual cells. Red line is Boltzmann fit with V1/2 value of −68.4 mV. (C) Voltage dependence of on and off time constants.
