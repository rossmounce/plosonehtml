                Figure 4.  VSFP2.1 responds to physiological neuronal membrane signals.PC12 cells expressing VSFP2.1 were voltage clamped with a voltage trace obtained from a current-clamped mouse olfactory bulb mitral cell. The mitral cell was stimulated to generate a series of action potentials by intracellular injection of a current pulse (A) or by electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve (B). Traces in (A) are averages of 50 sweeps, upper traces in (B) are the average of 90 sweep and the lower four traces in (B) are single sweeps. Traces show membrane potential (V), yellow fluorescence (Fy), cyan fluorescence (Fc) and the ratio of yellow and cyan fluorescence (Fy/Fc). Fluorescence signals were digitally low pass filtered (0.2 kHz) and were not corrected for dye bleaching. Recordings were done at 35Â°C.
