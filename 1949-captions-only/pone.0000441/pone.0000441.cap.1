                Figure 1.  (A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression pattern of all 9,106 expressed probe sets detected on the HG-U95Av2 GeneChip in 43 ovarian tumor samples.Samples beginning with AD are adenomas, with CA are carcinomas, and CC are patients pre-treated with chemotherapy. Samples divided into two major clusters termed adenoma-like and carcinoma-like. (B) Hierarchical clustering of the 1,527 probe sets that were significantly altered (&gt;2-fold, FDR&lt;1%) between the carcinoma-like and adenoma-like samples.
