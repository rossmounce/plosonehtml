                Figure 4.  Gene interaction network of altered genes associated with cell cycle regulation and cancer as determined by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis.Genes colored red showed increased expression in carcinomas relative to adenomas and in green had decreased expression in carcinomas relative to adenomas. Increased levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin B2 (CCNB2), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), E2F3, E2F5, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDC2 and CDK7) as well as decreased levels of p57 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN1C) and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma (GADD45G) are all consistent with carcinomas having higher proliferation rates than adenomas. Interactions of these genes with p53 are highlighted as green lines.
