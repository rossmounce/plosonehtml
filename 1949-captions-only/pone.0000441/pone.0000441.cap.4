Increased levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin B2 (CCNB2), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), E2F3, E2F5, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDC2 and CDK7) as well as decreased levels of p57 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN1C) and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma (GADD45G) are all consistent with carcinomas having higher proliferation rates than adenomas. Interactions of these genes with p53 are highlighted as green lines.</p>
