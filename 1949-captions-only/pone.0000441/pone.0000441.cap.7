                Figure 7.  Cumulative survival curves of ovarian carcinoma patients treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Seventy percent of neo-adjuvant cancer patients whose tissue gene expression profiles clustered with those of cancer patients not pre-treated with chemotherapy have survived five years after surgery. In contrast, only thirty percent of patients whose expression arrays clustered with benign adenoma patients prior to surgery survived five years after surgery. Although the trends are clear, because of the limited sample size of the cohort of patients for which follow-up data were available (A-L group n = 13; C-L group n = 11), the differences are marginally insignificant (p&lt;0.191, logrank test). The survivorship data used in the computation of the Kaplan-Meier plot can be found in the supplementary material (Figure S2).
