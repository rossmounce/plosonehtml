Plotted are the mean standard deviations from the theoretically expected random value for fly ISI series and the random series generated by a Poisson process. The fly deviations are all significantly larger than the values for the computer-generated series. B–Log-log plots of ISIs. The Lévy exponent μ is calculated from the inclination of the linear fit. A Lévy distribution is defined as 1&lt;μ&lt;3. Smaller values indicate a larger proportion of long ISIs. A Cox Process (<em>cox</em>) reveals a similar power-law structure as the flies. Error bars are S.E.M.s throughout. See <a href="#s4"><em>Methods</em></a> for details and statistics.</p>
