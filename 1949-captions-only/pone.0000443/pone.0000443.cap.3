                Figure 3.  Spontaneous behavior is not simply random.A–GRIP analysis of ISIs. Plotted are the mean standard deviations from the theoretically expected random value for fly ISI series and the random series generated by a Poisson process. The fly deviations are all significantly larger than the values for the computer-generated series. B–Log-log plots of ISIs. The Lévy exponent μ is calculated from the inclination of the linear fit. A Lévy distribution is defined as 1&lt;μ&lt;3. Smaller values indicate a larger proportion of long ISIs. A Cox Process (cox) reveals a similar power-law structure as the flies. Error bars are S.E.M.s throughout. See Methods for details and statistics.
