All three fly groups show a significant deviation from 0.5. The deviation of branched Poisson processes (<em>BPP</em>), however, depends on the nonlinearity of the filter function used to drive the Poisson processes and is significantly smaller than that of fly ISI series. *-significant difference from 0.5.</p>
