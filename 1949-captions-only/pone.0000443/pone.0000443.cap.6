Depicted are the averaged results for fly ISIs and raw yaw torque series (for clarity, only <em>openloop</em> data are shown here), together with two automat simulations. The fly ISI series shows a slightly improved forecast skill with increasingly nonlinear S-map solutions (increasing Θ). Fly yaw torque series yield both a better overall forecast skill as well as increased nonlinear improvement. The automat simulation can be tuned to produce both linear and nonlinear output. B–Sample raw yaw torque data traces from a real fly and the two versions of the simulated agent depicted in A (automat 1, automat 2). S-Map results for the other two groups are depicted in <a href="#pone.0000443.s005">Fig. S5</a>.</p>
