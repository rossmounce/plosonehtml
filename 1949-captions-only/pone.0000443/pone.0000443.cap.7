                Figure 7.  Suggested models for open-and closed-loop experiments.A–Open-loop model as proposed in Fig. 1b (for the openloop group). B–Closed-loop model (for the onestripe and uniform groups). Performance in a situation with a closed reafferent feedback loop is commonly modeled with a state estimator, cross-correlating sensory input with recent motor commands via an efference copy (EC). Such an evaluation is required for efficient behavioral control of incoming sensory data.
