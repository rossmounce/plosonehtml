                Figure 1.  Relationships between the Gini ratio of income inequality and early indicators of biodiversity loss.(A) Number of threatened plant and vertebrate species across countries; the curve shows the best-fit bi-variate power relationship. (B) Number of declining permanent resident bird species across US states; the line shows the best-fit bi-variate linear relationship. Of the apparent outliers in both Figure 1A and 1B, only those identified in the course of the multi-variate analyses described in the text are labeled.
