                Figure 1.  Schematic of the model for L-LTP induction.Electrical stimuli (tetanus or theta-burst) elevate synaptic and nuclear Ca2+. Steep sigmoidal functions of synaptic Ca2+ and nuclear Ca2+ transduce Ca2+ elevations into activation of synaptic tagging (elevation of the variable TAG) and activation of gene expression (elevation of GPROD). These sigmoidal functions are denoted Th1 and Th2. Equations are given in Methods. High synaptic Ca2+ elevations are required to set the tag for L-LTP. L-LTP is simulated by increase of a synaptic weight W at a rate proportional to the product of TAG and GPROD. (B) Model of a group of synapses converging on a single postsynaptic neuron. At each synapse, ongoing activity is modeled with brief Ca2+ transients at theta frequency (see Methods for details). Strengthening of any of the weights W1â€¦WN increases the amplitude of Ca2+ transients at that synapse and the level of nuclear Ca2+. In turn, increased synaptic Ca2+ synergizes with increased nuclear Ca2+ to strengthen the corresponding synaptic weight.
