                Figure 2.  Simulation of tetanic and theta-burst L-LTP.(A) At t = 2 hrs, three tetani are simulated at 5-min intervals. Each tetanus is simulated by concurrent 1-sec elevations of synaptic and nuclear Ca2+ to 0.9 µM and 0.45 µM respectively. Ca2+ elevations induce synthesis of GPROD and TAG. The time course of GPROD is vertically scaled (multiplied) by 3.0. (B). The rate of synaptic weight increase is proportional to the product, or overlap, of TAG and GPROD (time course of OV-P). The change in W(tetanic) is L-LTP of ~140%. L-LTP induced by a theta-burst stimulus is of similar magnitude, as illustrated by the W(TBS) time course.
