                Figure 3.  Simulation of the synaptic tagging protocol of [32].Parameter values, including stimulus parameters, are as in Fig. 2. At t = 2 hr, synapse 1 is given three tetani at 10-min intervals, increasing TAG1, GPROD, and W1. Thirty-five min after tetani, GPROD synthesis is blocked, but GPROD remains elevated, decaying slowly. At t = 3 hr, synapse 2 is given three tetani. TAG2 and W2 are increased as a result. Time courses of GPROD, W1, and W2 are vertically scaled by 3.0.
