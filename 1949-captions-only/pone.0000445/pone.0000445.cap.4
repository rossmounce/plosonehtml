                Figure 4.  A bifurcation diagram illustrates bistability of synaptic weight.The bifurcation parameter kltp is the rate constant for increases in W during L-LTP. As kltp increases past 0.014, a steady state of high W appears. In this state, the time average of synaptic [Ca2+] is elevated (running average taken over 10 min of Ca2+ transients). Consequently the tag for L-LTP is set (TAG is near 1.0), allowing for continual reinforcement of L-LTP. Synaptic [Ca2+] is vertically scaled by 4.0. Parameters other than kltp are at their standard values (Table 1).
