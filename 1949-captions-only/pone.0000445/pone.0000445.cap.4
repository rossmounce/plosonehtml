As k<sub>ltp</sub> increases past 0.014, a steady state of high W appears. In this state, the time average of synaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is elevated (running average taken over 10 min of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients). Consequently the tag for L-LTP is set (TAG is near 1.0), allowing for continual reinforcement of L-LTP. Synaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is vertically scaled by 4.0. Parameters other than k<sub>ltp</sub> are at their standard values (<a href="#pone-0000445-t001">Table 1</a>).</p>
