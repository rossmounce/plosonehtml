                Figure 5.  Time courses of W, GPROD, TAG, and time-averaged synaptic Ca2+ following 3 tetani to the single synapse of Fig. 4.Tetanus parameters are as in Fig. 2. Initially, W is in the low steady state of Fig. 4. The tetani elevate TAG, GPROD, and W. (A) With continuous background synaptic activity, TAG, GPROD, and W converge to the high steady state of Fig. 4. kltp = 0.4 hr−1, well to the right of the range in Fig. 4, so the high state of W is close to 1. Synaptic [Ca2+] is vertically scaled by 4.0 and GPROD is scaled by 0.5. Other parameters are as in Figure 4. (B) Tetani also induce a transition to the high steady state with episodic, rather than continuous, background synaptic activity. Periods (15 sec) of brief Casyn and Canuc elevations at theta-rhythm frequency are separated by intervals (45 sec) with no activity. All other parameters are as in (A) except kltp = 1.0 hr−1.
