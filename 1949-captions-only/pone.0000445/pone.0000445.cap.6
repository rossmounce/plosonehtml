                Figure 6.  Bistability is robust to parameter and equation changes.(A) Scatter plot with 31 points. The x-axis plots values of W in the low steady state of Fig. 5A, and the y-axis gives values of W in the high steady state. The control point (red square) corresponds to all parameters at standard values (Table 1). To generate the other points, the parameters were successively changed by plus or minus 30%. Most points are clustered very close to the control point. (B) Bifurcation diagram analogous to Fig. 4. To generate this diagram, one power of ST was removed from Eq. 1, and one power of SP was removed from Eq. 3. Parameter values are as in Fig. 4 except kphos = 3,330 hr−1, ksyn = 220 hr−1.
