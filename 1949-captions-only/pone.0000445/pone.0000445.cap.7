Ca<sub>syn</sub> varies continuously (black envelope) due to the brief imposed elevations that represent synaptic activity. At <em>t</em> = 60 hrs, L-LTP is induced by tetanic stimulation (parameters in <a href="#s2">Methods</a>). Ca<sub>syn</sub> is briefly elevated due to the tetanus (black vertical line). As W increases after tetanus, positive feedback between W and synaptic activity increases the amplitude of the Ca<sub>syn</sub> transients. Ca<sub>nuc</sub> increases less. (B) Time courses of synaptic variables –activities of CAMKII and MAPK, and TAG. The tetanus briefly elevates TAG, which at first starts to decline. However, the increase in W and the corresponding increase in Ca<sub>syn</sub> activate CAMKII and MAPK, which phosphorylate substrates and subsequently increase TAG. (C) Time courses of nuclear CAMKIV activity, GPROD, and W. In (B) and (C), time courses of CAMKII and GPROD are vertically scaled by 0.2 and 15.0, respectively. Parameter values are as in <a href="#pone-0000445-t001">Table 1</a> and in <a href="#pone.0000445-Smolen1">[33]</a> (their Table I) except for the following changes. From <a href="#pone-0000445-t001">Table 1:</a> Ca<sub>tet</sub> = 1.0 µM, Ca<sub>limit</sub> = 1.0 µM, K<sub>syn</sub> = 10.0, K<sub>sum</sub> = 0.1 µM. From <a href="#pone.0000445-Smolen1">[33]</a>: k<sub>W</sub> = 0.22 µM<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, τ<sub>W</sub> = 700 min, V<sub>P</sub> = 0.02 µM<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, τ<sub>P</sub> = 50 min, k<sub>f,Raf</sub> (basal) = 0.</p>
