                Figure 7.  Bistability of synaptic weight in the model of [33] with ongoing synaptic activity.(A) Time courses of synaptic and nuclear Ca2+. Casyn varies continuously (black envelope) due to the brief imposed elevations that represent synaptic activity. At t = 60 hrs, L-LTP is induced by tetanic stimulation (parameters in Methods). Casyn is briefly elevated due to the tetanus (black vertical line). As W increases after tetanus, positive feedback between W and synaptic activity increases the amplitude of the Casyn transients. Canuc increases less. (B) Time courses of synaptic variables –activities of CAMKII and MAPK, and TAG. The tetanus briefly elevates TAG, which at first starts to decline. However, the increase in W and the corresponding increase in Casyn activate CAMKII and MAPK, which phosphorylate substrates and subsequently increase TAG. (C) Time courses of nuclear CAMKIV activity, GPROD, and W. In (B) and (C), time courses of CAMKII and GPROD are vertically scaled by 0.2 and 15.0, respectively. Parameter values are as in Table 1 and in [33] (their Table I) except for the following changes. From Table 1: Catet = 1.0 µM, Calimit = 1.0 µM, Ksyn = 10.0, Ksum = 0.1 µM. From [33]: kW = 0.22 µM−1 min−1, τW = 700 min, VP = 0.02 µM−1 min−1, τP = 50 min, kf,Raf (basal) = 0.
