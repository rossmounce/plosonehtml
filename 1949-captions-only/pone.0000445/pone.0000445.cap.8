The frequency of ongoing activity is periodically decreased at synapses 1–4, but is kept high at synapse 5. Synaptic scaling is implemented as described in <a href="#s2">Methods</a> (Eq. 14). Synapses 1–4 repeatedly gain memory due to L-LTP, and also repeatedly lose their memory due to decreases in ongoing activity. In contrast, the memory at synapse 5 is preserved. (A) Time courses of synaptic weight for synapse 4 (blue trace) and for synapse 5. Model parameters are as in <a href="#pone-0000445-t001">Table 1</a>. Arrows, imposed decreases of activity at synapse 4, which decrease W<sub>4</sub>. (B) Details of the dynamics at another synapse, synapse 2. Repeated L-LTP switches W<sub>2</sub> to the high state and elevates synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (red trace, time-averaged and scaled as in <a href="#pone-0000445-g005">Fig. 5A</a>) and the tag. Arrows, imposed decreases of activity at synapse 2. Between state transitions of W<sub>2</sub>, smaller fluctuations of synapse 2 variables occur as a consequence of switches in the states of synapses 1, 3, and 4.</p>
