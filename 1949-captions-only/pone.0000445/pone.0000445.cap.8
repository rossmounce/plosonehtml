                Figure 8.  Simulation of maintenance and forgetting of simple memories, with each memory represented by strengthening of one of five synapses.L-LTP – inducing tetani (simulated as in Fig. 5) are periodically repeated at all synapses. The frequency of ongoing activity is periodically decreased at synapses 1–4, but is kept high at synapse 5. Synaptic scaling is implemented as described in Methods (Eq. 14). Synapses 1–4 repeatedly gain memory due to L-LTP, and also repeatedly lose their memory due to decreases in ongoing activity. In contrast, the memory at synapse 5 is preserved. (A) Time courses of synaptic weight for synapse 4 (blue trace) and for synapse 5. Model parameters are as in Table 1. Arrows, imposed decreases of activity at synapse 4, which decrease W4. (B) Details of the dynamics at another synapse, synapse 2. Repeated L-LTP switches W2 to the high state and elevates synaptic Ca2+ (red trace, time-averaged and scaled as in Fig. 5A) and the tag. Arrows, imposed decreases of activity at synapse 2. Between state transitions of W2, smaller fluctuations of synapse 2 variables occur as a consequence of switches in the states of synapses 1, 3, and 4.
