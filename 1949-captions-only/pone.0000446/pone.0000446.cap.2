                Figure 2.  Equilibration and calibration of REMS simulations of TC5b in explicit water.A. Instantaneous potential energy (U) as a function of MD time during evolution of the 273 K replica in the canonical NVT ensemble prior to initiating REMS, demonstrating its equilibration, as reflected in the energetic stability during the last 50 ps. B. Instantaneous potential energy (U) as a function of MD time upon replica exchange from 276 to 273 K, demonstrating thermalization in less than 2 ps. C. Average potential energy 〈U〉 of 273 K replica as a function of energy smoothing time (ts). As ts approaches 2000 fs, the standard deviation of &lt;U&gt; approaches the fluctuation of the energy distribution in that time domain. At ts  =  200 fs, energy-smoothed 〈U〉 of REMS is statistically indistinguishable from the instantaneous U used during conventional REM; double-sided p = 0.73. Bars represent ±1σ.
