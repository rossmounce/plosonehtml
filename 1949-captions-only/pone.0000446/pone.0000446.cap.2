Instantaneous potential energy (<em>U</em>) as a function of MD time during evolution of the 273 K replica in the canonical <em>NVT</em> ensemble prior to initiating REMS, demonstrating its equilibration, as reflected in the energetic stability during the last 50 ps. B. Instantaneous potential energy (<em>U</em>) as a function of MD time upon replica exchange from 276 to 273 K, demonstrating thermalization in less than 2 ps. C. Average potential energy 〈<em>U</em>〉 of 273 K replica as a function of energy smoothing time (<em>ts</em>). As <em>ts</em> approaches 2000 fs, the standard deviation of &lt;<em>U&gt;</em> approaches the fluctuation of the energy distribution in that time domain. At <em>ts</em>  =  200 fs, energy-smoothed 〈<em>U</em>〉 of REMS is statistically indistinguishable from the instantaneous <em>U</em> used during conventional REM; double-sided <em>p</em> = 0.73. Bars represent ±1σ.</p>
