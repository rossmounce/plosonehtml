                Figure 3.  REMS calculation of approximately canonical ensembles of pure water.A. Histograms of potential energies (U) of different temperature replicas, demonstrating energy overlaps between adjoining temperature REMS replicas, as required for efficient MC exchange. B. Comparison of histograms of potential energies (U) of water ensembles at 273 K calculated using canonical MD (NVT) and REMS. Usage of REMS yields statistically indistinguishable mean energies and slightly increased energy fluctuations, as compared to those of canonical MD simulations, as shown by their normal fits (solid curves). C. Heat capacities at constant volume (CV) of pure water at different temperatures, as obtained experimentally (solid squares), and calculated using canonical MD (dotted diamonds) and REMS (dashed circles). Usage of REMS with extremely long smoothing time of 600 fs (REMS*, solid stars) leads to a significant underestimation of the heat capacity of water at low temperature.
