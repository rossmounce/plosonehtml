Mean probabilities 〈<em>P</em>〉 of MC exchange between adjoining replicas <em>x<sub>n</sub></em> and <em>x<sub>m</sub></em> as a function of temperature, demonstrating that usage of REMS leads to efficient replica exchange. B. Exchanges of replicas in the temperature space, tracking the initial lowest (red dashed) and highest (blue solid) containing the predominantly native and unfolded states, respectively, as they diffuse in temperature space in the course of the simulation. C. Divergence of the normalized difference (<em>Δ</em>) of fraction of formed hydrophobic core W<sup>6</sup>:P<sup>19</sup> (closed squares), hydrophobic core Y<sup>3</sup>:W<sup>6</sup> (open circles), salt bridge D<sup>9</sup>:R<sup>16</sup> (closed stars), α-helical Y3:L7 (solid circles) and the β-turn D9:S14 (open squares) hydrogen bonds between initial and final structures as a function of replica exchange for the 363 K replica. These measure were chosen because their non-local nature should be most sensitive to initial configuration memory effects. The total length of REMS simulation exceeds the apparent computational time constant of self-diffusion by nearly three orders of magnitude.</p>
