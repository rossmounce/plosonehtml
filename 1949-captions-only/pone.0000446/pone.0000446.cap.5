                Figure 5.  Thermal stability of TC5b.A. Fraction of formed α-helix L2YIQWLK8 (dashed black), β-turn S14 (solid green), and polyprolyl helix P18 (dotted blue), as defined using self-consistent clustering and enumeration of their backbone dihedral angles. Note that P18 remains unchanged in its backbone conformation due to its definition in CHARMM. Individual α-helical residues have varying thermal stability, with the more N-terminal ones being less stable, consistent with the existence of α-helical fraying. B. Fraction of formed α-helical salt/secondary bridge Q5:K8 (solid red), α-helical hydrogen bond Y3:L7 (dotted red), β-turn/tertiary salt bridge D9:R16 (solid blue), β-turn hydrogen bond D9:S14 (dashed green), tertiary hydrophobic core W6:P19 and Y3:P19 (solid and dashed black), and secondary hydrophobic core Y3:W6 (dashed red), as defined by using self-consistent clustering and enumeration of their distances. Note that the α-helical salt/secondary bridge is only partially formed at low temperature, even though the rest of the structure is nearly fully folded by other measures. Similarly, the secondary hydrophobic core Y3:W6 persists even at high temperature, where the rest of the protein is largely unfolded by other measures. Importantly, substantial amount of residual native structure persists at high temperature. C. Fraction of formed mean α-helical structure (dashed black), mean β-turn structure (solid green), mean tertiary structure (solid black) in the REMS calculated ensembles, and native fraction measured experimentally using chemical shift dispersion (squares), as adapted from the first study of TC5b [28].
