                Figure 6.  Manifold of unfolded mesostates.Mapping of the unfolded state ensemble, as calculated using the 363 K replica, onto the two top coordinates of its locally linear embedding space (open black circles), and the two top coordinates of its principal component projection (solid green circles). Principle component analysis fails to discern mesostate structure of the unfolded state ensemble, with the entire ensemble located near the origin of the PCA projection. On the other hand, displacement along the manifold from the origin of the LLE map coincides with the formation of native-like mesostates, containing: 1) α-helical/secondary salt bridge (red), 2) β-turn/tertiary salt bridge (blue), 3) α-helix and α-helical hydrophobic core, and 4) nearly native configurations with both the α-helix and the tertiary hydrophobic core.
