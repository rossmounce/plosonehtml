Displacement along the <em>M<sub>1</sub></em> coordinate of the manifold coincides with the transformation of the 5) nearly native and 6) partially unfolded mesostates that lack the tertiary hydrophobic core and the native β-turn, but retain a frayed α-helix and the tertiary salt bridge. Displacement along the <em>M<sub>2</sub></em> coordinate coincides in part with the transformation of the α-helix from mesostate 7) that possesses a near native β-turn and hydrophobic cores and a non-α-helical but compact N-terminus, and mesostate 8) that lacks the native hydrophobic cores and has a non-native β-turn centered at K<sup>8</sup> that is part of the N-terminal α-helix in the NMR structure. Displacement along the <em>M<sub>3</sub></em> coordinate coincides with the transformation of the β-turn, including mesostates 9) that have a near native β-turn and tertiary salt bridge but have an unfolded α-helix and hydrophobic cores, and 10) possess a near native topology and α-helix but lack a native β-turn.</p>
