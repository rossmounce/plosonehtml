                Figure 7.  Folding reaction manifold.Mapping of TC5b's folding ensemble at the midpoint of its thermal transition, as calculated using the 310 K replica, onto the top three coordinates of its LLE manifold. Displacement along the M1 coordinate of the manifold coincides with the transformation of the 5) nearly native and 6) partially unfolded mesostates that lack the tertiary hydrophobic core and the native β-turn, but retain a frayed α-helix and the tertiary salt bridge. Displacement along the M2 coordinate coincides in part with the transformation of the α-helix from mesostate 7) that possesses a near native β-turn and hydrophobic cores and a non-α-helical but compact N-terminus, and mesostate 8) that lacks the native hydrophobic cores and has a non-native β-turn centered at K8 that is part of the N-terminal α-helix in the NMR structure. Displacement along the M3 coordinate coincides with the transformation of the β-turn, including mesostates 9) that have a near native β-turn and tertiary salt bridge but have an unfolded α-helix and hydrophobic cores, and 10) possess a near native topology and α-helix but lack a native β-turn.
