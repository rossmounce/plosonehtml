The level of filamentation was also analyzed for Tr strains. At least three independently constructed double mutants were tested. Metabolic mutations were deletions except for <em>pfk</em>, <em>pgk</em> and <em>pgm</em> were point mutations were used (<em>pfk1</em>, <em>pgkEP</em> and <em>pgm8</em>). Red boxes: strains fully suppressed (cells had a relative plating efficiency of 1, formed thick colonies, grew as fast as the corresponding metabolic mutant and did not make filament in liquid at restrictive temperature); yellow boxes: strains not suppressed (cells had a low plating efficiency at high temperature or, as in the <em>dnaE2.6 Δpdh</em> and <em>dnaE2.10 Δpta</em> strains, had a plating efficiency close to 1 but formed thin colonies with filamentous cells); white boxes: not tested. Thick lines and dots represent the central carbon metabolism reactions and their products, respectively. Main pathways are indicated. PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; O: overflow pathway; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; NEOG: gluconeogenesis.</p>
