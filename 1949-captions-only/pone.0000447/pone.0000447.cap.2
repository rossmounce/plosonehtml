                Figure 2.  Suppressive mutations of dnaE(Ts) strains are clustered in the terminal reactions of glycolysis.To analyze the impact of metabolic mutations on the Ts character of dnaE(Ts) strains, the plating efficiency of double mutants at restrictive temperature was compared to that at permissive temperature in LB (boxed numbers). The level of filamentation was also analyzed for Tr strains. At least three independently constructed double mutants were tested. Metabolic mutations were deletions except for pfk, pgk and pgm were point mutations were used (pfk1, pgkEP and pgm8). Red boxes: strains fully suppressed (cells had a relative plating efficiency of 1, formed thick colonies, grew as fast as the corresponding metabolic mutant and did not make filament in liquid at restrictive temperature); yellow boxes: strains not suppressed (cells had a low plating efficiency at high temperature or, as in the dnaE2.6 Δpdh and dnaE2.10 Δpta strains, had a plating efficiency close to 1 but formed thin colonies with filamentous cells); white boxes: not tested. Thick lines and dots represent the central carbon metabolism reactions and their products, respectively. Main pathways are indicated. PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; O: overflow pathway; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; NEOG: gluconeogenesis.
