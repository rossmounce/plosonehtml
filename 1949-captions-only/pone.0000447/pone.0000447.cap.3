Relative plating efficiencies (see legend to <a href="#pone-0000447-g002">Fig. 2</a>) are indicated inside the boxes. All the tested metabolic mutations were deletion except in the case of <em>pgk</em> where the point <em>pgkEP</em> mutation was used. At least two independent double mutants were tested. Red boxes: strains fully suppressed (cells had a plating efficiency of 100%, formed thick colonies and are not filamentous in liquid at restrictive temperature); orange boxes: strains partially suppressed (cells had a plating efficiency of 100%, formed thick colonies but were filamentous in liquid at high temperature); yellow boxes: strains not suppressed (cells had a low plating efficiency at high temperature or, in a few instances, had a plating efficiency close to 1 but formed thin colonies containing filamentous cells); white boxes: not tested. (B) Plating analysis of Ts and suppressed strains at various temperatures. (C) Growth analysis of <em>dnaG20 ΔpykA</em> and <em>ΔpykA</em> mutants at 42°C in LB liquid browth. (D) Optical microscopy analysis at restrictive temperature of Ts and suppressed mutants (see legend of <a href="#pone-0000447-g001">Fig. 1</a>).</p>
