                Figure 3.  Mutations in terminal reactions of glycolysis can suppress dnaG(Ts) and dnaC(Ts) mutants.(A) The effect of 9 metabolic mutations on Ts mutations carried by initiation (I) or elongation (E) factors of DNA replication was investigated by the plating and filamentation assays. Relative plating efficiencies (see legend to Fig. 2) are indicated inside the boxes. All the tested metabolic mutations were deletion except in the case of pgk where the point pgkEP mutation was used. At least two independent double mutants were tested. Red boxes: strains fully suppressed (cells had a plating efficiency of 100%, formed thick colonies and are not filamentous in liquid at restrictive temperature); orange boxes: strains partially suppressed (cells had a plating efficiency of 100%, formed thick colonies but were filamentous in liquid at high temperature); yellow boxes: strains not suppressed (cells had a low plating efficiency at high temperature or, in a few instances, had a plating efficiency close to 1 but formed thin colonies containing filamentous cells); white boxes: not tested. (B) Plating analysis of Ts and suppressed strains at various temperatures. (C) Growth analysis of dnaG20 ΔpykA and ΔpykA mutants at 42°C in LB liquid browth. (D) Optical microscopy analysis at restrictive temperature of Ts and suppressed mutants (see legend of Fig. 1).
