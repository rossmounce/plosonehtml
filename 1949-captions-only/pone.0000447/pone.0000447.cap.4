                Figure 4.  Suppression does not depend on a growth rate decrease.The doubling rate of metabolic mutants, WT for replication functions, was determined at 40–44°C by measurement of optical density of LB cultures. Values are positioned along a vertical axis. Mutations are grouped into suppressive, not suppressive, constitutive and inducible mutations. The growth rate of cells expressing glycolytic genes from the Pspac-I or Pxyl inducible promoters was positioned at the highest value allowing suppression for the following Ts alleles: a: dnaC30; b and d: dnaE2.6; c: dnaG20. e: Suppression of dnaG20 by the ΔpykA mutation in the gluconeogenic medium CM (see Fig. 5 and the text below).
