Values are positioned along a vertical axis. Mutations are grouped into suppressive, not suppressive, constitutive and inducible mutations. The growth rate of cells expressing glycolytic genes from the <em>Pspac-I</em> or <em>Pxyl</em> inducible promoters was positioned at the highest value allowing suppression for the following Ts alleles: <sup>a</sup>: <em>dnaC30</em>; <sup>b and d</sup>: <em>dnaE2.6</em>; <sup>c</sup>: <em>dnaG20</em>. <sup>e</sup>: Suppression of <em>dnaG20</em> by the <em>ΔpykA</em> mutation in the gluconeogenic medium CM (see <a href="#pone-0000447-g005">Fig. 5</a> and the text below).</p>
