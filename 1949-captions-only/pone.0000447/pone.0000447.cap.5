The number of doublings per hour (closed diamonds) was determined from optical density measurements. PykA activity was measured from crude extracts prepared from cells growing exponentially in LB broth supplemented with various IPTG concentrations (open diamonds). Typical experiments are presented. (B) Abrupt phenotypic shift of <em>dna</em>(Ts) <em>Pspac-I::pykA</em> strains on plates. Strains were spread on LB plates containing various IPTG concentrations (µM). The number of colony forming units was counted after plate incubation at restrictive temperature. Red, yellow and orange symbols pinpoints IPTG concentrations where cells were Tr (forming thick colonies at high frequency), Ts (low plating efficiency) or shifting between the two phenotypes (variable plating efficiency and thin, heterogeneous colonies), respectively. (C) Abrupt phenotypic shift of the <em>dnaE2.6</em> <em>Pspac-I::pykA</em> strain in liquid. The strain was grown at 30°C in LB broth supplemented with various concentrations of IPTG (µM). Exponentially growing cells were then shifted to restrictive temperature (time 0) and maintained at low concentration (OD<sub>600 nm</sub> &lt;0.4) by serial dilutions when required. Aliquots were withdrawn at different times and the number of viable cells was determined by growing cells on plates containing 100 µM IPTG at 30°C.</p>
