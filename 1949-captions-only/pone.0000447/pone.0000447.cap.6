Top panel: Plating efficiency of <em>PspacI::dnaE2.2-SPA</em> PykA+ and PykA− cells plated on medium supplemented with various IPTG concentrations and incubated at 47°C (restrictive temperature on plates). Bottom panel: SDS-PAGE (stained with SYPRO-Red for total protein staining) and Western blot analysis of crude extracts (10 µg of total proteins) prepared from cells grown ~5 generations in 1000 µM IPTG at 30 or 45°C (restrictive temperature in liquid cultures). (B) The DnaETs proteins are Tr in the PykA− context. Top panel: Plating efficiency of the <em>PspacI::dnaE2.2-SPA ΔpykA</em> strain grown in various IPTG concentrations at 30 and 47°C. Bottom panel: SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of crude extracts prepared from cells grown ~5 generations at 30 or 45°C in 250 or 1000 µM IPTG.</p>
