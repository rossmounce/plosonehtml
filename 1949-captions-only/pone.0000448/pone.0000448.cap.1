                Figure 1.  Increased pSmad2/3 expression and activation of TGFβ signaling in LRP− mouse aorta.Longitudinal sections of abdominal aorta from SM22Cre+;LRPflox/flox;LDLR−/− (LRP−) and LRPflox/flox;LDLR−/− (LRP+) mice were stained with anti-TSP1, anti-TGFβ1, anti-pSmad2/3 and anti-pSmad1 antibodies. Reduced LRP1 expression results in greatly enhanced expression of pSmad2/3 and its target gene, TSP1. By contrast, TGFβ1 levels were slightly reduced, pSmad1 levels did not change. Bar in a indicates 20 µm.
