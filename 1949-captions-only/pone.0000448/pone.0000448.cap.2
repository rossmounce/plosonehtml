                Figure 2.  Rosiglitazone treatment decreases expression of PDGFRβ and activation of Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) in vitro.Western blot analysis of activated Smad2/3 and PDGFRβ in whole cell lysates from human VSMC and MEF LRP+/+ cells pretreated 0, 24 or 48 hours with rosiglitazone at 10−5M and then stimulated with human TGFβ1 (200&nbsp;pM) for 0, 1.5, 3 or 6 hours.
