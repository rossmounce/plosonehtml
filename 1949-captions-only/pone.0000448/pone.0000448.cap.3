Mouse aortas expressing (LRP<sup>+</sup>) or not expressing (LRP<sup>−</sup>) LRP in VSMC were analyzed by western blot (Panel A) and immunohistochemistry (Panel B) for expression of PDGFRβ (d–f), and for activation of Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3, a–c), and Erk1/2 (pErk1/2, g–i). Panel C shows elastic staining of corresponding sections and gaps in elastic fiber continuity (arrows). Bar indicates 40 µm, insert scale bar in B,a indicates 10 µm.</p>
