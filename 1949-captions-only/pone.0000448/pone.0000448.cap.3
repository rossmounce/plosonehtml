                Figure 3.  Activation of TGFβ and PDGF signaling in LRP− mouse aortas are both prevented upon rosiglitazone treatment.Mice had been cholesterol-fed for 5 weeks in the absence (−Rosi) or presence (+Rosi) of rosiglitazone (GlaxoSmithKline, 25 mg/kg/day) before analysis. Mouse aortas expressing (LRP+) or not expressing (LRP−) LRP in VSMC were analyzed by western blot (Panel A) and immunohistochemistry (Panel B) for expression of PDGFRβ (d–f), and for activation of Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3, a–c), and Erk1/2 (pErk1/2, g–i). Panel C shows elastic staining of corresponding sections and gaps in elastic fiber continuity (arrows). Bar indicates 40 µm, insert scale bar in B,a indicates 10 µm.
