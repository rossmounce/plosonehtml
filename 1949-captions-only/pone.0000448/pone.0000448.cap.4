Mice had been cholesterol-fed for 5 weeks in the absence (−Rosi) or presence (+Rosi) of rosiglitazone (GlaxoSmithKline, 25 mg/kg/day) before analysis. Aortae were stained en face with Sudan IV and arrows indicate lipid-laden (Sudan-positive) atherosclerotic lesions. Scale bar, 1.2 cm. (B) Histological analysis of thoracic aortas from animals cholesterol-fed in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone. Hematoxylin and eosin (a and b, LRP<sup>+</sup>; c and d, LRP<sup>−</sup>), and trichrome staining (e and f, LRP<sup>−</sup>) of longitudinal sections. Scale bar in a, 15 µm. (C) Quantitative analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in aortas from cholesterol-fed LRP<sup>−</sup> and control (LRP<sup>+</sup>) mice (n = 5 mice per group) with and without rosiglitazone treatment. Values are expressed as mean±s.e.m. *, p&lt;0.05 for LRP<sup>−</sup> treated versus untreated. (D) FPLC profile of plasma lipoproteins from untreated LRP<sup>−</sup> (filled squares) and LRP<sup>+</sup> (opened squares) and rosiglitazone treated LRP<sup>−</sup> (filled triangles) and LRP<sup>+</sup> (opened triangles). (E) Plasma triglycerides and (F) cholesterol from untreated and rosiglitazone treated LRP<sup>−</sup> and LRP<sup>+</sup> mice. Values are expressed as mean±S.E.M. (n = 10 mice per group).</p>
