                Figure 1.  Site-directed mutagenesis and functional testing of AtGC1(1–100).(A) Original 14 amino acid search motif for GCs [12]; substitutions are in square brackets, X represents any amino acid and curly brackets define the number of amino acids. (B) AtGC1 (At5g05930): The position of the GC catalytic centre is marked in red; the underlined aspartic acid [D] is the amino acid that has been changed into a leucine [L] by site directed mutagenesis. The open arrow marks the conserved PPi-binding arginine [R] and the C-terminal putative metal binding site is highlighted in aquamarine. The green triangles point to exon borders and the solid arrow shows the border of the fragment that we have tested for GC activity. (C) SDS-PAGE of the 3 purification steps of the recombinant protein AtGC1(1–100); “M” is the molecular weight marker, “FT” is the protein in the flow-through, “W” is the wash and “E” is the eluted recombinant protein. (D) In vitro GC activity assay. The control (cont.; empty bar) was obtained by omitting protein in the reaction mix and the concentration of GTP was 1mM and that of Mn2+ or Mg2+ was 5 mM. The values for the wild-type protein (N-terminal fragment of 100 amino acids containing a [D] in position 7 of the catalytic centre) and the mutated protein (N-terminal fragment of 100 amino acids containing [L] in position 7 of the catalytic centre) are represented with solid bars. The bar values represent the mean cGMP (+/−SEM) generated in 15 minutes in three samples and the response pattern is representative of 3 independent experiments.
