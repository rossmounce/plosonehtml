                Figure 2.  Structural features of the GC catalytic domain and the Arabidopsis thaliana brassinosteroid receptor AtBRI1.(A) The 14 amino acid long original search motif (modified after [12] with an inclusion of [L] in position 7). Red amino acids are functionally assigned residues of the catalytic centre. The residue in position 1 does the hydrogen bonding with the guanine, the amino acid in position 3 confers substrate specificity and the residues in positions 10 and 14 stabilise the transition (GTP/cGMP). (B) Representation of the domain organisation of AtBRI1 containing a signal peptide (SP), leucine rich repeats (LLRs) including an island, a transmembrane domain (TM), a GC centre embedded in the kinase domain. The position (16 or 17) outside the catalytic centre is implicated in Mg2+/Mn2+-binding (aquamarine). (C) Amino acid sequence of the intracellular C-terminal region of AtBRI1. The kinase domain is underlined (yellow), the GC domain is boxed in green, putative Mg2+/Mn2+-binding sites are highlighted (aquamarine), the proposed PPi binding is underlined in black, and the recombinant protein (AtBRI1-GC) tested for GC activity in vitro is delineated by solid triangles (Ïƒ). (D) Alignment of AtBRI1-like sequences. AtBRI1 (At4g39400), LeBRI1 (tomato|TC185049, Q9LJF3), OsBRI1 (Os06g0691800), VvBRI1 (grape |TC70352, Q9ZWC8), PlBRI1 (poplar|TC57820, Q9ZWC8), PsBR (BAC99050), OsBR (Os08g25380), OsSR160 (BAD34326.1, AP006156.2).
