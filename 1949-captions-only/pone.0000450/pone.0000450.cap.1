                Figure 1.  Generation of R26floxneoWnt4 mice.A, Gene targeting strategy. Open box, R26 exon 1; DT-A, diphtheria toxin expression cassette. SA, splice acceptor; X, XbaI. B, Southern analysis of ES cell clones. Genomic DNAs were digested with XbaI and detected by 5′ external or 3′ internal probes. C, PCR genotyping of R26floxneoWnt4; Col2a1-Cre mice. Primers shown in panel A (arrowheads) amplify R26 wild-type (~600-bp) and targeted (~350-bp) alleles. Cre-specific primers yield a ~550-bp band to identify mice carrying the Col2a1-Cre transgene.
