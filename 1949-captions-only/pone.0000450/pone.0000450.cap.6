                Figure 6.  Section RNA in situ hybridization of tibial growth plates of 3-week-old animals.Molecular marker analysis of tibiae of 3-week-old R26floxneoWnt4 heterozygous control (A, C, E, G) and R26floxneoWnt4; Col2a1-Cre mutant (B, D, F, H) mice. Col2a1 marks proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes; Col10a1 marks prehypertropic chondrocytes; Ihh marks prehypertropic and hypertropic chondrocytes. Brackets mark relevant regions. Wnt4 hybridization is undetectable in the growth plate of the control, whereas Wnt4 transcripts are detected throughout the growth plate of the mutant.
