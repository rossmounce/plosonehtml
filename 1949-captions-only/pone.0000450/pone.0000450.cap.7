                Figure 7.  Cell proliferation in the epiphyseal growth plate of the proximal tibia.A, B, BrdU-labeled cells in 2-week-old control and R26floxneoWnt4; Col2a1-Cre mutant mice. C, The fraction of chondrocytes in the proliferation zone (pz) that incorporated BrdU was 0.189±0.051 in control mice compared to 0.122±0.020 in mutants (P&lt;0.001). The labeling percentage of the control was designated as 1.0, and the relative percentage of the mutant was calculated as 0.64.
