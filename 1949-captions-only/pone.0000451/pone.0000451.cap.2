Chromatogram of the profiles of protein extracts from 24 h (shown in red) 66 h (shown in black) fed salivary glands fractionated on a C4 hydrophobic column shows differences in the protein composition of the two populations. Fraction numbers are indicated next to prominent protein peaks. B. A dot-blot analysis of the HPLC fractions using tick-immune rabbit serum demonstrates differential reactivity with 24 and 66 h protein fractions. Numbers next to the cross-reacting spots correspond to HPLC protein peaks.</p>
