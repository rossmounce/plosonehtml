Fold change in gene expression at 66 h relative to 24 h. Error bars represent Mean fold changeÂ±SD. Expressions of most of the genes were increased at 66 h when compared to the levels at 24 h of feeding. The expression of at least 2 genes was increased at 24 h compared to that at 66 h (Inset) presented here as fold change in gene expression at 24 h relative to 66 h.</p>
