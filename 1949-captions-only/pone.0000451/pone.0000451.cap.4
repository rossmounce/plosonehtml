                Figure 4.  Proteins expressed within 24 h of tick feeding provoke tick-immunity.A. Guinea pigs challenged with I. scapularis nymphs subsequent to immunization with protein extracts from 66 h fed nymphal salivary gland extracts (66 h SGE); or after 3 tick infestations (Tick-immune). Naïve guinea pigs served as control. Inset. Immunoblots of tick salivary gland extracts (1 µg/lane) probed with immune sera from three 66 h SGE-immunized animals (lanes 1–3). Results are one representative of three replicate experiments. B. 24 h tick-immune guinea pigs when challenged with ticks showed erythema at the tick attachment sites within 24 h of tick attachment; no redness was apparent on naïve animals. C. Ticks feeding on 24 h tick-immune guinea pigs were rapidly rejected and the number of attached ticks decreased significantly (P = 0.01) within 48 h when compared to that on naïve animals. D. Ticks feeding on 24 h tick-immune animals showed decreased engorgement weights compared to ticks that engorged on naïve animals. Error bars represent Mean±SE.
