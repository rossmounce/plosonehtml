Samples from the 24-hour tick-immune animal had the highest number of inflammatory cells (c) which was characterized by a predominance of heterophils (d). In comparison inflammatory infiltrates were markedly reduced and comprised predominantly of mononuclear cells in 24-hour naïve animals (a, b). Scale bar = 500 µm (a, c); Scale bar = 100 µm (b, d). B. Dermal inflammatory cells in skin sections of 24 h tick-immune animals showed a statistically significant (<em>P&lt;0.001</em>) increase in the numbers compared to naïve animals. C. Toluidine blue positive cells representing basophils/mast cells also showed a statistically significant increase (<em>P&lt;0.05</em>) in skin biopsies of 24 h tick-immune animal compared to naïve animal (Error bars represent±SEM)</p>
