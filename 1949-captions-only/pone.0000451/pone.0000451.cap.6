The efficiency of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infected nymphs to feed on 24 h tick-immune animals was significantly decreased (<em>P&lt;0.02</em>) compared to that on naïve animals and ticks were rejected within 48 h of attachment. B. Quantitative PCR analysis of guinea pig skin punch-biopsies 4 weeks after tick detachment showed a significant decrease (<em>P = 0.01</em>) in spirochete burden in 24 h tick-immune animals compared to naïve animals as evaluated by <em>B. burgdorferi</em> <em>flaB</em> amplicon levels. C. Culture of skin punch-biopsies in BSK-H medium demonstrated a significant decrease (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>) in the number of 24 h tick-immune animals that harbored viable spirochetes when compared to naïve animals.
