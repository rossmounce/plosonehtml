                Figure 6.  Immunity against 24 h tick salivary proteins impairs Borrelia burgdorferi transmission.A. The efficiency of B. burgdorferi infected nymphs to feed on 24 h tick-immune animals was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.02) compared to that on naïve animals and ticks were rejected within 48 h of attachment. B. Quantitative PCR analysis of guinea pig skin punch-biopsies 4 weeks after tick detachment showed a significant decrease (P = 0.01) in spirochete burden in 24 h tick-immune animals compared to naïve animals as evaluated by B. burgdorferi flaB amplicon levels. C. Culture of skin punch-biopsies in BSK-H medium demonstrated a significant decrease (P&lt;0.01) in the number of 24 h tick-immune animals that harbored viable spirochetes when compared to naïve animals.
