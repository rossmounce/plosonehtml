The ability of nymphs to feed on rabbits upon repeated infestation was decreased. Inset. Immunoblot of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> protein extract probed with anti-<em>Borrelia</em> antiserum (lane 1) or nymph-immune rabbit serum (lane 2). B. Inset. Quantitative RT-PCR assessment of <em>Borrelia</em> burden as scored by levels of <em>flaB</em> amplicons in the midguts (MG) and salivary glands (SG) of nymphs feeding on mice that received rabbit tick-immune serum (RTIS) or naive serum (NRS); and quantitative PCR assessment of <em>Borrelia</em> burden in the bladder and skin of mice that received rabbit tick-immune serum (RTIS) or na√Øve (NRS) serum.</p>
