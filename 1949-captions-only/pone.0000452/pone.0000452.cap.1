                Figure 1.  Different methods for assessing visual field organization.The top two panels show two simulated distributions of neurons overlaid on a portion of the right hemisphere's cortical surface. Note that all the neurons prefer locations in the contralateral (left) visual field (see figure key in top left corner). Electrophysiological studies consistently show that most neurons prefer contralateral locations. In the top left panel, the neurons are topographically organized, such that neurons preferring nearby visual locations tend to lie close to each other on the cortical surface. In the top right panel, there is no topographic organization, such that neurons preferring different parts of contralateral visual field are randomly intermixed on the cortical surface. The middle panels show simulated BOLD maps in which voxels are colored to indicate the preferred visual location. The topographic organization of the neurons on the left is accurately reflected in the surface map. However, the map on the right also produces an illusory impression of topography. The problem is that the maps show the best fitting location in a ‘winner take all’ fashion, even when the differences between locations are insignificant. A more in-depth examination requires looking at how the magnitude of BOLD response varies as we move across the cortical surface. The dotted black line illustrates a trajectory across the cortical surface. The graphs in the bottom panel plot BOLD magnitudes along that trajectory. The topographic and non-topographic cases can now be clearly distinguished. The investigations we report here employ measures that take account of the relative magnitude of BOLD response to distinct visual locations.
