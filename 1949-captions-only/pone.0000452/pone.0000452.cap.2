                Figure 2.  The two behavioral tasks used in the study.(A) In the delayed saccade task subjects maintained fixation while a target dot was briefly presented. This was followed by a variable delay period during which flickering dots appeared in the same sector of the visual field as the target. When the screen went black, subjects made a rapid saccade to the remembered target location, then back to the center. Trials occurred in blocks of three, with small variations in target location, within the same sector, between trials (see methods). (B) The oddball task required subjects to categorize each stimulus, presented approx. once per second, as either ‘standard’ or ‘oddball’ using a manual response. On most trials the same ‘standard’ object was presented at the center, while on 12% of trials a novel object was presented in one of 7 locations (fovea or 6 peripheral locations as in the polar angle version of the delayed saccade task). Subjects maintained fixation throughout. (C) In the oddball task and the polar angle version of the delayed saccade task, the six sector centers were evenly distributed around a circle with a radius of approx 7 degrees visual angle. In the eccentricity version of the delayed saccade task, the sector centers lay on the horizontal meridian, at 2, 13 or 24 degrees eccentricity.
