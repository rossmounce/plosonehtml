(A) shows data from a passive viewing task in which contrast reversing checkerboards were displayed in alternating blocks along the horizontal and vertical meridians. Lines corresponding to the most robust representations of the horizontal and vertical meridians were drawn on the basis of this data set, and are reproduced in the other panels for comparison. (B) shows data from the polar angle version of the delayed saccade paradigm. Voxels showing a preference for the contralateral field were colored according to which of the three contra-lateral locations produced the greatest response. Note the close correspondence for the horizontal meridian, and the slight gap in activated representation on the vertical meridian, due to the stimuli lying 30 degrees from the vertical in this paradigm. (C) shows data from the oddball task, derived in the same way.</p>
