C: flat representation of dorsal occipital and parietal cortex. Maps show preferred visual field location thresholded by contra-lateral preference, as in <a href="#pone-0000452-g003">Figure 3 B&amp;C</a>. The cortical trajectory (shown in black) was drawn from the horizontal meridian of V1, in the calcarine sulcus, through V2, V3, V3A, V7 and then through those parts of medial intraparietal sulcus showing the greatest sensitivity to visual field location. D: Magnitude of BOLD activity associated with the three contra-lateral visual field positions along the trajectory (colors match maps in panels A–C). E: Mean magnitude associated with contra-lateral (pink) and ipsi-lateral (blue) visual field positions. F: Compass plots illustrating the BOLD magnitude associated with each of the six polar angles. Each plot comes from a cortical area demonstrating a preference for the contra-lateral horizontal meridian (blue regions in panels A–C). Data shown comes from the right hemisphere of subject A. Supplementary <a href="#pone.0000452.s001">figures S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0000452.s002">S2</a> show panels C–E for all eight hemispheres investigated.</p>
