                Figure 5.  Schematic illustration of regions sensitive to visual field location on the PALS atlas.A shows a flat representation of the cortex of the right hemisphere. B shows three different views of an inflated representation of the same surface. PCu, precuneus; ST, superior temporal; SFEF, superior FEF; IFEF, inferior FEF; MPCe, middle precentral; IFS, inferior frontal sulcus. The atlas co-ordinates of these regions are listed in Table 2.
