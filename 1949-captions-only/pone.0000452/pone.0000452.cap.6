The analysis was restricted to voxels which preferred either the upper or lower contralateral visual field locations. Each measure involves a subtraction of BOLD magnitudes associated with two visual field positions. The measures are comparable in the sense that the visual distance between locations was the same for each comparison. Importantly, increases in receptive field size should influence all measures equally. The black bars show the difference in BOLD response between the preferred visual field location and an ipsilateral location. Voxels were selected on the basis of contralateral preference, and so this measure can be considered as a baseline for comparison. The red bars reflect the difference between preferred and non-preferred within field locations. This measure reflects the degree of topography present in the region. In early visual areas, the red and black bars are identical, indicating a degree of topographic specificity as great as the contralateral preference. The blue bars indicate the difference between the non-preferred visual field location and the ipsilateral location. This measure reflects the degree to which the region possesses a non-topographic preference for the contra-lateral field. In extra-occipital areas, the black and blue bars are identical, indicating that these regions demonstrate a preference for the contra-lateral visual field but no detectable topography. Higher visual areas demonstrate a transition between these two types of organization.</p>
