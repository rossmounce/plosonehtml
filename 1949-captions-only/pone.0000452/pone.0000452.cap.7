The graphs plot the magnitude of BOLD response to three locations of varying eccentricity in the contralateral visual field, by distance across the cortical surface. The dotted black lines show the mean response to ipsilateral locations. Cortical trajectories were drawn using data from the passive retinotopy task. The trajectories for V1, V2/V3 and V3A each followed representations of the horizontal meridian in dorsal occipital cortex (these are the solid lines shown in <a href="#pone-0000452-g003">Figure 3</a>). The trajectory for MIPS was drawn at the same orientation on the flat surface. B shows mean responses for regions. The regions were defined using data from the polar angle version of the delayed saccade task, in which the eccentricity of the targets was approx. 7 degrees visual angle. The bars plot the BOLD response to contra-lateral locations, with the mean response to ipsi-lateral targets subtracted. These values are averaged across hemispheres (n = 4), with error bars showing the standard error. Note that in early visual areas there is a clear preference for the middle (13 deg.) contralateral location. This location corresponded most closely to the location of targets used to define these regions, and thus this preference reflects the topographic organization of these areas. This effect is not present in intermediate and extra-occipital areas. However, a few areas (V6/POS, PCu, ST) showed a preference for more peripheral stimuli.</p>
