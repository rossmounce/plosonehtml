Final adult forms, following rotation and additional morphological changes, are shown as trapezoids. (B) Corresponding mutant forms of ommatidial precursors and adult trapezoids from dorsal half of the eye are shown. D/V forms arise as a consequence of the wrong fate choice followed by the right direction of rotation with respect to those fates. A/P forms occur when the wrong fates are chosen but, unlike D/V inversions, ommatidial precursors subsequently rotate in the wrong direction with respect to the fates. AP/DV ommatidial result from the correct fate choice but wrong direction of rotation.</p>

Green arrows indicate correct direction of rotation with respect to R3/R4 fates. Purple arrows indicate wrong direction of rotation. Anterior is to the right.</p>
