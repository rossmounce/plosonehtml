                Figure 2.  Modification of sev-stbm phenotype by GMREP lines.(A) Wild-type eyes have two ommatidial forms, dorsal (blue) and ventral (red); each class falls exclusively on the dorsal or ventral side of the equator (yellow/black line). (B) sev-stbm eyes have polarity defects in 11% of ommatidia. Three DV (red trapezoid) and one AP (black trapezoid) inversions are shown here. (C) A GMREP line that primarily enhances the number of DV defects in the sev-stbm/+ phenotype. (D) The number AP/DV (green trapezoid) defects is enhanced by the GMREP line shown here in a sev-stbm/+ background. (E) An eye representative of GMREP lines that enhance the AP-type defects in a sev-stbm background. (F) The modified eye shown in this panel has a marked increase in the number of R3/R3 and R4/R4 symmetric defects (yellow open rectangles and horseshoe shapes). Key: examples shown are for ommatidia in dorsal half of eye. Blue: wild-type; red: D/V inversion; black: A/P inversion; green: AP/DV inversion; yellow rectangle: R3/R3 symmetric ommatidia; yellow horseshoe: R4/R4 symmetric ommatidia.
