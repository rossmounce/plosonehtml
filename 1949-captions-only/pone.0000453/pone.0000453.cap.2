(B) <em>sev-stbm</em> eyes have polarity defects in 11% of ommatidia. Three DV (red trapezoid) and one AP (black trapezoid) inversions are shown here. (C) A GMREP line that primarily enhances the number of DV defects in the <em>sev-stbm</em>/+ phenotype. (D) The number AP/DV (green trapezoid) defects is enhanced by the GMREP line shown here in a <em>sev-stbm</em>/+ background. (E) An eye representative of GMREP lines that enhance the AP-type defects in a <em>sev-stbm</em> background. (F) The modified eye shown in this panel has a marked increase in the number of R3/R3 and R4/R4 symmetric defects (yellow open rectangles and horseshoe shapes). Key: examples shown are for ommatidia in dorsal half of eye. Blue: wild-type; red: D/V inversion; black: A/P inversion; green: AP/DV inversion; yellow rectangle: R3/R3 symmetric ommatidia; yellow horseshoe: R4/R4 symmetric ommatidia.</p>
