Haplogroups are determined by monophyly and distribution. Haplogroups are colour coded as in <a href="#pone-0000454-g001">Figure 1</a>. The picture panel shows the general phenotype of each intermediate-level haplogroup. The <em>decula</em> terminal haplogroup is depicted to show the loss of patterning in this subspecies. The bottom panel displays the timing of evolutionary events with equivalent changes in the global temperature (as measured by changes in the oxygen isotope 18) adapted from <a href="#pone.0000454-Zachos1">[55]</a>.</p>
