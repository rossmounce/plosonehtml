In contrast, in the sister species <em>Hipposideros caffer</em> (C,G,K) and in <em>Mops condylurus</em> (D,H,L), proliferating as well as migrating cells can be detected in the subgranular layer of the hippocampus (Ki-67: C,D; MCM2: G,H; DCX: K,L) Molecular layer in all examples on the right side of the granule cell layer, arrows indicate immuno­positive cells. Scale bar is 20µm.</p>
