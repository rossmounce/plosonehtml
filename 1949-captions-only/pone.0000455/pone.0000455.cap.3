Thus, animals with and without hippocampal neurogenesis do not differ in their neurogenetic activity in the rostral migratory stream. In <em>Phyllostomus discolor</em>, all granule cells in the hippocampus are positive for NeuroD (I), in <em>Hipposideros cyclops</em> (J), <em>Hipposideros caffer</em> (K) and <em>Mops condylurus</em> (L) no reactivity to the antibody against NeuroD could be detected. Scale bar is 20µm.</p>
