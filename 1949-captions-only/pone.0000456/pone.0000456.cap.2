                Figure 2.  Hydrogen production from either 2 mM G-6-P or 2 mM starch (glucose equivalent).The reaction based on G-6-P contained the pentose phosphate cycle enzymes (#3-12, 1 unit each), ~70 units of P. furiosus hydrogenase (#13), 0.5 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 2 mM NADP+, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM MnCl2 in 2.0 ml of 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), at 30°C. The reaction based on starch rather than G-6-P was supplemented by 10 units of α-glucan phosphorylase (#1), 10 units of phosphoglucomutase (#2), and 4 mM phosphate at 30°C.
