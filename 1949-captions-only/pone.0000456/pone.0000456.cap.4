The chemical methods have low hydrogen yields (50~57%) due to poor selectivity of catalysts and requires high reaction temperatures (e.g., 500~900 K) <a href="#pone.0000456-Antal1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Cortright1">[10]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Huber1">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Matsumura1">[13]</a>. Anaerobic hydrogen fermentation is well known for its low hydrogen yield of 4 H<sub>2</sub>/glucose <a href="#pone.0000456-Hallenbeck1">[9]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Adams1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Das1">[18]</a>. The combination of ethanol fermentation and ethanol-to-hydrogen reforming has a theoretical yield of 10 H<sub>2</sub>/glucose unit (e.g. 83% of the maximum). Allowing 5~10% fermentation loss <a href="#pone.0000456-Wheals1">[30]</a> and ~5% reforming loss <a href="#pone.0000456-Deluga1">[12]</a>, the practical hydrogen yield through ethanol could be ca. 75% of the maximum yield. Assembly of the high-substrate-selectivity enzymes results in an artificial cascade enzymatic pathway, accompanied by a high hydrogen yield (12 H<sub>2</sub>/glucose), three time higher than the theoretical yield (4 H<sub>2</sub>/glucose) from biological hydrogen fermentations <a href="#pone.0000456-Hallenbeck1">[9]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Adams1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Das1">[18]</a> and much higher than those from chemical catalysis <a href="#pone.0000456-Antal1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Cortright1">[10]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Huber1">[11]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>Distinct from the severe reaction conditions of chemical catalysis <a href="#pone.0000456-Antal1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Cortright1">[10]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000456-Salge1">[14]</a>, the mild reaction conditions mediated by enzymes (~20–100°C, depending on the enzymes employed) provide two obvious benefits: 1) easy implementation in a small space, especially for mobile applications, and 2) simple process configurations due to easy separation of the gaseous products (H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) from the reactants (starch and water).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>Costs of hydrogen production from less-costly starch (e.g., $~0.15/kg) would be ~$2/kg H<sub>2</sub>, assuming that feedstock costs account for half of overall costs and enzymes and co-enzyme account for another half. In general, approximately 40–75% of prices of commodities, such as gasoline from crude oil, hydrogen from natural gas, and ethanol from corn kernels, come from feedstock costs <a href="#pone.0000456-Lynd2">[31]</a>. For example, current crude recombinant enzyme production costs are estimated to range ~$10/kg; commercial cellulase production cost is as low as $1–2/kg <a href="#pone.0000456-Zhang3">[29]</a>. Based on the rule of thumb for commodity production costs, the likely hydrogen-producing costs (~$2/kg H<sub>2</sub>) could meet or exceed the hydrogen cost goals ($2–3/kg H<sub>2</sub>), established by the US DOE <a href="#pone.0000456-U.S.1">[32]</a>. For example, the soaring prices of natural gas drove hydrogen costs from $1.40/kg H<sub>2</sub> in 2003 to $2.70/kg H<sub>2</sub> in 2005. We improve the method first described by Woodward <a href="#pone.0000456-Woodward1">[23]</a> by starting with a less costly and abundant substrate–starch. Thus we avoid several major shortcomings of Woodward's method: 1) costly glucose-6-phosphate, 2) accumulation of phosphate, which is a strong inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 3) increasing ionic strength in the buffer, which slows down overall reaction rates, and 4) a pH shift in the buffer.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4"></a><p>Solid starch has a relatively high energy density, with a mass-storage density of 14.8 H<sub>2</sub>-mass % and a volume-storage density of 104 kg H<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>. These densities are higher than most of the solid hydrogen storage technologies <a href="#pone.0000456-Schlapbach1">[7]</a>, as well as exceeding the DOE goals of 4.5 mass%, 6 mass%, and 9 mass% in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively <a href="#pone.0000456-DOE1">[5]</a>. Replacement of conventional solid hydrogen storage technologies by the on-board starch-H<sub>2</sub> converter and starch container will also solve several problems for solid hydrogen storage devices, e.g., energy loss for hydrogen compression or liquefaction, durability of reversible adsorption/desorption materials, high temperatures for desorption, and a long refilling time <a href="#pone.0000456-DOE1">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000456-Schlapbach1">[7]</a>. Easy and safe storage and distribution of solid starch will address many issues of the hydrogen economy infrastructure. For example, setting up the infrastructure to store and distribute gaseous hydrogen to vehicles might cost hundreds of billions in the USA alone <a href="#pone.0000456-Moore1">[33]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.p5"></a><p>This robust synthetic enzymatic pathway that does not function in nature was assembled by 12 mesophilic enzymes from animal, plant, bacterial, and yeast sources, plus an archaeal hyperthermophilic hydrogenase. The performance (e.g., reaction rate and enzyme stability) is anticipated to be improved by several orders of magnitude by using the combination of (a) enzyme component optimization <em>via</em> metabolic engineering modeling <a href="#pone.0000456-Stephanopoulos1">[34]</a>, (b) interchangeable substitution of mesophilic enzymes by recombinant thermophilic or even hyperthermophilic enzymes <a href="#pone.0000456-Woodward1">[23]</a>, (c) protein engineering technologies, and (d) higher concentrations of enzymes and substrates. We have increased the hydrogen production rates by nearly 4 times greater than Woodward's results <a href="#pone.0000456-Woodward1">[23]</a> through a) decreasing the ion strength of the buffer and b) substituting one mesophilic enzyme (#11). This research approach will naturally benefit from on-going improvements by others in synthetic biology systems that are addressing cofactor stability <a href="#pone.0000456-Ohno1">[35]</a>, enzyme stability by additives <a href="#pone.0000456-Ramos1">[36]</a>, and co-immobilization <a href="#pone.0000456-Jung1">[37]</a>, and development of minimal microorganisms <a href="#pone.0000456-Glass1">[38]</a> that can be built upon to create an <em>in vivo</em> enzyme system that produces H<sub>2</sub> in high yields.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p6" name="article1.body1.sec3.p6"></a><p>The concept of cell-free synthetic enzymatic pathway engineering is anticipated to be applied to other commodity chemical production because of its unique benefits: high product yields (i.e., no formation of by-products and cell mass), modest reaction conditions as compared to chemical catalysis, no toxic chemicals required or produced, broad reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature and low pH) as compared with microorganisms, and easy operation and control. For example, it has been argued that cell-free ethanol fermentation systems would replace microbe-based ethanol fermentation someday <a href="#pone.0000456-Allain1">[39]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7"></a><p>With technology development and integration with PEM fuel cells, the starch-to-hydrogen conversion technology is anticipated to have wide mobile applications. We envision that future mobile appliances will store solid starch, produce hydrogen from starch and water via this reaction, and then generate electricity by hydrogen fuel cells at the same compact place.</p>
