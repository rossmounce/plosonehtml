PDCA - pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylic acid; PTCA - pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid; TTCA - 1,3-thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid; TDCA - 1,3-thiazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid. Absorption was monitored at 255 nm and displayed on a linear scale. ESR spectra were obtained by suspending “ghosts” in water except for (h) which was performed in dry state. Ordinate in g–i is the derivative of the ESR absorption in arbitrary units.</p>
