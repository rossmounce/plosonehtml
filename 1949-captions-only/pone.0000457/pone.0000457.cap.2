                Figure 2.  Chemical composition and paramagnetic properties of melanin:a) structure of eumelanin oligomer; b) structure of pheomelanin oligomer; (c – f) HPLC of permanganate-oxidized melanins: c) chromatogram of background solution; d) C. neoformans; e) C. sphaerospermum grown on Sabaroud dextrose agar; f) W. dermatitidis isolate 8656 (wild type); (g–i) ESR spectra: g) W. dermatitidis isolate 8656; h) C. neoformans before irradiation; i) C. neoformans after irradiation with 0.3 kGy dose. PDCA - pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylic acid; PTCA - pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid; TTCA - 1,3-thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid; TDCA - 1,3-thiazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid. Absorption was monitored at 255 nm and displayed on a linear scale. ESR spectra were obtained by suspending “ghosts” in water except for (h) which was performed in dry state. Ordinate in g–i is the derivative of the ESR absorption in arbitrary units.
