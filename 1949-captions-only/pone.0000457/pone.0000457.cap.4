                Figure 4.  ESR spectra of melanin derived from C. sphaerospermum grown on different substrates: a) potato dextrose agar; b) Sabaroud dextrose agar; c) potato dextrose agar impregnated with 25 µg/mL tricyclazole.Differences in C. sphaerospermum ESR spectra in comparison with C. neoformans are marked with arrows. ESR spectra were obtained by suspending “ghosts” in water. Ordinate is the derivative of the ESR absorption in arbitrary units. Cs - C. sphaerospermum.
