                Figure 5.  The influence of ionizing radiation or heat on the metabolic activity of melanized and non-melanized C. neoformans cells.a, b) irradiated and non-irradiated cells: a) XTT; b) MTT. c) XTT of cells grown at room temperature (22°C) or at 30°C. The cells were kept in the dark while being exposed to ionizing radiation or different temperatures. Following the exposure, XTT or MTT reagents were added to the samples and absorbance was measured at 492 or 550 nm for XTT and MTT, respectively.
