                Figure 6.  Growth and incorporation of 14C-acetate by melanized C. neoformans H99 cells and non-melanized Lac(-) H99 cells lacking the laccase enzyme under conditions of limited nutrients supply in a radiation field of 0.05 mGy/hr or at background radiation level.a) growth of melanized H99 cells; b) growth of non-melanized Lac(-) H99 cells; c) incorporation of 14C-acetate into melanized H99 cells; d) incorporation of 14C-acetate into non-melanized Lac(-) H99 cells; e) ratio of irradiated to non-irradiated cells CFUs and cpms ratios (normalized CFUs and cpms) for melanized H99 and non-melanized Lac(-) H99 cells.
