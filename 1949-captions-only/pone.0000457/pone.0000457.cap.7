The volume of half-sphere was calculated as V/2 = π/12 d<sup>3</sup>. Radial linear growth rate of <em>C. sphaerospermum</em> colonies was calculated as K = (R<sub>t</sub>−R<sub>o</sub>)/(t−t<sub>o</sub>), where K is radial linear growth rate, mm/hr; R<sub>t</sub> and R<sub>o</sub> - colony radii at time t and time t<sub>o</sub>, respectively.</p>
