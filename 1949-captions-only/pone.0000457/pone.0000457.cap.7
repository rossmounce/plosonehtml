                Figure 7.  Survival of non-melanized and melanized C. sphaerospermum cells following exposure to external gamma rays: average volume (left side plates) and radial growth rate (right side plates) of melanized and melanin-deficient C. sphaerospermum colonies grown on agar plates with (top panels) or without (bottom panels) sucrose in a radiation field of 0.05 mGy/hr or at background radiation level (control).rad - irradiated, ctrl - control, mel - melanized, suc- sucrose added. The volume of half-sphere was calculated as V/2 = π/12 d3. Radial linear growth rate of C. sphaerospermum colonies was calculated as K = (Rt−Ro)/(t−to), where K is radial linear growth rate, mm/hr; Rt and Ro - colony radii at time t and time to, respectively.
