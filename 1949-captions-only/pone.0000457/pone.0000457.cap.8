                Figure 8.  Growth of W. dermatitidis.a) wild type 8656; b) albino mutant wdpks1Î”-1 with a disrupted polyketide synthase gene; c) a strain complemented with wild type gene wdpks1. The cells were grown under conditions of limited nutrients in a radiation field of 0.05 mGy/hr or at background radiation level. The cells were exposed to radiation for various times and plated for CFUs on YPD.
