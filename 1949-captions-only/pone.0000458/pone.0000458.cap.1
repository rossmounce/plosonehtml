                Figure 1.  pDC-mediated suppression of HIV infection in vitro.U87 cell lines expressing CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 were infected with pseudotyped luciferase HIV SF (X4) or HIV JRFL (R5), respectively. Purified pDCs (104) from HIV-infected (n = 11) or uninfected (n = 4) individuals were cocultured with 2×104 U87 cells, with or without 1 µg/ml CpG ODN 2216 in triplicate wells. After two days of incubation, cells were lysed and luciferase activity following addition of substrates was quantified by a luminometer. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.
