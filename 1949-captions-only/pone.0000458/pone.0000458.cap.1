Purified pDCs (10<sup>4</sup>) from HIV-infected (n = 11) or uninfected (n = 4) individuals were cocultured with 2×10<sup>4</sup> U87 cells, with or without 1 µg/ml CpG ODN 2216 in triplicate wells. After two days of incubation, cells were lysed and luciferase activity following addition of substrates was quantified by a luminometer. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.</p>
