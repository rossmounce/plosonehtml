For targets, autologous PBMCs were stimulated overnight with anti-CD3 and IL-2. On day 0, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified and plated at 1.2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well alone or with 5×10<sup>4</sup> stimulated or unstimulated pDCs, or with 1.2×10<sup>5</sup> purified autologous CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Neutralizing antibody against IFN-α receptor was added at 5 µg/ml to some wells. Culture supernatants were collected at days 3, 5, and 7 and assayed for HIV p24 by ELISA. All data shown are from day 7. A) A representative example of data from a viremic patient. CpG ODN 2216 had no effect on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alone, and the degree of viral suppression by activated pDCs was comparable to that by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. B) Effect of pDCs on HIV replication in autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The degree of HIV suppression by pDCs was expressed as the difference of log HIV p24 production between the culture containing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alone and the co-culture of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and pDCs (Δlog p24 = log HIV p24[CD4 cells alone]-log HIV p24[CD4+pDC]). Data are shown for unstimulated pDCs (left panel) and CpG-stimulated pDCs (right panel). Horizontal lines represent median values. n.s., not significant.</p>
