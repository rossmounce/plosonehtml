                Figure 3.  Soluble factor-mediated suppression of HIV replication.HIV p24 assays were set up as in Figure 2, with the exception that pDCs were cultured at 5Ã—104 cells/well separately from CD4+ T cells, and supernatants from unstimulated or CpG ODN 2216-stimulated pDC cultures were added to the T cells at days 0, 3, and 5. Data from day 7 are shown. A) A representative example of data from a viremic patient. B) Effect of soluble factors secreted by pDCs on HIV replication in autologous CD4+ T cells, expressed as in Figure 2. Data are shown for supernatants from unstimulated pDCs (left panel) and CpG-stimulated pDCs (right panel). Data are expressed as delta log p24 as described above. n.s., not significant.
