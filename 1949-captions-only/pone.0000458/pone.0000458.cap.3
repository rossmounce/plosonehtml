Data from day 7 are shown. A) A representative example of data from a viremic patient. B) Effect of soluble factors secreted by pDCs on HIV replication in autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, expressed as in <a href="#pone-0000458-g002">Figure 2</a>. Data are shown for supernatants from unstimulated pDCs (left panel) and CpG-stimulated pDCs (right panel). Data are expressed as delta log p24 as described above. n.s., not significant.</p>
