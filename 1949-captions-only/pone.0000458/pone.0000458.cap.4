No significant differences were observed between the degree of blockade of suppression between patient groups. B) Quantification of IFN-α production in pDC cultures. Culture supernatants from day 3 cultures of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells plus: activated pDCs (left panel of each plot, described in <a href="#pone-0000458-g002">Figure 2</a>) or supernatants of activated pDCs (right panel of each plot, described in <a href="#pone-0000458-g003">Figure 3</a>) were analyzed for IFN-α production by ELISA. Significantly more IFN-α was present in culture supernatants from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-pDC co-culture experiments than in those from cultures containing pDC supernatants (p values indicated for each patient group).</p>
