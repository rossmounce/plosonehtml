                Figure 4.  Interferon-α in pDC-mediated HIV suppression. A) Effect of neutralizing IFN-α receptor antibody on HIV suppression.The percent of the HIV suppression observed in co-culture experiments (left panel, data from Figure 2B) or pDC supernatant transfer experiments (right panel, data from Figure 3B) that could be neutralized by an antibody to the IFN-α receptor is indicated. No significant differences were observed between the degree of blockade of suppression between patient groups. B) Quantification of IFN-α production in pDC cultures. Culture supernatants from day 3 cultures of CD4+ T cells plus: activated pDCs (left panel of each plot, described in Figure 2) or supernatants of activated pDCs (right panel of each plot, described in Figure 3) were analyzed for IFN-α production by ELISA. Significantly more IFN-α was present in culture supernatants from CD4+ T cell-pDC co-culture experiments than in those from cultures containing pDC supernatants (p values indicated for each patient group).
