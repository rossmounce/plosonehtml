                Figure 5.  Clustering of differentially expressed genes in unstimulated pDCs from HIV-infected individuals with low versus high viral loads.cRNA was prepared from up to 106 pDCs purified from 4 individuals maintaining plasma viremia&lt;12,500 copies/mL and 5 individuals with uncontrolled viremia&gt;12,500 copies/ml. Transcriptional profiles were assessed using Applied Biosystems high-density genome survey microarrays. Overall, 596 probes were found to be differentially expressed with p&lt;0.05, of which examples are listed at right. Variations in relative levels of gene expression (Z-score, scale shown below heatmap) are indicated in color, where red regions indicate upregulation, and green regions indicate downregulation. The hierarchical clustering heatmap was generated using Euclidean distance as the distance measurement between clusters. All genes differentially expressed with p&lt;0.05 are shown in supplemental Table S1.
