                Figure 6.  pDC killing in HIV-infected individuals.A) Plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers are reduced in HIV-infected versus uninfected individuals. PBMCs were stained with anti-BDCA-2 (FITC) and anti-CD123 (PE) to measure the levels of pDCs. Horizontal lines represent median values. B) pDCs are susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas was crosslinked on the surface of PBMCs, and resultant pDC apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining. n.s., not significant. C–E) pDC cell death induced by HIV-infected cells. 2×106 CEM cells chronically infected with HIV (CEM-IIIB) were incubated for 8 h with 107 PBMCs from HIV-infected donors. The levels of apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining. Cells within the pDC (BDCA-2+/CD123+) population that were double-positive for both Annexin V and 7-AAD were considered necrotic, while those positive for Annexin V and negative for 7-AAD were considered apoptotic. In some cultures, 100 µg/ml T20 was added. C) Cells expressing HIV induce pDC death. The percent of pDCs that were necrotic (Annexin V+/7-AAD+) is indicated on the y-axis. PBMCs alone versus PBMCs+CEM-IIIB are shown. As indicated, CEM-IIIB cells showed a significant induction of cell death vs. cells alone. D) Representative examples of T20-mediated blockade of CEM-IIIB-induced pDC cell death. E) Cell death is blocked by T20. Cells were incubated with CEM cells alone (left panel), CEM-IIIB, or CEM-IIIB+T20, and the percentage of pDCs in the apoptotic or necrotic quadrants was quantified. No cell death above baseline was induced by CEM cells alone. Both types of cell death induced by CEM-IIB cells were significantly reduced (p values indicated) in the presence of T20.
