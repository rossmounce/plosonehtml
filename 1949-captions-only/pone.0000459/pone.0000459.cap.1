                Figure 1.  Analysis of SARS-Co viral protein interactions by Y2H matrix screen and CoIP in mammalian cells.Y2H matrix screen was performed by mating S. cerevisiae strains AH109 and Y187 containing prey and bait vectors with the respective SARS-CoV ORFs on selective media. All ORFs were tested against each other. Positive interactions in yeast (black and grey squares) were retested by CoIP in mammalian cells (293cells) using anti- HA (preys) and anti-c-myc (baits) antibodies. Interactions tested positive in 293 cells by CoIP are encircled in red.
