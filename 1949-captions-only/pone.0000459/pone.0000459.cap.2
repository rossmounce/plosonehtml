                Figure 2.  CoIPs of non-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8.293 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF-7 and subsequently co-transfected with HA- and c-myc- tagged plasmids carrying the respective SARS-CoV ORFs. After 20 hours half of the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, the other half with anti- c-myc antibody. Bound proteins were subjected twice to 12,5% SDS-PAGE and Western Blot transfer, and probed cross-wise with the two antibodies. Co-precipitated proteins are indicated in the right panels. HA and c-myc tags are expressed as N-terminal fusions with the corresponding SARS-CoV ORF in plasmids pGADT7 and pGBKT7, respectively. Stars indicate expression products by IP, arrows by CoIP.
