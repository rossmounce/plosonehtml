                Figure 4.  SARS-CoV-host interaction network.Viral interactions are based on the experimental Y2H findings. Human interactions were taken from the combined human interaction network described in Table 2. Interactions between SARS and human proteins were gathered from the literature and are listed in Supplemental Table 1. The figure shows the SARS interaction network (A) and proteins and interactions which are separated from the SARS network by no more than 2 (B) and 3 (C) interactions, respectively. SARS-CoV proteins are depicted in dark red, their direct targets (distance 1) in light red, neighbours of the direct targets (distance 2) in orange and neighbours of the latter (distance 3) in yellow.
