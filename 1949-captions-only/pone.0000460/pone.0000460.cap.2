                Figure 2.  Example length profile with deconvolution results.An example length profile is shown in blue. The normalized ratio from each length fraction is plotted against the length fractions in order, where the first length fraction is the one with the highest gel mobility. The rolling baseline is shown in green, and the deconvolution result is shown in red.
