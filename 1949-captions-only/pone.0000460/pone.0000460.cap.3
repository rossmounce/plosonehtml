                Figure 3.  Calibrating the relationship between gel mobility and transcript length.The precise gel mobilities of all peaks from gold standard genes are plotted against the natural log of the sum of their matching Refseq length and an estimated poly(A) tail length of 225 nucleotides. The least squares fit to a line is shown by a black line with the parameters y = 0.054731 x+5.997276 (R2 = 0.99). Closed circles represent points used to determine the calibration line. Points shown by open circles were excluded from the least squares calculation.
