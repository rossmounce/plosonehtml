The transcribed portion of the gene is shown with the filled boxes representing exons. The ORF is represented by the taller boxes. The genomic positions of four cDNA clones that map only to the <em>SLC2A1</em> gene, and a proposed novel <em>SLC2A1</em> transcript, are shown relative to the <em>SLC2A1</em> gene. The transcript length measured for each clone is shown in parentheses.</p>
