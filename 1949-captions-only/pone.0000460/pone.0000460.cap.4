                Figure 4.  Solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) gene.The SLC2A1 gene is pictured schematically. The transcribed portion of the gene is shown with the filled boxes representing exons. The ORF is represented by the taller boxes. The genomic positions of four cDNA clones that map only to the SLC2A1 gene, and a proposed novel SLC2A1 transcript, are shown relative to the SLC2A1 gene. The transcript length measured for each clone is shown in parentheses.
