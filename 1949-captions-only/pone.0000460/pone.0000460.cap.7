                Figure 7.  Calibration between bootstrap value and true positive rate.The bootstrap value is plotted against the true positive rate for bootstrap values from 0 to 0.6. The least squares fit to a sigmoidal equation is shown by a solid line with the parameters y = −0.07563+1.09892/(1+e (0.15928−x)/0.08257).
