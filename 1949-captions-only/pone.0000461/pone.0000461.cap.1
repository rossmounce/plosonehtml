                Figure 1.  The relationship between canSNPs, sub-lineages and/or sub-groups: The stars in this dendrogram represent specific lineages that are defined by one of the seven sequenced genomes of B. anthracis.The circles represent branch points along the lineages that contain specific subgroups of isolates. These sub-groups are named after the canSNPs that flank these positions. Indicated in red are the positions and names for each of the canSNPs (also see Table 1).
