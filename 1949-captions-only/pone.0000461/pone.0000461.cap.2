VNTR loci mutate at faster rates than SNPs and, hence, provide greater resolution for terminal branches. Longer branches, such as the B and C lineages, have length underestimation in this analysis due to mutational saturation. The scale bar indicates genetic distance. Also illustrated on this figure is the distribution of the canonical SNP groups relative to the MLVA phylogeny (right columns). The number of isolates (N) associated with each canSNP group is shown in the second column. The correlation between the phylogenetic clusters identified by the canSNP and MLVA analysis with regards to the world wide geographic distribution of these clusters can be seen in <a href="#pone-0000461-g003">Figure 3</a>.</p>
