The numbers of isolates (N) and associated MLVA genotypes (G) within each sub-lineage are indicated as well as the average Hamming distance (D) as estimated from VNTR data. The major lineages (A, B, C) are labelled, as are the derived sub-lineages (1â€“12), which are also color-coded. (B) Frequency and geographic distribution of the B. anthracis sub-lineages. The colors represented in the pie charts correspond to the sub-lineage color designations in panel A.</p>
