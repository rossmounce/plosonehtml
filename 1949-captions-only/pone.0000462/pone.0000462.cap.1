                Figure 1.  SNP positions and allele frequencies.(A) Positions of all twenty-nine SNPs in a 3551-bp region of schizophrenia-associated GABRB2 from base 160,689,203 to base 160,692,753 of chromosome 5 contig NT_023133.12 are shown to scale. Solid horizontal lines represent introns flanking Exon 9 (green box) and the human specific Alu insert Yi6AH151 (yellow box), which spans bases 160,691,468 and 160,691,782. The ID numbers of SNPs with prefixes “rs” or “ss” are labeled according to the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP; www.ncbi.nih.gov/SNP). The two alleles for each SNP are shown in parentheses following the SNP ID number in the format of (ancestral base)/(derived base). (B) Population allele frequencies of each SNP are represented by pie-charts for the AF, GE, US and JP populations, where the cyanine wedge indicates the frequency of the ancestral allele (N), and the red wedge the frequency of the derived allele (D). The four SNPs with high derived allele frequencies (high-D SNPs) are indicated by arrows and red ID Number.
