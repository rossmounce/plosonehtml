                Figure 2.  Haplotype frequency distribution in the four populations (refer to Figure 1 legend for abbreviations).Each haplotype is assigned into either the ancestral (HG-N; cyanine) or derived (HG-D; red) group according to its allelic status at rs1816072, likely the youngest high-D SNP. Details of the compositions and frequencies of different haplotypes are shown in Table S3.
