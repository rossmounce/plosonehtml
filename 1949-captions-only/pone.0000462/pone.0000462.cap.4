                Figure 4.  Proposed molecular evolution events in relation to time frame of modern human origins and dispersal from Africa.The age estimates of the four high-D SNPs are shown on the left of this figure. Relevant human evolution milestones, including divergence from chimpanzee and modern human evolution events delineated in Mellars' model [29], are represented on the right. Yi6AH151 is represented as Alu.
