                Figure 5.  Homozygous D-allele genotype (DD) frequencies for the four high-D SNPs in controls (top) and schizophrenics (bottom) (Table S5).These DD frequencies are plotted for AF, GE, US, JP and Han Chinese from Shanghai (CH) with the four high-D SNPs arranged from left to right in a descending order of their estimated ages. To avoid the potential influence from any gender effect, only male samples were employed in this controls-schizophrenics comparison. The absence of schizophrenic samples of AF origin is indicated by “#”.
