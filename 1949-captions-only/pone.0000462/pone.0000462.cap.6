                Figure 6.  Variations of GABA-potentiated current rundowns with infused ATP.Currents were measured upon 30 successive additions of GABA at 1-minute intervals as described in Methods. Electrophysiological currents, expressed as a percentage of the peak current (▵) measured upon initial response to stimulation by 100 µM (top row) or 300 µM (bottom row) GABA, were measured for α1β2Lγ2L (▪) and α1β2Sγ2L (○) receptors with intracellular infusion of 1 mM, 2 mM or 4 mM ATP. Each data point represents average±standard error recorded from 7–10 cells from at least six independent transfections. Responses that were significantly different between the α1β2Lγ2L and α1β2Sγ2L receptors based on the two-tailed Student's t-test are marked by asterisks (*, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01).
