Electrophysiological currents, expressed as a percentage of the peak current (▵) measured upon initial response to stimulation by 100 µM (top row) or 300 µM (bottom row) GABA, were measured for α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2L</sub>γ<sub>2L</sub> (▪) and α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2S</sub>γ<sub>2L</sub> (○) receptors with intracellular infusion of 1 mM, 2 mM or 4 mM ATP. Each data point represents average±standard error recorded from 7–10 cells from at least six independent transfections. Responses that were significantly different between the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2L</sub>γ<sub>2L</sub> and α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2S</sub>γ<sub>2L</sub> receptors based on the two-tailed Student's <em>t</em>-test are marked by asterisks (*, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01).</p>
