In order to make it easier to see which letters are most likely in each of the columns of the motif, the simplified motif shows the letter probabilities multiplied by 10 rounded to the nearest integer. Zeros are replaced by “:” (a colon) for readability. The information content diagram provides an idea of which positions in the motif are most highly conserved. Each column (position) in a motif can be characterized by the amount of information it contains (measured in bits). Highly conserved positions in the motif have high information; positions where all letters are equally likely have low information. The diagram is printed so that each column lines up with the same column in the simplified position-specific probability matrix above it. This multilevel consensus sequence says several things about the motif. First, the most likely form of the motif can be read from the top line as LLVIAVVVALVIxVLLVxL. Second, that only letter L has probability more than 0.2 in position 1 of the motif, both L and I have probability greater than 0.2 in position 2, etc. Third, a rough approximation of the motif can be made by converting the multilevel consensus sequence into the Prosite signature: L-[LI]-V-I-[AS]-V-V-V-[AGS]-L-V-[IF]-x-[​VI]-L-[LV]-V-x-[LI].</p>
