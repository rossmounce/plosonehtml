The sites are shown aligned with each other, and the ten sequence positions preceding and following each site are also shown. Each site is identified by the name of the sequence where it occurs and the position in the sequence where the site begins. The sites are listed in order of increasing p-value. The p-value of a site is computed from the match score of the site with the position specific scoring matrix for the motif. The p-value gives the probability of a random string (generated from the background letter frequencies) having the same match score or higher. Amino acid residues constituting the transmembrane region of the protein are indicated by shading.</p>
