                Figure 1.  Differential Gene expression in physiologically normal individuals with age.Ordered distance matrix using the HOPACH algorithm[53] of significantly differentially expressed genes in young versus old skeletal muscle (FWER&lt;0.05). Bold lines surround the first level of clustering, with the less bold lines indicating secondary clustering. Green to blue to purple is close to far. B) Medoid gene expression profile of a gene illustrating the expression behavior of cluster 1. C) Medoid gene expression of a gene illustrating the expression behavior of cluster 2.
