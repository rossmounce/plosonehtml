                Figure 2.  Exercise reverses a functional decline in the elderly.Each point represents an individual who underwent strength training as described in the methods. Young individuals had a greater capacity to lift the weights compared to older individuals (p&lt;0.001, non parametric t-test). However, after 6 months training, the older individuals had a marked increase in their ability to carry out the exercise (p&lt;0.0001, paired non-parametric t-test).
