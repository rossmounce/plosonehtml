Gene Index represents the 179 genes associated with age and exercise. The expression of these genes has been normalized relative to young values (young expression is represented by the dark line drawn across the graph at 1). Each genes average relative expression within the 14 older individuals can be seen relative to younger individuals. Genes that are downregulated with age show a marked reversal to youthful levels with exercise, and genes that are upregulated with age also show the same trend to return to youthful levels in association with exercise. b. Permutation testing of genes associated with exercise and age, to determine statistically significant reversals with exercise. The x axis (log<sub>2</sub>) represents the ratio of older subjects post-exercise gene expression compared to young individuals, with 0 being equivalent to “young” gene expression. This resulted in a <em>p</em>-value of &lt;0.02. The conclusion is that the log<sub>2</sub> ratios are much closer to 0 (expression is the same in old-exercise and young) than one would expect by chance (random draw of the 596 genes related to age).</p>
