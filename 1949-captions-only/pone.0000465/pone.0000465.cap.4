                Figure 4.  Exercise is more likely to affect “aging” genes than genes not associated with age.The x-axis (log2) represents the ratio of post over pre-exercise gene expression among older subjects. The dark solid line represents the distribution of log2 ratios of exercise (post/pre) among genes that are significantly associated with age. The red line represents the equivalent distribution for those genes not associated with aging. The p-value associated with the difference in distributions is less than 0.0001.
