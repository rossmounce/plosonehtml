The dark solid line represents the distribution of log<sub>2</sub> ratios of exercise (post/pre) among genes that are significantly associated with age. The red line represents the equivalent distribution for those genes not associated with aging. The <em>p</em>-value associated with the difference in distributions is less than 0.0001.</p>
