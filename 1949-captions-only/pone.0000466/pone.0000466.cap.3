                Figure 3.  Hemodynamic parameters measured by telemetry of conscious Sprague Dawley rats (250g to 300g) treated with single intravenous bolus infusions of LeTx (0.03 mg PA+0.015 mg LF) or EdTx (0.15 mg PA+0.075 mg EF).A. Heart rate (beats per min), B. Pulse pressure (mmHg), C. Mean arterial pressure (mmHg), D. Systolic blood pressure (mmHg), and E. Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) were measured every 15 min. for 72 hr before and after toxin administration.
