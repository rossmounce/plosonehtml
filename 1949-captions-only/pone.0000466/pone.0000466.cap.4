LeTx treated rats at zero, one and two hr post-infusion, velocity of propagation was 24±5, 34±7 and 46±17 cm/sec, respectively, with significant difference (P = 0.05 at one hr compared to controls and P = 0.007 at two hr compared to controls); B. LeTx treated rats at zero and one hr post-infusion, left ventricular diastolic area was 0.98±0.07 and 1.15±0.06, respectively, with significant difference (P = 0.01); C. LeTx treated rats at zero and one hr post-infusion, left ventricular systolic area was 0.79±0.08 and 0.98±0.10 cm, respectively, with significant difference (P = 0.02); D. EdTx treated rats at zero, one and two hr post-infusion, heart rate was 326±49, 371±28, and 393±10 beats per min, respectively, with significant difference (P = 0.05 at one hr and P = 0.001 at two hr compared to controls). The box represents the middle 50% of the data. The line through the box represents the median. The line (whiskers) extending from the box represent the upper and lower 25% of the data. The line of each plot connects the means of the sample.</p>
