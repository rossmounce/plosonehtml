For each round of selection the DNA library was transcribed, photoligated to a 3â€²-puromycin DNA linker, translated, and reverse transcribed to produce a pool of protein 18-19 variants displayed as mRNA-protein fusions. The library was incubated with ATP derivatized agarose in selection buffer supplemented with 1.5-3 M GuHCl, washed to remove the unbound material, and eluted with selection buffer containing 10 mM ATP. Eluted fractions were combined, amplified by PCR, and used as input into the next round of selection.</p>
