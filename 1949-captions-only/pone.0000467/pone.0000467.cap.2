                Figure 2.  ATP Binding Selection Profile.The proportion of mRNA-protein fusions that bound to immobilized ATP and eluted with free ATP in selection buffer supplemented with 1.5 M GuHCl. The pool of protein variants used as the input into round 1 were generated by amplification of protein 18-19 under mutagenic conditions. The average mutagenic rate was 3.5% per amino acid position.
