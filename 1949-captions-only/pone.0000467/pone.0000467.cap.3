SDS-PAGE analysis shows that protein variants containing one or both of the selected mutations remain soluble in the absence of exogenous ATP. (B) Thermal denaturing curves for protein 18-19 and evolutionary optimized variants. The thermal stability of proteins 18-19, 18-19 (N32D), 18-19 (D65V), and DX were measured by temperature dependent circular dichroism at a fixed wavelength of 210 nm. Proteins containing one or both of the selected mutations exhibit higher relative thermal stability than the parent sequence.</p>
