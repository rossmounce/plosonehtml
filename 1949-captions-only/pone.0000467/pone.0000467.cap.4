Mutations N32D and D65V transformed protein 8-19 into a stably folded water-soluble protein with significantly less ligand dependence than the parent sequence. (B) The three-dimensional structure (ribbon diagram) of protein DX (gray) superimposed with the parent sequence, protein 18-19 (gold). The zinc metal ion is shown in orange and the ATP ligand is colored by atom type.</p>
