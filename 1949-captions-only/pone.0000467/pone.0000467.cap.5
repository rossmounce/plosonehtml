                Figure 5.  Structural Comparison of the Selected Mutations.(A) The region of the ATP binding site contains a network of pi-stacking (Y43 and F50) and electrostatic interactions (K34, K36, R41, and D66) that mediate ligand binding. (B) The D65V mutation removes a salt bridge on the hydrophobic side of the Î²-sheet and repositions several nearby loops and side-chains. (C) The N32D mutation caused a change in the electrostatic environment of the ligand binding site by forming an ion pair with K47.
