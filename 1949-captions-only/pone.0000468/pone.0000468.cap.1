No conformational changes occur upon binding. The ligand (white) and the target (green) have complementary structures. (B) Induced fit. The target changes its conformation due to the interaction with the ligand. (C) Pre-existing equilibrium model. The native state is actually an ensemble of conformations, that is deformations may occur even before binding. The ligand selectively binds the matching target within this ensemble of fluctuating conformations.</p>
