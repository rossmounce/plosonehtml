Non-specific binding energy may lead to the formation of functional complexes in which the target and the ligand are not exactly matched. The unmatched complexes may also be functional but their product formation rates, ν<em><sub>um</sub></em>, may differ from these of the matched complexes, ν<em><sub>m</sub></em>. The specificity of the ligand, that is its ability to discriminate between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, depends on the ligand flexibility, the structural mismatch between its native state and the correct target and on the structural difference between the competing targets.</p>
