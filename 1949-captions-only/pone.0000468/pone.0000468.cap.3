                Figure 3.  General molecular recognition scheme.Both the ligand (white) and the target (green) are interconverting between an ensemble of conformations denoted by indices, ai and Ai, respectively. All the different conformations may interact and as a result, a variety of complexes is formed. In some of them the target and the ligand are perfectly matched, for example aiAi and ajAj, and in some there is only partial fit, for example aiAj and ajAi. The rate of product formation depends on the concentrations of the complexes, which depend on Kij, and on the functionality of each complex, which depends on the turnover numbers, Ï…ij. In a similar fashion, the different ligand conformations, ai, may interact with competing target conformations Bi and thus catalyze incorrect product.
