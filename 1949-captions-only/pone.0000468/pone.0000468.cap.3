All the different conformations may interact and as a result, a variety of complexes is formed. In some of them the target and the ligand are perfectly matched, for example <em>a<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>a<sub>j</sub>A<sub>j</sub></em>, and in some there is only partial fit, for example <em>a<sub>i</sub>A<sub>j</sub></em> and <em>a<sub>j</sub>A<sub>i</sub></em>. The rate of product formation depends on the concentrations of the complexes, which depend on <em>K<sub>ij</sub></em>, and on the functionality of each complex, which depends on the turnover numbers, Ï…<em><sub>ij</sub></em>. In a similar fashion, the different ligand conformations, <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>, may interact with competing target conformations <em>B<sub>i</sub></em> and thus catalyze incorrect product.</p>
