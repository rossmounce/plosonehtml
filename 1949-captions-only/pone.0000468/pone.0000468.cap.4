In the native state of the ligand, the binding sites are equally spaced and positioned at <em>x<sub>i</sub></em><sup>0</sup> (<em>i</em> = 0,1,2…<em>N−1</em>) and the total length of the binding domain is <em>l<sub>0</sub></em>. The ligand is interacting with a rigid target on which <em>N</em> complementary binding sites are equally spaced and positioned at <em>y<sub>i</sub></em>  = <em>y<sub>0</sub>+i·s/</em>(<em>N−1</em>) where <em>s</em> is the length of the target binding domain. The ligand may undergo a conformational change to fit the target. Since we consider only the lowest mode motion, the ligand may only stretch or expand uniformly. Thus, its binding sites are displaced to <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>x<sub>0</sub></em>+<em>i·l</em>/(<em>N</em>−1) and the total length changes from <em>l<sub>0</sub></em> to <em>l</em>.</p>
