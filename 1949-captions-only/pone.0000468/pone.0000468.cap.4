                Figure 4.  Lowest elastic mode model.Conformational changes occur upon binding of a ligand (white) and a target (green). In the native state of the ligand, the binding sites are equally spaced and positioned at xi0 (i = 0,1,2…N−1) and the total length of the binding domain is l0. The ligand is interacting with a rigid target on which N complementary binding sites are equally spaced and positioned at yi  = y0+i·s/(N−1) where s is the length of the target binding domain. The ligand may undergo a conformational change to fit the target. Since we consider only the lowest mode motion, the ligand may only stretch or expand uniformly. Thus, its binding sites are displaced to xi = x0+i·l/(N−1) and the total length changes from l0 to l.
