                Figure 6.  Specificity ξ as a function of mismatch d and flexibility, k.Colors denote various values of rigidity k (in units of kBT/Å2, legend). (A) For targets that differ by Δ = 3 Å the specificity is optimal at a nonzero mismatch. As the ligand becomes more rigid the optimal mismatch tends to zero as d0~k−1/2. (B) For competing targets with similar structure, Δ = 0, the specificity resembles a rectangular window centered on zero mismatch. The width of this window also decreases as k−1/2. (C) The specificity when only matched complexes are functional, r = 0, increases exponentially with the mismatch as ξ~exp(k·Δ·d). The parameters of the plot are N = 15, m = 2, ε = 2 kBT, r = 0.1, g = 1 Å, f = 15 kBT.
