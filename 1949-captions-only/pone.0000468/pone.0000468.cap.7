                Figure 7.  Specificity as a function of a 2D mismatch in the presence of multiple competitors.Color bar shows log of specificity. In two dimensions, the ligand structure may stretch or shrink along x and y. The mismatches along these axes are dx and dy. The gray circle denotes zero mismatch. In the presence of multiple competitors (green crosses), the optimal mismatch (black X) is nonzero and depends on the structure of the various competitors. Competitors that slightly differ from the correct target have a “window of recognition” which overlaps with correct target recognition window. As a result, the specificity is maximal for a non-zero mismatch. The parameters of the plot are N = 15, m = 2, ε = 2 kBT, r = 0.1, g = 1 Å, k = 1 kBT/Å2, f = 15 kBT.
