                Figure 8.  Specificity ξ in the presence of two noisy targets as a function of mismatch d.Colors denote various values of rigidity k (in units of kBT/Å2, legend). The lengths of the target binding domain, sA and sB are fluctuating according to a Gaussian noise with variances σA and σB. (A, B) For competing targets of different structure, Δ = 3 Å, similarly to noiseless targets, the specificity is optimal at a nonzero mismatch. (C, D) Competing targets of similar structure, Δ = 0. The specificity has an extremum at d = 0, but whether this point is maximum or minimum depends on the noise. For a noisier correct target, σA&gt;σB, an optimal ligand has a nonzero mismatch. The parameters of the plot are: N = 15, m = 2, ε = 2 kBT, r = 0.1, g = 1 Å, σA,B = 0.5, 0.6 Å, f = 15 kBT.
