                Figure 1.  Nicotine protects renal function after I/R in a dose-dependent manner.A dose range from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight of nicotine has been administrated intraperitoneally 30 minutes before the induction of renal ischemia (A). Only 0.5 mg/kg (n = 12) and 1 mg/kg (n = 15) of nicotine protects renal function 1 day after renal I/R. Doses lower than 0.5 mg/kg such as 0.25 mg/kg (n = 6) and 0.1 mg/kg (n = 7) were not protective. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05. On panel B, serum creatinine levels were measured in sham-operated animals that received either saline solution (black bars, n = 8) or nicotine at the dose of either 0.5 mg/kg body weight (white bars, n = 6) or 1 mg/kg body weight (n = 6) and compared with saline-treated (black bars, n = 19 at day 1 and n = 15 at day 3) or nicotine treated animals at doses of 0.5 mg/kg (n = 12 at day 1 and n = 15 at day 3) or 1 mg/kg (n = 16 at day 1 and n = 12 at day 3) that underwent renal I/R. Blood samples were harvested 1 and 3 days after reperfusion. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05.
