Histology of the corticomedullary junction 1 day after reperfusion from a sham-operated mouse (B, referred as sham), a saline-treated mouse that underwent I/R (C, referred as IRI-CTRL) and a nicotine-treated mouse (D, referred as IRI-nicotine), PAS staining, original magnification ×40. The PAS positive brush border (BB) is shown in panel B. Tubular casts (TC) and tubular dilatations (TD) are visible in panel C. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05.</p>
