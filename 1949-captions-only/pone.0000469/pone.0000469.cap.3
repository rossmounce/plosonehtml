TNF-α and KC levels were measured by ELISA in kidney homogenates harvested 24 hours after reperfusion. All samples were corrected for total protein amounts measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. HMGB1 specific blots (C) were performed on cytoplasmic renal extracts. From left to the right: saline treated sham-operated animals, nicotine-treated sham-operated animals, nicotine treated I/R animals and saline treated I/R animals. Blots are representative of 6 to 8 individual mice in each group. Quantification was assessed by the densitometry index (D). Similar results were observed in two separate experiments. Data are expressed as mean± SEM and (*) p≤0.05.</p>
