Sham operated animals displayed no neutrophil (data not shown). Nicotine administration completely prevented neutrophil infiltration (panel B, magnification ×40). Quantification is represented in panel C. Black bars represent saline-treated animals and white bars nicotine-treated groups after either sham operation (n = 6 in each group) or I/R (n = 8 in each group). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05.</p>
