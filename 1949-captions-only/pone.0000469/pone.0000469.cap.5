                Figure 5.  Nicotine reduces tubular epithelial cell apoptosis and subsequent proliferation.Immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 (A, B) and Ki67 (D, E) were performed one day and 3 days after I/R, respectively. Panel A represents TEC apoptosis in saline-treated animals (magnification ×40) and panel B represents TEC apoptosis in nicotine pre-treated animals (magnification ×40). Graph C compares the quantification of apoptotic TECs in saline-treated (black bars) or nicotine-treated animals (white bars), either after sham operation (n = 6 in each group) or renal I/R (n = 7 in saline-treated group and n = 10 in nicotine pretreated group). Panels D and E compare Ki-67+ cells between saline-treated animals and nicotine-treated animals (magnification ×40). Graph F compares the quantification of proliferation 3 days after reperfusion (n = 5 in each group). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05.
