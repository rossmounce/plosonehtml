                Figure 6.  Nicotine-mediated protection against renal I/R is a7nAChoR-dependent.Serum creatinine levels one day after renal I/R were measured in the following groups from left to the right: saline-treated wild-type α7nAChoR sufficient animals (+/+, black bars, n = 10), nicotine-treated wild type α7nAChoR sufficient animals (+/+, white bars, n = 5), saline-treated α7nAChoR−/− animals (−/−, black bars, n = 8) and nicotine-treated α7nAChoR−/− animals. (−/−, white bars, n = 10). Nicotine was given at the dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) p≤0.05.
