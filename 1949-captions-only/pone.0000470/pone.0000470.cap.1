Mean levels of CCR5 expression in the control and statin treated cells are depict, * indicates P&lt;0.01. (B) Levels of CCR5 mRNA were assayed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N) on day 4 of treatment. The results are presented as a ratio between untreated (unt.) cells and cells treated (tr.) with statins.</p>
