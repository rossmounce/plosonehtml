                Figure 1.  Statins down-regulate expression of CCR5 on CD4+ T lymphocytes.(A) CCR5 cell surface expression was monitored on enriched CD4+ T lymphocytes treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N). Mean levels of CCR5 expression in the control and statin treated cells are depict, * indicates P&lt;0.01. (B) Levels of CCR5 mRNA were assayed in CD4+ T lymphocytes treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N) on day 4 of treatment. The results are presented as a ratio between untreated (unt.) cells and cells treated (tr.) with statins.
