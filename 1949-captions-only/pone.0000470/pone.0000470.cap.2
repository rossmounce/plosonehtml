                Figure 2.  Statins upregulate RANTES accumulation in culture supernatant and increase RANTES mRNA expression.(A) RANTES levels were analyzed in the culture supernatants of cells from five donors treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N) on day 4 of treatment and compared to untreated control cells. (B) Mean levels of RANTES mRNA expression after treatment with the statins in four donors. The results are presented as a ratio between untreated (unt.) cells and cells treated (tr.) with statins.
