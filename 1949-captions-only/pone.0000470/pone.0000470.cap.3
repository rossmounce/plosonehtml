                Figure 3.  Stain treatment preferentially inhibits the replication of R5 versus X4 HIV-1 (A)TCID50/ml infectious profiles of an R5 (black bars) and X4 virus (white bars) were monitored on CD4+ T lymphocytes in the presence of Lov, Mev, Sim(N) and Sim(A) and compared to non-statin treated cells. (B and C) CD4+ enriched lymphocytes were treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N) for 4 days then infected with an X4 (B) or R5 strain (C) of HIV-1 and cultured in the absence of statins as well as compared to non-statin treated cells. Non-statin treated cells are depict with closed squares and statin treated cells are depict with open circles.
