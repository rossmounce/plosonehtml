(B and C) CD4<sup>+</sup> enriched lymphocytes were treated with Lov, Mev, Sim(A) and Sim(N) for 4 days then infected with an X4 (B) or R5 strain (C) of HIV-1 and cultured in the absence of statins as well as compared to non-statin treated cells. Non-statin treated cells are depict with closed squares and statin treated cells are depict with open circles.</p>
