The RRM domain is underscored and the RS domains at the N-and C-terminus are indicated by dashed underlines. Identical amino acids are shown by reverse lettering. Dashes indicate gaps in alignment. (B) In vitro splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA in S100 cell extract supplemented with either 25 ng of ASF/SF2 (ASF) or increasing amounts (10, 30 and 90 ng) of purified SR45 (SR45) expressed in insect cells. The positions of pre-mRNA, spliced mRNA and 5′ exon are indicated to the right of the blot. Boxes and a line indicate exons and an intron, respectively.</p>
