Filled rectangles are exons; thin lines are introns; inverted open triangle indicates the position of the T-DNA insertion in the 7<sup>th</sup> exon. The location of various primers used in PCR is indicated by half-head arrows. The schematic diagram below the gene structure shows domain organization of SR45 protein. The corresponding gene positions coding for the N-terminal arginine/serine rich (RS1) domain, the middle RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the C-terminal RS2 domain are indicated by downward arrows. (B) Verification of the <em>sr45-1</em> insertion in the genomic DNA by PCR with <em>SR45</em>-specific primers (LP and RP) and the T-DNA-specific primer LBb1; the locations of these primers relative to the T-DNA insertion are shown in (A). (C) Southern blot showing single insertion of T-DNA. Genomic DNA from WT and <em>sr45-1</em> was digested with either SacI or EcoRI and probed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled T-DNA probe. (D) RT-PCR expression analyses of <em>SR45</em> in WT and <em>sr45-1</em> plants using <em>SR45</em>-specific primers (1F and 414R, which will amplify full-length <em>SR45</em>; 1F and 172R will amplify a truncated <em>SR45</em> transcript before the T-DNA insertion). Cyc, cyclophilin product was amplified to show equal amount of cDNA template in PCR. PCR product in WT and <em>sr45-1</em> was normalized to cyclophilin expression in WT and <em>sr45-1</em>, respectively. Numbers below each panel indicate the level of transcript in WT and <em>sr45-1</em> plants. The level of <em>SR45</em> transcript in WT is considered as 1.</p>
