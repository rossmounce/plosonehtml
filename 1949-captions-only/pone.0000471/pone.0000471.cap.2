                Figure 2.  Molecular characterization of sr45-1plants.(A) Gene structure of SR45 (At1g16610). Filled rectangles are exons; thin lines are introns; inverted open triangle indicates the position of the T-DNA insertion in the 7th exon. The location of various primers used in PCR is indicated by half-head arrows. The schematic diagram below the gene structure shows domain organization of SR45 protein. The corresponding gene positions coding for the N-terminal arginine/serine rich (RS1) domain, the middle RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the C-terminal RS2 domain are indicated by downward arrows. (B) Verification of the sr45-1 insertion in the genomic DNA by PCR with SR45-specific primers (LP and RP) and the T-DNA-specific primer LBb1; the locations of these primers relative to the T-DNA insertion are shown in (A). (C) Southern blot showing single insertion of T-DNA. Genomic DNA from WT and sr45-1 was digested with either SacI or EcoRI and probed with a 32P-labeled T-DNA probe. (D) RT-PCR expression analyses of SR45 in WT and sr45-1 plants using SR45-specific primers (1F and 414R, which will amplify full-length SR45; 1F and 172R will amplify a truncated SR45 transcript before the T-DNA insertion). Cyc, cyclophilin product was amplified to show equal amount of cDNA template in PCR. PCR product in WT and sr45-1 was normalized to cyclophilin expression in WT and sr45-1, respectively. Numbers below each panel indicate the level of transcript in WT and sr45-1 plants. The level of SR45 transcript in WT is considered as 1.
