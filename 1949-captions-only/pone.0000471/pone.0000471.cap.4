                Figure 4.  Phenotypic characterization of sr45-1plants.(A–D) Phenotypes of sr45-1 at different growth stages grown under long-days (16-h photoperiod). WT plants are shown on the left side and sr45-1 plants are on the right side of each panel. (A) Eight day-old seedlings on MS plates; Note that sr45-1 has narrow true leaves. (B) Twenty-day-old plants in the soil; several leaves in the sr45-1 plant are curled downward and inward, indicated by arrow-heads. Inset graph in (B) shows the size of sr45-1 compared to WT. (C) Thirty-five-day old plants in soil. (D) Fifty-four-day-old plants in soil; note that WT has completed flowering and most of the siliques have turned brown, whereas, the sr45-1 plant is still flowering. (E) Root growth in sr45-1 and WT plants. A representative photograph of sr45-1 and WT seedlings (27 days after germination) illustrates reduced root growth. (F) Quantification of root growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM of 5 plants.
