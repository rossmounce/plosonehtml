WT plants are shown on the left side and <em>sr45-1</em> plants are on the right side of each panel. (A) Eight day-old seedlings on MS plates; Note that <em>sr45-1</em> has narrow true leaves. (B) Twenty-day-old plants in the soil; several leaves in the <em>sr45-1</em> plant are curled downward and inward, indicated by arrow-heads. Inset graph in (B) shows the size of <em>sr45-1</em> compared to WT. (C) Thirty-five-day old plants in soil. (D) Fifty-four-day-old plants in soil; note that WT has completed flowering and most of the siliques have turned brown, whereas, the <em>sr45-1</em> plant is still flowering. (E) Root growth in <em>sr45-1</em> and WT plants. A representative photograph of <em>sr45-1</em> and WT seedlings (27 days after germination) illustrates reduced root growth. (F) Quantification of root growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM of 5 plants.</p>
