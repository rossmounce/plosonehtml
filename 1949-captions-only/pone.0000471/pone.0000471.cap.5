Age of the plants at the time they were photographed is indicated on each panel. Bottom Panel: Quantification of flowering time. Transition to reproductive stage was measured as days to bolting and number of rosette leaves at the appearance of 1<sup>st</sup> flower. Each bar is the mean±SEM of 48 to 72 plants. Significant differences (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) between WT and <em>sr45-1</em> plants are indicated by ‘*’. Each experiment was repeated three times. (B) Effect of vernalization on flowering of <em>sr45-1</em> plants. <em>sr45-1</em> and WT seeds were stratified at 4°C for 2 days or vernalized for 40 days at 4°C and grown under LD (16 h photoperiod) or SD (8 h photoperiod) conditions in soil. Flowering time was measured as described in experimental procedures. V+and V-indicate vernalized and unvernalized plants, respectively. Significant differences (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) between vernalized and unvernalized plants are indicated by ‘*’. Each experiment was repeated three times. (C) Expression analyses of flowering related genes in <em>sr45-1</em> and WT plants. Expression of representative genes in various flowering pathways was analyzed by RT-PCR. <em>VRN2</em> belongs to the vernalization pathway, <em>FCA</em> to the autonomous pathway; <em>FLC</em> integrates signals from these two pathways. <em>CO</em> belongs to the photoperiod pathway. <em>SOC1</em> and <em>FT</em> function downstream of <em>FLC</em>. Each RT-PCR was repeated at least three times. (D) Expression levels of various genes in the flowering time pathways of Arabidopsis. Model is adapted from <a href="#pone.0000471-Boss1">[24]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000471-He2">[70]</a>. Value in parentheses next to a gene indicates induction or repression of that gene in <em>sr45-1</em>. NC, No change.</p>
