Note that <em>sr45-1</em> has elongated leaves. Cotyledonary leaves (C1 and C2) and true leaves are numbered from left (older) to right (younger). (B) Leaf length/width ratios (Mean±SEM) of WT and <em>sr45-1</em> plants. (<em>n</em> = 11 leaves from 11 plants, Student's <em>t</em>-test <em>p</em>-values are as follows: Cotyledon (C1), <em>p</em> = 0.52; Cotyledon (C2), <em>p</em> = 0.39; leaf 1, <em>p</em> = 0.002; leaf 2, <em>p</em> = 0.021; leaf 3, <em>p</em> = 0.022; leaf 4, <em>p</em> = 0.0003; leaf 5, <em>p</em> = 0.33; leaf 6, <em>p</em> = 0.49; leaf 7, <em>p</em> = 0.29). The symbol ‘*’ on the top of bars indicate that the difference between WT and <em>sr45-1</em> is significant (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (C) Fully opened flowers of <em>sr45-1</em> plants have elongated petals. The bottom panel shows quantification of length, width and length/width ratio (Mean±SEM) of petals in WT (WT) and mutant (<em>sr45-1</em>) plants (<em>n</em> = 16, Student's <em>t</em>-test <em>p</em>-values: length, <em>p</em> = 10<sup>−9</sup>, width, <em>p</em> = 10<sup>−8</sup><em>;</em>length/width <em>p</em> = 10<sup>−10</sup>). The symbol ‘*’ on the top of bars indicate that the difference between WT and <em>sr45-1</em> is significant (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (D) The leaves of <em>sr45-1</em> plants exhibit abnormal expansion of pavement cells. Scanning electron micrographs of the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of WT and <em>sr45-1</em> plants. Note the presence of abnormal elongated abaxial pavement cells in <em>sr45-1</em>. For clarity, the boundaries of pavement cells on the adaxial surfaces are outlined. Note the presence of markedly enlarged and elongated pavement cells in <em>sr45-1</em> leaves. Bars = 50 µm. (E) Quantitative analyses of the number of pavement cells and stomata in WT and <em>sr45-1</em>. Each bar is the average±SEM of cells counted in at least three 160 mm<sup>2</sup> areas in three different leaves. The <em>p</em>-values of the <em>t</em>-test statistics of pavement cell and stomata were 0.55 (non-significant) and 0.03 (significant, indicated by ‘*’), respectively. (F) Box plots of the distribution of cell sizes in WT and <em>sr45-1</em> pavement cells. Each box plot was made from the cell sizes of WT (<em>n</em> = 112) and <em>sr45-1</em> (<em>n</em> = 128) from at least three different leaves. Boxes indicate the interquartile range between the 1st and 3rd quartile, whereas line in the middle of the box represents median. Ends of the vertical lines indicate the range of the data.</p>
