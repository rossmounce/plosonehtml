                Figure 8.  Full-length GFP-tagged SR45 rescued the mutant phenotypes of sr45-1 plants.(A) Growth of WT, sr45-1 and GFP-SR45/sr45-1 plants. The narrow-leaf and stunted growth phenotype of sr45-1 was rescued by expression of GFP-SR45 in sr45-1 plants. Inset in the lower right corner shows a root epidermal nucleus of a GFP-SR45/sr45-1 displaying the characteristic speckled distribution of GFP-SR45. (B) Petal shape phenotype of WT, sr45-1 and GFP-SR45/sr45-1. The p-values of t-test statistics are as follows: WT vs sr45-1, p = 0.000012 (significant); WT vs GFPSR45/sr45-1, p = 0.32 (non-significant). Significant difference is indicated by ‘*’. (C) Quantification of flowering time. Transition to reproductive stage was measured as days to bolting and number of rosette leaves at the appearance of 1st flower. Each bar is the mean±SEM of 10 to 22 plants. Bars with same letter and the same color indicate non-significant difference (p&gt;0.05). (D) Expression pattern of alternatively spliced transcripts of SR genes in WT, sr45-1 and GFP-SR45/sr45-1 plants. Expression pattern of three independent GFP-SR45/sr45-1 lines is shown. In all transgenic lines the splicing patterns of pre-mRNAs encoding SR proteins is restored to wild-type. Similar results were obtained in two independent RT-PCR analyses. For details on RT-PCR and primer sets used see Figure 3. Cyclophilin amplification was used to demonstrate equal amount of template in each PCR.
