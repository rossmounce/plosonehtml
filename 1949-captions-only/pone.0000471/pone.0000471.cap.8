The narrow-leaf and stunted growth phenotype of <em>sr45-1</em> was rescued by expression of <em>GFP-SR45</em> in <em>sr45-1</em> plants. Inset in the lower right corner shows a root epidermal nucleus of a <em>GFP-SR45</em>/<em>sr45-1</em> displaying the characteristic speckled distribution of GFP-SR45. (B) Petal shape phenotype of WT, <em>sr45-1</em> and <em>GFP-SR45</em>/<em>sr45-1</em>. The <em>p</em>-values of <em>t</em>-test statistics are as follows: WT vs <em>sr45-1</em>, <em>p</em> = 0.000012 (significant); WT vs <em>GFPSR45/sr45-1</em>, <em>p</em> = 0.32 (non-significant). Significant difference is indicated by ‘*’. (C) Quantification of flowering time. Transition to reproductive stage was measured as days to bolting and number of rosette leaves at the appearance of 1<sup>st</sup> flower. Each bar is the mean±SEM of 10 to 22 plants. Bars with same letter and the same color indicate non-significant difference (<em>p</em>&gt;0.05). (D) Expression pattern of alternatively spliced transcripts of <em>SR</em> genes in WT, <em>sr45-1</em> and <em>GFP-SR45</em>/<em>sr45-1</em> plants. Expression pattern of three independent <em>GFP-SR45</em>/<em>sr45-1</em> lines is shown. In all transgenic lines the splicing patterns of pre-mRNAs encoding SR proteins is restored to wild-type. Similar results were obtained in two independent RT-PCR analyses. For details on RT-PCR and primer sets used see <a href="#pone-0000471-g003">Figure 3</a>. Cyclophilin amplification was used to demonstrate equal amount of template in each PCR.</p>
