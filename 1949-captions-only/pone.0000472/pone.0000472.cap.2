The arrowheads indicate the positions of the observed cleavage sites within the guide and target sequences. (C) and (D) illustrate the gel shift assay used to monitor the interaction of EL18-15 and EL9-11 with the target sequence (TL). The reaction products were loaded on a 12% non-denaturing PAGE. The complex formation was quantified using the Instant Imager and the average percent shift (%) obtained from two independent experiments is indicated below each gel. The complexes are indicated on the right. RNA cleavage was assayed using EL18-15 (E) or EL9-11 (F). The RNA was incubated with different ratios of 5â€²-end labeled target (TL) and two different Rnt1p concentrations (20 and 80 nM) for 20 minutes. The cleavage products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE and the bands were quantified using Instant Imager. Average percent (%) cleavage of three independent experiments is indicated below each gel. The RNA marker is displayed on the left. The positions of the substrate (S) and product (P) are showed on the right.</p>
