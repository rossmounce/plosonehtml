                Figure 2.  FACS analysis of the expression of HSP60 at the cell surface membrane.(A) Positive control: HUVECs stressed with glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes; (B) HUVECs treated with anti-UL122 antibodies for 9 hours; (C) HUVECs treated with anti-US 28 antibodies for 9 hours. HUVEC cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody directed against HSP60. Percentage of positive cells: (A) 44,2%; (B) 1,3%; (C): 6,7%.
