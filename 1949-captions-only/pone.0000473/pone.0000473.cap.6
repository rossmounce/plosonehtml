CCL2, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and CXCL2 transcripts were increased by 2,46-, 5,95-, 3,76-, and 4,21-fold, respectively, compared with control endothelial cells. (B) Genes selected for validation by Q-PCR in endothelial cells treated with anti-UL122 antibodies. CCL2, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 transcripts were increased 19-, 31,15-, 18,8-, and 12,7-fold compared to control endothelial cells. The level of transcript expression is reported on the vertical axis. <em>GAPDH</em> was selected as endogenous gene.</p>
