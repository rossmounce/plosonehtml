                Figure 7.  Soluble mediators released in cell culture supernatants.(A, B) Quantification of CCL2 released in the supernatant (SN) of HUVECs stimulated with antibodies (Abs) against the irrelevant peptide and with anti-UL122 and anti-US28 affinity purified antibodies. (C, D) Quantification of soluble E-selectin in the SN of HUVECs stimulated with abs against the irrelevant peptide and with antiâ€“UL122 and anti-US28 affinity purified antibodies. Results are expressed in pg/mL and ng/mL, respectively. Results are expressed as mean of three independent experiments.
