                Figure 1.  Development of a polyclonal antibody against human ClC-6 (hClC-6).Multiple sequence alignment (ClustalW) of all human CLC proteins revealed a COOH-terminal region that is unique for ClC-6 (aa 639–740). This region interrupts the first cystathionine-β synthase (CBS) domain in the COOH-terminal cytosolic tail [52]. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against an epitope (aa 672–686; red box) in this unique region.
