Incubation with the affinity-purified polyclonal α-hClC-6 resulted in a band of approximately 100 kDa in transfected COS-1 cells, but not in wild type COS-1 cells. Such a band was not observed in transfected COS-1 cells when the blot was incubated with pre-immune serum or when the polyclonal α-hClC-6 was preincubated with the epitope-peptide before applying to the blot. (B) Immunofluorescence of COS-1 cells transfected with the bicistronic vector pcINeo/GFP-IRES/hClC-6a which ensures strict coupling between GFP expression (green signal in panels a and c) and ClC-6 expression. Incubation with pre-immune serum (panel b) never generated a positive signal in transfected cells. In contrast, a positive signal for ClC-6 (red in panel d) was exclusively observed in transfected cells incubated with polyclonal α-hClC-6. Nuclei were counterstained with blue TO-PRO®-3. The scale bar corresponds to 10 µm. (C) Western blot of microsomal membrane fractions from transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing either hClC-6 or GFP-hClC-7. Incubation with α-hClC-6 generated a positive signal in the hClC-6 expressing membrane fractions, but not in the hClC-7 expressing membranes. Expression of GFP-hClC-7 was confirmed by incubation with a monoclonal α-GFP antibody.</p>
