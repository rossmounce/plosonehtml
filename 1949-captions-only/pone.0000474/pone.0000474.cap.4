Markers for different endosomal compartments (middle column) were (A) mouse anti-EEA-1 (an early endosome marker); (B) mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR, an early/recycling endosome marker); (C) mouse anti-LAMP-1 (a late endosomal/lysosomal marker). The marker antibodies were visualized by anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red signal). In the merged pictures (right column) colocalization is indicated by a yellow signal. The scale bars represent 10 µm.</p>
