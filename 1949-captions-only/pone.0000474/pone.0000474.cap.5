                Figure 5.  Immunolocalization of hClC-6 in transfected COS-1 cells.Double immunofluorescence confocal images of COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1(−)/hClC-6a. hClC-6 expression (left column) was detected using the polyclonal α-hClC-6 antibody and visualized with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green signal). Organelles were stained with the following antibodies or markers (middle column): (A) mouse anti-BIP (an endoplasmic reticulum marker); (B) mouse anti-Golgin-97 (a Golgi marker); (C) mouse anti-LAMP-1 (a late endosomal/lysosomal marker); (D) mouse anti-EEA-1 (an early endosome marker); (E) mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR, an early/recycling endosome marker). The marker antibodies were visualized by anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red signal). The column on the right shows merged pictures of ClC-6 expression and marker staining with yellow indicating colocalization. The scale bars represent 10 µm.
