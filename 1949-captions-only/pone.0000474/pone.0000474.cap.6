                Figure 6.  Colocalization of overexpressed hClC-6 with different endosomal Rab-proteins.Confocal images of double transiently transfected HeLa cells, expressing hClC-6 and (A) GFP-Rab4, (B) GFP-Rab5, (C) GFP-Rab7, (D) GFP-Rab11. hClC-6 was detected with the polyclonal α-hClC-6 antibody and visualized with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594. The Rab signals were visualized by the GFP signal. (E) Represents a confocal image of double transiently transfected COS-1 cells, expressing the glycosylation-deficient AAA-hClC-6 (red signal) and GFP-Rab4 (green signal). The scale bars represent 10 µm.
