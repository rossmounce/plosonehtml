Upward flotation of the DRM's was checked by distribution of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) which migrated to the top of the gradient (fractions 2/3/4). Transferrin receptor (TfR), a non-raft membrane protein, was used as a negative control (fractions 8/9 at the bottom of the gradient). hClC-6 expression was checked by staining with the polyclonal α-hClC-6. (B) Confocal images of double transiently transfected COS-1 cells, expressing GFP-hClC-7 and wild type hClC-6 (panels a to c) or KKGRR/AAGAA-hClC-6 (panels d to f). Wild type and KKGRR/AAGAA-hClC-6 were detected with the polyclonal α-hClC-6 antibody and visualized with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red signal, panels a and d). ClC-7 expression is visualized by the GFP signal (green signal, panels b and e). A yellow signal indicates colocalization (panels c and f). Scale bars represent 10 µm.</p>
