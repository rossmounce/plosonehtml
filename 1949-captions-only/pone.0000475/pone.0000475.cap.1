                Figure 1.  Immunoreactivity for IGF-1 in the developing visual cortex: effects of EE.(A) Typical appearance of IGF-1 positive cells in the developing rat binocular visual cortex Oc1B. Age of the animal, P25, calibration bar 25 µm. (B) Example showing the preponderance of the neuronal phenotype in IGF-1 positive cells in the developing rat binocular visual cortex Oc1B. Age of the animal P18. Staining for IGF-1 green, staining for NeuN (neuronal marker) red, merged image. Calibration bar: 50 µm. (C) Mean number of IGF-1 positive cells in the visual cortex, normalized to the number of neurons (Neu N positive cells) for each developmental age analysed. Black dots are data from EE rats and light grey dots data from non-EE rats. Vertical bars represent SEM. The number of animals analyzed is: for non-EE rats, N = 5 at P15, N = 8 at P18, N = 6 at P21, N = 6 at P25; for EE rats, N = 6 at P15, N = 10 at P18, N = 6 at P21, N = 7 at P25. The normalized number of IGF-1 positive cells increases between P15 and P21 in non-EE rats (Two Way ANOVA, housing (two levels)×age (four levels), factor age significant, p&lt;0,001; post-hoc Tukey's test, p&lt;0,05). In EE rats the normalized number of IGF-1 positive cells increases significantly between P15 and P18; the normalized number at P18 in EE rats is significantly increased with respect to non-EE rats (Two Way ANOVA, housing (two levels)×age (four levels), factor age significant, p&lt;0,001, interaction housing×age significant, p = 0,011; post-hoc Tukey's test, p&lt;0,05). (D) Example of IGF-1 labelling from fields taken in the layers II/III of the rat visual cortex of one P18 EE and one P18 non-EE rat. It is evident the increase in IGF-1 positive cells caused by EE. Calibration bar: 50 µm.
