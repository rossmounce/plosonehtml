                Figure 2.  IGF-1 administration in the visual cortex accelerates visual acuity development.(A) Experimental protocol. (B) Left, schematic representation of minipump implant and recording site for Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs). Right, representative waveform of VEP recorded from Oc1B in response to visual stimulation with gratings sinusoidally modulated in contrast at 1Hz. (C) Example of visual acuity estimate in one IGF-1 (red) and one vehicle (light blue) treated animal. Experimental points are VEP amplitudes normalized to the mean amplitude of VEP at 0,2 c/deg; thick lines are linear fits to the data. Estimated visual acuities (arrows) are taken as the extrapolation to 0 level of the fitting line. Waveforms above the graph are the VEP recordings obtained at 0,2 and 0,5 c/deg for the IGF-1 (red) and the vehicle (PBS) treated animal (light blue). It is evident that at the higher spatial frequency response is obtained only in the IGF-1 treated rat. (D) Summary of visual acuity in all groups. Data are mean visual acuity and vertical bars represent SEM. Visual acuity of non-EE IGF-1 treated animals (IGF-1, 0,9±0,08 c/deg, N = 5) is significantly higher than in non-EE vehicle treated animals (PBS, 0,67±0,03 c/deg, N = 6) or in non-EE untreated animals (non-EE 0,63±0,01 c/deg, N = 7); the latter two do not differ (One Way ANOVA, p&lt;0,001; post-hoc Tukey's test, significance level 0,05). The visual acuity in non-EE IGF-1 treated rats do not differ from that in P25 EE rats (EE, 0,93±0,03, N = 4) (One Way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey's test p&gt;0,05). Asterisks denote significant difference (two asterisks, p&lt;0,01, three asterisks p&lt;0,001).
