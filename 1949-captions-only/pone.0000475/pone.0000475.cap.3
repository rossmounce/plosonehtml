                Figure 3.  IGF-1 blockade prevents the acceleration of visual acuity development in enriched animals.(A) Experimental protocol and schematic representation of minipump implant and recording site for VEPs. (B) Example of visual acuity estimated in one JB1 treated EE rat (EE-JB1, blue) and one vehicle treated EE animal (EE-PBS, green). Experimental points are normalized VEP amplitudes; thick lines are linear fits to the data. Estimated visual acuities are indicated by arrows. Waveforms above the graph are VEPs recorded in response to visual stimulation with gratings of spatial frequencies 0,2 and 0,5 c/deg for the JB1 treated (blue) and the vehicle treated EE animal (green). It is evident that at the higher spatial frequency a response is obtained only in the vehicle treated EE rat. (C) Summary of mean visual acuity in all JB1 (0,55±0,05 c/deg, N = 5) and PBS treated (0,81±0,07 c/deg, N = 4) P25 EE animals; data for P25 EE and non-EE rats are replotted from Fig. 2 for comparison. Vertical bars represent SEM. Visual acuity of JB1 treated EE animals is significantly lower than in EE animals either treated with vehicle or untreated and does not differ from the visual acuity of P25 non-EE rats (One Way ANOVA, p&lt;0,001; post-hoc Tukey's test, significance level 0,05). Asterisks denote significant difference (one asterisk, p&lt;0,05; two asterisks, p&lt;0,01; three asterisks, p&lt;0,001).
