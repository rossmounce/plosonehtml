The lanes with poly(A)<sup>+</sup> and poly(A)<sup>âˆ’</sup> RNA samples, isolated from <em>Drosophila</em> embryos (E), larvae (L), pupae (P) and imago (I) are shown. Positions of the RNA markers in nt are shown on the right. The band of around 300 nt in length is shown on the left. Quantitation of the RNA content by hybridization with an rp49-specific probe is shown at the bottom.</p>
