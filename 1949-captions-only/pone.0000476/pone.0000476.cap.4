                Figure 4.  Expression patterns of suffix and F elements in Drosophila testis.In situ hybridizations with DIG-labeled, strand-specific RNA probes were performed (Materials Methods). (A, B) The patterns revealed by suffix sense and antisense probes, respectively. (C, D) The patterns revealed by F element sense and antisense probes, respectively. Arrows indicate the transcripts detected in primary spermatocytes.
