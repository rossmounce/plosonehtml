                Figure 5.  Expression patterns of suffix and F elements in Drosophila menalogaster ovaries.In situ hybridizations with DIG-labeled, strand-specific RNA probes were performed (Materials Methods). (A, B) The patterns revealed by suffix sense and antisense probes, respectively. (C, D) The patterns revealed by F element sense and antisense probes, respectively. Black arrows indicate the transcripts detected in the cytoplasm of nurse cells. White arrows denote F element transcripts in follicle cells.
