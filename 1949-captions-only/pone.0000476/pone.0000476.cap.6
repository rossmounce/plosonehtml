                Figure 6.  Analysis of suffix-specific small RNAs by Northern blot analysis or SI nuclease protection assay.Numbers indicate the lengths of the RNA molecules in nt. M indicates RNA markers, containing a mixture of intact 25 and 14 nt RNAs and a fragmented 25 nt or 86 nt RNAs (see Materials and Methods). (A) Blots containing fractionated total RNA samples isolated from embryos (E), larvae (L), pupae (P) and imago (I), were probed by suffix-specific antisense [32P]-labeled RNA probes (see Figure 1). The same results were obtained with an identical blot after hybridization with a suffix-specific sense [32P]-labeled RNA probe (not shown). The total Drosophila RNA content on lanes is validated by hybridization with a 123 nt 5.8S RNA-specific probe (see Materials and Methods). (B) SI nuclease protection assay of total Drosophila RNA isolated from dcr2/dcr2 ovaries (Materials and Methods). [32P]-labeled 86 nt antisense RNA probe corresponding to 5′ region of the suffix was hybridized overnight with 5 µg of total RNA (1) or with 5 µg of yeast tRNA (3). After SI nuclease digestion at 20°C the probes were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 2–result obtained with 5 µg of total Drosophila RNA without hybridization (overnight incubation at 0°C). M–RNA marker. (C) SI nuclease protection assay of total Drosophila RNA isolated from the wild type ovaries. Indications are the same as in (B). Regions corresponding to siRNAs and piRNAs are shown in brackets.
