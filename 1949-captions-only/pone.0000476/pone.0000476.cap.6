M indicates RNA markers, containing a mixture of intact 25 and 14 nt RNAs and a fragmented 25 nt or 86 nt RNAs (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). (A) Blots containing fractionated total RNA samples isolated from embryos (E), larvae (L), pupae (P) and imago (I), were probed by <em>suffix</em>-specific antisense [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RNA probes (see <a href="#pone-0000476-g001"><span class="underline">Figure 1</span></a>). The same results were obtained with an identical blot after hybridization with a <em>suffix</em>-specific sense [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RNA probe (not shown). The total <em>Drosophila</em> RNA content on lanes is validated by hybridization with a 123 nt 5.8S RNA-specific probe (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). (B) SI nuclease protection assay of total <em>Drosophila</em> RNA isolated from <em>dcr<sup>2</sup>/dcr<sup>2</sup></em> ovaries (<a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled 86 nt antisense RNA probe corresponding to 5′ region of the <em>suffix</em> was hybridized overnight with 5 µg of total RNA (1) or with 5 µg of yeast tRNA (3). After SI nuclease digestion at 20°C the probes were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 2–result obtained with 5 µg of total <em>Drosophila</em> RNA without hybridization (overnight incubation at 0°C). M–RNA marker. (C) SI nuclease protection assay of total <em>Drosophila</em> RNA isolated from the wild type ovaries. Indications are the same as in (B). Regions corresponding to siRNAs and piRNAs are shown in brackets.</p>
