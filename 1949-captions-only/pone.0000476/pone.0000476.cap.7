After the addition of a poly(A) tail to the poly(A)<sup>−</sup>RNA preparations isolated from pupae or ovaries, the samples were used for reverse transcription with a poly(T) primer and subsequent PCR using poly(T)-and F element-specific primers. (B) The number of clones identified by hybridization with <em>suffix</em>-specific or F-element-specific probes in colony-hybridization experiments. Five clones from pupae (3, 5, 16, 28 and 38) showed hybridization with the F-element probe only were selected for sequencing. Similarly, two clones (15 and 55) were isolated from the wild type ovaries. (C) The sequences of the cDNA clones isolated from pupae or ovaries that were truncated by RNA silencing mechanisms at the very beginning of the <em>suffix</em> sequence (shown in bold) are presented (clones 38 and 28 are identical by sequence to clones 5 and 16, respectively). (D) Diagram showing the positions of the cut sites at the very beginning of the <em>suffix</em> sequence in the cDNA clones corresponding to F element transcripts, indicated by arrows.</p>
