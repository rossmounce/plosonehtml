                Figure 8.  Hypothetical model for the concerted regulation of genes containing a SINE in their 5′ or 3′ non coding regions.Symmetrical transcription of a SINE sequence, co-transcribed as part of a number of larger RNA molecules, leads to the formation of dsRNA and thus to RNAi. As a result, SINE-specific siRNA molecules target the SINE-containing mRNAs, leading to the cleavage of the 5′ or 3′ non coding stretches that are important for gene expression and thus result in the concerted silencing of the SINE-containing genes.
