Schematic structure of the Pf332 gene. The gene is composed of a 5′ exon I (PF11_0506) with a size of 1704 bp and a 3′ exon II (PF11_0507), separated by a short intron of 236 bp. The 3′-exon II is the gene fragment previously referred to as the gene coding for the antigen Pf332. The location of the primers is indicated as arrows. B. PCR amplification from cDNA and gDNA across the intron region of the Pf332 gene: Lane 1: PCR amplification with primers UP3 and UP4 from cDNA; lane 2: PCR amplification with the same primer pair from gDNA. C. Northernblot with probes located at 5′-end (UP1–UP2) and across the splicing site (UP3–UP4) of the Pf332 gene. Total RNA from 3D7AH1 iRBC was resolved in an agarose gel (lanes 1 and 3). Lane 2 shows the hybridisation with the first probe (UP1–UP2); lane 4 shows the hybridisation with the second probe (UP3–UP4) revealing a band of the same size as seen in the first hybridization.</p>
