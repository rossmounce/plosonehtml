                Figure 2.  Schematic illustration of the conserved structure of the erythrocyte-binding region of Pf332 and the EBL family.The N-terminal region of the Pf332 encoded by exon I contains a Duffy-binding like domain homologous to the DBL-domain of the EBL-family. This domain of Pf332 is located closer to the N-terminal part of the molecule and lacks a signal leading sequence as compared to the other EBL family members. It aligns with the F2 region of EBA-175 of P. falciparum and the DBP of P. vivax. In addition, the carboxyl cysteine (c-cys)-rich domain present upstream of the transmembrane domain in EBA-175 and DBP is not found in Pf332.
