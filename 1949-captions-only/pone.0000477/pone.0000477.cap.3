Normalized Pf332 levels at different times p.i. are plotted for 3D7AH1 (•), FCR3S1.2 (○) and 7G8 (▾). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the quotient and * denotes significantly higher levels of transcription in FCR3S1.2 (p&lt;0.001, One Way ANOVA with Tukey test). The amount of Pf332 mRNA transcripts in FCR3S1.2 is around two fold higher than in 3D7AH1 and 7G8 at the time of maximal transcription. B: Upper panel: Immunofluorescence staining with α-DBL/nDBL-domain antibodies of Pf332. α-DBL/nDBL-domain antibodies (green) visualize at early trophzoite stage (around 20 h p.i.) vesicles that carry Pf332 in the cytosol of the iRBC; when the iRBC reaches late trophozoite/schizont stage (40–47 h p.i.), Pf332 can be observed in association with the iRBC membrane. Lower panel: Additional staining with the α-Pf332 monoclonal antibody m33G2. Staining with previously raised sera against the Pf332 (m33G2, red) show that α-DBL/nDBL-domain antibodies (green) co-localize with sera raised against the polypeptide encoded by exon II of Pf332. Staining is shown for the parasite strain 7G8, DNA staining with Hoechst (blue); Scale bars = 1 µm. C: Immunoblot analysis confirmed that antibodies raised against the DBL/nDBL-domain of Pf332 reacted with the same high molecular weight polypeptide as the previously raised antibodies α-EB200 and m33G2 (compare <a href="#pone.0000477.s003">Fig. S3</a>). This verifies that the sequence of the Pf332-DBL/nDBL-domain is an additional exon of the same open reading frame as the previously described Pf332. The total amount of expressed Pf332 varies in between parasites, with FCR3S1.2 iRBC expressing the highest amount of Pf332. An α-glycophorin antibody was used compare the amount of loaded material in the different lanes. The bands corresponding to Pf332 are marked with an asterix.</p>
