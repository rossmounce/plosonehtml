                Figure 6.  Antibodies directed against the DBL-domain of Pf332 inhibit parasite invasion.RBC infected with the parasite clones/strains FCR3S1.2, 3D7AH1 and 7G8 were cultivated in the presence of α-Pf332-DBL/nDBL-antibodies for 24 h allowing reinvasion of the parasites into new RBC. The parasitemia was analysed by flow-cytometry and compared to a control cultivated in the presence of a serum raised against a non-related protein. Parasites displayed a decreased invasion rate in the presence of α-Pf332-DBL/nDBL-antibodies. The effect of α-Pf332-DBL/nDBL-antibodies (light bars) is slightly lower as compared to inhibition caused by antibodies against a hybrid protein of AMA1 and MSP1 (dark bars). Bars represent the mean of three experiments; error bars indicate the standard deviation.
