                Figure 1.  dmMis12, dmNuf2 and dmNdc80 localize to Drosophila kinetochores.Localization of dmMis12 (A), dmNuf2 (B) and dmNdc80 (C) fusions with EGFP protein in stably transfected D-mel cells. Examples of mitotic (indicated by arrows) and interphase cells are shown. Single-color images show GFP fluorescence. Cells are co-stained with anti-α-tubulin (MT) or anti-CID/CENP-A (CID) antibodies and counter-stained with DAPI (DNA) in merged images. Bar represents 5 µm.
