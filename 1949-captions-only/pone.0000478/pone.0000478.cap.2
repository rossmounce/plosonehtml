                Figure 2.  Mass spectrometry identifies proteins from kinetochore complexes.(A) Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel showing resolved proteins from purifications of two bait proteins: Protein A::dmNdc80 and dmNnf1R-2::protein A. For clarity, only several bands identified by MS are labelled. Red arrows indicate bait proteins. Bands labelled with asterisks contained large amount of α- and β-tubulin. (B) Schematic of protein-protein interactions identified in our affinity purification by MS analyses. Components of the NDC80 complex (green text), MIND/MIS12 complex (blue text) and Spc105 (red text) are indicated and bait proteins are shown in boxes. Note that lines indicate associations that may be either direct or indirect.
