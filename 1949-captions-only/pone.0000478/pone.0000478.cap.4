                Figure 4.  Localization of new components of Drosophila kinetochores in mitotic and interphase cells.Localization of dmSpc25R/Mitch (A), dmNnf1R-1 (B), dmNnf1R-2 (C) and dmNsl1R (D) EGFP fusions expressed in stable D-mel cell lines. EGFP fusions with dmNnf1R-2 and dmNsl1R show localization to centromeres/kinetochores in interphase and mitosis, whereas dmSpc15R/Mitch and dmNnf1R-1 are present on kinetochores only during mitosis. Single colour images demonstrate localization of EGFP fusions. Merged images show DNA (blue), α-tubulin, CENP-C or CID/CENP-A (red) and EGFP fusions (green). Arrows indicate mitotic cells. Bar represents 5 µm.
