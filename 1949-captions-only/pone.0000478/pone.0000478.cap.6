                Figure 6.  Dependency relationships between dmNnf1R-1 and other centromere and kinetochore proteins.Example of the experimental approach used to establish dependencies between Drosophila centromere/kinetochore components: cells stably expressing dmNnf1R-1::EGFP fusion were treated with dsRNAs targeting other kinetochore components as indicated. Cells were stained with anti-α-tubulin antibody (first column) and counter-stained with DAPI (second column). DEP indicates “dependency” and IND indicates “independency” for kinetochore binding by dmNnf1R-1::EGFP. This approach allowed to establish recruitment dependencies for all other centromeric and kinetochore proteins analyzed in this study. Bar represents 5 µm.
