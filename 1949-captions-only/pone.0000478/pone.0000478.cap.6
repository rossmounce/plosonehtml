Cells were stained with anti-α-tubulin antibody (first column) and counter-stained with DAPI (second column). DEP indicates “dependency” and IND indicates “independency” for kinetochore binding by dmNnf1R-1::EGFP. This approach allowed to establish recruitment dependencies for all other centromeric and kinetochore proteins analyzed in this study. Bar represents 5 µm.</p>
