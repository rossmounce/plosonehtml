                Figure 7.  Dependency relationships between newly described Drosophila kinetochore proteins for their recruitment to kinetochores.(A) Summary of recruitment dependencies generated from the series of experiments exemplified in Figure 6. DEP = dependent; IND = independent; nd â€“ not determined (experiment not performed). 1) dmNnf1R-1 and dmNnf1R-2 localize to kinetochores independently of each other. 2) In those cases we were unable to determine the dependency. 3) Foci of GFP::dmNdc80 present on kinetochores, but with much lower intensity than in control (partial dependency). 4) No signal of dmNnf1R-2 in mitotic cells, but foci still present in interphase. Dependencies of some MIND/MIS12 complex components on dmSpc105R for their recruitment to kinetochore indicate that the assembly of MIND/MIS12 and dmSpc105R are interdependent. NDC80 complex depends on both of them for its proper localization in mitosis. Colours indicate the kinetochore complexes that a particular protein belongs to (see B). (B) Schematic representation of kinetochore assembly in Drosophila melanogaster.
