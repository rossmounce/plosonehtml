DEP = dependent; IND = independent; nd â€“ not determined (experiment not performed). <sup>1)</sup> dmNnf1R-1 and dmNnf1R-2 localize to kinetochores independently of each other. <sup>2)</sup> In those cases we were unable to determine the dependency. <sup>3)</sup> Foci of GFP::dmNdc80 present on kinetochores, but with much lower intensity than in control (partial dependency). <sup>4)</sup> No signal of dmNnf1R-2 in mitotic cells, but foci still present in interphase. Dependencies of some MIND/MIS12 complex components on dmSpc105R for their recruitment to kinetochore indicate that the assembly of MIND/MIS12 and dmSpc105R are interdependent. NDC80 complex depends on both of them for its proper localization in mitosis. Colours indicate the kinetochore complexes that a particular protein belongs to (see B).
