                Figure 1.  The bicontinuous gyroid (A), diamond (B) and primitive (C) cubic phases are shown.The bilayer mid-planes are displayed in blue and the corresponding skeletal graphs are presented on top. In parts (D) and (E), the proposed molecular models of peptide surfactant nanostructures in water are illustrated [66], [68], [70]: a peptide nanotube, and a peptide nanovesicle are presented, respectively. The average diameters of these self-assembled structures are about 300–500 Å. Color code: green for the hydrophobic tails; and blue for the charged headgroups.
