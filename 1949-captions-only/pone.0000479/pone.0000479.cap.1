In parts (D) and (E), the proposed molecular models of peptide surfactant nanostructures in water are illustrated <a href="#pone.0000479-Vauthey1">[66]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000479-vonMaltzahn1">[68]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000479-Zhao1">[70]</a>: a peptide nanotube, and a peptide nanovesicle are presented, respectively. The average diameters of these self-assembled structures are about 300–500 Å. Color code: green for the hydrophobic tails; and blue for the charged headgroups.
