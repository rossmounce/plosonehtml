                Figure 2.  From top to bottom: the molecular models of the peptide surfactants A6D, A6K, DA6, and KA6.Aspartic acid (D) bears two negative charges, and lysine (K) bears one positive charge. Alanine (A) constitutes the hydrophobic tails. The peptides A6D and A6K were synthesized with the head group at the C-terminus. In the opposite arrangement, the peptides DA6 and KA6 were synthesized with the head group at the N-terminus. All used peptides are similar to biological phospholipids: each peptide is 25 Ã… in length. The color scheme as follows: carbon, cyan; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; and hydrogen, white.
