Alanine (A) constitutes the hydrophobic tails. The peptides A<sub>6</sub>D and A<sub>6</sub>K were synthesized with the head group at the C-terminus. In the opposite arrangement, the peptides DA<sub>6</sub> and KA<sub>6</sub> were synthesized with the head group at the N-terminus. All used peptides are similar to biological phospholipids: each peptide is 25 Ã… in length. The color scheme as follows: carbon, cyan; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; and hydrogen, white.</p>
