                Figure 3.  Impact of the anionic peptide A6D (A) and the cationic peptide A6K (B) on the MO-based fully hydrated Pn3m phase at 25°C.The experiments were carried out within a certain range of peptide concentrations (R≤0.2). The samples were formed in excess water at pH = 7.4 and contain a total amount of 18 wt% lipid (MO plus peptide). For better visibility the intensities are shifted by arbitrary constants.
