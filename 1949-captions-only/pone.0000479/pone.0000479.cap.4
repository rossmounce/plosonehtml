                Figure 4.  A schematic description of the influence of loading short designer peptide surfactants (cationic and anionic molecules) onto the fully hydrated Pn3m phase.(A) At low peptide content the Pn3m phase with its two interwoven water networks (marked by full and dashed circles) is preserved, (B) at high peptide content the H2 phase is induced and (C) for comparison the H2 phase is also depicted for the unloaded MO/water system. (The figure in panel A has been adapted with permission from the [ref. 34].)
