                Figure 6.  Phase diagrams of MO-based systems with differing A6D (A) and KA6 content (B), respectively.The structural investigations were carried out for R values in the range of 0–0.2. The Pn3m phase regions in these diagrams have been highlighted in light grey and approximate phase boundaries are depicted. The lattice parameter values, a, for some of the Pn3m (•) and H2 (O) phases are given in Ångstrøms.
