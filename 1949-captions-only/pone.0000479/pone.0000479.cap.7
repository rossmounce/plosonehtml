                Figure 7. (A) Variation of the unit cell parameter, a, during heating for the fully hydrated Pn3m phase of the binary MO/water mixture [26] (+), and for the peptide-loaded ternary systems at R = 0.01: MO/A6D/water (□), and MO/KA6/water (▪). (B) Variation of a(T) for the H2 phase of the binary MO/water mixture (+) [26], and for the peptide-loaded ternary systems at R = 0.1: MO/A6D/water (O), and MO/KA6/water (•).
