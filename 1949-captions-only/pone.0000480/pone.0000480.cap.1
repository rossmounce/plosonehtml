Panel A shows the location of the 17q11.2 region on Chromosome 17. Panel B maps the position of four known genes (blue rectangles) in the region around D17S798, where a horizontal line represents DNA sequence, and a pink bar marks the location of microsatellites D17S798 and D17S1800. The diagram conveys the fact that TMEM98 and SPACA3 (represented above the horizontal line) lie on the forward helix, whereas Myo1D and ACCN1 (represented below the horizontal line) lie on the reverse helix. Panel C zooms on gene ACCN1, showing the locations of the genotyped markers relative to D17S798, in Kb. In this latter panel, the horizontal line represents genomic DNA, the pink dots represent the SNPs we have genotyped, the pink vertical bar represents microsatellite D17S1850, the blue bars represent ACCN1 exons and the wavy solid line between exons corresponds to the ACCN1 introns. The ACCN1 gene is located on the reverse strand, so the portion of ACCN1 near D17S798, where SNP rs28936 and SNP rs28933 are located, is the 3′ UTR-exon10 region of the gene. The width of the introns and exons in panel C is proportional to the actual length, with the exception of the first three very long introns (right portion of the panel) which have been shortened. Gaps are represented by diagonal bars: three bars (intron1-2) = 1,043,911 base pairs; two bars (intron 3–4) = 60,470 base pairs; one bar (intron 2–3) = 22,926 base pairs</p>
