                Figure 2.  Distributions of oxygen saturation at rest at baseline and after 6 months follow-up.Box-and-whisker plots show the distributions for “rapid” progressors (red) and “slow” progressors (blue). Boxes indicating the middle 50% of data points extend from the first (25%) quartile to the third (75%) quartile. The height of each box is the interquartile range (IQR). The second (50%) quartile, or median, is indicated by a line within each box. Whiskers extend out to the smallest and largest data points within 1.5 IQRs of the first and third quartiles, respectively. Observations beyond the whiskers are potential outliers, indicated here by only two dashed lines, among slow progressors at baseline.
