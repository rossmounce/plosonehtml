                Figure 3.  Gene expression patterns that distinguish “rapid” progressors from “slow” progressors.(A) Infogram of 437 differentially expressed genes in individual rapid and slow progressor patients. The expression levels for each gene were normalized to the geometric mean of all the samples for each gene. Increased genes are shown in progressively brighter shades of yellow, and decreased genes are shown in progressively darker shades of blue. Genes shown in gray are not different between the groups. The genes were ranked according to their significance level. (B) A log scale scatter plot of the average of intensity of all the genes on the arrays in rapid progressors (X-axis) and slow progressors (Y-axis). Colored points-437 genes that were significantly changed (p-value &lt;0.05 in TNoM and t-test and fold ratio &gt;2). Points are colored by their fold ratios; progressive shades of blue indicate increase and progressive shades of red indicate decrease. Points colored in gray did not reach significance. Adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) and prominin-1/CD133 (PROM1) were among the most upregulated genes in the “rapid” progressor group.
