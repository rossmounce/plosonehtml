                Figure 4.  Localization of adenosine A2B receptor in IPF lungs.Immunoreactive protein was revealed with 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole and samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. Panels A and B show two different IPF lungs from rapid progressors exhibiting strong epithelial staining of A2B AR (original magnification, 10 and 40×). Stained fibroblasts are also seen in panel B. Panel C: A2B AR staining in an IPF lung from slow progressor. Panel D: Lung specimen from hypersensitivity pneumonitis displaying positive macrophage staining for A2B AR (10×, inset 40×). Panel E: Control lung (10×). Panel F: Negative control section from IPF lung in which the primary antibody was replaced with non-immune serum (40×).
