Panels A and B show two different IPF lungs from rapid progressors exhibiting strong epithelial staining of A<sub>2B</sub> AR (original magnification, 10 and 40×). Stained fibroblasts are also seen in panel B. Panel C: A<sub>2B</sub> AR staining in an IPF lung from slow progressor. Panel D: Lung specimen from hypersensitivity pneumonitis displaying positive macrophage staining for A<sub>2B</sub> AR (10×, inset 40×). Panel E: Control lung (10×). Panel F: Negative control section from IPF lung in which the primary antibody was replaced with non-immune serum (40×).</p>
