                Figure 7.  Fibroblast migration.Fibroblasts were placed in the upper compartment of a Boyden-type chamber, and F-12 medium containing 5% BSA alone or with 50% BAL fluid was added to the lower compartment. After 8 h of incubation, the migrating cells were stained and the absorbance of the stained solution was measured by ELISA. *p&lt;0.01 versus controls and p&lt;0.05 versus slow progressors.
