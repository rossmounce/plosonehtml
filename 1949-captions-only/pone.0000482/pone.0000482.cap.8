                Figure 8.  Identification of gelatinolytic activities in bronchoalveolar lavage from controls, and rapid and slow progressors IPF patients.Supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels (8.5%) containing gelatin (1 mg/ml) and a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml heparin. Std = MMP-9 and MMP-2 zymography standards. The relative variations of gelatinase levels were analyzed by densitometry. Densitometric analysis of pro-MMP-9 and active MMP-9 is shown in the bottom. *P&lt;0.05.
