                Figure 2.  Contig size distribution for assemblies of D. melanogaster and human chromosomes 1, 11, and 21.Higher 20.0x coverage levels are shown in bold. A point (x, y) on the graph indicates that y% of the genome can be covered by contigs that are at least x bp in size. Each of the human chromosomes show a similar profile, and going from 11.25x to 20.0x shows a roughly 3-fold improvement in N50 contig sizes for all the assemblies.
