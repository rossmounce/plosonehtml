A point (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) on the graph indicates that <em>y</em>% of the genome can be covered by contigs that are at least <em>x</em> bp in size. Each of the human chromosomes show a similar profile, and going from 11.25x to 20.0x shows a roughly 3-fold improvement in N50 contig sizes for all the assemblies.</p>
