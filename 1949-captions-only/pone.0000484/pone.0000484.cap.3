A point (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) on the graph indicates that <em>y</em>% of the genome can be covered by contigs that are at least <em>x</em> bp in size. At 200 bp the contig sizes are reasonably large, while 250 bp shows still a significant increase in quality. Going to 300 bp is only a slight improvement over 250 bp, however.</p>
