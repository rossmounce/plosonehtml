                Figure 3.  Contig size distribution for assemblies of human chromosome 21 for various average read lengths.Results include both 11.25x and 20.0x net coverage levels, with 20.0x shown in bold. A point (x, y) on the graph indicates that y% of the genome can be covered by contigs that are at least x bp in size. At 200 bp the contig sizes are reasonably large, while 250 bp shows still a significant increase in quality. Going to 300 bp is only a slight improvement over 250 bp, however.
