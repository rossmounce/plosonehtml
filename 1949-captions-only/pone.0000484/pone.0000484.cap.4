Each piece is individually cloned and further fragmented into small pieces suitable for sequencing. We then ligate sequencing adapters that include a 5-base tag that is unique to each clone within a 266-clone “batch”. After amplifying the fragments on beads, a batch of 266 clones are multiplexed together on a 400,000 read plate, and the first five bases of each read are used to identify the source clone. By running 750 plates in this fashion, we can fully sequence a mammalian genome to 20.0x coverage.</p>
