(b) <em>Intersection read sets </em><em>I</em><em><sub>i,j</sub></em> and <em>I</em><em><sub>i,k</sub></em> are constructed by finding for C<sub>i</sub> the clones C<sub>j</sub> and C<sub>k</sub> that overlap C<sub>i</sub> minimally to the left and right, and intersecting their respective inferred clone read sets. (c) <em>Difference read sets </em><em>D</em><em>′<sub>i,j</sub></em> and <em>D</em><em>′<sub>i,k</sub></em> are constructed similarly by finding for C<sub>i</sub> the clones C<sub>j</sub> and C<sub>k</sub> that overlap it maximally to the left and right, and subtracting the respective inferred clone read sets. Each read set is assembled independently with the <em>Euler</em> assembler during stage 1.</p>
