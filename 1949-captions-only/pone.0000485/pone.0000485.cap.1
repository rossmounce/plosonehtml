                Figure 1.  Simulation of PC to DCN synaptic conductance.(A) Saturating level of release probability (Rss) taken from Pedroarena and Schwarz (2003) could be modeled with a double exponential function (red line, see Materials and Methods for details). (B) Simulated synaptic conductance profiles in response to 10, 30 and 100 Hz PC firing, respectively. These results should be compared to Figure 7A of Pedroarena and Schwarz (2003).
