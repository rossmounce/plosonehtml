                Figure 2.  Regular patterns in cerebellar Purkinje cell simple spike trains.(A) Raster plot of PC SS in an anesthetized rat (AnR). (B) CV2 distributions of SS trains recorded from anesthetized mice (AnM, left), awake mice (AwM, middle, blue: neurons in cerebral motor cortex), and mean of 92 CV2 distributions (Pooled, right) which were significantly different from those of inhomogeneous Poisson processes with similarly modulated firing rates (p&lt;0.05, χ2 test; *: p&lt;0.001, χ2 goodness of fit residual test; red line: CV2 = 0.2). Insets and right panel: mean±s.e.m. (black: PC, green: inhomogeneous Poisson process) (C) Extracting regular spiking patterns by setting CV2 threshold at 0.2 (white dotted lines). White dashes: CV2 values calculated from the two surrounding ISIs, red: first ISI of regular patterns, pink: successive ISIs in regular patterns, dark blue: ISIs not belonging to a regular pattern).
