(B) CV<sub>2</sub> distributions of SS trains recorded from anesthetized mice (AnM, left), awake mice (AwM, middle, blue: neurons in cerebral motor cortex), and mean of 92 CV<sub>2</sub> distributions (Pooled, right) which were significantly different from those of inhomogeneous Poisson processes with similarly modulated firing rates (p&lt;0.05, χ<sup>2</sup> test; *: p&lt;0.001, χ<sup>2</sup> goodness of fit residual test; red line: CV<sub>2</sub> = 0.2). Insets and right panel: mean±s.e.m. (black: PC, green: inhomogeneous Poisson process) (C) Extracting regular spiking patterns by setting CV<sub>2</sub> threshold at 0.2 (white dotted lines). White dashes: CV<sub>2</sub> values calculated from the two surrounding ISIs, red: first ISI of regular patterns, pink: successive ISIs in regular patterns, dark blue: ISIs not belonging to a regular pattern).</p>
