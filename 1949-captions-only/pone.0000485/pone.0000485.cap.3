                Figure 3.  Effect of CV2 threshold on patterns.(A) Mean (Â± s.e.m.) of normalized number of patterns in spike trains classified with different values of the CV2 threshold, ranging from 0 to 0.5, in 92 PCs (filled circles) and in simulated spike trains from Poisson processes with similar firing rate profiles as in the PCs (open circles). Arrow: maximum number of patterns, *: range where there was no statistical difference (p&gt;0.05). Inset: same distribution but for all possible thresholds. (B) Raster plots with indication of the spike timings belonging to patterns (red dotted lines: start of patterns, red solid lines: following spikes in each pattern) and singles (blue). Black dots: difference in classified patterns when threshold was 0.2 (upper trace) and 0.24 (lower trace).
