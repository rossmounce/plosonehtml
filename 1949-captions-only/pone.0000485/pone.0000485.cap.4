Insets: magnified plot of indicated area (lower) and 90 P (90 percentile, upper) of each population, *: p&lt;0.01, Student t test. (B) The relation between pattern mean ISI and pattern size in AnR (left, cyan), AnM (middle, magenta) and AwM (right, yellow). Insets: maximum pattern mean ISI (90 percentile) of different pattern sizes. *: p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test. (C) Percentage ISIs belonging to patterns (upper, *: p&lt;0.001, Student t test), Average maximum pattern size (middle, *: p&lt;0.001, Student t test), and Pattern size distribution (lower, p&lt;0.05, χ<sup>2</sup> test). Cyan: AnR, magenta: AnM, yellow: AwM.</p>
