                Figure 5.  Simulated synaptic conductance in PC to DCN synapse caused by spontaneous PC spiking.(A) A representative example of the simulated synaptic conductance (Gsyn) induced by PC (black) of AnR (upper panel), AnM (middle panel) and AwM (lower panel), and by corresponding realizations of an inhomogeneous Poisson process (green). Rasters: spikes belonging to patterns (black and green dotted lines: start of patterns, black and green solid lines: following spikes in patterns, blue lines: singles), numbers: number of all spikes in the 500 ms window. (B) Distribution of Gsyn values for PCs (black) compared to Poisson processes (green). Bin = 0.2 nS. Red bar: bins where PCs contained significantly more Gsyn values. p&lt;0.05.
