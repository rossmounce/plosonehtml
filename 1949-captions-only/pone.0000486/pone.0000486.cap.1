                Figure 1.  MAOA genotype moderates the association between early traumatic life events and physical aggression.Interactions between gender, MAOA genotype, and early traumatic life events (ETLE) predicted AQ-PA physical aggression scores in (a) males and (b) females. In the male group, carriers of the low, but not the high MAOA activity allele reporting exposure to early traumatic life events showed significantly greater physical aggression scores.
