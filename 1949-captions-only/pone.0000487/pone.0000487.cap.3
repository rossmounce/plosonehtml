                Figure 3.  The planitibia subgroup of picture wing species[7].The planitibia complex: differens, hemipeza, heteroneura, planitibia, and silvestris. The neopicta complex: neopicta (npi) and nigribasis. The cyrtoloma complex (right column): cyrtoloma, melanocephala, neoperkinsi (npk), oahuensis, and obscuripes. The picticornis complex: picticornis. Inset, chromosome inversion-based lineage for the species shown (see text). The six species in the large box arose from an ancestral population that was polymorphic for the inversions that now differ among these species; see Carson [41] for details.
