Pattern elements can vary independently. Left, <em>engyochracea</em> (yellow), <em>orphnopeza</em> (cyan), and <em>sproati</em> (magenta) are overlaid. Black indicates where all three coincide. Wings were uniformly skewed in Photoshop to maximize overlap of the margins and veins. Names of longitudinal veins are indicated; L1 is the costal or marginal vein. Arrow, the spot over L2 varies much more than the other spots. Right, positions of the variable spot on L2 are compared in the three species: upper, <em>orphnopeza</em>; middle, <em>sproati</em>; lower, <em>engyochracea</em>; the same region of the wing is shown in each case. B. Two specimens from the <em>antopocerus</em> group are overlaid: <em>tanythrix</em> (orange) and <em>longiseta</em> (blue). The wings were resized to overlay the anterior crossvein, L2 and L3, but the photos were not skewed. Arrow indicates where the anterior margin has a bump in <em>longiseta</em> but is concave in <em>tanythrix</em>. C. Sexual dimorphism in <em>cilifera</em>: a female (upper) and male (middle) are overlayed (lower; female in orange, male in blue). Wings were slightly rescaled to align the veins.</p>
