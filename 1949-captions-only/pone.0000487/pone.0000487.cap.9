Wings from <em>grimshawi</em> mutant lines. A. <em>weak veins</em> mutant with a gap in L4 (arrow); dark pigment is absent from the distal L4 vein fragment. B. Wing notching in a <em>Nihoa</em> mutant is associated with a shortened L4 and a reduced distal spot (arrow). In both A and B, the prepattern of dark hairs is not affected <a href="#pone.0000487-True1">[21]</a>. C. Rare, natural variant of <em>clavisetae</em> with incomplete pigmentation; this defect is seen in both wings. Compare the central crossvein in the variant (arrow) to that of a typical <em>clavisetae</em> female (inset). D–E. Wings from two <em>hamifera</em> males. D. Normal pattern. (This wing and the one in <a href="#pone-0000487-g002">Fig. 2</a> are a pair from one male). E, F. Pair of wings from a different male. As in C, the intervein regions have not fully pigmented; see for example the spot indicated by the arrow.</p>
