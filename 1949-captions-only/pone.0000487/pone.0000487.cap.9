                Figure 9.  Variants that uncouple the prepattern from the vein-dependent pattern.A–B. Wings from grimshawi mutant lines. A. weak veins mutant with a gap in L4 (arrow); dark pigment is absent from the distal L4 vein fragment. B. Wing notching in a Nihoa mutant is associated with a shortened L4 and a reduced distal spot (arrow). In both A and B, the prepattern of dark hairs is not affected [21]. C. Rare, natural variant of clavisetae with incomplete pigmentation; this defect is seen in both wings. Compare the central crossvein in the variant (arrow) to that of a typical clavisetae female (inset). D–E. Wings from two hamifera males. D. Normal pattern. (This wing and the one in Fig. 2 are a pair from one male). E, F. Pair of wings from a different male. As in C, the intervein regions have not fully pigmented; see for example the spot indicated by the arrow.
