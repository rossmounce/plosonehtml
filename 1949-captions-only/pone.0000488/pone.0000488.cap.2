                Figure 2.  Expression of Bax is lethal for Giardia.A) Induced cells expressing Bax stop dividing and die in the course of 6 hours. Inset: semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Bax mRNA levels in transgenic cells pre induction (PI) and 4 hours after induction. B) Subcellular localization of CWPs in ESVs of encysting wild type cells labeled by a monoclonal anti-CWP antibody at 4 h post induction. C) Bax abolishes ESV formation in encysting cells and causes accumulation of CWPs in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Inset: differential interference contrast (DIC) image. Scale bar: 5 Âµm.
