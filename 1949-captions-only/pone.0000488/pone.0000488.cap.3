Note the co-localization of Bax (green) with (partially intact) ESVs and significantly less cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic CWP signal than in untreated cells (compare with <a href="#pone-0000488-g002">FIG. 2C</a>).16-May B) Deletion of the Bax C-terminus uncouples Bax targeting to ESV membranes and CWP release. BaxΔ22 lacks the C-terminal 22 amino acids of Bax and localizes to membranes of intact ESV. C, D) Electron micrographs of representative cells expressing Bax or BaxΔ22 at four hours post induction. C) Encysting trophozoite from the population expressing BaxΔ22 showing numerous ESVs with electron dense material (arrowheads). ESV and general compartment morphology are indistinguishable from wild type cells (not shown). Enlarged region shows an individual ESV. Peripheral vesicles underlying the plasma membrane are clearly visible. D) ESVs or organelle remnants are not present in surviving cell expressing Bax. Nuclei, and parts of the microtubule structures of the anterior flagella and significantly enlarged PVs are visible. N, nuclei. Scale bars: 2 µm.</p>
