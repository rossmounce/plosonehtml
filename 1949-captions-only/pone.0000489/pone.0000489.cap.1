                Figure 1.  Detection and characterization of important human and avian influenza virus subtypes.Base composition signatures are shown in A, G, C, T order. Identical base compositions within a column are the same color. Base compositions represented only once are shown in white. Base compositions from human H1N1, human H3N2 and avian/human H5N1 isolates (in green, blue and red boxes, respectively) are included in Figure 2.
