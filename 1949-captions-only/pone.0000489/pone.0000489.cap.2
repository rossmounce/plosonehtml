Solid symbols represent experimental measurements from this study, while open symbols are calculated base compositions determined from published sequences. Human isolates are shown as cubes and avian isolates as spheres. H1N1 isolates are shown in green, H3N2 in blue, and H5N1 in red. Arrows indicate avian influenza viruses isolated from humans.</p>
