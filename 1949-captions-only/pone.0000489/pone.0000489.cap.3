From year 2000 onwards, seasons were labeled “North” and “South” to reflect the northern or southern hemispheric origin of the samples. Thick vertical bars represent the persistence of main types between consecutive seasons. Within each season, the number of isolates is reported between parentheses for types encountered more than once. Thin horizontal lines represent the spawning of new types through the accumulation of single mutations (left to right). Black font: types determined through sequence analysis; blue font: experimentally determined base composition types; red font: experimentally determined base composition types for season 2005–06. Ten rare sequence types (~1.5%) were not uniquely discernable by the base composition analysis of the eight amplicons used in this analysis, as more than one subtype produced the same BC-type. These BC-types are indicated by asterisks.</p>
