Each concentric ring represents a single, double and triple mutations removed from the founder isolate, color coded for the gene containing the mutation. The order of the letters in the BC-type correspond to the six primer pairs used in this study, targeting PB1, NP, PA, M1, NS1 and NS2, respectively.</p>
