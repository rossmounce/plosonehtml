The heat maps in the top sections are a charge state representation of the data; the spectral plots in the lower sections were created by filtering the charge state responses to create signal representations vs. mass. The main peaks on the spectral plots are the primary amplicons and appear as hot spots in the charge state representations; the secondary amplicons appear as “cloudy” regions to the right and left for the forward and reverse strands, respectively. Panels A and B contain two species in relatively large ratios (20–50% mixtures) and involve the season 2005–2006 parent BC-type (AADFAA) and a type with a single mutation (panel A, within the M1 amplicon, BC-type AAHFAA; panel B, within the overlapping NS1 and NS2 amplicons, BC-type AADFBB). Panel C shows detection of a low abundance type (2–5%). Panel D shows a close-up view of the mass spectrum from Panel C. In this view, the shoulder of the peak is fit with a single mass model (blue dotted line) and a two mass model (dashed red line).</p>
