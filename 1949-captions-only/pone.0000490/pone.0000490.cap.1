Groups of 10 to 15 NF or AF flies were subjected to pure N<sub>2</sub> for 5 min (anoxia) at room temperature. Recovery time of each fly from the time of anoxic stupor to that of arousal following reintroduction of room air was recorded. A significantly shortened recovery time was found in AF flies (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01; NF: n = 166, AF: n = 114). (B): Increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate of AF flies in hypoxic condition. O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate was measured in a sealed testing jar at room temperature under normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>, Baseline) and hypoxia (3% O<sub>2</sub>, Hypoxia), respectively. Groups of 600 to 800 NF or AF flies were used in each test. Although both AF and NF decreased their O<sub>2</sub> consumption when switched to hypoxic condition, AF flies reduced less than NF (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01, n = 5). (C and D): Decreased body size and weight in AF flies. AF flies had decreased body weight and size. Body weight of a group of 100 NF or AF male flies were measured at 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> generation (n = 6) following hypoxia selection. A significant decrease at body weight was found in AF flies (lower panel, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01). Data were presented as mean Â± SEM, and the statistical significance was analyzed by student's <em>t</em>-test.</p>
