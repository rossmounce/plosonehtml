                Figure 1.  Phenotypic changes following long term hypoxia selection.(A): Shortened recovery time of AF flies from anoxic stupor. Groups of 10 to 15 NF or AF flies were subjected to pure N2 for 5 min (anoxia) at room temperature. Recovery time of each fly from the time of anoxic stupor to that of arousal following reintroduction of room air was recorded. A significantly shortened recovery time was found in AF flies (p&lt;0.01; NF: n = 166, AF: n = 114). (B): Increased O2 consumption rate of AF flies in hypoxic condition. O2 consumption rate was measured in a sealed testing jar at room temperature under normoxia (21% O2, Baseline) and hypoxia (3% O2, Hypoxia), respectively. Groups of 600 to 800 NF or AF flies were used in each test. Although both AF and NF decreased their O2 consumption when switched to hypoxic condition, AF flies reduced less than NF (p&lt;0.01, n = 5). (C and D): Decreased body size and weight in AF flies. AF flies had decreased body weight and size. Body weight of a group of 100 NF or AF male flies were measured at 16th and 17th generation (n = 6) following hypoxia selection. A significant decrease at body weight was found in AF flies (lower panel, p&lt;0.01). Data were presented as mean Â± SEM, and the statistical significance was analyzed by student's t-test.
