Panel A is representative pictures of wings from an AF (blue) and a NF (red) fly (bar = 250 µm). There was more than 20% reduction in wing area in AF (B; n = 16, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01), that is not able to be fully compensated by a corresponding increase in cell density (C and D; n = 16, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01). Further estimation of the total number of cells in the wing by multiplying the area by the cell density resulted in a total 10.2% cell loss in AF flies. Therefore, the reduction of the fly size is due to decrease of both cell size and cell number. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. The statistical significance was calculated by student's <em>t</em>-test.</p>
