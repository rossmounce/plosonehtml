                Figure 3.  Distinct expression clusters between AF and NF samples revealed by microarrays.cDNA Microarray results were clustered according to the levels of expression of the hypoxia selected and the control cross adult fly samples using GeneCluster [42]. Differentially expressed genes were sharply distinguished between NF and AF flies. Upper panel: a representative subgroup of up-regulated genes. Lower panel: a representative subgroup of down-regulated genes. Yellow color represents relative high levels of expression while blue represents low levels of expression. The brightest color is 1.5-fold or greater differential from the reference black.
