Differentially expressed genes were sharply distinguished between NF and AF flies. Upper panel: a representative subgroup of up-regulated genes. Lower panel: a representative subgroup of down-regulated genes. Yellow color represents relative high levels of expression while blue represents low levels of expression. The brightest color is 1.5-fold or greater differential from the reference black.</p>
