                Figure 4.  Survival of P-element insertion alleles of candidate genes in severe O2 environment.Survival of single P-element insertion lines for specific candidate genes. Embryos from each P-element insertion line were collected and cultured at 5% O2 condition. Total and eclosed pupae were counted and the ratio of eclosion for each allele was compared to that of yw and NF controls. Each bar represents the average of at least three tests of individual P-element insertion lines. The total number of scored pupae was indicated over each bar. The statistical significance was obtained when p values were &lt;0.001 (Chi-squared test).
