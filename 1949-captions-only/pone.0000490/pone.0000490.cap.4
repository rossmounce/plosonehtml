Embryos from each <em>P</em>-element insertion line were collected and cultured at 5% O<sub>2</sub> condition. Total and eclosed pupae were counted and the ratio of eclosion for each allele was compared to that of <em>yw</em> and NF controls. Each bar represents the average of at least three tests of individual <em>P</em>-element insertion lines. The total number of scored pupae was indicated over each bar. The statistical significance was obtained when <em>p</em> values were &lt;0.001 (Chi-squared test).</p>
