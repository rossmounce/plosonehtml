                Figure 5.  Alteration of target gene expression by P-element insertion.(Aâ€“F): Genomic localization of P-element insertions within or around gene Best1, broad, CG7102, dunce, lin19 and sec6. (G): Effect of P-element insertion on target gene expression was determined by sq-RT-PCR. Each open-bar represents the mean value of sqRT-PCR of a P-element allele for the target gene.
