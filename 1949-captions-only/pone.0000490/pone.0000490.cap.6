                Figure 6.  Precise-excision of P-elements in genomic region of gene sec6 reverses hypoxia tolerance.Survival of precise excision lines for P-element insertion targeting gene sec6 was determined in hypoxic condition. Embryos from each precise excision line were collected and cultured in 5% O2. Total and eclosed pupae were counted and the ratio of eclosion for each allele was compared to that of yw, NF controls and original P-element alleles. Each bar represents the average of at least three tests of individual excision line. The total number of scored pupae was indicated over each bar. The statistical significance was obtained when p values were &lt;0.001 (Chi-squared test).
