(A, B) meiosis. (C, D) polarity establishment; beginning of sperm aster growth. (E, F) prophase; arrows point to enrichment around the asters. (G, H) anaphase. (I, J) Early two cell stage. (K, L) Late two cell stage. (M) central focal plane of embryo in (A,B), showing that EEs are cortically associated. EEs are evenly distributed in meiosis (A), then become depleted from the posterior near the site of the sperm pronucleus (C). Anterior enrichment of EEs is maintained throughout the rest of the cell cycle and in the two cell stage. During meiotic divisions, there is a small clearing of EEs around the meiotic spindle (data not shown). Anterior, left.</p>
