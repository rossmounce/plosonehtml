The Golgi is visualized using two markers: (A) YFP::ManS, a fusion of YFP and the Golgi resident mannosidase F58H1.1 and (B) anti-CASP/Y54F10AM.4b staining. CASP is an integral Golgi membrane protein <a href="#pone.0000493-Gillingham1">[17]</a>. Arrowheads in (A), (B), and (C) (the merged image) show colocalization of puncta with the two markers. Central focal planes are shown. (D) even distribution of Golgi structures in a projection of 12 focal planes of YFP::ManS in a wild-type anaphase stage embryo.</p>
