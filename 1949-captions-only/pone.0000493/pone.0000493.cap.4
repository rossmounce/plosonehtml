                Figure 4.  NMY-2 and PAR-3 are required for EE asymmetry.Projections of EEA-1 distributions in (A) par-3(it71) mutant, and (B) nmy-2(RNAi) embryo. Compare to similar staged wild-type images in Figure 1 (1G and 1I, respectively). Asymmetry is lost in par-3 mutant and nmy-2(RNAi) embryos. (C) Ratio of the number of EEA-1 positive puncta in an anterior region compared to a posterior region of the same size.
