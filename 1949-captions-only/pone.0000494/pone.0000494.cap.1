Results are expressed as individual values with medians. C, Correlation between circulating levels of IL-16 and nucleosomes in control subjects, asymptomatic subjects and patients with WD. Dots were analyzed by linear regression. D, The caspase activity in leukocytes (FLICA measurement) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as the percentage of leukocytes that expressed active caspases.</p>
