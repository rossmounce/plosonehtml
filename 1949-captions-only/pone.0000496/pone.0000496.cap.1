Cells can be completely contained within a primary concavity, due to its dimensions. (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (<strong>B</strong>) SEM analysis of primary concavity dimensions (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (<strong>C</strong>) SEM analysis of secondary concavity dimensions (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (<strong>D</strong>) The interaction between the concave surface, showing primary (<span class="underline">white arrow</span>) and secondary (<span class="underline">red arrows</span>) micro-concavities at the confocal microscope (in green a cell within a concavity). The intimate adherence of a cell to the polymer surface and its nuclear polarity are clearly observable. The image was been obtained superimposing dark field with light field confocal microscopy (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (<strong>E</strong>) Confocal image showing primary (outlined in red) and secondary (outlined in blue) micro-concavities and spider-shaped cellular elongations (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (<strong>F</strong>) A gingival fibroblast not showing cellular alterations or nuclear polarity at the confocal microscope (Calibration Bar = 10 µm).</p>
