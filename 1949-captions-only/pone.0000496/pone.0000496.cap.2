                Figure 2.  Images showing the results obtained when cells were cultured on the smooth surface.(A) smooth surface at SEM (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (B) cells, cultured on a smooth surface, under SEM, show an elongated shape (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (C) confocal image showing the relationship between cells and the smooth surface (Calibration Bar = 10 µm); (D) image showing the relationship between cells and the different surface texturing: (1) concave and (2) smooth.
