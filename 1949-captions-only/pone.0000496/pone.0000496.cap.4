                Figure 4.  ELISA assays performed on (A) VEGF and (B) BMP2 released within the supernatant by SBP-DPSCs after 24, 48, 72 and 96h from plating on smooth and concave textured surface; ELISA assays performed on (C) VEGF and (D) BMP2 present in the cell layer of SBP-DPSCs after 24, 48, 72 and 96h from plating on smooth and concave texturing.Each experiment was performed in triplicate (n = 3). The error bars are Â±SD. *p&lt;0.01. N indicates samples not NMP-treated; P indicates NMP-treated samples.
