The figures shows that the bone tissue is of great thickness with an evident periosteal layer (red arrow) and containing osteocytes entrapped within the matrix (black arrows). (<strong>B</strong>) <em>In vivo</em> sample on smooth PLGA scaffold (Calibration Bar = 5 µm) appeared to be more primitive, thin (black arrow) and not as well developed above a connective loose tissue containing vessels (red arrow).</p>
