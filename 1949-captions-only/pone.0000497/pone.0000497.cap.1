                Figure 1.  Reactivation of TbTIM with and without BSA.In A, denatured TbTIM was allowed to reactivate in 100 mM triethanolamine, 10 mM EDTA and 200 mM GdnHCl (pH 7.4) that contained the indicated concentrations of the enzyme without and with 19 µg BSA/ml (open and closed circles, respectively). In B, the reactivation media contained 1 µg/ml TbTIM and the indicated concentrations of BSA. After 24 hours at 25°C, activity was determined. The ordinate shows the extent of reactivation; 100% is the activity of the starting TbTIM which was 3353 and 3488 µmol/min/mg in experiments A and B, respectively.
