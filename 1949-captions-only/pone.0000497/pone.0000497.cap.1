In B, the reactivation media contained 1 µg/ml TbTIM and the indicated concentrations of BSA. After 24 hours at 25°C, activity was determined. The ordinate shows the extent of reactivation; 100% is the activity of the starting TbTIM which was 3353 and 3488 µmol/min/mg in experiments A and B, respectively.</p>
