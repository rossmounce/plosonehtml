The conditions were as in <a href="#pone-0000497-g001">Figure 1</a>. The concentration of TbTIM in the reactivation buffer was 1 µg/ml and that of BSA 19 µg/ml. In A, the appearance of activity is plotted against time; 100% is the activity of native TbTIM, 3391 µmol/min/mg. The inset shows the ln of the appearance of activity versus time, where ln = [(Maximal activity reached−activity at time x)/maximal activity]×100. B shows the effect of adding BSA (19 µg/ml) after the enzyme was allowed to reactivate for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours; after 24 hours, activity was determined. In the zero time sample, denatured TbTIM was added to media that contained BSA. The activity of native TbTIM was 3121 µmol/min/mg; this was considered 100%.</p>
