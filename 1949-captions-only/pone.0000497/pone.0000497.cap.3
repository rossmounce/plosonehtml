                Figure 3.  Effect of BSA on the stability of TbTIM dimers.In A, the indicated concentrations of native TbTIM dimers were incubated with and without 19 µg/ml BSA; after 24 hours activity was recorded. 100% is the activity at time zero (3401 µmol/min/mg). Note that with 5 µg/ml TbTIM, activity dropped by about 20%; at a concentration of 10 µg/ml, the activity remained unchanged (not shown). In B, 1 µg/ml TbTIM was incubated with the indicated BSA concentrations for 24 hours.
