The bottom of Figure A shows the molecular weights, isoelectric points and the molar ratio of protein:TbTIM of BSA; ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase; DNasa: deoxyribonuclease; Ovo: ovalbumin; Hex: hexokinase; Lyso: lysozyme; CytC: cytocrome c; RNasa: ribonuclease A. B shows the effect of 19 µg/ml of the same proteins on the stability of 1 µg/ml TbTIM dimers after 24 hours of incubation. Note that in the absence of the proteins, TbTIM lost 64% of its activity; in the presence of the proteins, hardly any activity was lost. The activity of native TbTIM was 3322 µmol/min/mg (100%). In C, the effect of 19 µg/ml BSA on the reactivation of 1 µg/ml of TIM from <em>T. cruzi</em> (Tc) <em>Leishmania mexicana</em> (Lm) and <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (Sc) is shown. Data with TbTIM are included. The reactivation time was 24 hours. The activities of native TbTIM, TcTIM, LmTIM, and ScTIM were 3422, 3638, 3762, and 7572 µmol/min/mg, respectively. The respective activities were considered as 100%.</p>
