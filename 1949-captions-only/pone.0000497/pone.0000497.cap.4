                Figure 4.  Reactivation and stability of TbTIM with various proteins, and reactivation of different TIMs.In A, 1 µg/ml of TbTIM was allowed to reactivate in presence of 19 µg/ml of the indicated proteins for 24 hours. The bottom of Figure A shows the molecular weights, isoelectric points and the molar ratio of protein:TbTIM of BSA; ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase; DNasa: deoxyribonuclease; Ovo: ovalbumin; Hex: hexokinase; Lyso: lysozyme; CytC: cytocrome c; RNasa: ribonuclease A. B shows the effect of 19 µg/ml of the same proteins on the stability of 1 µg/ml TbTIM dimers after 24 hours of incubation. Note that in the absence of the proteins, TbTIM lost 64% of its activity; in the presence of the proteins, hardly any activity was lost. The activity of native TbTIM was 3322 µmol/min/mg (100%). In C, the effect of 19 µg/ml BSA on the reactivation of 1 µg/ml of TIM from T. cruzi (Tc) Leishmania mexicana (Lm) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) is shown. Data with TbTIM are included. The reactivation time was 24 hours. The activities of native TbTIM, TcTIM, LmTIM, and ScTIM were 3422, 3638, 3762, and 7572 µmol/min/mg, respectively. The respective activities were considered as 100%.
