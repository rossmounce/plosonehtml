(2) The heat changes that occurred when 15 µl of a solution of 17 mg TbTIM per ml were injected into a solution of 10 mg/ml lysozyme. (3) The calorimetric response of repeated injections of a TbTIM solution into buffer alone. Panel B depicts the heat evolved in the interaction between TbTIM and lysozyme as a function of the TbTIM/lysozyme molar ratio. Open squares are heats obtained from the calorimetric traces in A; closed squares are a replica. The average enthalpy change was −0.32 kcal/mole of TbTIM. Inset: heat due to the dissociation of the self-associated lysozyme as function of lysozyme concentration in the main cell.</p>
