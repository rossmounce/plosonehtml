The fluorescence of the sample containing tubulin alone increased rapidly to a maximum value at 45 minutes of incubation at 37°C. The ST (N-terminus) and DR (β3) peptides had no effect on total microtubule assembly, the FI (loop) peptide inhibited microtubule assembly, while the LT (β8) and ER (C-terminus) peptides promoted microtubule assembly. The positive control, Paclitaxel, accelerated microtubule assembly, while the negative control, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, inhibited microtubule assembly which was consistent with previous reports <a href="#pone.0000498-Thompson1">[59]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000498-Berkowitz1">[60]</a>.</p>
