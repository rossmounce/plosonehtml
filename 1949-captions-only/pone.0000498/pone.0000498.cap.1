                Figure 1.  Effect of αB crystallin peptides on microtubule assembly.Samples containing tubulin and αB crystallin peptides or control molecules were excited at λ = 355 nm and the fluorescence emission of DAPI bound to assembled microtubules was recorded at λ = 460 nm. The fluorescence of the sample containing tubulin alone increased rapidly to a maximum value at 45 minutes of incubation at 37°C. The ST (N-terminus) and DR (β3) peptides had no effect on total microtubule assembly, the FI (loop) peptide inhibited microtubule assembly, while the LT (β8) and ER (C-terminus) peptides promoted microtubule assembly. The positive control, Paclitaxel, accelerated microtubule assembly, while the negative control, CaCl2, inhibited microtubule assembly which was consistent with previous reports [59], [60].
