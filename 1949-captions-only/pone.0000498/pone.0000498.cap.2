The ST sequence is in the N-terminal extension, the DR, LT, and FI sequences are in the β3 and β8 strands and the loop of the α crystallin core domain, and the ER sequence is in the C-terminal extension. Surfaces formed by the LT (β8) and ER (C-terminal extension containing the Ile-X-Ile motif) sequences mediated subunit-subunit interactions as well as interactions with unfolded substrate proteins, filaments, and tubulin.</p>
