                Figure 2.  Surface locations of the interactive sequences in αB crystallin for subunit-subunit interactions, chaperone activity, and interactions with filaments and tubulin.Interactive sequences for subunit-subunit interactions, chaperone activity, and interactions with filaments and tubulin identified by in vitro assays, mutagenesis, and pin array analysis were mapped to the N-terminal, β3-β8-β9, and C- terminal interface regions of the human αB crystallin homology model. The ST sequence is in the N-terminal extension, the DR, LT, and FI sequences are in the β3 and β8 strands and the loop of the α crystallin core domain, and the ER sequence is in the C-terminal extension. Surfaces formed by the LT (β8) and ER (C-terminal extension containing the Ile-X-Ile motif) sequences mediated subunit-subunit interactions as well as interactions with unfolded substrate proteins, filaments, and tubulin.
