                Figure 3.  Effect of synthetic αB crystallin peptides on microtubule assembly, disassembly, and tubulin aggregation.The DAPI fluorescence of assembled microtubules, disassembled tubulin, and tubulin aggregates in the absence of αB crystallin peptides and control additives were normalized to 1.0. The FI, LT, and ER peptides had the strongest effect on microtubule assembly/disassembly and tubulin aggregation, while ST and DR peptides had little to no effect microtubule assembly/disassembly and tubulin aggregation.
