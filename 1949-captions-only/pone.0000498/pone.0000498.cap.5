                Figure 5.  Effect of αB crystallin concentration on microtubule assembly.Microtubule assembly (Y-axis) was sensitive to the concentration of wt αB crystallin (X-axis). Microtubule assembly in the absence of αB crystallin was normalized to 1.0. The ratio of αB crystallin to tubulin for each concentration of αB crystallin is listed at the top of the plot. For αB crystallin to tubulin ratios &lt;1:4, microtubule assembly was unchanged at 1.0. For ratios between 1:4 and 2:1, microtubule assembly was &gt;1.0 with maximum assembly observed at a tubulin to αB crystallin ratio of approximately 1:2. For ratios &gt;4:1, microtubule assembly was &lt;1.0. For a αB crystallin to tubulin ratio of 10:1, microtubule assembly was undetectable. The variation of microtubule assembly with increasing concentrations of human αB crystallin is explained by the dynamic subunit model for the chaperone activity of αB crystallin.
