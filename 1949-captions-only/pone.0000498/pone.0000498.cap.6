The αB crystallin sequences <sub>113</sub>FISREFHR<sub>120</sub>, <sub>131</sub>LTITSSLS<sub>138</sub>, and <sub>156</sub>ERTIPITRE<sub>164</sub> that modulate tubulin-microtubule dynamics are in red, green, and blue respectively. The <sub>113</sub>FISREFHR<sub>120</sub> sequence, which inhibits microtubule assembly is exposed on the surface of the hollow αB crystallin complex. <sub>113</sub>FISREFHR<sub>120</sub> sequences from three separate αB crystallin subunits surround each of the eight windows that lead into the hollow core of the complex. In contrast, the <sub>131</sub>LTITSSLS<sub>138</sub> and <sub>156</sub>ERTIPITRE<sub>164</sub> sequences, which promote microtubule assembly, are sites of subunit-subunit interactions in αB crystallin with limited exposure on the surface of the complex. For these sequences to interact with tubulin and promote microtubule assembly, dissociation of the subunits from the complex is required. In contrast, tubulin binding to the inhibitory <sub>113</sub>FISREFHR<sub>120</sub> sequences can occur on the surface of the complex. The computed model for the human αB crystallin complex was based on the <em>Methanococcus jannaschii</em> sHSP16.5 twenty-four subunit crystal structure described previously <a href="#pone.0000498-Muchowski2">[62]</a>.</p>
