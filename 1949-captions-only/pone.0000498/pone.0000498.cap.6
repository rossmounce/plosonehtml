                Figure 6.  Model of the tubulin interactive sequences in the human αB crystallin complex and their importance in the assembly of microtubules.In the model, twenty-four subunits (grey) of αB crystallin form a complex which is a hollow sphere containing eight windows entering the central cavity [34], [36], [38], [61]. The αB crystallin sequences 113FISREFHR120, 131LTITSSLS138, and 156ERTIPITRE164 that modulate tubulin-microtubule dynamics are in red, green, and blue respectively. The 113FISREFHR120 sequence, which inhibits microtubule assembly is exposed on the surface of the hollow αB crystallin complex. 113FISREFHR120 sequences from three separate αB crystallin subunits surround each of the eight windows that lead into the hollow core of the complex. In contrast, the 131LTITSSLS138 and 156ERTIPITRE164 sequences, which promote microtubule assembly, are sites of subunit-subunit interactions in αB crystallin with limited exposure on the surface of the complex. For these sequences to interact with tubulin and promote microtubule assembly, dissociation of the subunits from the complex is required. In contrast, tubulin binding to the inhibitory 113FISREFHR120 sequences can occur on the surface of the complex. The computed model for the human αB crystallin complex was based on the Methanococcus jannaschii sHSP16.5 twenty-four subunit crystal structure described previously [62].
