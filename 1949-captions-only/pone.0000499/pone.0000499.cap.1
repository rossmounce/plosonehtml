                Figure 1.  Mean relative target biomass of all species in the control treatment.Mean target biomass (Â±SE) of each species in all pairwise combinations, standardized by the target biomass with conspecific neighbours. Grey bars indicate target biomass with conspecific neighbours, white bars target biomass with their respective interspecific neighbours. Target species are: (A) A. pratensis, (B) A. odoratum, (C) A. elatius, (D) F. rubra and (E) H. lanatus.
