                Figure 2.  Relationship between the relative competitive effect and relative differences in light interception.Linear regression slopes and 95% confidence intervals for the relationships between the relative competitive effect (RCEij) and the log ratio of neighbour/target light interception levels (A) 10 weeks, (B) 15 weeks and (C) 18 weeks after sowing. The black dashed line is the expected regression line with perfect symmetry which has a slope of one and an intercept of zero.
