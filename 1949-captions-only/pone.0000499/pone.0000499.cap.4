                Figure 4.  Relationship between the relative competitive release and relative differences in light interception.Linear regression slopes and 95% confidence intervals for the relationships between the relative competitive release (RCRij) based on (A) target plant biomass and (B) height and the log ratios of neighbour/target light interception levels 10 weeks after the sowing. Letters denote the target plant species; subscripts denote the corresponding surrounding species of each respective species pair, as given in Fig. 1.
