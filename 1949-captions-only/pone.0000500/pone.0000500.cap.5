                Figure 5.  Dekadal mean daily maximum air temperature for 21.March-30.April recorded at the meteorological station, Jelgava, Latvia. The horizontal dotted lines indicate mean temperatures for 1970–1988 and 1989–2004, except for the 3rd dekad of April, where the more marked increase from 1993 is also highlighted; this discontinuity is confirmed by the D2 statistic peak (bottom graph).
