Dots represent the nodes of the network, while edges between nodes depict connections. Nodes belonging to different <em>k</em>-shells are indicated by different colors (on the right hand side) and are arranged around concentric circles, whose average radius decreases with <em>k</em>. In particular, a node of a given shell is placed just inside (outside) the corresponding circle, if it is preferentially connected to lower (higher) <em>k</em>-shells. The sizes of the dots indicate the degree of the respective nodes; see legends to the left of the figures for representative sizes.</p>
