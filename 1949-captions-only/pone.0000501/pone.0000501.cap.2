                Figure 2.  The hierarchical structure of the TRN as revealed by the k-core decomposition.The k-core visualization of a single realization of our model network (Left) obtained with the visualization tool lanet-vi (http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.NI/0504107) The length distribution exponent of the PR sequences has been adjusted to Î¼ = 0.1 to match the number of k-cores to that obtained from Yeastract data (Right). Dots represent the nodes of the network, while edges between nodes depict connections. Nodes belonging to different k-shells are indicated by different colors (on the right hand side) and are arranged around concentric circles, whose average radius decreases with k. In particular, a node of a given shell is placed just inside (outside) the corresponding circle, if it is preferentially connected to lower (higher) k-shells. The sizes of the dots indicate the degree of the respective nodes; see legends to the left of the figures for representative sizes.
