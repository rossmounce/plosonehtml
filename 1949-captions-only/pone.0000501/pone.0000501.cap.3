                Figure 3.  Topological features.Above: Degree distributions extracted from the Yeastract [5] data (red circles), superposed on the corresponding degree distributions of one hundred realizations of the model network (black dots). From left to right, (a) The total degree distribution with an inset showing a log-linear plot for k/kavâ‰¤10, where one may observe that both the model and the data points almost fall on a straight line. (b) The in-degree distribution plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale. (c) The out-degree distribution plotted on a log-log scale. The axes are scaled by the appropriate average total degree in order to factor out sample-to-sample fluctuations in the network size. Below: Comparison of (d) the clustering coefficient c(k), (e) the typical degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes knm(k), and (f) the rich-club coefficient r(k), from left to right, for 100 realizations of the model (black dots) and the Yeastract data (red circles).
