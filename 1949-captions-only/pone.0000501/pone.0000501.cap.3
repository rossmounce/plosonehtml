From left to right, (a) The total degree distribution with an inset showing a log-linear plot for <em>k</em>/<em>k</em><sub>av</sub>â‰¤10, where one may observe that both the model and the data points almost fall on a straight line. (b) The in-degree distribution plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale. (c) The out-degree distribution plotted on a log-log scale. The axes are scaled by the appropriate average total degree in order to factor out sample-to-sample fluctuations in the network size. Below: Comparison of (d) the clustering coefficient <em>c</em>(<em>k</em>), (e) the typical degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes <em>k</em><sub>nm</sub>(<em>k</em>), and (f) the rich-club coefficient <em>r</em>(<em>k</em>), from left to right, for 100 realizations of the model (black dots) and the Yeastract data (red circles).</p>
