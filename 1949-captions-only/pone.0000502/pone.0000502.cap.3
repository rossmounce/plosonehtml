                Figure 3.  Posterior densities for the estimated parameters from the most complex models conditioned on the first infection allowing for parameter changes on 23rd Feb and interaction.(a) Spatial kernel powers Î³ pre and post 23rd February. (b) Pre and post 23rd February estimated kernels, a log-log scale plot. (c) Susceptibility ratios cattle:sheep and (d) Animals infectivity parameters as modified by interaction in time varying kernel model. (e) Infectivity ratio cattle:sheep as calculated from the most complex model. (f) Assortativity parameter.
