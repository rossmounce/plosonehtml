<h4>Infections in proactively culled farms</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>We have made the strong assumption for this study that the only infected farms during the 2001 epidemic were the reported IPs, and hence that any farms which were infected but culled before clinical diagnosis were not responsible for causing any infections. It is therefore interesting to calculate how many of the proactively culled farms our model predicts might have been infected (but, by definition, not diagnosed).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2"></a><p>To calculate the probability <em>p<sub>i</sub></em><sub> </sub>that a particular proactively culled farm <em>i</em> was infected, we need to adjust the infection hazard by the probability that the farm would have not been reported as a clinical case before its culling date <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e021&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>. From the outbreak data, we calculate the probability density of the time from infection to report for reported IPs and hence the cumulative probability distribution of the time from infection to report, denoted by <em>F</em>. Then, with λ<em><sub>i</sub></em>(<em>t</em>) being the force of infection on a proactively culled farm <em>i</em> at time <em>t</em> (from the best fit model conditioned on 23<sup>rd</sup> February), the probability that that farm gets infected and escapes reporting between its potential infection time and culling time <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e022&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> is<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e023&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(13)</span></span><br>We calculate the expected number of infections in different classes (e.g. DCs, CPs) of proactively culled farms culled within a particular time interval (<span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e024&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>). For instance, the expected number of CPs culled at the time <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e025&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> which are predicted to have been infected can be formally written as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e026&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(14)</span></span><br>This is a simplification, as in reality the delay from infection to report almost certainly depends on the size and species mix on a farm, but the result is nevertheless indicative of the expected level of infection in proactive culling. Also, at this stage, the calculations are made as if culling was a non-informative censoring process. This is a reasonable assumption for all proactively culled farms except for DCs (which by definition had been identified by veterinarian as having had a high risk of exposure) but our method may underestimate the infection rate. In calculating the infection to report delay distributions, we divided the epidemic after 23<sup>rd</sup> February into 3 time periods: 23<sup>rd</sup> February–31<sup>st</sup> March, 31<sup>st</sup> March–1<sup>st</sup> May and 1<sup>st</sup> May–5<sup>th</sup> October. In these intervals a total of 1332, 4498 and 1627 farms were slaughtered, respectively. Our best fit model conditioned on 23<sup>rd</sup> February predicts different infectivity regimes before and after 31<sup>st</sup> March (see Parameter Estimates and <a href="#pone-0000502-t002">Table 2</a>) but we split further the second period of time due to different delays in reporting to culling. The infection to report delay is 8.6 and 8.8 days for the last two periods of time respectively but the infection to cull delay drops from 9.4 and 8.8 days respectively.</p>

We estimate that approximately 1.3% (1%, 1.6%) of 7457 culled non-IP farms may have been infected – 97 in total (<a href="#pone-0000502-g006">Figure 6a</a>). Of the 1332 farms culled between 23<sup>rd</sup> February and 31<sup>st</sup> March, 1.7% (1%, 2.4%) may have been infected (23 farms). Of the 4498 farms culled between 31<sup>st</sup> March and 1<sup>st</sup> May, we estimate 0.7% (0.5%, 1%) were infected (34 farms). In the period 1<sup>st</sup> May to 5<sup>th</sup> October, we estimate that 1.6% (1%, 2.3%) of 1627 farms culled were infected (27 farms).</p>
