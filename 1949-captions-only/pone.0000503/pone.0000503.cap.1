                Figure 1.  Rate matrices for different substitution models.All matrices are scaled to one expected substitution per unit time per site. Shading of the cells reflects the respective magnitude of the rate, with darker shades corresponding to increasingly higher rates. Substitutions which involve a single nucleotide are marked with a circle. The four diagonal blocks represent similarity classes (conservative substitutions) according to the Stanfel scale.
