Shading of the cells reflects the respective magnitude of the rate, with darker shades corresponding to increasingly higher rates. Substitutions which involve a single nucleotide are marked with a circle. The four diagonal blocks represent similarity classes (conservative substitutions) according to the Stanfel scale.</p>
