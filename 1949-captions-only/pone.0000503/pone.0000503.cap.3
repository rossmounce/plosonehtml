<h4>Model validation using independent data sets</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>To determine whether HIV Within and HIV Between models reflect evolutionary patterns found in circulating HIV-1 strains, rather than simply fitting the noise in the training sample, we tested model fits on samples of HIV-1 sequences not included in the training set. The results on samples collected from 47 different patients (the sequences from each patient formed a distinct test case) with a median of 32 sequences (range 10–57) and 357 sites (range 330–473), representing <em>env</em> and <em>pol</em> sequences from subtype B and subtype C viruses are shown in <a href="#pone-0000503-t002">Tables 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0000503-t003">3</a>. In 44/47 cases, the <strong>HIV-W<sub>m</sub></strong> model with base frequencies estimated from the sample had the best small sample Akaike Information Criterion score (c-AIC) score of all 19 models compared. The c-AIC score of a model is defined as c-AIC = 2(−<em>L</em>+<em>ps</em>/(<em>s</em>−<em>p</em>−1)), where L is the log-likelihood score of the model, p is the number of estimated model parameters, and s is the number of independent samples. There are a number of possible ways to estimate the number of independent samples in the alignment <a href="#pone.0000503-Posada1">[32]</a> and we chose to use the number of alignment columns as an estimate of s. c-AIC performed well in selecting appropriate evolutionary models on biological and simulated alignments of paired RNA sequences <a href="#pone.0000503-KosakovskyPond5">[33]</a>. In 2/47 cases, the <strong>HIV-W<sub>m</sub></strong> model with the frequencies from the training set was the best and in 1/47 cases, the <strong>HIV-B<sub>m</sub></strong> model was the best. In fact, the four HIV models predominantly occupied the four top ranks, suggesting that no other empirical model adequately represents the evolutionary rates shaping HIV-1 genomic variation. The REV-1 and JTT (+F) models were 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>, respectively. Surprisingly, three models based on large heterogeneous database samples (JTT, WAG and mtMAM) outperformed the rtREV model, which was derived from a viral training dataset. Perhaps more importantly, our general HIV model estimated across many of the HIV genes consistently outperformed the rtREV model on sequence samples, including the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase protein.</p>
