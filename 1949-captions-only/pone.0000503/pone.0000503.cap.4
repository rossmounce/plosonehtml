                Figure 4.  Maximum likelihood trees inferred with two different amino acid models from a sample of HIV-1 env V3 sequences with a known transmission history (Leitner et al. 1996).HIV-Bm found the tree that is congruent with the true history of the sequences. Scale bars are in expected amino acid substitutions/site.
