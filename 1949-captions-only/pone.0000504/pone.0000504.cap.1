                Figure 1.  Concentration of compounds for testing was assessed using a food clearance assay.(A) Flow diagram of the food clearance assay. 20 newly hatched L1 animals were incubated at 25°C in E. coli at a final OD (A595) of 0.6 in 96 well microtiter plate wells containing varying drug concentrations. The OD of the microtiter plate was measured daily for 5 days. (B) The OD of E. coli is reported daily for each concentration of LiCl. The mean OD is calculated for each day from triplicate samples and plotted over time. Error bars represent SEM. Food clearance assays were also performed on trichostatin A and mithramycin, (Figure S1). (C) Animals treated with no drug and indicated LiCl concentrations. Animals treated with 50 mM or 100 mM LiCl are alive but concentrations above 100 mM LiCl cause death (data not shown). Scale bar is approximately 75 µm.
