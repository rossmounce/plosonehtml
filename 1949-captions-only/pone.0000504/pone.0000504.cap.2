Animals were grown in the presence of compound for 3 days. ASH neuron survival was evaluated by the presence or absence of GFP expression. (B–D) LiCl, TSA and MTR increased ASH neuron survival in the <em>pqe-1;Htn-Q150</em> animals in the presence of <em>E. coli</em>. ASH neuron survival was evaluated by the presence or absence of GFP expression on day 3. 100 neurons were scored for each trial; mean percentage of 3 different trials±SEM is shown. p&lt;0.0001 for 25 mM LiCl. p = .037 for 0.5 mM MTR; p&lt;0.0001 for 1 mM MTR. p = 0.0082 for 165 µM TSA; p = 0.005 for 330 µM TSA.</p>
