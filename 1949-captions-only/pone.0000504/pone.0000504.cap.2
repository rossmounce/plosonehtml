                Figure 2.  LiCl, TSA, and MTR decrease polyQ mediated ASH neuronal death.(A) Flow diagram of the sensitized assay. 20–30 synchronized pqe-1;Htn-Q150 L1s per well were incubated at 15°C in S medium with E. coli at an OD (A595) of 0.6 and varying concentrations of compound to a total volume of 60 µl. Animals were grown in the presence of compound for 3 days. ASH neuron survival was evaluated by the presence or absence of GFP expression. (B–D) LiCl, TSA and MTR increased ASH neuron survival in the pqe-1;Htn-Q150 animals in the presence of E. coli. ASH neuron survival was evaluated by the presence or absence of GFP expression on day 3. 100 neurons were scored for each trial; mean percentage of 3 different trials±SEM is shown. p&lt;0.0001 for 25 mM LiCl. p = .037 for 0.5 mM MTR; p&lt;0.0001 for 1 mM MTR. p = 0.0082 for 165 µM TSA; p = 0.005 for 330 µM TSA.
