On day 7, animals were collected and dye filled using DiD. (B) LiCl increased ASH neuron survival in the <em>pha-1;Htn-Q150</em> aged animals. ASH neurodegeneration was evaluated by the presence or absence of dye-filled ASH neurons on day 7. 50 neurons were scored for each trial; mean percentage of 3 different trials±SD is shown. p = 0.0033 for 15 mM LiCl.</p>
