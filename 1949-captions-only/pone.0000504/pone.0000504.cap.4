On day 2, the survival of the ASH neuron was determined by visually evaluating the presence or absence of GFP expression. (B) LiCl and MTR increase neuronal survival in starved conditions. 100 neurons were scored for each trial; mean percentage of 3 different trials±SEM is shown. p = 0.0063 for 10 mM LiCl; p&lt;0.0001 for 25 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM LiCl. p&lt;0.0001 for 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM, 1.0 mM, and 1.5 mM MTR. (C) LiCl and MTR increase neuronal survival in a <em>daf-16</em> independent manner. At least 100 neurons were scored for each trial; percentage of neuronal survival in one representative experiment of 2 independent trials is shown; p&lt;0.0001 for 25 mM and 50 mM LiCl. p&lt;0.0001 for 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM MTR. (D) Combined, MTR (0.5 mM) and LiCl (25 mM) were more effective than either drug alone in protecting ASH neurons from polyQ neurotoxicity. 50 synchronized <em>pqe-1;Htn-Q150</em> L1s per well were incubated at 25°C in S medium with 0.5 mM MTR and 25 mM LiCl to a total volume of 60 µl. On day 2, the survival of the ASH neuron was evaluated by the presence or absence of GFP. 100 neurons were scored for each trial; mean percentage of 3 different trials±SEM is shown. The excess synergy was 0.14 based on a Bliss Independence analysis. p = 0.046 for 0.5 mM MTR; p = 0.0039 for 25 mM LiCl; p&lt;0.0001 for LiCl+MTR.</p>
