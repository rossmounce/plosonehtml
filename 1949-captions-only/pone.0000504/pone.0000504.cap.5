(2) The protective effects of compounds on polyglutamine neurodegeneration and cell death were assessed in <em>pqe-1;Htn-Q150</em> animals treated with compounds for 3 days. (3) To determine if neuroprotective effects of compounds were dependent on <em>pqe-1</em>, compounds were retested in animals expressing <em>Htn-Q150</em> for 7 days. (4) To distinguish drug effects on neuronal cell death versus effects on growth and/or development, synchronized <em>pqe-1;Htn-Q150</em> L1 animals were incubated in the presence of drugs without food for 2 days. (5) The neuroprotective effects of compounds on the aging process can be tested by introducing mutations (<em>daf-16</em>) in components of specific aging-related (insulin signaling) pathways.</p>
