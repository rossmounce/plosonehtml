                Figure 5.  Schematic Diagram of Compound Testing Strategy.(1) A range of concentrations for each compound for testing in C. elegans was established using the food clearance assay. (2) The protective effects of compounds on polyglutamine neurodegeneration and cell death were assessed in pqe-1;Htn-Q150 animals treated with compounds for 3 days. (3) To determine if neuroprotective effects of compounds were dependent on pqe-1, compounds were retested in animals expressing Htn-Q150 for 7 days. (4) To distinguish drug effects on neuronal cell death versus effects on growth and/or development, synchronized pqe-1;Htn-Q150 L1 animals were incubated in the presence of drugs without food for 2 days. (5) The neuroprotective effects of compounds on the aging process can be tested by introducing mutations (daf-16) in components of specific aging-related (insulin signaling) pathways.
