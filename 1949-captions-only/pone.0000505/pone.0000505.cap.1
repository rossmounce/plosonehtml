TIRF-Microscopy image of the footprint of a representative chromaffin cell transfected with NPY-mRFP taken prior to (left) and immediately after (right) depolarization (seven 100 ms depolarizations to âˆ’5 mV at 5 Hz). White arrows indicate vesicles that were secreted during stimulation. B. Corresponding membrane capacitance recording of the cell shown in (A). Black arrows indicate the approximate time of secretion in TIRF. C. A high correlation (p&lt;0.001, correlation coefficient 0.76, n = 77) was observed between the number of secreted vesicles measured by TIRF-Microscopy and the corresponding capacitance increase. Gray arrow points to the exemplary cell shown in A and B.</p>
