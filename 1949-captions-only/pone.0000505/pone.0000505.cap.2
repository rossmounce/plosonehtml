                Figure 2.  Different triggers and different vesicle labels lead to better correlates between exocytosis measured by TIRF-Microscopy and by membrane capacitance recording.A. Correlation plot of exocytosis measured by TIRF-Microscopy and by membrane capacitance recording when secretion was either induced by a depolarization train (open circles) or by flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ (blue triangles). B. Correlation plot of exocytosis measured by TIRF-Microscopy and by membrane capacitance recording. LDCVs were either labeled by overexpretion of NPY-mRFP (open circles) or of NPY-Venus (yellow diamonds).
