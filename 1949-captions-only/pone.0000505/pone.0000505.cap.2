Correlation plot of exocytosis measured by TIRF-Microscopy and by membrane capacitance recording when secretion was either induced by a depolarization train (open circles) or by flash photolysis of caged Ca<sup>2+</sup> (blue triangles). B. Correlation plot of exocytosis measured by TIRF-Microscopy and by membrane capacitance recording. LDCVs were either labeled by overexpretion of NPY-mRFP (open circles) or of NPY-Venus (yellow diamonds).</p>
