Secretion from two exemplary cells using membrane capacitance recording (gray line, left axis) and TIRF-Microscopy (back dot, right axis). The time of secretion is given by the time at which an image was acquired (black line, bottom of the graphs). C. Average secretion of 6 cells stimulated 1 to 3 times (n = 13). The gray line represents the average membrane capacitance recording and the black line represents the average cumulative secretion visualized by TIRF-Microscopy. Error bars represent S.E.M. Both curves have been scaled so that the starting value and the end value coincide. Note that both curves overlap over the entire time course of recording.</p>
