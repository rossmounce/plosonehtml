                Figure 4.  Exocytosis at the cell footprint and on the entire cell surface was increased by a similar factor after PMA treatment.A. The cells were imaged with TIRF-Microscopy and their membrane capacitance was recorded simultaneously for 3 min. During this period secretion was stimulated twice with an interval of 2 min (top). The cells were then treated with 250 nM PMA for 2 min, washed for 2 min and were then stimulated twice. There was a strong increase in secretion as measured by both TIRF-Microscopy (middle) and by membrane capacitance change (bottom) after PMA application (right). Scale bar represents 5 Âµm. B. The correlation plot shows that exocytosis in response to both stimuli of the same recording period was similar when measured by either TIRF-Microscopy or membrane capacitance recording. A strong increase of secretion was observed upon PMA application using both measurement methods. The number of vesicles secreted at the footprint was normalized to the number of vesicles prior to fusion. Symbols are derived from the protocol above (A, top). C and D. Average membrane capacitance increase (C) and secreted vesicles measured using TIRF-Microscopy (D) upon stimulation immediately prior to and after PMA treatment. Note that exocytosis is increased (p&lt;0.005) by a similar factor at the cell footprint and in the entire cell.
