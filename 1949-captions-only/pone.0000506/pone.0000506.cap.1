Each color represents the origination period (figure inset) of the gene family inferred from phylogenetic analyses (<a href="#pone.0000506.s001">Figure S1</a>). As further evidence for orthology, domain architectures of selected gene family members were compared (<a href="#pone.0000506.s002">Figure S2</a>). NCBI accession numbers for each gene family member are provided in <a href="#pone.0000506.s007">Table S1</a>. Some gene families may have been lost from the investigated genomes and originated with an earlier ancestor than shown. Question mark indicates insufficient traces to confirm this PDZ domain.</p>
