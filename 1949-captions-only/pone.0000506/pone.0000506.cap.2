(<a href="#pone.0000506.s004">Figure S4</a>). The subset of residues painted blue represent the core union set that interact directly with the ligand in the PDZ1 co-crystal (2I1N), the PDZ2 co-crystal (2G2L), or the PDZ3 co-crystal (1BE9) by either van der Waals contacts of 3.9 Å or shorter or by hydrogen-bond lengths of 3.5 Å or shorter. (B) Ligand-binding residues are very highly conserved within a specific type of PDZ domain. Conservation of the 13 binding residues compared to the remaining 61 more distant residues for 16 types of PDZ domains from <em>Homo, Drosophila, Nematostella</em> and <em>Amphimedon</em>. These frequencies are also calculated across all those domains at once (column 1). Comparison of the conservation of binding residues versus non-binding residues; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001 (Probability associated with a Student's two-sample unequal variance t-Test).</p>
