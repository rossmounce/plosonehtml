                Figure 3.  Expression of Post-Synaptic Orthologs in Amphimedon Larvae. DLG, GKAP, GRIP, HOMER and CRIPT.All five genes (listed across the top) are expressed in the flask cells of Amphimedon larvae. (A–E) Sections of whole mount in situ hybridized larvae, with the posterior pole to the top. OL, outer epithelial- like layer; SL, subepithelial (middle) layer; ICM, inner cell mass. (F–J) Magnification of OL and SLs, with flask cells distributed in OL. (K–O) Scale bars: a–e, 100 µm; f–j, 50 µm; k–o, 10 µm.
