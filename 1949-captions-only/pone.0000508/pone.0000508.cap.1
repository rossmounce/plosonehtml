                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic distribution across land plants of included taxa and PCR success of tested loci.The cladogram indicates the major land plant lineages [34]–[35]. The lineages sampled in this study are highlighted in yellow. The success of each colored-coded primer in amplifying at least one species is indicated for each of the lineages; open white boxes indicate primer failure in all taxa tested; white boxes with an “X” indicate missing sample.
