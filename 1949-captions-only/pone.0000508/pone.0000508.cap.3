                Figure 3.  Properties of two-locus pairs tested as putative barcodes.Only those locus pairs with PCR success greater than 90% are included. Yellow bars indicate percent success in differentiating between species of a pair only; maroon bars indicate PCR success combined with the ability to differentiate between species of a pair.
