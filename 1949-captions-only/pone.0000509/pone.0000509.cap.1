                Figure 1.  Effect of rapamycin/FK506 pharmacology on caste characters in honey bees (Vehicle = 2% ethanol in insect saline; FK+R = sequential treatment of FK506, rapamycin; R = rapamycin; W = worker as comparison).In queen-destined individuals, rapamycin: a, prolonged development and b, reduced wet-weight (size) at adult emergence; c, ovary size was not affected by pharmacology but rapamycin d, induced the worker-specific trait corbicula (arrow in top panel shows location on hind leg); pictures of hind leg basitarsus covered with short hairs in Vehicle and FK+R, and by long corbicular hairs (e.g. arrows) in R and W (scale bar 0.25 mm). Corbicula is associated with low basitarsus length/width ratio [9], and in accord R individuals showed a decrease in this Basitarsal Index (BI) mean±s. e. noted in d (ANOVA: F3,21 = 21.48, P&lt;0.00001, Fisher LSD: P&lt;0.00001; vs. between Vehicle and FK+R controls and between worker-destined groups P&gt;0.50). e–g, rapamycin/FK506 pharmacology did not affect worker-destined bees. Bars are means±s. e. (asterisk P&lt;0.02, two asterisks P&lt;0.005, three asterisks P&lt;1.0 10−6).
