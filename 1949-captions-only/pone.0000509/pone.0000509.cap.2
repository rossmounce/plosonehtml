                Figure 2.  Relative quantities (RQ) of amTOR mRNA levels in honey bee larvae.In colonies a–b, queen- (Q) and worker-destined (W) larvae are characterised by a transient two-fold difference in amTOR expression (present in 3rd instar larvae, absent in spinning 5th instar larvae). In vitro c–d, RNAi was calibrated to decrease amTOR about two-fold in 3rd instar knockdowns (RNAi) vs. controls exposed to GFP derived dsRNA (GFP). Suppression was transient, as often observed with RNAi. Thereby natural expression patterns of amTOR were mimicked (a–b vs. c–d). Bars are means±s. e. (asterisk P&lt;0.01, three asterisks P&lt;1.0 10−6).
