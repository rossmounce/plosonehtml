                Figure 4.  Control experiment comparing amTOR suppression (amTOR RNAi) with vitellogenin suppression (vg RNAi).In 3rd instar larvae, vitellogenin mRNA a, was reduced by amTOR RNAi. Yet when b, vitellogenin was similarly suppressed by vg RNAi, amTOR c, remained unaffected. Thus, vg RNAi is an unconfounded control for amTOR RNAi. In comparison to vg RNAi, amTOR RNAi: d, reduced larval growth (exemplified by 5-day-old larvae, larval volume is mean±s. e., arbitrary units); and delayed development (days until adult emergence: vg RNAi, 20.14±0.14; amTOR RNAi, 24.00±0.58) – also shown in e, a snapshot of phenotypic variance (20-day-olds), which demonstrates that vg RNAi bees had emerged with queen characters or had advanced pupal pigmentation; while amTOR RNAi bees were pupae, lightly pigmented and small. f, adult size of the last vg RNAi bees to emerge (21st day) vs. TOR RNAi bees (adult wet-weight mg: vg RNAi, 197.14±7.94; amTOR RNAi 119.67±12.03). In comparison to vg RNAi, amTOR RNAi also reduced ovary size g, (range vg RNAi: 62–210; amTOR RNAi: 4–26 ovarioles/ovary, ANOVA: F1,8 = 118.92, P&lt;0.00001). These data accurately replicate our comparison of GFP controls and amTOR RNAi (Fig. 3). Bars are means±s. e. (asterisk P&lt;0.05). Scale bars d: 10 mm; e, f: 5 mm.
