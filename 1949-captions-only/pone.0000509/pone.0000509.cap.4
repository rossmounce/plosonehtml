Yet when b, <em>vitellogenin</em> was similarly suppressed by <em>vg</em> RNAi, <em>amTOR</em> c, remained unaffected. Thus, <em>vg</em> RNAi is an unconfounded control for <em>amTOR</em> RNAi. In comparison to <em>vg</em> RNAi, <em>amTOR</em> RNAi: d, reduced larval growth (exemplified by 5-day-old larvae, larval volume is mean±s. e., arbitrary units); and delayed development (days until adult emergence: <em>vg</em> RNAi, 20.14±0.14; <em>amTOR</em> RNAi, 24.00±0.58) – also shown in e, a snapshot of phenotypic variance (20-day-olds), which demonstrates that <em>vg</em> RNAi bees had emerged with queen characters or had advanced pupal pigmentation; while <em>amTOR</em> RNAi bees were pupae, lightly pigmented and small. f, adult size of the last <em>vg</em> RNAi bees to emerge (21<sup>st</sup> day) <em>vs.</em> TOR RNAi bees (adult wet-weight mg: <em>vg</em> RNAi, 197.14±7.94; <em>amTOR</em> RNAi 119.67±12.03). In comparison to <em>vg</em> RNAi, <em>amTOR</em> RNAi also reduced ovary size g, (range <em>vg</em> RNAi: 62–210; <em>amTOR</em> RNAi: 4–26 ovarioles/ovary, ANOVA: <em>F</em><sub>1,8</sub> = 118.92, <em>P</em>&lt;0.00001). These data accurately replicate our comparison of GFP controls and <em>amTOR</em> RNAi (<a href="#pone-0000509-g003">Fig. 3</a>). Bars are means±s. e. (asterisk <em>P</em>&lt;0.05). Scale bars d: 10 mm; e, f: 5 mm.</p>
