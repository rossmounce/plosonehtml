                Figure 5.  Effect of RA treatment on the specification of the maxillary and mandibular arch.(A) Pregnant B6D2F1xDlx5lacZ/+ mice received by gavage a single dose of RA or vehicle, 207 hours after coitum. Embryos were collected 2 days later and the expression of Dlx5-lacZ was revealed by Xgal staining. RA treatment induced the selective down regulation of Dlx5-lacZ expression in the 1st PA (arrow) and did not affect its expression in other territories including the other PAs, the limb apical ectodermal ridge (arrow head), the otic vesicle (ov) and the olfactory placode. A similar result was obtained when analyzing the expression of Dlx5 in normal embryos treated with RA at the same time (data not shown). (B) Transgenic mice in which the expression of lacZ is driven by the Dlx5/Dlx6 intragenic enhancer I56i, were treated with a single dose of RA or vehicle as described above. In treated embryos collected 2 days later, expression of the reporter gene was selectively lost in the 1st PA (arrow), but persisted in the brain and in the other PAs. (C) RA treatment of pregnant normal mice 207 hours after mating leads to a reduced expression of Dlx6, Dlx1, Dlx2 and of dHAND (a target of Dlx5 and 6) in the 1st PA of embryos collected at 10.5 dpc. (D) Transformation of the lower jaw induced by RA treatment. 14.5 dpc Krox20-lacZ+/âˆ’ heterozygous embryos deriving from a mothers which had received either a single gavage of RA at 207 hpc (two representative littermates are shown, RA right panels) or vehicle alone (control: left panel) were stained with Xgal to reveal the formation of vibrissae. Note the appearance of rows of vibrissae in the lower jaw (white arrow), indicating a transformation into an upper jaw territory. The number of vibrissae in the lower jaw was highly variable even between littermates.
