Embryos were collected 2 days later and the expression of <em>Dlx5-lacZ</em> was revealed by Xgal staining. RA treatment induced the selective down regulation of <em>Dlx5-lacZ</em> expression in the 1st PA (arrow) and did not affect its expression in other territories including the other PAs, the limb apical ectodermal ridge (arrow head), the otic vesicle (ov) and the olfactory placode. A similar result was obtained when analyzing the expression of <em>Dlx5</em> in normal embryos treated with RA at the same time (data not shown). <em>(B)</em> Transgenic mice in which the expression of <em>lacZ</em> is driven by the <em>Dlx5/Dlx6</em> intragenic enhancer <em>I56i</em>, were treated with a single dose of RA or vehicle as described above. In treated embryos collected 2 days later, expression of the reporter gene was selectively lost in the 1<sup>st</sup> PA (arrow), but persisted in the brain and in the other PAs. <em>(C)</em> RA treatment of pregnant normal mice 207 hours after mating leads to a reduced expression of <em>Dlx6, Dlx1, Dlx2</em> and of <em>dHAND</em> (a target of Dlx5 and 6) in the 1<sup>st</sup> PA of embryos collected at 10.5 dpc. <em>(D)</em> Transformation of the lower jaw induced by RA treatment. 14.5 dpc <em>Krox20-lacZ<sup>+/âˆ’</sup></em> heterozygous embryos deriving from a mothers which had received either a single gavage of RA at 207 hpc (two representative littermates are shown, RA right panels) or vehicle alone (control: left panel) were stained with Xgal to reveal the formation of vibrissae. Note the appearance of rows of vibrissae in the lower jaw (white arrow), indicating a transformation into an upper jaw territory. The number of vibrissae in the lower jaw was highly variable even between littermates.</p>
