                Figure 6.  Reduction of the territories of expression of Fgf8 and ET1 induced by RA treatment in the 1st PA.In situ hybridization with an Fgf8 and an ET1 probe on the head region of normal embryos collected 4h after treating the mother with vehicle or RA at 207 hpc. Note that the territory of expression of both genes in the signalling territory of the epithelium of the 1st PA (black arrow) is strongly reduced, while the level of expression of Fgf8 in the isthmus (is) was not significantly affected by RA treatment.
