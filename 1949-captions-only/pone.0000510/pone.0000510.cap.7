                Figure 7.  Summary diagram of the effects of RA on derivatives of the 1st PA.(A) RA treatment (right side) inhibits both Fgf8 (blue) and ET1 (green) signalling from the 1st PA epithelium and gradually prevents the activation of Dlx1/Dlx2 (yellow) and Dlx5/Dlx6 (red) in the CNCC-derived ectomesenchyme. This results in phenotypic combinations of altered characters reminiscent of those present in the Dlx1/2 and Dlx5/6 double mutants. (B) Summary diagram of the effects of RA-treatment during jaw development.
