After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and Dil-AcLDL uptake measured by flow cytometry. <em>B</em>, db/+and db/db mice were administered 5 µg/mL of bodipy-cholesteryl ester by IP injection. After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry. <em>C</em>, bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E) or carrier (Con) were administered as in A for 4 h. PerMΦs cholesteryl ester uptake was examined using fluorescent microscopy. Results are representative of three independent experiments. <em>D</em>, PerMΦs were collected from db/+and db/db mice and cultured for 30 min ex vivo. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/mL bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E.) and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry at 4 h. Results for A, B and D represent the average of three independent experiments±SEM. *: p&lt;0.05.</p>
