                Figure 2.  Phagocytosis and fluid-phase endocytosis are not increased in PerMΦs from db/db mice.A, Db/+and db/db mice were IP administered 0.21 or 2.6 µm latex microspheres (beads) at 5×109 or 5×107 beads/ml, respectively. Following a 4 h in vivo incubation period, PerMΦs were collected and microsphere uptake was measured by flow cytometry. B, Db/+and db/db mice were IP administered 0.25 mg/ml FITC-dextran. Following a 4 h in vivo incubation period, PerMΦs were collected and dextran uptake was measured by flow cytometry. Results for A and B represent the average of three independent experiments±SEM.
