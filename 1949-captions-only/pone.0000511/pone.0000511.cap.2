Following a 4 h <em>in vivo</em> incubation period, PerMΦs were collected and microsphere uptake was measured by flow cytometry. <em>B, Db</em>/+and <em>db/db</em> mice were IP administered 0.25 mg/ml FITC-dextran. Following a 4 h <em>in vivo</em> incubation period, PerMΦs were collected and dextran uptake was measured by flow cytometry. Results for <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> represent the average of three independent experiments±SEM.</p>
