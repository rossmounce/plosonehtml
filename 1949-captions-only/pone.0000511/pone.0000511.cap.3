Cells were then incubated on ice for 15 m with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/ml Dil-AcLDL and uptake measured by flow cytometry at 4 h. <em>B,</em> PerMΦs were collected from <em>db/db</em> mice and cultured for 30 min ex vivo. Cells were then incubated on ice for 15 m with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/ml Dil-AcLDL and uptake measured by flow cytometry at 4 h. <em>C, Db</em>/+mice were IP administered 5 µg/ml bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E.) with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry. <em>D, Db/db</em> mice were IP adminsitered 5 µg/ml bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E.) with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry. <em>E</em>, PerMΦs were collected from <em>db</em>/+and <em>db/db</em> mice. CD36 and SR-A surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. Results for <em>A-E</em> represent the average of three independent experiments±SEM. *: p&lt;0.05</p>
