                Figure 3.  CD36 and SR-A mediate increased AcLDL and cholesteryl ester uptake in diabetic PerMΦs.A, PerMΦs were collected from db/+mice and cultured for 30 min ex vivo. Cells were then incubated on ice for 15 m with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/ml Dil-AcLDL and uptake measured by flow cytometry at 4 h. B, PerMΦs were collected from db/db mice and cultured for 30 min ex vivo. Cells were then incubated on ice for 15 m with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/ml Dil-AcLDL and uptake measured by flow cytometry at 4 h. C, Db/+mice were IP administered 5 µg/ml bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E.) with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry. D, Db/db mice were IP adminsitered 5 µg/ml bodipy-cholesteryl ester (C.E.) with CD36, SR-A blocking antibodies (Ab) or isotype control antibodies (Iso) as indicated. After 4 h, PerMΦs were collected and cholesteryl ester uptake measured by flow cytometry. E, PerMΦs were collected from db/+and db/db mice. CD36 and SR-A surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. Results for A-E represent the average of three independent experiments±SEM. *: p&lt;0.05
