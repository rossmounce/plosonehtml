                Figure 2.  Example of mimetope identification.(a) Partial sequence alignment coming from the output file of the BLASTP algorithm analysis between the exposed-protein database from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the non-redundant protein database. A putative linear B-cell epitope is highlighted. (b) Partial sequence alignment coming from the output file of the BLASTP algorithm analysis between the exposed-protein database from Chlamydia pneumoniae and the non-redundant protein database. A putative linear B-cell epitope is highlighted.
