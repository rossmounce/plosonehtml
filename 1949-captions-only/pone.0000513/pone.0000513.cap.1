                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the experimental design.After the intranigral microinjections of saline or MPTP, the rats were distributed for sleep-wake cycle recording (n = 8/group), midbrain TH immunohistochemical examination (n = 5) and nigral TH protein expression study (n = 5). Histological and western blotting experiments used animals that had their brains collected along the 5 days of recording (n = 5/day/group) at the same hour they were lesioned, according to the time-points schedule.
