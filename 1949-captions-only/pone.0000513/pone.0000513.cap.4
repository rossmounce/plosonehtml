                Figure 4.  Nigral disruption promoted an increase in the sleep efficiency during the first four days of recording.SNpc dopaminergic neuronal loss promoted a sustained increase in the percentage of sleep efficiency on the first 3 days of the sleep-wake recording, in both light and dark periods. On the fourth day, the increase in this parameter occurred only in the dark period. The values are expressed as meanÂ±S.E.M. **p&lt;0.05 compared to baseline, #p&lt;0.05 compared to the respective sham group, ANOVA followed by the Tukey test.
