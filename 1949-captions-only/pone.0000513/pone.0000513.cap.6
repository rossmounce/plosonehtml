In contrast, the percentage of REM sleep significantly rose on the fourth day, probably as a compensatory rebound mechanism. The values are expressed as mean±S.E.M. *p&lt;0.05 compared to those of baseline, <sup>#</sup>p&lt;0.05 compared to the respective sham group, <sup>ψ</sup>p&lt;0.0007 compared to the MPTP group day 1.
