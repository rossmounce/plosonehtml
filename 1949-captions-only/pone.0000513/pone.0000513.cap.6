                Figure 6.  SNpc neurons are fundamental in the generation of REM sleep.The percentage of REM sleep, of the MPTP group, was reduced on the first three days of recording, in both light and dark periods. In contrast, the percentage of REM sleep significantly rose on the fourth day, probably as a compensatory rebound mechanism. The values are expressed as mean±S.E.M. *p&lt;0.05 compared to those of baseline, #p&lt;0.05 compared to the respective sham group, ψp&lt;0.0007 compared to the MPTP group day 1. ANOVA followed by the Tukey test.
