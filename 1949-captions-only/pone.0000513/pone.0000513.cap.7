A standard curve was generated from densitometric values obtained from computer analysis of digitized film from immunoblot. A linear relationship between optical density and the amount of protein was observed with a strong correlation. (b) TH protein expression was significantly decreased in the MPTP group in comparison to the sham on the first day after the microinjection. Two days after MPTP, TH presented an expression of 98% in comparison to the sham group, on the respective day. A similar situation was observed for the subsequent time-points analyzed. The values are expressed as meanÂ±S.E.M. *p&lt;0.05 compared to those of baseline. ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls test.</p>
