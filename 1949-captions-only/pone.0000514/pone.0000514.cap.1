                Figure 1.  Complete amino acid sequence for L. hesperus major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp1).The sequence is read from left to right and then top to bottom. The diamond marks the start position and the asterisk denotes the stop position. The protein is dominated by poly-A (red) and GGX (green) motifs. The majority of the sequence can be categorized into four types of ensemble repeat units. Repeats of each type are aligned within a box. Gaps (-) have been inserted in order to align repeat units within a type.
