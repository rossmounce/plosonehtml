                Figure 2.  Complete amino acid sequence for L. hesperus major ampullate spidroin 2 (MaSp2).The sequence is read from left to right and then top to bottom. Start position, stop position, and alignment gaps are indicated as for MaSp1 (Figure 1). MaSp2 is characterized by poly-A (red), GGX (green), GPX (blue), and QQ (purple) motifs. There are four types of ensemble repeats. Repeats of each type are aligned within a box, except for Type 1, which is separated into two boxes because it is approximately twice as prevalent as any other repeat type. Right and left pointing arrows mark beginnings and ends of two near-perfect repeats of 778 aa.
