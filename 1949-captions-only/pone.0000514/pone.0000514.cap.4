                Figure 4.  Comparison of N-termini, C-termini and repeat units of spider silk proteins.(A) Alignment of published N-terminal amino acid sequences. Amino acids shared by ≥50% of proteins are highlighted in grey. Gaps are represented by dashes and missing characters by question marks. (B) Alignment of corresponding C-terminal amino acid sequences. Taxa with an asterisk result from partial sequencing and are presumed to belong to the same locus as the N-terminal sequences. (C) MP trees of N and C-terminal encoding sequences treating gaps as a fifth state and employing midpoint rooting. Left tree length = 1449 (N-terminus); Right tree length = 838 (C-terminus). Dots represent nodes with &gt;75% bootstrap support in all MP and ML analyses and &gt;95% Bayesian posterior probability. (D) Exemplar repeat units for each of the major ampullate fibroins and representative TuSp1 and Flag repeats. Amino acid motifs are colored as in Figure 2.
