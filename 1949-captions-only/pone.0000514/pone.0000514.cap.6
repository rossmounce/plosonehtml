Peak height corresponds to level of identity between the two clones. Regions exceeding 70% conservation over a window length of 100 bp are colored (blue for exons, red for non-coding sequence). The red peak corresponds to a putative transposable element found in both clones. Arrows mark open reading frames (ORFs) on the clone containing <em>MaSp1</em>.</p>
