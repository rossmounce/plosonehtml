                Figure 6.  Global AVID alignment of L. hesperus genomic clones containing MaSp1 and MaSp2 visualized with VISTA.The MaSp1-containing clone was used as the reference sequence. Peak height corresponds to level of identity between the two clones. Regions exceeding 70% conservation over a window length of 100 bp are colored (blue for exons, red for non-coding sequence). The red peak corresponds to a putative transposable element found in both clones. Arrows mark open reading frames (ORFs) on the clone containing MaSp1.
