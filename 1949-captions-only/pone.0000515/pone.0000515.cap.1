                Figure 1.  Action and sequence of the conopeptide NMB-1.(A) Inhibition of an MA current by 1 µM NMB-1. (B) Primary sequence of NMB-1 showing disulfide bridges. (C) Conopeptides closely related to NMB-1. Shown are ρ-TIA (from Conus tulipa), with differences from NMB-1 indicated, and the α-conopeptides, α-GI (Conus geographus) and α-PnIB (Conus pennaceus).
