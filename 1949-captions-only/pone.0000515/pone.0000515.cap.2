                Figure 2.  NMB-1 has 30-fold selectivity for ion channels underlying SA currents over those mediating RA currents.(A) Upper. Example traces showing the action of 1 µM NMB-1 on RA (left), IA (center) and SA (right) currents; control responses are in gray and currents in NMB-1 are in black. NMB-1 had no effect on RA currents but had significant inhibitory effects on IA and SA currents. Lower, Subtraction of traces recorded in 1 µM NMB-1 from control traces shows that NMB-1 selectively inhibits a persistent component of the response at this concentration. (B) The rate at which blockade by NMB-1 develops is independent of stimulation frequency (i.e. channel open time). 1 µM NMB-1 was applied to 3 neurons that were stimulated at 12 and 24 sec intervals; the association constants were 2.50×104 M−1s−1 and 2.47×104 M−1s−1, respectively. (C) The rate at which blockade by NMB-1 is relieved following drug removal is also independent of stimulation frequency. For 1 µM NMB-1 (n = 3) the disassociation constants were 0.034 s−1 (12 sec) and 0.029 s−1 (24 sec). (D) Example traces showing the effect of 30 µM on a RA current (top) and the blocked current (from subtraction, bottom). (E) Summary of inhibition of RA currents by 15 µM and 30 µM NMB-1 (n = 4); currents were inhibited by 25.9±6.3% and 46.8±9.5%, respectively.
