Example traces showing the action of 1 µM NMB-1 on RA (<em>left</em>), IA (<em>center</em>) and SA (<em>right</em>) currents; control responses are in <em>gray</em> and currents in NMB-1 are in <em>black</em>. NMB-1 had no effect on RA currents but had significant inhibitory effects on IA and SA currents. <em>Lower</em>, Subtraction of traces recorded in 1 µM NMB-1 from control traces shows that NMB-1 selectively inhibits a persistent component of the response at this concentration. (B) The rate at which blockade by NMB-1 develops is independent of stimulation frequency (i.e. channel open time). 1 µM NMB-1 was applied to 3 neurons that were stimulated at 12 and 24 sec intervals; the association constants were 2.50×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 2.47×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. (C) The rate at which blockade by NMB-1 is relieved following drug removal is also independent of stimulation frequency. For 1 µM NMB-1 (n = 3) the disassociation constants were 0.034 s<sup>−1</sup> (12 sec) and 0.029 s<sup>−1</sup> (24 sec). (D) Example traces showing the effect of 30 µM on a RA current (<em>top</em>) and the blocked current (from subtraction, <em>bottom</em>). (E) Summary of inhibition of RA currents by 15 µM and 30 µM NMB-1 (n = 4); currents were inhibited by 25.9±6.3% and 46.8±9.5%, respectively.</p>
