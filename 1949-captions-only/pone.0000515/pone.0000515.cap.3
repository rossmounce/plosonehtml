The derived IC<sub>50</sub> was 1.0 µM and the Hill-coefficient was 1.4. (B) Example traces of currents in each concentration of NMB-1 (<em>left</em>, as indicated) and the derived blocked current for each concentration (<em>right</em>, as indicated). (C) Current-voltage relationship for currents in control conditions (•) and in the presence of 2 µM NMB-1 (○); all values are normalized to charge transfer in control solutions at −70 mV (n = 3, mechanical stimuli applied for 100 msec). (D) Data from <em>C</em> shown as the relationship between fractional blockade by 2 µM NMB-1 and membrane potential; block declines linearly as the membrane is depolarized from −70 mV.</p>
