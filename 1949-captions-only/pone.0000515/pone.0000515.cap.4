Each connected pair of symbols on the graph represents a single neuron. The symbol on either end indicates the peak current amplitude and the level of inhibition of charge transfer by 1 µM NMB-1; the left-hand symbol represents the response to a 9 µm stimulus and the right-hand one the response to 12 µm. Capsaicin-sensitive neurons are represented by black symbols and solid lines, whereas capsaicin-insensitive neurons are shown by white symbols with dotted lines. SA currents are indicated by circles, and squares represent RA currents. The results show the heterogeneity of currents and the different ratios of NMB-1 sensitive and insensitive ion channels in each cell; NMB-1 has a greater inhibitory effect at the larger stimulus intensity and is most active in capsaicin-sensitive neurons and neurons with SA currents. In capsaicin-insensitive neurons with RA currents 2/5 are NMB-1 sensitive and only at a 12 µm stimulus. Only neurons with currents &gt;250 pA were selected for these experiments. (B). Example traces of currents (Grey = control, black = 1 µM NMB-1) activated by 9 µm (<em>left</em>) and 12 µm (<em>right</em>) stimuli in a capsaicin sensitive neuron (<em>top</em>), a neuron with a SA current (<em>middle</em>) and a capsaicin insensitive neuron with a RA current (<em>bottom</em>). (C) Expanded view of a family of currents evoked by ascending mechanical steps showing that currents activate at a specific membrane displacement and how this allows extrapolation of the threshold of activation. (D) Graph shows the average activation thresholds for capsaicin insensitive neurons with RA currents (2.7±0.3 µm, n = 31) that were lower than those of neurons with SA currents (5.0±0.3 µm, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001, n = 9) and capsaicin sensitive neurons (5.4±0.4 µm, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001, n = 32). (E) Schematic of ion channel distribution across subpopulations of DRG neurons. Each color represents a functional class of neurons and indicated are the MS channel types expressed by that class.</p>
