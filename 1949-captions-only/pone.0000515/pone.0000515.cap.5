                Figure 5.  The stretch-activated channel blocker GsMTx-4 does not block mechanically activated currents in DRG neurons.(A) Example traces of SA (top) and RA (bottom) mechanically activated currents. Shown are the effects of GsMTx-4 (1 µM, red) and for comparison, NMB-1 (1 µM, blue). Scale bars: horizontal, 50 msec, vertical, 0.5 nA. GsMTx-4 did not significantly alter either the peak current amplitude (B) or the charge transfer (C) through DRG channels.
