                Figure 6.  Biotinylated NMB-1 binds to peripherin-positive DRG neurons.Primary cultures of DRG neurons were stained with biotinylated NMB-1 and streptavidin linked to Cy3. (A,C) or alkaline phosphatase (D). Counter-staining with a monoclonal antibody to peripherin (B) shows in merged figure (C) that nearly all NMB-1 binding neurons express peripherin. Large diameter sensory neurons (E) were negative for NMB-1 binding. No signal was visible when NMB-1 was omitted from the staining procedure.
