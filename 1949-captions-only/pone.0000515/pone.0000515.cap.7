OHCs are clearly visible by their V-shaped sensory hair bundles. IHCs are out of focus in this view but their position is indicated for reference. FM1-43 was applied by local pipette perfusion for 10 seconds (two times). The confocal fluorescence images shown are subtracted images showing the change in FM1-43 derived fluorescence at the end of the 2×10 second applications. In the presence of 5 µM NMB-1 there is minimal FM1-43 loading. After washout FM1-43 loading recovers. (B) Time course data showing the loading of FM1-43 measure in a single outer hair cell as a function of time during the two 10 second applications. In the presence of 5 µM NMB-1 FM1-43 loading is blocked. (C) Pooled data showing the changes in FM1-43 fluorescence after 2×10 second applications from 4 different cultures (samples are averages from the same 3 cells in each experiment) for control, NMB-1 and subsequent recovery after wash out. Mechanotransduction-dependent loading of FM1-43 is blocked by 5 µM in both OHCs and IHCs.</p>
