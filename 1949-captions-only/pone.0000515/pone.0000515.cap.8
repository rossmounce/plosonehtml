Neither NMB-1 (20 nMoles, n = 8) nor its vehicle (0.1% BSA in external solution, n = 8) had an effect on PWT. (B) NMB-1 (2×20 nMoles, n = 8, Student's unpaired t-test versus vehicle effect, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001) increased the threshold for evoking pain behaviors in rat hind paw by 41.1±7.3% in the Randall-Selitto test. Injection of 0.1% BSA solution had no behavioral effects (n = 8). (C) NMB-1 had no effect on withdrawal latencies in the Hargreaves' test for thermal sensitivity; after injection of 20 nMoles of NMB-1 latencies were 107.5±16.6% of pre-injection control values (n = 6 in each group, Student's paired test; <em>P</em>&gt;0.8; Student's unpaired t-test versus vehicle effect, <em>P</em>&gt;0.4).</p>
