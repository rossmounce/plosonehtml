                Figure 1.  Cumulative GI data when 2.7Ã—104 CFU/vial of MAP ATCC 19698 was inoculated into each Bactec vial.Each drug dilution was studied in duplicate. Error bars are SD. The positive control is methotrexate, with maximal inhibition by 8 mg/ml. Neither the negative control sulfasalazine, nor sulfapyridine, have any inhibition. Both and 5-ASA alone and in combination with sulfapyridine have dose dependent inhibition.
