For MAP ATCC 19698, 6×10<sup>4</sup> CFU's were inoculated/vial. Sulfasalazine is the negative control for both MAP and <em>M. avium</em> strains. In all strains there is dose dependent increase in cGI. There is no inhibition by sulfapyridine alone with either MAP strain. 5-ASA has dose dependent inhibition on both MAP strains. Note the subtle synergy up to 16 µg/ml for both MAP strains for the 5-ASA+sulfapyridine group compared to 5-ASA alone. The positive control in the Dominic study was clarithromycin which, because it was diluted in methanol, is off scale. Accordingly, the clarithromycin data are not presented.</p>
