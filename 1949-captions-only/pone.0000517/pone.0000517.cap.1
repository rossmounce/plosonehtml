The codon:anticodon mini-helix in the decoding center is stabilized by base-pairing at all three positions of the mini-helix favoring A-minor interactions with flipped out bases G520, A1492 and A1493. PyMol (Delano Scientific, LLC) was used to generate this figure based on the coordinates 1IBM in the RSCN Protein Data Bank <a href="#pone.0000517-Ogle3">[40]</a>. Panel B. In all missense reporters, transcription is initiated from the yeast <em>ADH1</em> promoter, and terminated at a sequence from the <em>CYC1</em> 3â€² UTR. The luciferase genes from <em>Renilla</em> and firefly are cloned in frame to produce a fusion of the two proteins. The sense reporter has the AGA codon encoding arginine at amino acid residue 218 in the catalytic site of firefly luciferase. Missense reporters contain the indicated mutations at this position, which encode the indicated amino acids. Efficiencies of missense suppression were calculated by dividing the ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase generated from cells harboring the missense test vectors by the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase generated from cells harboring the sense control plasmid.</p>
