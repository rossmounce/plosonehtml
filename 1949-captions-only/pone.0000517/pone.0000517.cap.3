                Figure 3.  Effects of the eEF1 complex mutants on mis-reading of near- and non-cognate codons.Misreading of the non-cognate UCU and near-cognate AGC codons by mutant forms of eEF1A (Panel A), or by isogenic strains with tef3Δ, tef4Δ, or tef3Δ tef4Δ double null mutants or tef5Δ strains expressing the K120R S121Δ I122Δ allele compared to isogenic wild-type strain (Panel B). Panel C. Misreading of all seven missense codons by cells lacking both forms of eEF1Bγ (tef3Δ tef4Δ). Effects of the indicated mutants are depicted as fold of isogenic wild-type cells. ** indicates p values of &lt;0.01; * indicates p values of &lt;0.05.
