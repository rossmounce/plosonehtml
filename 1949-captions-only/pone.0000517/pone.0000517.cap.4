                Figure 4.  Characterization of alleles of RPL5.Panel A. Effects of the K27E rpl5 mutanton misreading of seven missense codons. Effects on the indicated missense reporters are depicted as fold of isogenic wild-type cells. ** indicates p values of &lt;0.01. Panel B. Paromomycin dilution spot assays. Ten-fold dilutions (106→101 CFU) of logarithmically growing cells were arrayed onto H-leu medium containing paromomycin (1 mg/ml) or no drug control plates. Cells were grown at 25°C for 3 days.
