Effects of the K27E rpl5 mutanton misreading of seven missense codons. Effects on the indicated missense reporters are depicted as fold of isogenic wild-type cells. ** indicates p values of &lt;0.01. Panel B. Paromomycin dilution spot assays. Ten-fold dilutions (10<sup>6</sup>→10<sup>1</sup> CFU) of logarithmically growing cells were arrayed onto H-leu medium containing paromomycin (1 mg/ml) or no drug control plates. Cells were grown at 25°C for 3 days.</p>
