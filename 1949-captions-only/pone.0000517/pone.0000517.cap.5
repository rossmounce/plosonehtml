                Figure 5.  Modeling of mutations in eEF1A and eEF1Bα that influence influence misincorporation of missense aa-tRNAs.The nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Bα and the fitted aa-tRNA present clashes indicating that they do not interact with eEF1A simultaneously. PyMOL (Delano Scientific, LLC) was used with the coordinates 1G7C of yeast eEF1A:eEF1Bα (amino acids 114–206) in complex with GDPNP [50]. The ribbon structure of eEF1A is shown in blue, eEF1A mutated bases are shown in cyan, and GDPNP is indicated in magenta. Panel A. tRNA (yellow) was fitted into the structure based on coordinates obtained from the crystal structure of the EF-Tu:Phe-tRNAPhe:GCPNP complex (1TTT in the RSCN Protein Data Bank, [51]. Panel B. Ribbon structure of eEF1Bα from 1G7C is shown in red, and the KSI residues in the mutant form used in this study are indicated in salmon.
