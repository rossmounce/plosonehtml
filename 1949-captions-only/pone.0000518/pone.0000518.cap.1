Each panel contains lung RNA as an internal standard. Top panel was hybridized with <em>MICA</em> cDNA. The differential transcript length of <em>MICA</em> and <em>MICB</em> is due to a previously documented larger 3′UT in <em>MICB</em> mRNA <a href="#pone.0000518-Bahram4">[50]</a>. The middle panel depicts the expression of <em>β<sub>2</sub>m</em>, indicative of the β<sub>2</sub>m bound conventional MHC-I expression. Finally the <em>β-actin</em> transcription acts as a loading control. For more detailed explanation see main text.</p>
