The variability in SS patients is due to 2 individuals whom represent an unusually high ratio (see main text for explanation). None of the differences is significant as assessed by the Wilcoxon text: p = 0.1658 for controls vs. RA; p = 0.9547 for controls vs. SLE and p = 0.5012 for controls vs. SS.</p>
