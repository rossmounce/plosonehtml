                Figure 2.  Sequence alignment of mouse and human p66Î± proteins.Identical residues are indicated by a *. The coiled-coil (CR1) and GATA type zinc finger (CR2) regions are underlined. The arrows indicate the positions of the boundaries of Exons 2 and 4, which are eliminated after gene targeting. The truncated protein consists of the region upstream from the first arrow, followed by 34 frameshifted amino acids.
