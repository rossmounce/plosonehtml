B: wild type mp66α genomic region. C: mutant mp66α genomic region. D: mutant mp66α with pgkneo cassette removed. Gray rectangles are exons. Heavy black lines at top indicate location of homologous arms. 5 and 6 are primers N-6 and 2-36 respectively. They were used to screen targeted clones by long range PCR for homologous recombination. The expected band size was 2069 nt. Labeled restriction sites and external probes 9 and 11 were used to confirm correct targeting and for some genotyping. 1–4 are primers used for PCR genotyping after recombination was shown to be correct by Southern blot genotyping. Short Arm: Probe 11 Long Arm: Probe 9 NcoI WT = 2335 bp Spe I, Sac I WT = 8724 bp NcoI mutant = 2799 bp Spe I, Sac I mutant = 7633 bp</p>
