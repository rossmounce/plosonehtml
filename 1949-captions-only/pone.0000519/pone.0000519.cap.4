                Figure 4.  Confirmation of correct targeting by molecular hybridization.A: Southern blot of SpeI, SacI digested clones hybridized with probe 9. The long homologous arm is correctly integrated in clones numbered 26, 88,104 as indicated by the 7.6 kb fragment. B: Southern blot of Nco I digested clones hybridized with probe 11. The short homologous arm is integrated correctly in clones numbered 329 and 88, as indicated by the 2.8 kb fragment. C. Northern blot of RNA in +/− and −/− ES cells. mp66α RNA is normal in the +/− clone but aberrant in the −/− clone. GAPDH is the loading control. D, E. Pups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are heterozygous for the correctly integrated mutant alleles as shown for both the long arm (D) and the short arm (E). These pups were the founders for two independently targeted lines, line 26 and line 110.
