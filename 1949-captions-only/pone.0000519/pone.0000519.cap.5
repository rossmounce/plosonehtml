                Figure 5.  Mutant embryos.Embryonic Day 9.5 and 10.5 mp66α −/− Embryos. Mutant embryos, significantly smaller, are shown in comparison with wild-type littermates. Abnormalities in mp66α null embryos around day 9.5 (A, B) include malformed and non-fused neural folds, failure of closure of anterior neuropore, missing or excessively large blood vessels in the yolk sac, Day 10.5 embryos (C,D) are disintegrating due to multiple defects.
