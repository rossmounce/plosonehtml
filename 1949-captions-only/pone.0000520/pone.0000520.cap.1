The number of potential candidates with SXL binding sites remaining after each step is indicated. (+3) represents that the three known targets of SXL (<em>Sxl, tra, msl2</em>) were also identified. (B) Schematics of how the search program works. Overlapping nucleotide windows are scanned for sequences that match the consensus-binding site. When a binding site is identified, the search program determines whether it is within 100 nucleotides of a splice site, whether it is in the sense orientation, and whether there is evidence of alternative splicing for that site.</p>
