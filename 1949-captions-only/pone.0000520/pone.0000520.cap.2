                Figure 2.  Screening for sex-specific isoforms.(A) Seven candidates show sex-specific mRNA isoforms by Northern analysis on poly(A)+ RNA from adult flies. Asterisks indicate sex-specific isoforms. XY and XX indicate chromosomal sex. (B) (Top) Several candidates (bancal, Bap60, ImpL3, inx7, Moe, Rala, Ric, Top2, Frq2, Cyp28a5, RpL36, and Dhc16F)a were present at equal levels in both sexes. (Bottom) Several others (fus, pUf68, CG8370, katanin-60, vap, CG2967, CG5455, and aralar1)b showed no hybridization in adult flies.
