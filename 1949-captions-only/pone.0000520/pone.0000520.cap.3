                Figure 3.  Schematics of the relevant portion of the potential SXL targets (A) and known SXL targets (B).Boxes, exons; horizontal lines, introns; solid and dotted lines, alternative splicing pathways; asterisks, potential SXL-binding sites. The SXL-binding sites identified are: CG3630 (UUUUUCUUGUUUUUUUU), CG6422 (UUUUUGUUUUUUUUUU), CG11737 (UUUUUGUUGUUUUUUUUUUU), Rm62 (UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, UUUGUUGUUUUUUUCUUUGUGUUUG, and UUUUUUUU), Act5c (GUGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU), blow (UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGUUU), and e(r) (UUUUUUUUUUGUCUUUUUUUUUUUU and UGUGUGUGUUUUUGUGUGUUUCAAUGUUUUUUUGUG).
