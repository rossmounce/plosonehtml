                Figure 4.  The sex-specific transcripts of CG11737 and blow are downstream of dsx in the soma.A. The sex-specific transcripts of CG11737 and blow are somatic in origin, and the sex-specific transcript of Rm62 is restricted to the germline. CG11737 and blow show no changes in expression pattern in the progeny of tud mothers (lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2), while the female-specific transcript of Rm62 is lost (lane 4 versus lane 2). B. The sex-specific transcripts of CG11737 and blow are downstream of Sxl in the soma. Loss of Sxl in XX flies causes a switch to the male expression pattern (lane 3). C. The sex-specific transcripts of CG11737 and blow are downstream of tra and dsx in the soma. Loss of tra (lane 4) or dsx (lane 10) in XX flies causes a switch to the male expression pattern.
