                Figure 5.  Germline SXL is necessary for expression of the female-specific Rm62 transcript.A. XX flies homozygous for the snf1621 or snf148 alleles, which disrupt SXL function specifically in the germline, do not express the female-specific Rm62 transcript (lanes 1 and 3). Expression of a Sxl cDNA in snf mutant backgrounds under the control of the otu promoter restores the synthesis of the female-specific Rm62 transcript (lanes 2 and 4). B. XX flies homozygous for the Sxlf4 or Sxlf5 alleles show a loss of the female-specific Rm62 transcript (lanes 3 and 4). C. The female-specific Rm62 transcript is maternally deposited, and is present only in mature ovaries.
