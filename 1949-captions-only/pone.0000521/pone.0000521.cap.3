The main axis displays 43.48% and 14.93% of the total variance. K-means groups are represented with polygons surrounding individuals belonging to the rootstock group (dashed line) or <em>V. vinifera</em> ssp. <em>silvestris</em> group (entire line). Bayesian probabilities are represented with pie charts. The white part of the pie represents the probability to belong to the rootstock group, while the grey part the <em>V. vinifera</em> ssp. <em>silvestris</em> group. Six common cultivated rootstocks were included in the analysis (Asia1–<em>V. amurensis</em>, US1–SO4 cl 5, US2-Rupestris du lot cl 110, US3-Riparia gloire cl 1, US4-Richter 110 cl 7, US5–<em>V. aestivalis</em>). Hybrids between both groups are clearly absent. Moreover, none of the 23 naturalized rootstocks collected were a true-to-type clone of the cultivated rootstocks included in the analysis.</p>
