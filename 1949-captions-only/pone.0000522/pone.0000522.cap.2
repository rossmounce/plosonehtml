                Figure 2.  Phylogeny of Acilius based on 1693 characters.Posterior probability of the topology = 0.85, from Bayesian analysis. Treelength = 793 steps from parsimony search (single best cladogram). Values below branches are clade support values (posterior probabilities). Values above branches are optimized continuous valued characters of male suction cups (S1–S4: see fig. 4D); (S1 as a fraction of S3/S4 in µm above, number of S4 cups below). Colours on branches are optimized female condition; green = non-setose, blue = with setose furrows. Visualization of the major character transformation events 1–4 [in red] see fig 3.
