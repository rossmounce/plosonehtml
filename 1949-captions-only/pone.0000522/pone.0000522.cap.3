                Figure 3.  Major coevolutionary events in the intersexual arms race of Acilius.Top row: close-up of female cover wings, bottom row: male front foot with suction cups. 1: The ancestor of Acilius evolved a back with dense and large punctures accompanied in males by large cup size differentiation into three large and multiple smaller cups. 2: Females evolve setose furrows, males further differentiate their suction cups, one very large, two medium sized and radically increasing the number of minute cups. 3: The last transformation reverse in both sexes supporting the theory that arms races can both escalate and de-escalate [43]. 4: The female, but not male, condition also reverses in the recent species A. kishii.
