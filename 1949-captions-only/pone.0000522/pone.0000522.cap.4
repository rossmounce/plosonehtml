                Figure 4.  A possible example of recent allopatric speciation driven by sexual conflict [3].A: The distribution of A. japonicus and A. kishii in Japan [31]. • = specimens examined and ▪ = literature records of A. japonicus, ★ = A. kishii. B: ♀ of A. japonicus. C: ♀ of A. kishii. D: ♂ front foot of A. kishii indicating the labelling of suction cups S1–S4. E: ♂ frontfoot of A. japonicus. The sibling species pair A.kishii and A. japonicus are endemic to Japan, with A. kishii occurring in a single mountain lake in Fukui prefecture, just south of A. japonicus range. They differ morphologically only in secondary sexual characters involved in the arms race, in particular the loss in A. kishii of setose furrows in the female.
