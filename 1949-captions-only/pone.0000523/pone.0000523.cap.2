T-, B- and dendritic cells were investigated by flow cytometry using antibodies to CD3, B220 and CD11c. (C) Relative proportion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was analyzed using Ly-6G antibody. (D) M cells number inside the follicle associated with epithelium was investigated by immuno-histochemistry. Arrows indicated the presence of M-cell inside the follicle associated with epithelium. Data represent the means±SEM of 8 mice per group. **P&lt;0.01.</p>
