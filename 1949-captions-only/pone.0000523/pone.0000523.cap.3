                Figure 3.  Nod2 and T-cells subset in PP and spleen from mice at 12 weeks of age.Relative proportion of CD4+, CD8+ and CD4−CD8− T-cells from PPs (A) and spleen (B) of KO (▪) and WT (□) mice. At week 12, CD3+ T-cells were stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD8. Data were gated for CD3+ T-cells. Data represent the means±SEM of 8 mice per group. *P&lt;0.05.
