                Figure 5.  Paracellular permeability and bacterial translocation are increased in Nod2 invalidated mice.Ussing-chamber and Real-time PCR experiments were performed on PP and PP-free ileum from WT (□) and KO (▪) at week 12. (A) Paracellular permeability was analysed by FITC-dextran flux from PP and PP-free ileum under basal condition. (B) mRNA expression levels of TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2 and Occ) from PP were analysed by real-Time-PCR under basal condition. (C) Bacterial translocation of chemically killed fluorescent Escherichia Coli K-12. (D) Translocation of the viable non enteropathogen Escherichia Coli strain J53. (E) Translocation of a chemically killed fluorescent Staphylococcus Aureus. (F) Translocation of chemically killed fluorescein-conjugated Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Data represent the means±SEM of 8 mice per group. *P&lt;0.05 and **P&lt;0.01, significantly different from WT.
