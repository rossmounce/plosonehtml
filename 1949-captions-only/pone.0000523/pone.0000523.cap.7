The restriction maps of the <em>Card15/Nod2</em>+allele (5â€² portion), the <em>Card15/Nod2</em> KO targeting fragment, and the modified <em>Card15/Nod2</em> allele after homologous recombination and Cre-mediated recombination of an Hygromycin selection cassette are shown. Exons 1, 2, and 3 (black boxes) and restriction sites used for cloning and screening (X) XbaI, (A) AgeI, (P) PmlI, (S) SalI, (N) NotI are indicated. The <em>Card15/Nod2</em> KO targeting fragment comprises the EGFP gene (Clontech) in frame with <em>Card15/Nod2</em> ATG and the floxed PGKHygromycin (Clontech) selection cassette, introduced between the AgeI site downstream of <em>Card15/Nod2</em> exon 1 and the SalI site upstream of exon 1 in the <em>Card15/Nod2</em> orientation. All loxP sites are represented by open triangles. Recombination of loxP1 and loxP2 results in the loxP1+2 site. In the first step of the strategy, the <em>Card15/Nod2</em> locus was targeted with the <em>Card15/Nod2</em> KO targeting fragment. In the second step, the PGKHygromycin selection cassette was removed by Cre recombinase. The double-headed arrows indicate the DNA fragments resulting from digestions with different enzymes expected to hybridize with probes A, B or Hyg. Also depicted are combinations of PCR primers P1-4 that detect the different <em>Card15/Nod2</em> alleles. (B) Southern blot analysis of restricted DNA resulting from digestion with XbaI.Hybridation with Probe A and B show complete integration of the targetting fragment after homologous recombination. Probe Hyg show the differents integrations of targetting fragments after homologous recombination. (C) Genotyping of Nod2-deficient mice by PCR. Genomic DNA from mice was amplified by PCR to detect the disrupted sequence (PCR product of 459 bp). (D) Expression of Nod2 mRNA in spleen. RT-PCR was performed on purified mRNA from the spleen of WT and KO mice. As expected, no signal was observed in KO mice. GAPDH expression was used as positive control of expression.</p>
