To be included as an overlap a gene must be differentially expressed in at least one time point in both time courses (&gt;1.2-fold and p-value&lt; = 0.05), but the time points or trends do not have to necessarily match. For a detailed listing of all of the genes in the overlaps see Supplementary <a href="#pone.0000525.s003">Tables S2</a>, <a href="#pone.0000525.s005">S4</a>, <a href="#pone.0000525.s007">S6</a> and <a href="#pone.0000525.s009">S8</a>).</p>
