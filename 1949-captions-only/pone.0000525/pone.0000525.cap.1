                Figure 1.  Overlaps between differentially expressed genes in the four treatment/time course combinations.These Venn diagrams illustrate the overlaps between genes that were scored as being either up or down regulated. To be included as an overlap a gene must be differentially expressed in at least one time point in both time courses (&gt;1.2-fold and p-value&lt; = 0.05), but the time points or trends do not have to necessarily match. For a detailed listing of all of the genes in the overlaps see Supplementary Tables S2, S4, S6 and S8).
