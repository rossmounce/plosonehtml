                Figure 2.  Gene expression changes in p27Kip and four genes that may regulate its expression.This diagram shows a combination of semi-quantitative PCR data (for p27Kip) and microarray data for the other four genes conducted on the utricle neomycin time courses. Each gene expression profile is color coded with the key to the right of each figure. The X-axis lists time points and the Y-axis is the log2 fold-change at each time point. Expression values are derived from Supplementary Table S2, except for DACH1 which is detectably expressed, but is not significantly differentially expressed across the time course.
