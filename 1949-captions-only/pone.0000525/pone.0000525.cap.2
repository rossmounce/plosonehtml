Each gene expression profile is color coded with the key to the right of each figure. The X-axis lists time points and the Y-axis is the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change at each time point. Expression values are derived from Supplementary <a href="#pone.0000525.s003">Table S2</a>, except for <em>DACH1</em> which is detectably expressed, but is not significantly differentially expressed across the time course.</p>
