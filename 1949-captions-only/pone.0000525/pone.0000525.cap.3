Each box (centroid) in this figure is numbered from C0â€“C15 and they reflect common patterns of expression for clustered groups of genes within the dataset. The X-axis for each centroid consists of each time point and runs from the laser 30 min time point through 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs and then into the neomycin 0 time point followed by the neomycin 24 and 48 hr time points. The Y-axis indicates expression level (fold-change). The number in the top left of each centroid indicates the number of genes that fall into this cluster of co-expression. The top line indicates the upper boundary of expression for all of these genes and the lower line indicates the lower boundary. The middle line is the mean. All of the specific genes that fall into each centroid are listed in Supplementary <a href="#pone.0000525.s019">Tables S18</a> and <a href="#pone.0000525.s020">S19</a>. <a href="#pone-0000525-g003">Figure 3A</a> shows the clustering for the utricle time points and <a href="#pone-0000525-g003">Figure 3B</a> shows the clustering for cochlea time points. Arrows indicate various patterns or genes within specific centroids that are described in the text.</p>
