                Figure 4.  Detectably expressed TFs in the four treatment/time course combinations.All TFs that were present (as judged by exceeding a background intensity level) at any stage were considered in this analysis, irrespective of differential expression at any time point. Overlaps between these sets of TFs are illustrated in these Venn diagrams. Figure 4A shows overlaps for the utricle time points and treatments. Figure 4B shows overlaps for the cochlea time points and treatments. For a detailed listing of all of the genes in these diagrams see Supplementary Tables S20 and S21.
