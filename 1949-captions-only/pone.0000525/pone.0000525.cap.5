                Figure 5.  Two examples of Ingenuity gene networks constructed from cochlear differentially expressed genes.Genes that showed differential expression in both the laser and neomycin cochlear time courses (listed in Supplementary Tables S6 and S8) were uploaded to the web-based Ingenuity program (IngenuityÂ® Systems, www.ingenuity.com) and the network of interactions shown here was generated. Each interaction is shown according to the following legend and is supported by at least one literature citation (available from the Ingenuity website). Figure 5A shows the network of interactions for genes specifically identified within the cochlear neomycin time course as being part of Estrogen receptor signaling. Figure 5B shows the network of interactions surrounding Circadian rhythm signaling and was generated by uploading all of the cochlear differentially expressed genes (rather than a subset as in 5A). Red denotes up-regulation and green down-regulation in at least one time point. Genes shown in bold with no shading vary across a time course (e.g. GTF2H4 in Figure 5A was up-regulated at 24 hrs and down-regulated at 48 hrs). All other genes were either not represented on the microarray or were not significantly differentially expressed. A key to additional Ingenuity labels is listed below.
