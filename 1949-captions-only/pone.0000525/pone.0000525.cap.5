Each interaction is shown according to the following legend and is supported by at least one literature citation (available from the Ingenuity website). <a href="#pone-0000525-g005">Figure 5A</a> shows the network of interactions for genes specifically identified within the cochlear neomycin time course as being part of Estrogen receptor signaling. <a href="#pone-0000525-g005">Figure 5B</a> shows the network of interactions surrounding Circadian rhythm signaling and was generated by uploading all of the cochlear differentially expressed genes (rather than a subset as in 5A). Red denotes up-regulation and green down-regulation in at least one time point. Genes shown in bold with no shading vary across a time course (e.g. <em>GTF2H4</em> in <a href="#pone-0000525-g005">Figure 5A</a> was up-regulated at 24 hrs and down-regulated at 48 hrs). All other genes were either not represented on the microarray or were not significantly differentially expressed. A key to additional Ingenuity labels is listed below.</p>
