The PRRSV particles (indicated by arrows) are visualized in the cytoplasm of Marc-145 cells (in ultra-thin sections), and the PRRSVs are also observed in the TEM picture on the left bottom. (B) PCR assay of the infected tissues with specific primers for PRRSV. â€“: Negative control; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: the supernatants from the homogenized tissues of lungs, spleen, kidney, heart, liver and brain, respectively. The target fragment of ~0.6 kb is highlighted by the arrow.</p>
