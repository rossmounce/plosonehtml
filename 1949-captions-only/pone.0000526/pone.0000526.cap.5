<h4>High Virulence of the Isolated PRRSV</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>In order to confirm the above notion, it is essential and important to reproduce the high pathogenicity of the isolated PRRSV by employing a pig infection model. Three representative PRRSV isolates with different origins (JXA1, HEB1, and HUB2) were used for challenge of 12 SPF-pigs (4 piglets/group). In each group, two of the piglets were intravenously injected and both died within 6–8 days, implying the high virulence of the tested PRRSV strains. Similarly, the two other piglets in each group were intranasally inoculated, and they developed marked signs of “high fever” disease (e.g., high fever, blood spots, petechiae, shivering, lamping, etc.) within 3–6 days, and both died on day 10 post-infection. Subsequently, viral isolates were successfully recovered from the infected pigs and confirmed by PCR detection and EM. Autopsies were undertaken to evaluate the immunological effects and pathological lesions. We found almost the same pathological changes (in lung, heart, brain, kidney, liver, etc.) as were observed in pigs killed during the “high fever” epidemic, as well as from the results of our immunohistochemical experiments (<a href="#pone.0000526.s003">Fig. S1</a>). In light of the above data, we are confident that the 2006 outbreak of “high fever” disease in China was caused by highly pathogenic PRRSV infection in pig populations. It is therefore important to understand whether a virulent strain of PRRSV emerged in China, or if novel virulence factors have been acquired by PRRSV ancestors during evolution under some local selection pressures <a href="#pone.0000526-Storgaard1">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000526-Nielsen1">[32]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000526-Pesch1">[41]</a>.</p>


<h4>Genome-wide Molecular Dissection of the Pathogen</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>To shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the high virulence of the isolated PRRSV, six isolates (GD, JXA1, HEB1, SHH, LN and HUB2) were subjected to whole genome sequencing using T vector-based clones. The acquired sequences were assembled into complete genomes with a full length of 15,320 bp, excluding their poly-A sequences. To define their genetic backgrounds, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using their genome sequences together with full genomes obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrates that the six strains of PRRSV are extremely similar and can be classified into the same clade. More importantly, they are assigned to Type II with the Northern American strain ATCC VR2332 as a prototype (<a href="#pone-0000526-g006">Fig. 6A</a>). This was also verified by the evolutionary analysis of ORF5, a putative virulence marker at the amino acid level (<a href="#pone-0000526-g006">Fig. 6B</a>). As reported previously <a href="#pone.0000526-Gao1">[12]</a>, HB-1 and HB-2, two Chinese isolates, also belong to Type II PRRSV. The accumulated data reveals that our isolates (e.g., JXA1) share a close relationship with HB-1, suggesting the possibility that PRRSV isolates collected in this outbreak may have evolved from its ancestor.</p>
