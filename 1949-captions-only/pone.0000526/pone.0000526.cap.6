(B) Phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV isolates from this study on the basis of amino acid sequences of ORF5. Both are unrooted trees. PRRSV isolates from this outbreak are highlighted in red; HB-1, a previously reported Chinese isolate is indicated in pink; VR2332, standard strain of Type II (Northern American PRRSV) is shown in blue; and prototype of Type I (European PRRSV) is in green.</p>
