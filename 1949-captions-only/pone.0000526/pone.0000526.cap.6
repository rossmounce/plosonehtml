                Figure 6.  Phylogenetic relationship of PRRSVs.(A) Phylogenetic tree of the isolates in this outbreak together with some other PRRSV strains with known genome sequences. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV isolates from this study on the basis of amino acid sequences of ORF5. Both are unrooted trees. PRRSV isolates from this outbreak are highlighted in red; HB-1, a previously reported Chinese isolate is indicated in pink; VR2332, standard strain of Type II (Northern American PRRSV) is shown in blue; and prototype of Type I (European PRRSV) is in green.
