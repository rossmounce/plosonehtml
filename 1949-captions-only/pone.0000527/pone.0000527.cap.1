In addition, signs of rhabdomyolysis were reported (creatine phosphokinase 41600 IU/mL). The muscle biopsy was performed on the quadriceps muscle, for pathological diagnosis during the acute phase of the illness (red star). During the following weeks, the patient recovered. Patient#2 is a 71 year old woman who complained in January, 2006, of headaches, arthralgia and a rash; around three months later, she was admitted to hospital with a classical clinical picture of CHIK virus infection, including fever, headaches, joint pain, and myalgia. A biopsy was performed in the quadriceps muscle during this recurrent phase of the disease (red star). 1A: A section from the muscle biopsy of patient #1. Hematoxylin-eosin staining. No important cellular infiltrates were observed. Atrophy and necrosis of muscle fibers could be seen, as well as central nuclei (arrow). (magnification: ×60). 1B: A section from the muscle biopsy of patient #1. Hematoxylin-eosin staining. Vacuolization of muscle fibers were detected. (magnification: ×140). 1C, D: Sections from the muscle biopsy of patient #2 showing an important mononuclear infiltration in transversal (C) and longitudinal sections (D) stained by hematoxylin-eosin (C) and Masson's trichrome (D); an important amount of fibrosis is also observed (D); (magnification:C: ×140; D: ×80)</p>
