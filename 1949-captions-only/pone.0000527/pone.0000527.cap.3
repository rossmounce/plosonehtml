Immunoreactivity is detected on fusiform curved shaped cells located at the periphery of the myotubes, either as multiple cells per microscopic field (A,D), or as single cell per field (B,C). Some immunoreactive cells (arrows) were detected at the periphery of muscle fibers with central nuclei (C, arrowhead). E–F: Detection of CHIK virus in muscle biopsy sections from patient #1 (E) and #2 (F) using the immunofluorescence technique. Whereas the muscle biopsy of patient #1 numerous cells exhibited immunoreactivity (E), at the periphery of myotubes, as assessed by the (immunoperoxydase technique), very rare immunoreactive cells could be detected in sections of the muscle biopsy from patient #2 (F). G: West Nile virus (IS-98-ST1 srtrain) used as the primary antibody (muscle section from patient#1); no staining was observed; similar results were obtained with sera against yellow fever virus, or dengue type-1 virus (data not shown). G,H: sections from a non-infected patient (G) or from a HTLV-1-infected patient with myositic syndrome<a href="#pone.0000527-Ozden1">[11]</a> (H) used as controls; no significant immunoreactivity detected. I: double labeling by immunofluorescence of CHIK virus antigens (green staining; HMAFs anti CHIK virus #1) and laminin (red staining; rabbit anti-laminin polyclonal antibody). Note the CHIK virus immunoreactive cells are located beneath the basal lamina. (magnification: ×300(A,C,D,E,F); ×400(B); ×420 (I); ×100 (G,H)).</p>
