For infection experiments, muscle cells (satellites and myotubes) were exposed for 2 h. at 37°C in medium containing 1% FCS to about 1 to 10 pfu/cell of CHIK virus isolates 06-049 and 05-115 . Cultures were kept for 24, 36, 48, and 72 h. (according to experiments) in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed as described in <a href="#pone-0000527-g002">Fig. 2</a>, both by indirect immunofluorescence or immunoperoxydase, after acetone fixation. A: Detection by immunofluorescence of CHIK virus antigens on satellite cells grown for 24 h. after CHIK virus infection (m.o.i. 10). HMAF anti-CHIK virus #1; (magnification:×250). B: Detection by immunofluorescence of CHIKV antigens on satellite cells grown for 24 h. after CHIK virus infection (m.o.i. 10), using a monoclonal antibody against alphavirus nucleocapsid<a href="#pone.0000527-GreiserWilke1">[9]</a>. (magnification: ×1000). C: Detection by immunofluorescence of CHIK virus antigens on satellite cells grown for 48 h. after CHIK virus infection (m.o.i. 10). HMAF anti-CHIK virus #1; (magnification: ×400). D: Absence of infection of myotubes, 24 h. after CHIK virus infection (m.o.i. 10), using HMAF anti-CHIK virus as primary antibody. (magnification: ×200). E and F: Detection by immunoperoxydase of CHIK virus antigens on satellite cells (from two different donors) grown for 36 h. after CHIK virus infection (m.o.i. 10). HMAF anti-CHIK virus #1; (magnification: ×200(E), ×400(F)). G: viral yielding of satellite cells from donor #1 at 24 and 72 h. post-infection by CHIK virus. Analysis of viral yielding was performed by plaque titration on cultured mosquitoe cells as previously described<a href="#pone.0000527-Schuffenecker1">[8]</a> and is expressed as UFF/mL.</p>
