Mice were randomized to mifepristone- or doxycycline-treated (each group n = 7) and untreated (n<sub>-mif</sub> = 8; n<sub>-dox</sub> = 12) groups. Indicated xenografts (arrowhead) were injected with HSV-Switch-TG17 and HET6C-<em>tk39</em> respectively (&gt;2×10<sup>6</sup> t.u.) 48h prior to PET-imaging, resulting in high accumulation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in HSV-Switch-TG17 or HET6C-<em>tk39</em> infected and mifepristone- or doxycycline-treated tumors as compared to some background activity in non-treated tumors.</p>
