                Figure 1.  Experimental procedure.(A), Set-up for measurement of the amount of saliva secretion is illustrated as a lateral view. The distal cut-stump of the salivary duct (SD) was inserted into a small plastic chamber, and the tip of the plastic chamber was covered with white Vaseline (dotted square) to prevent leakage of saliva. Saliva (shaded area) secreted from the SD was collected by a plastic capillary attached to a syringe every 1 min. The amount of secreted fluid was calculated from the length (L) of the fluid column. (B), Stimulus schedules for five P+/V− or P−/V+ forward-pairing trials. One P+/V− or P−/V+ forward-pairing trial consisted of the presentation of peppermint (shaded rectangles) or vanilla odor (hatched rectangles) to an antenna before the presentation of sucrose solution (white squares and white triangles) to the mouth and presentation of vanilla or peppermint odor without pairing with sucrose solution, respectively. (C), Stimulus schedules for five P+/V− backward-pairing trials. One P+/V− backward-pairing trial consisted of the presentation of peppermint odor after the presentation of sucrose solution and subsequent unpaired presentation of vanilla odor. (D), Stimulus schedule for unpaired presentation of peppermint and vanilla odors (CS alone). Peppermint and vanilla odors were alternately presented five times without pairing with sucrose solution. (E), Stimulus schedules for unpaired presentation of sucrose solution (US alone). Sucrose solution was presented five times without pairing with an odor. The duration of olfactory stimulus was 4 sec. The inter-stimulus intervals were 5 min in B–D and 10 min in E. The measurements of salivation responses to peppermint, vanilla and apple odors (Test; black squares) were performed at 30 min (B–E) or 1 day (B) after conditioning or control trials.
