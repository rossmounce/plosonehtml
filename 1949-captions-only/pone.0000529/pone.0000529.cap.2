In another two groups of cockroaches, 4 µl of 500 mM sucrose solution (solid line) or 5 M sodium chloride solution (dotted line) was presented to the mouth (C). The amount of saliva secreted from the salivary duct was measured every 1 min, and values are shown as means±s.e.m. For statistical evaluation, the amount of saliva secreted for a 2-min period after the onset of olfactory (B) or gustatory (D) stimulation (R; black bar) was compared with that before stimulation (R<sub>0</sub>; white bar). Asterisks indicate the level of significance (** &lt;0.01, NS&gt;0.05; WCX-test).</p>
