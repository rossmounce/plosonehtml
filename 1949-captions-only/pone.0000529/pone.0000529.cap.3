The odors were presented for 4 sec with intervals of 6 min. The amount of saliva secreted from the salivary duct was measured every 1 min, and values are shown as means±s.e.m. For statistical evaluation, the amount of saliva secreted for a 2-min period after the onset of stimulation (R; black bar) was compared with that before stimulation (R<sub>0</sub>; white bar) at 30 min (B,E) or at 1 day (C,F) after five P+/V− or P−/V+ forward-pairing trials. Asterisks indicate the level of significance (** &lt;0.01, NS&gt;0.05; WCX-test).</p>
