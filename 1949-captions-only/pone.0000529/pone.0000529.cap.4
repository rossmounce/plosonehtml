                Figure 4.  Changes in the levels of salivation in response to odors after control trials.In each of three groups of cockroaches, the amount of saliva secreted in response to peppermint, vanilla and apple odors was measured at 30 min after P+/V− backward (A), CS alone (B) or US alone (C) trials. The amounts of saliva were measured every 1 min, and values are shown as means±s.e.m. For statistical evaluation, the amount of saliva secreted for a 2-min period after the onset of olfactory stimulation (R; black bar) was compared with that before stimulation (R0; white bar). Asterisks indicate the level of significance (** &lt;0.01, NS&gt;0.05; WCX-test).
