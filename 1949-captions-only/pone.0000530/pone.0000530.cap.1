                Figure 1.  Subset of Drosophila pseudoobscura third chromosome inversion network.The sets of inversion events thought to be responsible for a subset of the arrangements polymorphic in populations of D. pseudoobscura are shown. Arrows indicate single paracentric inversions; ambiguous inversion events (those for which the ancestral arrangement is unclear) are shown with double-ended arrows [24]. Hypothetical (HY) is a necessary intermediate that has never been collected. The Olympic (OL), Chiricahua (CH), and Vandeventer Flat (VF) arrangements were used in previous recombination rate experiments [15]â€“[17], but not in this study.
