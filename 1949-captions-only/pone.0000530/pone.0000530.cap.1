Arrows indicate single paracentric inversions; ambiguous inversion events (those for which the ancestral arrangement is unclear) are shown with double-ended arrows <a href="#pone.0000530-Popadic1">[24]</a>. Hypothetical (HY) is a necessary intermediate that has never been collected. The Olympic (OL), Chiricahua (CH), and Vandeventer Flat (VF) arrangements were used in previous recombination rate experiments <a href="#pone.0000530-Dobzhansky3">[15]</a>â€“<a href="#pone.0000530-Levine3">[17]</a>, but not in this study.</p>
