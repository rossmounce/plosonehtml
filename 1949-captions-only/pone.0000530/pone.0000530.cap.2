                Figure 2.  Crossing scheme to determine the frequency of wild-type non-recombinant individuals.Females carrying a marker chromosome on the AR gene arrangement were crossed to males carrying one of five wild-type chromosomes (AR, ST, PP, SC, or TL). Individual male and female mutant progeny were test crossed to a marker stock carrying the or and pr mutations on an AR background. Single pair matings involving heterozygotes of the same sex carrying the same wild-type gene arrangement are considered replicates.
