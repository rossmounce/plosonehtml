Simulations were carried out as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. Simulated data sets are represented as follows: diamonds, AR; squares, ST; triangles, PP; circles, SC; no marker, TL. Simulations carried out using parameters from crosses involving heterozygous females are indicated by solid lines and filled in makers, those from crosses using heterozygous males with dashed lines and hollow markers.</p>
