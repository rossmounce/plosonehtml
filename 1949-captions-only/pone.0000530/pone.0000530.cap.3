                Figure 3.  Power to detect significant excess of wild-type non-recombinants.The power to detect significant excess of wild-type non-recombinants (p&lt;0.05) using the average across replicates (N&gt;30) is graphed for different frequencies of transmission of wild-type chromosomes. Simulations were carried out as described in Methods. Simulated data sets are represented as follows: diamonds, AR; squares, ST; triangles, PP; circles, SC; no marker, TL. Simulations carried out using parameters from crosses involving heterozygous females are indicated by solid lines and filled in makers, those from crosses using heterozygous males with dashed lines and hollow markers.
