                Figure 4.  Distribution of variances from simulations of crossing scheme.1,000 simulations were carried out using the observed frequency of transmission (sum across replicates) for crosses involving the following heterozygotes: (A) AR females, (B) ST females, (C) PP females, (D) SC females, (E) TL females, (F) AR males, (G) ST males, (H) PP males, (I), SC males, (J) TL males. The observed sample variance of the replicates, mean of the sample variance from 1,000 simulations, and the significance of a one tailed test for observed variance greater than mean simulated variance are shown.
