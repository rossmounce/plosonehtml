(B) Condensed cladograms showing the evolutionary relationship of 28 lamin genes, compared for the central rod domain, the IF-tail domain and full protein sequences. Protostome and deuterostome sequences group together rather than with different deuterostomic lamin groups. Note also how the central rod domain of the single C elegans lamin gene is equally related to deuterostome and protosome sequences, whereas its IF-tail domain groups with other protostomal sequences. The full C. elegans lamin sequence also occupies an intermediary position. Arrows indicate the root node of respective C.elegans sequences. Bootstrap values (1000 trials) are given as percent figures near nodes. See <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> for lamin designations, and <a href="#pone.0000532.s002">Supplemental Figure S1</a> for full cladograms. Sequence alignments upon which these were based are available on request.</p>
