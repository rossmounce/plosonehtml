                Figure 2.  Molecular characterization of null allele lamD395.(A) Schematic drawing of the lam locus. Exons are presented as large grey arrows, and relevant restriction sites and the translation start site are indicated. The site of insertion of the P element responsible for the lamP mutation is shown, and the bar underneath indicates the extent of the lamD395excision. (B) Southern blot of genomic DNA from the genotypes indicated above each lane. The white arrowheads mark the band corresponding to the second exon lacking in lamD395 homozygotes and lamD395/Df (2L) cl-h1 transheterozygotes. The white asterisks mark the 4.8 kb HinDIII band resulting from the wild type chromosome (lower) and the band from the mutant chromosome (upper), which is larger due to the deletion of the HinDIII (2910) site.
