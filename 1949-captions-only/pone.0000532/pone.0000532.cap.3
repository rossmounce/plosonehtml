Each symbol represents the mean of six trials for an individual adult, with error bars showing SEM. (B) Negative geotaxis was plotted as a function of genotype and age. Each point represents 20 â€“ 35 adults, with error bars showing SEM. Data from males and females were pooled. (C) The percentage of living adults that climbed in the negative geotaxis assay, plotted as a factor of age. Homozygous <em>lam</em><sup>G262</sup> mutants all died before three weeks of age.</p>
