                Figure 4.  Larval behavior of lam mutants.(A) Vials showing the difference in pupariation height between wild type at left, and lamG262at right. (B) Chart of pupariation height in mm. Error bars correspond to SEM. Differences between lamD395 and lamD395/Df(2L)cl-h1, and outcrossing are described in the text. Sample sizes; wt (w1118) = 163, G262/+(lamG262/+) = 114, G262 (lamG262) = 133, 04643/+(lam04643/+) = 40, 04643 (lam04643 ) = 45, P/+(lamP/+) = 105, P (lamP) = 5, D395/+(lamD395/+) = 74, D395 (lamD395) = 33, G262 outcrossed = 39, 04643 outcrossed = 19, P outcrossed = 94, and D395/Df = 87. The asterisk marks lamP laboratory strain, where we had to screen a very large number of larvae to find 5 pupae to measure - see also the footnote to lamP laboratory strain lethality in Table 1. (C) Larval locomotion is shown for the indicated genotypes as the number of 5 mm squares crossed in 5 minutes (see Materials and Methods). Error bars correspond to SEM. In all cases, n = 30.
