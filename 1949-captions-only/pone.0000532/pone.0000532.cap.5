Thoraces were cleared and examined by polarized light microscopy. (A) Wild type w1118. (B) lamG262 and (C) lam04643. Note that this technique does not allow fine focus, but permits gross assessment of muscle bulk and organization through entire thoraces. (D–F) Abdominal segmental muscle fibers labeled by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. (D) Wild type w1118. Muscle 5 is indicated by a white arrow. (E–F). lam04643 showing absence (E) or misinsertion (F) of muscle 5. (G) Higher magnification of phalloidin-stained w1118 larval body wall muscles showing regular patterns. (F) lam04643 - fine structure defects are highlighted by arrowheads. Similar defects are seen in other alleles (data not shown). (I) Phalloidin-stained late stage lam04643 embryo demonstrating normal muscle organization and form.</p>
