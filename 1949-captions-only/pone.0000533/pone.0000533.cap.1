                Figure 1.  Functional brain specific rtTA mice and tetracycline-induced, rtTA-dependent gene activation in the forebrain.(A) Schematics depicting the double-positive mice harboring constructs of tTA (left) and rtTA (right) under the control of the αCaMKII promoter and responder genetic modules under control of bidirectional Tet promoter (Ptetbi) to express Cre recombinase and the firefly luciferase genes. Notice that the tTA and rtTA activate Ptetbi in the absence and presence of Dox, respectively. (B) Luciferase activity in different brain subregions in double-postive transgenic mice (rtTA2-M2CaMK-2×LC-1) treated with Dox by different delivery routes (black bars, w (water), f (food) and ip (intraperitoneal injection). For comparison, luciferase activity in double transgenic mice (tTACaMK×LC-1) is also shown (grey bars). Luciferase activity presented on a log scale. (C) Forebrain-specific expression of Cre recombinase in tTACaMK/LC-1 mice (left). Specific detection of rtTA2-M2 RNA in brain slices of rtTA2-M2CaMK-2 mouse. Gene activation induced for two weeks of 9TB-Dox treatment and Cre signal is visualized by immunohistochemistry (right, insert shows a magnified image of dentate gyrus).
