Notice that the tTA and rtTA activate P<sub>tet</sub>bi in the absence and presence of Dox, respectively. (B) Luciferase activity in different brain subregions in double-postive transgenic mice (rtTA2-M2<sup>CaMK</sup>-2×LC-1) treated with Dox by different delivery routes (black bars, w (water), f (food) and ip (intraperitoneal injection). For comparison, luciferase activity in double transgenic mice (tTA<sup>CaMK</sup>×LC-1) is also shown (grey bars). Luciferase activity presented on a log scale. (C) Forebrain-specific expression of Cre recombinase in tTA<sup>CaMK</sup>/LC-1 mice (left). Specific detection of rtTA2-M2 RNA in brain slices of rtTA2-M2<sup>CaMK</sup>-2 mouse. Gene activation induced for two weeks of 9TB-Dox treatment and Cre signal is visualized by immunohistochemistry (right, insert shows a magnified image of dentate gyrus).</p>
