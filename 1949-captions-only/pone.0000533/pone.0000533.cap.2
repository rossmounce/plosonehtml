                Figure 2.  Direct Dox delivery to brain tissues.(A) Induced gene expression in the rtTA2-M2CaMK-2/G3 mouse by direct Dox injection into brain regions in vivo, DG granule cells (left) and cortex (right). (B) Gene expression in organotypic slices of rtTA2-M2CaMK-2/LC-1 mice either without Dox (left) or treated with Dox (right). Scale bars, 200 Âµm.
