                Figure 3.  Incomplete gene suppression by Dox.(A) Dox-controlled, tTA-dependent gene inactivation of luciferase activity detected in intact brain and lysates from double-positive transgenic mice (tTACaMK×LC-1), either untreated or treated with different Dox concentrations in the drinking water for three weeks. Single-positive transgenic LC-1 mouse brain also shown as a control (far left). (B) Two different strains of double-positive mice, (tTACaMK×LC-1 and tTACN12×LC-1), were used to measure luciferase activity in the forebrain (displayed on a linear scale), either untreated or Dox-treated (2 mg/ml of Dox in the drinking water) for three weeks. Also, luciferase activity was measured from the forebrain in newborn embryos treated with Dox throughout development (tTACaMK×LC-1, far right). Scale bar, 100 µm.
