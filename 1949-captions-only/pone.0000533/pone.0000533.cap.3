Single-positive transgenic LC-1 mouse brain also shown as a control (far left). (B) Two different strains of double-positive mice, (tTA<sup>CaMK</sup>×LC-1 and tTA<sup>CN12</sup>×LC-1), were used to measure luciferase activity in the forebrain (displayed on a linear scale), either untreated or Dox-treated (2 mg/ml of Dox in the drinking water) for three weeks. Also, luciferase activity was measured from the forebrain in newborn embryos treated with Dox throughout development (tTA<sup>CaMK</sup>×LC-1, far right). Scale bar, 100 µm.</p>
