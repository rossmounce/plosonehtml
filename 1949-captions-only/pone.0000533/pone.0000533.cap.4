                Figure 4.  Episomal Ptetbi responder gene activation in rtTA2-M2CaMK-2 mice.(A) rAAV-Ptetbi-GFPvenus/Cre infected into the brain of rtTA2-M2CaMK-2 mice and robust Ptetbi gene activation (live GFP fluorescence) was clearly apparent throughout the infected sites (cortex, Cx, and hippocampal layers CA3 and CA1) after 10 days of treatment with 9TB-Dox. (B) Rapid gene activation is also apparent within hours of 9TB-Dox treatment. Scale bars, 100 Âµm.
