                Figure 5.  Un-silencing of Ptetbi in neurons.(A) rAAV mediated high tTA expression in cortical neurons of responder mice (MTH-Cg2-7) after two weeks (upper panel) and eight weeks (lower panel). (B) MTH-Cg2-19 mice with “basal” Ptetbi activity infected either with tTA2 (upper panel) or with rtTA2-M2 (lower panel). Serial brain sections were stained for tTA/rtTA2-M2 (left panel) and induced GFP expression (right panel). (C) Fraction of GFP-positive/tTA-positive neurons in different brain subregions (cortical layers, CA1 and DG) of different responder lines over time. Day post infection (DPI). Scale bars, 250 µm.
