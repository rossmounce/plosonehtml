                Figure 1.  Expression patterns of Cyr61, CTGF, and WISP-1 mRNAs in NSCLC and matched normal lung tissues.Relative mRNA expression levels of Cyr61, CTGF, and WISP-1 are shown in 60 pairs of primary NSCLC tissues and matched normal lung samples. Expression is displayed as a ratio of expression of CCN genes in cancer versus matched normal tissues. Each bar is the log2 value of the ratio of CCN expression levels between lung tumors (T) and matched normal tissues (N) from the same patients. Less than 2-fold change: the ratio between tumor and normal is &lt;2. Because Log2 2 = 1, bar value &gt;1 represents &gt;2-fold increase (T&gt;N), whereas bar value &lt;âˆ’1 represents &gt;2-fold decrease (T&lt;N).
