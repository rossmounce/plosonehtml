Expression is displayed as a ratio of expression of CCN genes in cancer <em>versus</em> matched normal tissues. Each bar is the log2 value of the ratio of CCN expression levels between lung tumors (T) and matched normal tissues (N) from the same patients. Less than 2-fold change: the ratio between tumor and normal is &lt;2. Because Log2 2 = 1, bar value &gt;1 represents &gt;2-fold increase (T&gt;N), whereas bar value &lt;âˆ’1 represents &gt;2-fold decrease (T&lt;N).</p>
