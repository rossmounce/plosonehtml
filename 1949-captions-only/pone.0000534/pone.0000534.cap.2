                Figure 2.  Expression patterns of Cyr61, CTGF, and WISP-1 protein in NSCLC and matched normal lung tissues.The graph depict distributions of specimens according to the percentage of cells positive for Cyr61, CTGF, and WISP-1 in 60 pairs of NSCLC and matched non-cancerous lung tissues. P values (paired-samples t-test) are listed suggesting the difference between NSCLC samples versus matched normal tissues.
