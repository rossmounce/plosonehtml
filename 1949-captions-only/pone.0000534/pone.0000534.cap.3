In corresponding NSCLC tissues, Cyr61 immunoreactivity is less (B) compared with normal lung tissue. Similar to Cyr61, many CTGF-positive cells (brown) are visible in non-tumor lung tissues (D), and positive signals are only sparsely distributed in NSCLC tissues (E). WISP-1 immunohistochemistry, however, displays a different expression pattern. WISP-1 immunoreactivity (brown) is barely detected in normal lung tissues from NSCLC patients (G) but is markedly increased in NSCLC tissues (H). C, F, and I are negative controls of Cyr61, CTGF, and WISP-1, respectively. All slides are counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Scale bar = 60 Âµm.</p>
