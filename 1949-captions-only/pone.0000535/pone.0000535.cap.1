To further assess the accuracy of the decision rule component in the protocol, it was also compared to the two second-best rules. When examining the inductive model component, the cut-off point at BMI 20 was also compared to the cut-off points representing BMI 16 to 19.</p>

<h4>Decision rules based on definitions of obesity</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p><a href="#pone-0000535-t002">Table 2</a> shows the odds ratios for univariate regression analyses using derivation cohort data of associations between obesity at 10 years of age and the corresponding variable. For the development of a decision rule based on categorical variables, the three best performing variables in the univariate analyses were chosen. These variables (obesity at the ages of 2.5 years, 4 years and 5 years, respectively) were analysed both separately and combined in pairs. The classification performance of this set of decision rules was assessed by calculating the precision, sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio at 95% confidence intervals. The three best performing decision rules identified using the derivation cohort data were considered for inclusion in the decision protocol (<a href="#pone-0000535-t003">table 3</a>).</p>
