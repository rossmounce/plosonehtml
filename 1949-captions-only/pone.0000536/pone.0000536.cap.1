                Figure 1.  Mitochondrial oxidative stress causes hyperphosphorylation of tau.Western blots of cortical extracts from sod2 null mice treated with 1 mg/kg (n = 8) of the catalytic antioxidant EUK189 or 30 mg/kg (n = 7) of EUK189 (white bars), or wild-type mice (n = 6, 1 mg/kg; n = 7, 30 mg/kg) treated comparably (black bars), were probed with the following antiphospho-tau antibodies; Thr 205, Ser 396, Ser 404, Ser 214, and Thr-231. Quantitation of chemiluminesence was carried out in the linear range of detection for each of these antibodies, using a regression model to adjust for the total amount of tau (results). P values for comparisons between each of the residues of phospho-tau were derived from the regression model, after correcting for the total amount of tau per group.
