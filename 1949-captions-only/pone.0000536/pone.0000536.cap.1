Quantitation of chemiluminesence was carried out in the linear range of detection for each of these antibodies, using a regression model to adjust for the total amount of tau (results). P values for comparisons between each of the residues of phospho-tau were derived from the regression model, after correcting for the total amount of tau per group.</p>
