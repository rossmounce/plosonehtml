                Figure 2.  Mitochondrial oxidative stress results in a synergistic increase in the levels of phospho-tau in Tg2576 mice.Data show the mean±SD levels of Ser-396 phospho-tau assayed by Western blot of cortical extracts from mice of ≈500 days of age from each of the following genotypes: wild-type n = 4, sod2+/−n = 4, Tg2576 n = 8, Tg2576:sod2 n = 9 (all matched for genetic background). A non parametric t test was carried out between genotypes, and a significant increase in phospho tau in the Tg2576:sod2 mice was observed, compared to controls.
