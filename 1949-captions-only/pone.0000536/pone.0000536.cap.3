                Figure 3.  Immunohistochemical identification of phospho-tau positive dystrophic neurites in Tg2576:sod2 mice.(a) Immunohistochemistry for anti Ser-396 was carried out as described in the text, and positivity was observed surrounding senile plaques in the brains of Tg2576:sod2 mice. (b) In order to ensure specificity, we also tested the effects of preadsorbing the Ser-396 antibody with the peptide the antibody was raised against. This abolished the staining seen around the plaques.
