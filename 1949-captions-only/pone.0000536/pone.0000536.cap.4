                Figure 4.  Exacerbation of amyloid load by genetic combination of lack of sod2 and overexpression of APP.(a) Immunohistochemistry quantitation (area occupied by Aß/mm2) did not demonstrate any significant alterations in total Aß plaque burden, although there is an ~30% increase (p = 0.2) in plaques in the Tg2576:sod2 animals as compared to other groups. (b) ELISA quantitation demonstrates that EUK189 treatment significantly modulates Aß levels. Furthermore, genetically combining lack of sod2 with overexpression of mutant APP elevates Aß levels in the Tg2576 mouse. The data indicate mean±SD.
