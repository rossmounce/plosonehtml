                Figure 5.  APP levels are elevated by genetic combination of sod2 with Tg2576 mice.The data indicate meanÂ±SD APP levels in brain assayed by western blot. As compared to the baseline Tg2576 levels, APP protein was marginally higher in Tg2576 mice treated with EUK189 (29% increased, p = 0.2), but markedly elevated by the presence of the sod2 mutation (88% increased, p = 0.002).
