                Figure 6.  Metal levels are lowered by genetic combination of lack of sod2 and overexpression of APP.Data indicate meanÂ±SD brain metal levels in the various genotypes, as indicated. This revealed a significant decrease in insoluble (16%) (A) and soluble (25%) (B) Copper levels, insoluble (23%) (C) and soluble (35%) (D) Manganese levels, and insoluble (21%) (E) and soluble (18%) (F) Zinc levels in the Tg2576:sod2 animals compared to the Tg2576 background strain. EUK189 treatment increased soluble (91%) and insoluble (113%) Manganese and soluble (12%) Zinc levels in the Tg2576 animals.
