This revealed a significant decrease in insoluble (16%) (A) and soluble (25%) (B) Copper levels, insoluble (23%) (C) and soluble (35%) (D) Manganese levels, and insoluble (21%) (E) and soluble (18%) (F) Zinc levels in the Tg2576:<em>sod2</em> animals compared to the Tg2576 background strain. EUK189 treatment increased soluble (91%) and insoluble (113%) Manganese and soluble (12%) Zinc levels in the Tg2576 animals.</p>
