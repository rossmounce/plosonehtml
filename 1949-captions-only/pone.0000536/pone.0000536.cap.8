                Figure 8.  Model of potential interactions between increasing Aß, decreased activity of SOD2, and a resultant increase in the hyperphosphorylation of tau.As levels of Aß increase with age, this causes a concomitant decrease in the activity of SOD2, which in turn leads to increased aggregation of Aß. The resulting pro-oxidant state of the cell causes hyperphosphorylation of tau.
