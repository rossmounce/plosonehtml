                Figure 1.  The association of levels of PCR amplifiable human nuDNA and RNA with digestion time.Note that in conventional quantitative real-time PCR assays, the measure of PCR amplifiable DNA or RNA (the Ct value) is inversely related to the starting concentration of template. Therefore, lower Ct values indicate higher original PCR amplifiable DNA or RNA yields.
