                Figure 2.  DNA and RNA yields (ng/µg original tissue) in six different nucleic acid extracts from sample PM85L.Each extract derives from a different digestion technique (a–f). For full details of the digestion protocols refer to main text. The data clearly demonstrates that total (but not necessarily amplifiable) DNA and RNA yields are greatly reduced in extracts performed using hot alkali techniques [22], [23].
