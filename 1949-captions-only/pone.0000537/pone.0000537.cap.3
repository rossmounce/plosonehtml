                Figure 3.  The relative PCR-amplifiable nuDNA yields resulting from different extraction techniques (a–f) on 3 different formalin fixed samples.Only sample PM85 was extracted with techniques (d–f). Techniques (a–c) are based on the hot-alkali methods of Shi et al. [22], [23], while techniques (d–f) are conventional proteinase k digestion techniques with extended digestion times. Note that in conventional quantitative real-time PCR assays, the measure of PCR amplifiable DNA (the Ct value) is inversely related to the starting concentration of DNA. Therefore, lower Ct values indicate higher original PCR amplifiable DNA yields. Although too small a sample to provide statistically supported findings, the data suggest that while there is little difference between the efficacies of the different hot alkali techniques themselves, they provide marginally higher levels of PCR amplifiable nuDNA.
