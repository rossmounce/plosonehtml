Boxes represent exons and lines are introns. Mutations are in lower case and the corresponding nucleotides in the wild-type substrate are underlined. Bold A indicates the branchpoint. (B) <em>In vitro</em> splicing assays were carried out in HeLa nuclear extract (NE) or S100 extract complemented with recombinant SC35, with or without a 20–40% ammonium sulfate (AS) fraction from HeLa NE. Quantitation is shown as the percent of the total RNA that is spliced. (C) Scheme for purification of the complementing activity and quantitation of RESCUE activity in HQ column fractions spanning the peak of activity. Splicing activity was normalized to the input material (H*). (see also <a href="#pone.0000538.s002">Figure S2</a>). H* refers to the HQ column input that was denatured with urea and renatured. (D)(top) Silver-stained SDS-PAGE of HQ peak fractions. (bottom) Western blot analysis of heparin (H) and HQ fractions 14-21. PUF* refers to an SDS-resistant dimer of the protein <a href="#pone.0000538-PageMcCaw1">[16]</a>. (E) Western blot analysis of S100 (lanes 1,4; 4 µl), NE (lanes 2,5; 4 µl), and recombinant PUF60 from E. coli (lane 3) using a PUF60 (lane 1–3) or U2AF<sup>65</sup>-specific (lane 4,5) antibody. (F) <em>In vitro</em> splicing assay using the PyD substrate in reactions containing S100 extract with SC35 alone (lane 2; 3 µl) and complemented with PUF60 purified from E. coli (lanes 3–4; 1 and 2 µl).</p>
