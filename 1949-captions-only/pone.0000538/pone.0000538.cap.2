                Figure 2.  Identification of PUF60-associated Proteins.(A) Western blot analysis of nuclear extract (NE) prepared from control untransfected HeLa cells (C, lane 1) or cells expressing the FLAG-V5-tagged PUF60 protein (F-V5-PUF, lane 2). Blots were probed with antibodies specific for PUF60 and U2 snRNP B”. (B) Silver-stained 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE of FLAG-PUF60 (PUF, lanes 1, 3) or control (C, lanes 2,4) immunoprecipitates, either bound to the α-FLAG beads (lanes 1,2) or eluted from the beads with FLAG peptide (lanes 3,4). The heavy chain (*) and light chain (**) from the FLAG antibody are indicated. (C) Western blot analysis of FLAG-PUF60 immunoprecipitates eluted with FLAG peptide.
