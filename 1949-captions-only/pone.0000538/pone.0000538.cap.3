PyD pre-mRNA spliced in mock-depleted nuclear extract (NE, lane 1), extract depleted of U2AF subunits and PUF60 (ΔNE, lane 2), depleted extract complemented with U2AF<sup>65/35</sup> purified from HEK-293E cells alone (lanes 3–6: 17, 33, 67, and 133 nM final concentration of U2AF<sup>65</sup>, respectively) or with 67 nM of U2AF<sup>65</sup> plus recombinant PUF60 (lanes 7,8: 1.2 and 2.4 µM PUF60) or with PUF60 alone (lanes 9,10: 1.2 and 2.4 µM). (B) Splicing of β-globin intron 1 in nuclear extract (NE, lanes 1, 8), or in poly(U)-depleted extract alone (ΔNE, lanes 2,9). Depleted extract was complemented with purified U2AF<sup>65/35</sup> (lanes 3–5: 17, 33, and 133 nM final concentration of U2AF<sup>65</sup>), with 670 nM of U2AF<sup>65</sup> plus recombinant PUF60 (lanes 6,7: 1.2 and 2.4 µM,) or with PUF60 alone (lanes 10,11: 1.2 and 2.4 µM). (C) C12 and (D) δ-crystallin pre-mRNA spliced in nuclear extract (NE, lanes 1), depleted extract (ΔNE, lanes 2) or depleted extract with addition of recombinant PUF60 (lanes 3–5: 1.2, 2.4, and 4.8 µM final concentration; lanes 6–8: 1.2 µM; lanes 12–14, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 µM) or purified U2AF<sup>65/35</sup> (lanes 6–8: 33, 67, and 133 nM of U2AF<sup>65</sup>; lanes 9–11: 67, 133, and 200 nM ; lanes 12–14: 670 nM). (E) Quantitation of C12 (left) and δ-crystallin (right) splicing. Splicing was calculated at three concentrations of protein (see C and D). PUF60 corresponds to quantitation of lanes 3–5; PUF60+U2AF<sup>65</sup> refers to lanes 6–8; U2AF refers to lanes 9–11; and U2AF+PUF60 corresponds to lanes 12–14. The level of splicing expected if the PUF60 and U2AF activity is additive was calculated as the sum of lanes 3+9, 4+10, and 5+11, respectively (Sum).</p>
