                Figure 4.  Cooperative Binding of U2AF65/35 and PUF60 to the 3â€² splice site.(A) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a radiolabeled 34-nt RNA derived from adenovirus major late (AdML) pre-mRNA, and recombinant PUF60 and U2AF65/35. Complexes are indicated on the left. (B) Quantitation of PUF60 binding to AdML RNA represented as the fraction of total labeled RNA bound by the protein. (C) U2AF65 binding represented as the fraction of total labeled RNA bound by the protein.
