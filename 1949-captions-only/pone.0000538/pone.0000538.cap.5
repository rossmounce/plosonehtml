                Figure 5.  Footprinting analysis of PUF60 and U2AF65/35 binding(A) RNase 1 digestion. Labeled RNA was incubated with purified PUF60, U2AF65/35, or both PUF60 and the U2AF heterodimer, digested with RNase and separated by denaturing PAGE. The concentration of PUF60 was 0.72 µM (lane 2), or 0.36 µM (lane 4) and that of U2AF65 was 1.9 µM (lane 3), or 0.96 µM (lane 4). (B) Graphical representation of footprint data in (A). Relative protection is normalized to digestion in the absence of protein (A, lanes 1, 6). The RNA sequence below the plot indicates the position of cleavage (arrowhead). The pyrimidine tract is underlined. (C) RNase T1 digestion. The concentration of PUF60 was 0.36 µM (lanes 7, 9) and that of U2AF65 was 0.48 µM (lanes 8,9). The bands corresponding to the pyrimidine (Py) tract and branchpoint adenosine (A), and full-length RNA (FL) are indicated (see also Berglund et al., 1998). RNase T1 cleavage sites are numbered. A lower exposure of the top of the RNase T1 gel allows visualization of cleavage site 2. (D) Graphical representation of footprinting data in (C). Relative protection is normalized to digestion in the absence of protein (C, lanes 1, 6). The RNA sequence below the plot indicates the position of cleavage (arrowhead). The pyrimidine tract is underlined.
