                Figure 6.  Changes in PUF60 and U2AF65/35 levels regulate alternative splicing in cells.(A) Western blot analysis of HeLa cells with stable expression of empty vector (HeLa) or PUF60 cDNA with silent mutations that protect transcripts from siRNA-mediated knockdown (HeLa PUFrm). Cells were treated with PUF60 siRNA (+) or mock-treated (−). Blots were probed with antibodies specific for PUF60, hnRNP A1, and U2 B”. (B) Western blot analysis of HeLa cells treated with siRNA specific for PUF60 (lane 2), a U2AF65-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) or mock-treated (lane 1). Antibodies against U2AF65, PUF60, or α-tubulin were used. (C) APP and (D) BIN1 alternative splicing analyzed by RT-PCR with [α-32P]dCTP of endogenous transcripts from stable cell lines mock-treated (lanes 1,3) or treated with PUF60 siRNA (lanes 2,4)(from (A)). (E) APP and (F) BIN1 alternative splicing analyzed by RT-PCR with [α-32P]-dCTP of endogenous transcripts from HeLa cells mock-treated (−) or treated with PUF60 (P), U2AF65 (U) siRNAs, or both (P+U). RT-PCR analysis of APP and BIN1 from untreated Weri-Rb1 (W) cells demonstrates neural splicing patterns.
