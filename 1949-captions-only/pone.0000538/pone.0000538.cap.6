Cells were treated with PUF60 siRNA (+) or mock-treated (−). Blots were probed with antibodies specific for PUF60, hnRNP A1, and U2 B”. (B) Western blot analysis of HeLa cells treated with siRNA specific for PUF60 (lane 2), a U2AF<sup>65</sup>-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) or mock-treated (lane 1). Antibodies against U2AF<sup>65</sup>, PUF60, or α-tubulin were used. (C) <em>APP</em> and (D) <em>BIN1</em> alternative splicing analyzed by RT-PCR with [α-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP of endogenous transcripts from stable cell lines mock-treated (lanes 1,3) or treated with PUF60 siRNA (lanes 2,4)(from (A)). (E) <em>APP</em> and (F) <em>BIN1</em> alternative splicing analyzed by RT-PCR with [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP of endogenous transcripts from HeLa cells mock-treated (−) or treated with PUF60 (P), U2AF<sup>65</sup> (U) siRNAs, or both (P+U). RT-PCR analysis of <em>APP</em> and <em>BIN1</em> from untreated Weri-Rb1 (W) cells demonstrates neural splicing patterns.</p>
