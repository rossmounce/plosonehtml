                Figure 7.  Complex modulation of alternative splicing by PUF60 and U2AF65.(A) UBQLN1 exon 8 splicing, (B) SMN2 exon 7 splicing, and (C) MAPT exon 10 splicing analyzed by RT-PCR in the presence of [α-32P]-dCTP of endogenous transcripts from untreated (−) HeLa cells, HeLa cells treated with a PUF60-specific siRNA (P), a U2AF65 siRNA (U), or both siRNAs (P+U). Transcripts including the alternative spliced exon (+) or skipping the exon (Δ) are labeled.
