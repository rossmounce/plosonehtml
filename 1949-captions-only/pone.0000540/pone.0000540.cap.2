                Figure 2.  Central memory CD4+ T-cell counts in naive controls and NAb-immunized macaques.(A) Peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts (cells/µl). (B) Peripheral CD95+CD28+ central memory CD4+ T-cell counts (cells/µl) [28]. (C) Statistical comparison of CD28+CD95+ central memory CD4+ T-cell counts around 3 months post-challenge. The geometric mean (indicated by the longer bar) of central memory CD4+ T-cell counts in naive controls is 1.7×102 counts/µl, and its 95% confidence interval (indicated by the shorter bars) is 1.1×102−2.7×102 counts/µl. The geometric mean in NAb-immunized macaques is 4.3×102 counts/µl, and its 95% confidence interval is 2.9×102−6.3×102 counts/µl. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant by unpaired two-tailed t test (p = 0.0066) and by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.0061).
