(B) Peripheral CD95<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts (cells/µl) <a href="#pone.0000540-Pitcher1">[28]</a>. (C) Statistical comparison of CD28<sup>+</sup>CD95<sup>+</sup> central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts around 3 months post-challenge. The geometric mean (indicated by the longer bar) of central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in naive controls is 1.7×10<sup>2</sup> counts/µl, and its 95% confidence interval (indicated by the shorter bars) is 1.1×10<sup>2</sup>−2.7×10<sup>2</sup> counts/µl. The geometric mean in NAb-immunized macaques is 4.3×10<sup>2</sup> counts/µl, and its 95% confidence interval is 2.9×10<sup>2</sup>−6.3×10<sup>2</sup> counts/µl. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant by unpaired two-tailed t test (<em>p</em> = 0.0066) and by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (<em>p</em> = 0.0061).</p>
