<h4>Post-infection passive NAb immunization in vaccinees</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>Our previous trial of a DNA-prime/SeV-Gag vector-boost vaccine in Burmese rhesus macaques has shown vaccine-based, NAb-independent control of SIVmac239 replication, suggesting association of MHC-I haplotype with this control <a href="#pone.0000540-Matano2">[6]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000540-Kawada1">[30]</a>. We then examined possible synergy of post-challenge passive NAb immunization with the prophylactic CTL-based vaccination in suppression of SIV replication in two groups of macaques possessing MHC-I haplotype <em>90-088-Ij</em> and <em>90-120-Ia</em>, respectively (<a href="#pone-0000540-g004">Figure 4A</a>). In the former group of macaques possessing <em>90-088-Ij</em>, vaccinees failed to control SIV replication even after passive NAb immunization (<a href="#pone-0000540-g004">Figure 4B</a>). In the latter group of macaques possessing <em>90-120-Ia</em>, all 4 vaccinees without NAb immunization controlled SIVmac239 replication and had undetectable plasma viral loads after week 8 post-challenge (<a href="#pone-0000540-g004">Figure 4B</a>). All of them rapidly selected for a mutation escaping from Gag<sub>206-216</sub> epitope-specific CTL by week 5, suggesting a strong selective pressure on the virus by this CTL <a href="#pone.0000540-Matano2">[6]</a>. As for the two vaccinees VA2 and VA3 infused with NAbs, plasma viremia became undetectable by week 5 and rapid selection of CTL escape mutation was not observed (data not shown). SIV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell frequencies at week 2 in the NAb-immunized vaccinees VA2 and VA3 were comparable with the vaccinees without NAb immunization, while SIV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell induction at week 2 was observed in just one (V5) of the four vaccinees without NAb but in both of the NAb-immunized vaccinees (<a href="#pone-0000540-g004">Figure 4C</a>). These results suggest, even in the NAb-immunized vaccinees, a dominant effect of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses on control of SIV replication, although implying a possibility of NAb-mediated augmentation of CTL vaccine-based viral control.</p>
