(B) In vitro antigen presentation assay. Either in vitro-generated DCs (Exp. 1, Exp. 2, and Exp. 3) or positively-selected CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs (Exp. 4) prepared from PBMCs were pulsed with SIV alone (SIV), SIV preincubated with control antibodies (SIV+Control Ab), SIV preincubated with NAbs (SIV+Neutralizing Ab), or SIV preincubated with Fc-depleted NAbs (SIV+Neutralizing F[ab']2). Autologous PBMCs were cocultured with these pulsed DCs and then subjected to measurement of specific IFN-γ induction.</p>
