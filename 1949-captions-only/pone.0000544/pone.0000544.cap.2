                Figure 2.  Direct MS of serum.Average spectra for patients with VTE (a) and without VTE (b) show differences in overall protein expression, with the internal spike protein denoted by an asterisk. The 500 signals selected by the ANOVA analysis are denoted by red circles, representing locations on the mass spectrum with differential protein expression between the two groups of patients (c).
