Cells were co-incubated with capsaicin (capsaicin, ED<sub>200</sub> = 2 ÂµM) in the presence of different concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin inhibitors. Calmidazolium (CMZ)&gt;trifluoperazine (TFP)&gt;chlorpromazine (CPZ) were identified as full antagonists of capsaicin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake, in the micromolar range, while fluphenazine (FluPhe), W7 and W13 were determined as partial or weak inhibitors. Similar efficacy order was determined in two additional experiments, carried out in duplicate samples.</p>
