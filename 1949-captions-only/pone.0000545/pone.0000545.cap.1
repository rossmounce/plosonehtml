                Figure 1.  Antagonist activity of Ca2+-calmodulin inhibitors in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells.45Ca2+-uptake experiments were carried out in 96 well plates with robotic liquid handling. Cells were co-incubated with capsaicin (capsaicin, ED200 = 2 ÂµM) in the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+- calmodulin inhibitors. Calmidazolium (CMZ)&gt;trifluoperazine (TFP)&gt;chlorpromazine (CPZ) were identified as full antagonists of capsaicin-induced Ca2+-uptake, in the micromolar range, while fluphenazine (FluPhe), W7 and W13 were determined as partial or weak inhibitors. Similar efficacy order was determined in two additional experiments, carried out in duplicate samples.
