                Figure 10.  (a) Homologous portions of various TRP channels, near the border of the pore loop and the 6th transmembrane domain were aligned with a validated R4W2 peptide similar in biochemical character to ruthenium red.An acidic tetrad motif DXEXXEXXD which can bind the positively charged peptides in human and rat TRPV1, is absent in TRPV2/VRL1 and TRPV3, (both close homologues of TRPV1) as well as in distantly related TRPs and bKcsA, a bacterial cation channel. An acidic sequence, partially similar to the heat sensitive TRPs, is present in the cold responsive TRPM8/CMR1. Distant TRPV homologues do not share the acidic tetrad motif either, such as g/mOTRPC4 and hOSM, nonselective cation channel orthologues from Gallus gallus (chicken), mouse, and human, respectively that confer sensitivity to extracellular osmolarity, mTRP12, another osmotically activated TRP channel from mouse; mGFRCC, mouse growth factor receptor coupled channel; hVOC, Homo sapiens Kv4.3 potassium channel; dSha12, a “shaker-like” potassium channel from Drosophila melanogaster. (b) The TM5-pore loop-TM6 region of TRPV1 is analogous to the “inverted teepee”, pore-forming domain of bKcsA. Side-view of the TRPV1 tetramer channel depicts the hypothetical pore at the middle. Arrows point to the putative ruthenium red/R4W2 binding site in each TRPV1 subunits of the tetramer. (c) To better represent the simulated quaternary structure of TRPV1, a view perpendicular to the plasma membrane is generated with the homo-tetrameric TRPV1 domain fragments. The position of acidic domain is noted by an arrow in a single subunit in this view of the model.
