An acidic sequence, partially similar to the heat sensitive TRPs, is present in the cold responsive TRPM8/CMR1. Distant TRPV homologues do not share the acidic tetrad motif either, such as g/mOTRPC4 and hOSM, nonselective cation channel orthologues from <em>Gallus gallus</em> (chicken), mouse, and human, respectively that confer sensitivity to extracellular osmolarity, mTRP12, another osmotically activated TRP channel from mouse; mGFRCC, mouse growth factor receptor coupled channel; hVOC, <em>Homo sapiens</em> Kv4.3 potassium channel; dSha12, a “shaker-like” potassium channel from <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. (<em>b</em>) The TM5-pore loop-TM6 region of TRPV1 is analogous to the “inverted teepee”, <em>pore</em>-forming domain of bKcsA. Side-view of the TRPV1 tetramer channel depicts the hypothetical pore at the middle. Arrows point to the putative ruthenium red/R<sub>4</sub>W<sub>2</sub> binding site in each TRPV1 subunits of the tetramer. (<em>c</em>) To better represent the simulated quaternary structure of TRPV1, a view perpendicular to the plasma membrane is generated with the homo-tetrameric TRPV1 domain fragments. The position of acidic domain is noted by an arrow in a single subunit in this view of the model.</p>
