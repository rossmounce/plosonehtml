Aromatic residues within the 20 Å proximity to the inhibitor are shown by sticks, and the Asp and Glu residues as well as the ligand by spacefilled models. Color codes for the atoms: grey, C; cyan, H; blue, N; red, O; green, Cl. The pore loop, localized in between transmembrane domain 5 and 6 of TRPV1 is shown with the specific docking site of the positively charged CMZ. (<em>a</em>) side-view and (<em>b</em>) a view perpendicular to the cell membrane were generated after docking of CMZ. Negatively charged “acidic domain” of TRPV1 in the homotetramer may serve as ideal nest for channel blockers such as CMZ&gt;trifluoperazine&gt;chlorpromazine/amitr​iptyline,as well as, ruthenium red and R<sub>4</sub>W<sub>2</sub>, all charged oppositely. The rule is that more basic is an anti- calmodulin substance that more attracted to the acidic moieties of the “nest” by electrostatic forces near to the entrance (i.e. ion filter) of the pore. It is a tendency that longer is the hydrophobic side chain tethered to the tricyclic core better is the fit inside the pore, such as determined with amitriptyline and carbamazepine.</p>
