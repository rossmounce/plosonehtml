                Figure 2.  Screening of other calmidazolium analogs (M-set).Among miconazoles, clotrimazole, and N-benzylimidazole compounds (M1â€“M7) calmidazolium was the most potent inhibitor in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells. Each point on the graph is the average of triplicate determinations. Chemical structure of miconazoles, clotrimazole, and N-benzylimidazole compounds used in these studies are indicated. Experiments were repeated two additional times in triplicate with similar results.
