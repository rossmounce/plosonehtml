                Figure 3.  Kinetics of Ca2+-transport inhibition by calmidazolium (CMZ), chlorpromazine (CPZ) and capsazepine (CAZ) in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells, induced by increasing concentrations of capsaicin.Increasing doses of calmidazolium decreased Vmax of Ca2+-transport, however, affinity of TRPV1 to capsaicin remained constant, as indicated. Likewise, chlorpromazine showed distinctive, non-competitive inhibition kinetics, similar to that determined to calmidazolium, consistent with a channel blocking mechanism on TRPV1. In contrast to calmidazolium and chlorpromazine, capsazepine, a bona fide vanilloid antagonist shifted the capsaicin dose-response curves right, however, above 1 ÂµM behaved as a mixed kinetics inhibitor, also decreased Vmax. Experiments were repeated two additional times in duplicates with similar results.
