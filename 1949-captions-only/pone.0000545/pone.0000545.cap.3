Likewise, chlorpromazine showed distinctive, non-competitive inhibition kinetics, similar to that determined to calmidazolium, consistent with a channel blocking mechanism on TRPV1. In contrast to calmidazolium and chlorpromazine, capsazepine, a <em>bona fide</em> vanilloid antagonist shifted the capsaicin dose-response curves right, however, above 1 ÂµM behaved as a mixed kinetics inhibitor, also decreased V<sub>max</sub>. Experiments were repeated two additional times in duplicates with similar results.</p>
