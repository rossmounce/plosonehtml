                Figure 4.  Effect of a non-membrane permeable inhibitor of calmodulin on TRPV1-mediated Ca2+-transport.Camstatin, a recently identified, selective, 25-mer polypeptide blocker of calmodulin, was employed, which inhibited capsaicin-induced Ca2+-uptake with comparable activity (IC50 = 20 ÂµM) determined previously to other, more conventional antagonists, of calmodulin in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells. Results with camstatin suggests calmodulin-like structure at the extracellular domains of TRPV1. Experiments were repeated two additional times in triplicate with similar results.
