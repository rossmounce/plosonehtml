                Figure 5.  Activity of other drugs, similar to chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine, on TRPV1.Amitriptyline (AMI), carbamazepine and gabapentine were tried in cell based capsaicin-induced Ca2+-uptake experiments. Among these substances amitriptyline, a tricyclic analogue of phenothiazines, was the best inhibitor, however, carbamazepine with shorter side chain than amitriptyline was determined inactive. Gabapentine showed only partial inhibition on TRPV1. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments carried out in triplicate.
