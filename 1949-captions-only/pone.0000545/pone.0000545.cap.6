                Figure 6.  Efficacy of Ca2+- calmodulin inhibitors in rat primary DRG cultures.Neuron cultures derived from embryonic rat DRGs readily show inducible (10 fold over base line) activation with vanilloids due to endogenous expression of TRPV1. As with the TRPV1-NIH 3T3 cells, calmidazolium was determined the most effective inhibitor of capsaicin-induced Ca2+-uptake. As controls of specificity, flunarizine, SB 290157, and CGP 37157 showed only partial blocking activity in DRG neurons. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments carried out in triplicate.
