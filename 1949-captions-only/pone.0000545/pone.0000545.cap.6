As with the TRPV1-NIH 3T3 cells, calmidazolium was determined the most effective inhibitor of capsaicin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake. As controls of specificity, flunarizine, SB 290157, and CGP 37157 showed only partial blocking activity in DRG neurons. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments carried out in triplicate.</p>
