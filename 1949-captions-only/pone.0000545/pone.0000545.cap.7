                Figure 7.  Heat-induced pain signal inhibition of the best Ca2+- calmodulin inhibitor in the rat.Ratemeter recordings showing the inhibitory effects of calmidazolium (CMZ) on responses of a spinal dorsal horn neuron to noxious heat delivered to its cutaneous receptive field on the paw. Panel A: Heat-evoked responses evoked in every 3 min during the control period.. Panel B: Effects of iontophoresed CMZ on the heat-evoked responses. Similar results were obtained in five additional experiments. A representative recording is shown.
