Note the differential effects of calmidazolium on NMDA responses versus kainic acid responses. Panel A: Responses to NMDA and kainic acid iontophoresed alternately in every 2 min. Panel B: Effects of iontophoresed calmidazolium on the responses to these excitatory amino acids during the control period. Panel B: Differential effects of calmidazolium on the NMDA- versus the kainic acid-evoked responses. Similar results were obtained in fifteen additional experiments. A representative recording is shown.</p>
