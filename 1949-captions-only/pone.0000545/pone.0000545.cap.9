                Figure 9.  Summary of the effects of calmidazolium (CMZ) on the responses to heat or to iontophoresed excitatory amino acids of spinal dorsal horn neurons of nociceptive specific (NS) or wide dynamic range (WDR) types.Note the decrease of the responses in the presence of calmidazolium. Asterisks denote significant differences by ANOVA (**p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.01) as compared to their respective controls or the significant difference between the decrease of NMDA- and kainic acid -evoked responses in the presence of calmidazolium. See details in the text.
