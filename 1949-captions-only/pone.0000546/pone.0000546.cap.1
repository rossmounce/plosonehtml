                Figure 1.  Subjective and physiological responses.(A) Mean subjective intensity ratings of happy and neutral facial expressions during both true and false physiological feedback of cardiac rate. Subjective intensity was rated on a four point rating scale via button box responses during functional scanning. A significant interaction between emotion (happy neutral) and feedback (true false), and a significant increase in the attributed emotional intensity of neutral faces during false relative to true feedback were observed. The volume of partial brain T2 data acquired is illustrated by the dashed box. (B) Peripheral physiological measures recorded outside the scanner showed that exercise increased systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, heart rate and stroke volume.
