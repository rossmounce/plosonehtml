                Figure 2.  Neural Interaction of Emotion and Feedback Veracity.Left; Significant interactions of emotion (happy neutral) and feedback (true false) were observed on neural activity within; 1) right anterior insula, 2) right amygdala, 3)left amygdala, 4)right mid insula, 5) left mid insula and 6) posterior dorsal cerebellum. Functional interactions are projected onto a normalised mean structural image calculated from each individual subjects structural T1 weighted image. Dashed bounding box illustrates volume of acquired T2 data. Right; Contrast estimates at the illustrated regions are displayed.
