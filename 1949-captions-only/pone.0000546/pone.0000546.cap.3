                Figure 3.  Neural activity associated with physiological comparator mismatch.During rating of neutral expressions, greater bilateral anterior insula activity was observed during asynchronous rather than synchronous cardiac feedback, relative to the same difference during ratings of happy expressions. Results are projected onto the normalised mean structural T1 weighted image.
