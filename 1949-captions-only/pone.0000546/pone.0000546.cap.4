This interaction closely resembles the right anterior insula interaction previously observed within the non-exercise condition alone. A) Coronal and sagittal sections, B) Contrast estimates. C) When considering both the exercise and non-exercise conditions, individual subjects' ratings of neutral faces during false is significantly correlated with BOLD responses within the right anterior insula cortex (across subjects).</p>
