Second level group analysis of within subject results revealed a significant association within right anterior insula. Left: An individual subjects activation overlaid on their structural T1 weighted image. Right: Within the right anterior insula, the HRF amplitude is modulated as a function of the perceived intensity of neutral faces during false physiological feedback. The predicted response is illustrated across the entire HRF (right top) and at the peak HRF response (right bottom).</p>
