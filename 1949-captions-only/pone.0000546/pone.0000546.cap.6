                Figure 6.  Experimental Paradigm and Task Design.Participants viewed emotional faces (happy, angry &amp; neutral expressions, presented for 2 seconds each) and rated the emotional intensity during a subsequent blank screen (presented for 1 second). Within each of three sessions, participants performed the face rating task during isometric exercise and no exercise conditions (3 minutes each). Within each condition, physiological feedback of cardiac rate was true, asynchronous and false (1 minute each). Each participant completed three scanning sessions.
