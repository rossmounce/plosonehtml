The 47 genes may be catagorized (see <a href="#pone-0000547-t001">Table 1</a>) as: input genes (dashed circles); membrane genes; death genes; life genes; and finally the remaining genes in the network. The output, or “death” node (48) is added to represent the cumulative effect of many genes implicated in the onset of the cell death machinery. In this figure, solid lines indicate promotion while short dashed links indicate inhibition. The long dashed link between CASP3 and CASP8 adds the possibility of feedback in the apoptosome.</p>
