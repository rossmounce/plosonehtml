Distribution of nodes appearing in selective and mortal perturbations in the linear (top panel) and logarithmic (lower panel) OSA rules.The life/death threshold is set to s̅o = 1 for the two rules. The correlation between the mortality and selectivity distributions is 0.88 for the linear case and −.80 for logarithmic case.
