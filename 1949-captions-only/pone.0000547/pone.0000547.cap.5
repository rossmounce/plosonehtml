                Figure 5.  Majority rule signaling with non-linearity.The distribution of signals in heterogeneous cell populations with a population size of 50,000. These distribution are for majority rule signaling with positive, continuous gene activities calculated from the signal by using the Michaelis-Menten law a = s/(1+s). a) Signal statistics at the output node is similar to a normal distribution; b) Signal statistics at the gene NFkB remains close to log-normal despite the non-linear dependence of the activity on the signal.
