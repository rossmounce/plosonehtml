These distribution are for majority rule signaling with positive, continuous gene activities calculated from the signal by using the Michaelis-Menten law <em>a</em> = <em>s</em>/(1+<em>s</em>). a) Signal statistics at the output node is similar to a normal distribution; b) Signal statistics at the gene NFkB remains close to log-normal despite the non-linear dependence of the activity on the signal.</p>
