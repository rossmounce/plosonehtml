(10)), the middle figure is for the Michaelis-Menten case (<em>b</em> = <em>c</em> = <em>d</em> = 1 in Eq. (10)), and the bottom figure was found using Eq. (10) with <em>c</em> = 2, <em>d</em> = 1 and <em>b</em> = 2 corresponding to co-operative non-linearity. In the top figure the link weights are ω<sub>12</sub> = 0.367, ω<sub>23</sub> = 0.864, ω<sub>34</sub> = 0.754, ω<sub>45</sub> = 0.617, ω<sub>51</sub> = 0.718, ω<sub>51</sub> = 0.828. In the middle and bottom figures the weights used were (0.417,0.847,0.287,0.456,0.614,0.521) and (1.812,1,207, 0.971,1.158, 1.924,1.489) respectively. The link weights were chosen to be random on the interval [0,<em>c</em>].</p>
