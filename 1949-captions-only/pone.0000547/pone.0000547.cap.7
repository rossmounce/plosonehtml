                Figure 7.  The steady state activity of genes in the feedback loop illustrated in Fig. 6.The top figure is the case of linear signaling (d = 0, c = b = 1 in Eq. (10)), the middle figure is for the Michaelis-Menten case (b = c = d = 1 in Eq. (10)), and the bottom figure was found using Eq. (10) with c = 2, d = 1 and b = 2 corresponding to co-operative non-linearity. In the top figure the link weights are ω12 = 0.367, ω23 = 0.864, ω34 = 0.754, ω45 = 0.617, ω51 = 0.718, ω51 = 0.828. In the middle and bottom figures the weights used were (0.417,0.847,0.287,0.456,0.614,0.521) and (1.812,1,207, 0.971,1.158, 1.924,1.489) respectively. The link weights were chosen to be random on the interval [0,c].
