(13), the sigmoidal function, Eq. (14) and the linear function, Eq. (12). The death statistics for these three models: b) linear function; c) sigmoidal function; d) logarithmic function. It is clear that the distribution of death activities becomes bimodal and broader as we go from the linear function to the logarithmic function.</p>
