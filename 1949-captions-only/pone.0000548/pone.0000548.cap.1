                Figure 1.  Ribbon representation of the hAFP structure.The positions of ten cysteine residues are labeled. Three conserved disulfide bonds (Cys4-Cys15, Cys32-Cys125, and Cys101-Cys117) are shown in yellow and two unique disulfides bonds (Cys69-Cys100 and Cys89-Cys111) in magenta. The Ca2+ ion is shown in green. This diagram was generated using the programs MOLSCRIPT and Raster3D [39], [40].
