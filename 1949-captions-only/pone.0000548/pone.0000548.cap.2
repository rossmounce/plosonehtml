Residues are colored according to their physicochemical properties. Numbering in the top ruler corresponds to residue numbering of hAFP. Numbers in brackets in the N- and C-terminal part of the alignment indicate how many amino acids have been omitted for the sake of the clarity. Type II AFPs–specific cysteines forming disulfide bonds are indicated by “*”. Residues forming the first Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site in hAFP are indicated with “1”. Residues homologous to residues of the second Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site are indicated as “2”.</p>
