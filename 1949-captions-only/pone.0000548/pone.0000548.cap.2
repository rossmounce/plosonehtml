                Figure 2.  Sequence alignment of type II AFPs and most closely related fish-specific lectins.Similar or identical amino acid residues are highlighted. Residues are colored according to their physicochemical properties. Numbering in the top ruler corresponds to residue numbering of hAFP. Numbers in brackets in the N- and C-terminal part of the alignment indicate how many amino acids have been omitted for the sake of the clarity. Type II AFPs–specific cysteines forming disulfide bonds are indicated by “*”. Residues forming the first Ca2+-binding site in hAFP are indicated with “1”. Residues homologous to residues of the second Ca2+-binding site are indicated as “2”.
