                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of type II AFPs.(A) Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of type II AFPs and representatives of the most closely related fish skin mucus lectins. The values on the nodes represent the bootstrap support for the individual branches. (B) Phylogenetic tree of Teleostei reproduced based on Lundberg, John G. 2006. Teleostei. Version 18 August 2006 (temporary). http://tolweb.org/Teleostei/15054/2006.0​8.18 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/ and classification from the NCBI Taxonomy database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/). (C) Evolutionary history of type II AFPs. Putative gene losses are indicated. Those taxa for which gene losses could not be stated due to insufficient genomic data are indicated with “?”.
