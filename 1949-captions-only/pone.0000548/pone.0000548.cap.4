                Figure 4.  Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of type II AFPs, fish skin mucus lectins and other closely related lectins.Values at the nodes represent branch support (probability values) derived with parametric approximate likelihood ratio test for branches (aLRT). A clade postulated in this work to be monophyletic and containing type AFPs is shown in blue. Other clades are shown in green. The position of the root of the tree is hypothetical. Gene duplications responsible for a rise of major clades are indicated.
