                Figure 6.  Ca2+-binding properties of hAFP and its mutants.(A) 45CaCl2 overlay assay of WT-6H and its mutants. Lysozyme was used as negative control and Î²-lactoglobulin was used as positive control. PLMWM represents prestained low molecular weight marker. Both wild-type hAFP and its mutants can bind Ca2+ ions properly. (B) Proteolysis protection assay of WT-6H and its mutants. Endoprotease Glu-C was used to detect conformational changes of hAFP and its mutants as modulated by Ca2+ ions. In the absence of Ca2+ ions, hAFPs were subjected to Glu-C cleavage. Three lanes of each sample from left to right represent hAFP, and hAFP treated with Glu-C, respectively, in the presence, and in the absence, of Ca2+ ions.
