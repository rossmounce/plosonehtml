Lysozyme was used as negative control and Î²-lactoglobulin was used as positive control. PLMWM represents prestained low molecular weight marker. Both wild-type hAFP and its mutants can bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions properly. (B) Proteolysis protection assay of WT-6H and its mutants. Endoprotease Glu-C was used to detect conformational changes of hAFP and its mutants as modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, hAFPs were subjected to Glu-C cleavage. Three lanes of each sample from left to right represent hAFP, and hAFP treated with Glu-C, respectively, in the presence, and in the absence, of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p>
