Values showed represent means of triplicate measurements done on each single sample. (B) Ice crystal morphologies of hAFP and its mutants. Samples were: (1) buffer alone and wild-type hAFP; (2) the mutant that exhibited no effect on thermal hysteresis; (3) mutants that showed reduced thermal hysteresis activities; (4) mutants which retained the ability to modify the ice crystal with no detectable thermal hysteresis activities, (5) mutants that exhibited complete loss of antifreeze activity. The protein concentration used for each sample is also indicated.</p>
