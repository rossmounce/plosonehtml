Fluorescent (FITC) and transmitted light images were acquired serially on postoperative days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Scale bar = 2.5 mm. GFP-positive tumor area (green fluorescence) is indicated by white arrows and tumor-associated vasculature in transmitted light images is outlined by black arrowheads. (C) Quantification of tumor neovascularization as measured by vascular length density (VLD) in window chambers treated with EPO or control buffer revealed increased angiogenesis in EPO-treated chambers compared to controls, *P&lt;0.001. (D) Quantification of tumor growth revealed significantly increased tumor area in EPO-treated chambers compared to controls, *P&lt;0.001; ** P&lt;0.01.</p>
