                Figure 2.  Stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and growth in response to tumor cell EPOR-R129C expression.Representative images of dorsal skin-fold window chambers implanted with R3230-GFP cells transfected with (A) empty pCR3.1 vector control, or (B) EPOR-R129C expression vector are shown. Scale bar = 2.5 mm. Two independent single cell clones each of empty pCR3.1 vector and EPOR-R129C-transfected cells were tested for a total of 7 animals in each group. (C) Quantification of tumor neovascularization in window chambers implanted with EPOR-R129C or empty vector-transfected R3230-GFP cells revealed significantly increased VLD in EPOR-R129C expressing group compared to vector controls, *P&lt;0.001. (D) Quantification of tumor growth in window chambers implanted with EPOR-R129C or vector transfected R3230-GFP cells revealed increased tumor area in EPOR-R129C expressing group compared to vector controls, *P&lt;0.001; **P&lt;0.01 (n = 7 animals/group).
