                Figure 3.  In vivo tumor growth of R3230 mammary carcinoma cells in the mammary fat pad of nude mice.Stably transfected R3230-GFP cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of mice, tumor volumes were measured and expressed as fold-increase of palpable tumor size at day 7. Three independent single cell clones of each cell line were analyzed and empty vector-transfected cells (pCR3.1 and pcDNA3.1) served as negative controls. Expression of EPOR-R129C was associated with a significant increase in tumor growth rate compared to pCR3.1 vector controls (*P&lt;0.001, n = 19 tumors in EPOR-R129C and n = 16 in pCR3.1 group). No significant tumor growth was observed in animals injected with cells expressing R103A-EPO antagonist (n = 14) compared to pcDNA3.1 vector transfected cells (**P&lt;0.001, n = 15 tumors in pcDNA3.1 group).
