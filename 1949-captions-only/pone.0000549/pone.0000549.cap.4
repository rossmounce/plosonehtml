Fluorescent and transmitted light images were acquired serially on postoperative days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Scale bar = 2.5 mm. (D) Quantification of tumor neovascularization revealed significantly decreased angiogenesis in sEPOR and mab-treated chambers compared to controls. Control buffer was PBS (n = 3) and control protein was mouse IgG1 (n = 4), *P&lt;0.001; **P&lt;0.01, (n = 7 animals/group). (E) Quantification of tumor growth revealed significantly decreased tumor area in sEPOR and mab-treated chambers compared to controls, *P&lt;0.001; <sup>†</sup>P&lt;0.05, (n = 7 animals/group).</p>
