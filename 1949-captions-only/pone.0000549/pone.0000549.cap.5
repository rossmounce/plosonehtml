Note the constriction and near-complete disappearance of blood vessels in the areas surrounding the tumor which was observed in all window chambers injected with cells expressing R103A-EPO. Two independent single cell clones each of empty pcDNA3.1 vector or R103A-EPO-transfected cells were analyzed for a total of 7 animals in each group. (C) Quantification of tumor neovascularization revealed decreased angiogenesis in window chambers implanted with R103A-EPO secreting cells compared to vector controls, *P&lt;0.001. (D) Quantification of tumor growth in window chambers implanted with R103A-EPO or vector transfected R3230-GFP cells. Compared to vector controls, decreased tumor area was observed in R103A-EPO expressing group with near-complete disappearance of tumor cells at day 8 in all chambers, *P&lt;0.001 (n = 7).</p>
