                Figure 5.  Expression of R103A-EPO antagonist inhibits induction of tumor angiogenesis and disrupts primary tumor growth.Representative images of window chambers implanted with R3230-GFP cells transfected with (A) empty pcDNA3.1 vector, or (B) R103A-EPO antagonist expression vector. Note the constriction and near-complete disappearance of blood vessels in the areas surrounding the tumor which was observed in all window chambers injected with cells expressing R103A-EPO. Two independent single cell clones each of empty pcDNA3.1 vector or R103A-EPO-transfected cells were analyzed for a total of 7 animals in each group. (C) Quantification of tumor neovascularization revealed decreased angiogenesis in window chambers implanted with R103A-EPO secreting cells compared to vector controls, *P&lt;0.001. (D) Quantification of tumor growth in window chambers implanted with R103A-EPO or vector transfected R3230-GFP cells. Compared to vector controls, decreased tumor area was observed in R103A-EPO expressing group with near-complete disappearance of tumor cells at day 8 in all chambers, *P&lt;0.001 (n = 7).
