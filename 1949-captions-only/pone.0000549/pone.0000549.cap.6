Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against phosphorylated or total proteins to detect (A) JAK2, JAK1 and STAT-5, (B) ERK1/2, and (C) JNK. Representative blots are shown. The phosphorylated (P) and total (T) proteins are indicated by the arrows. Comparable sample loading and protein integrity were confirmed by stripping the blots and hybridizing to respective antibodies to detect total protein amounts in the samples. The relative positions of the molecular weight markers are indicated in each blot. Quantitative representation of phosphorylated proteins using densitometry normalized to total protein levels are shown below the blots for ERK1/2 and JNK (n =  3 independent experiments using 3 different single cell clones, (*P&lt;0.05).</p>
