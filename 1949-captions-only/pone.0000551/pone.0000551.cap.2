<h4>Adverse Events and Safety Outcomes</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1"></a><p>Five SAEs were reported after the 1<sup>st</sup> dose of study drug: two in the 4 mg arm (i. cellulitis, unlikely related (judged by site investigator), moderate severity, resolved; ii. shigella enteritis, likely unrelated), one in the 8 mg arm (altered mental status, likely unrelated, moderate severity, resolved), one in the 16 mg arm (pancreatitis, likely unrelated, severe, resolved), and one in the PBO arm (Kaposi's sarcoma, likely unrelated, mild severity, resolved). No deaths were reported. There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events or laboratory toxicities between PRO and PBO. Four grade 3 (severe) AE's were reported: two in the placebo arm (i. foot pain, possibly related; ii. thrombocytopenia, possibly related), one in the 2 mg arm (fatigue, unrelated), and one in the 16 mg arm (thrombocytopenia, unlikely related). Five grade 4 laboratory toxicities were reported: two in the placebo arm (1 reduced platelet count; 2. elevated calcium level), one in the 2 mg arm (elevated SGOT level), and two in the 16 mg arm (both with reduced absolute neutrophil count).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p2"></a><p>Statistically significant decreases in CD4 were noted for the 8 mg arm only; however this was not significantly different (statistically) from PBO (<a href="#pone-0000551-t002">Table 2</a>). No statistically significant decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were noted for the active compared to PBO.</p>
