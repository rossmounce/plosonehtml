                Figure 1.  Oct4 Correlation Analysis.ESC, EC, myogenic, neuronal, retinal, and hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives underwent Affymetrix gene expression profiling as part of the Stem Cell Genomics Project. A set of 45 samples were profiled in biological triplicate and hybridized to the MOE430 GeneChip set. Mean intensity values for each biological triplicate are plotted in log scale on the Y-axis, with an approximate cutoff of 1000 demarcating detection status of each gene represented. Transcript expression levels of genes positively (Nanog, Sox2), negatively (Tdrd7 and Mef2a), and not (Myog) correlated to Oct4 are displayed. Detection calls of ‘Present’ for Oct4 are depicted by solid black squares. ‘Absent’ calls are represented by open black squares.
