A set of 45 samples were profiled in biological triplicate and hybridized to the MOE430 GeneChip set. Mean intensity values for each biological triplicate are plotted in log scale on the Y-axis, with an approximate cutoff of 1000 demarcating detection status of each gene represented. Transcript expression levels of genes positively (<em>Nanog, Sox2</em>), negatively (<em>Tdrd7</em> and <em>Mef2a</em>), and not (<em>Myog</em>) correlated to <em>Oct4</em> are displayed. Detection calls of ‘Present’ for <em>Oct4</em> are depicted by solid black squares. ‘Absent’ calls are represented by open black squares.</p>
