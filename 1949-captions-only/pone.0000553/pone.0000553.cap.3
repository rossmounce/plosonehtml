                Figure 3.  Validation of Oct4 targets.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed with Oct4 and IgG antibody and no antibody as a negative control followed by Quantitative Real-time PCR analysis (ChIP/QRT-PCR) for putative positively regulated Oct4 target (A), negatively regulated Oct4 target (B), and non-validated (C) genes. *8L16Rik represents 1110008L16Rik. Results are from two independent ChIP assays, with duplicate QRT-PCR assessment for each. Error bars denote standard error of the mean (SEM).
