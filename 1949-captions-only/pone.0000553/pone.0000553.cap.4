Red and green indicate negative and positive regulation, respectively for all cases. Dashed lines emanating from Oct4 indicate putatively regulated genes. Solid black lines represent potential regulatory nodes that could facilitate the directed differentiation of ESCs. The pressures that preserve stem cell function and modulate early lineage commitment are diametrically opposed. While Oct4 acts to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in the undifferentiated ‘ES’ state by its modulation of genes that act to maintain permissive chromatin structure, DNA repair, anti-apoptosis, and inactive <em>pRb</em> (B), in differentiation the balance of these forces is altered to favour repressive chromatin structure, DNA checkpoint control, apoptosis, and active pRB which facilitate cellular commitment (C).</p>
