                Figure 1.  Example of thermal performance curves â€“ growth rate z was measured at six temperatures for 90 families of caterpillars.This set of curves has a common shape (slowly increases, tend to reach a maximum and rapidly decreases). The variation in the curves is due to both genetic and environmental factors operational in the population. Adapted from ref. [10].
