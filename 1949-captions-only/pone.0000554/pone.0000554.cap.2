<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a><p>The questions mentioned above can now be addressed by using genetic mapping approaches <a href="#pone.0000554-Lander1">[13]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000554-Xu1">[16]</a> that capitalizes on molecular markers to infer the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for thermal reaction norms. However, these traditional approaches can only be well used to associate marker genotypes with single phenotypic values of a trait, and have less power to map a phenotype, such as thermal reaction norms, expressed as an “infinite-dimensional” curve. Although extensions have been made to model multiple discrete traits at the same time <a href="#pone.0000554-Jiang1">[17]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000554-Korol1">[18]</a>, they are limited for mapping a large number of traits due to computational prohibition and longitudinal repeated measures showing an autocorrelation structure. More recently, a new QTL mapping strategy, called functional mapping, has been proposed to map traits that vary continuously as a function of an independent variable <a href="#pone.0000554-Ma1">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000554-Wu1">[20]</a>. By embedding biologically sensible growth equations into the mapping framework, functional mapping can estimate the dynamic changes of the genetic effects of a QTL in development and push hypotheses tests towards the interplay between genes and development.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec1.p6"></a><p>In principle, functional mapping can be used to study the genetic architecture of environmentally sensitive phenotypic variation for a complex trait. However, a direct use of functional mapping is problematic because it has not taken into account the underlying modes of variation unique to thermal reaction norms <a href="#pone.0000554-Huey2">[8]</a>. The purpose of this study is to derive a theoretical framework model for mapping QTL that regulate differentiation in TPC described by a rational function. By testing the mathematical parameters that define the optimum performance breadth and thermal limit of a TPC, a general procedure is given for testing and identifying possible existence of a particular underlying mode of variation. The model allows for a further extension to discern the contributions of multiple modes of variation to TPCs through a web of genetic actions and interactions. The model and procedure are derived within the maximum likelihood context and implemented with the EM algorithm. Monte Carlo simulation studies are performed to explore the statistical properties of the model and validate its usefulness in practice.</p>

<h4>Mixture Model</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>To simplify the description of the model, we assume a backcross population in which there are only two contrast genotypes at each locus. The model can be readily extended to other more complicated designs, such as the F<sub>2</sub>, a full-sib family, a natural population and a structured pedigree with multiple founders. The backcross considered has <em>n</em> individuals, each genotyped with polymorphic markers for the construction of a linkage map. This map is used to identify the genome-wide distribution of QTL that control TPCs. All the backcross individuals are subjected to a multitude of temperature (say <em>T</em>), which cover the range suited for the species studied to grow normally. At each temperature, body mass or body size (in terms of length, width or volume) of the backcross is measured at multiple time points, from which the mean rate of growth is calculated. Thus, the relationship between growth rate and temperature describe the TPC which is modeled by a rational function.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>Suppose there is a putative QTL segregating with two different genotypes <em>Qq</em> (coded by 1) and <em>qq</em> (coded by 0) in the assumed backcross that affects the shape of TPCs. This QTL is located somewhere in the genome, which can be detected by the linkage map. Assume the QTL to reside between a pair of flanking markers <strong>M</strong><sub>1</sub> and <strong>M</strong><sub>2</sub> each with two genotypes coded by 1 and 0. For each backcross individual, it may carry one (and only one) QTL genotype, 1 or 0. The probability of a particular individual (<em>i</em>) to carry QTL genotype 1 or 0 depends on the marker genotype of this individual at two flanking markers (<strong>M</strong><sub>1</sub> and <strong>M</strong><sub>2</sub>) that bracket the QTL. Let <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>r</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>r</em> be the recombination fractions between <strong>M</strong><sub>1</sub> and QTL, between QTL and <strong>M</strong><sub>2</sub> and between the two markers, respectively. Under the assumption of independent crossovers, we derive the probability of a QTL genotype given a marker genotype as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>Because each individual has a known marker genotype, 11, 10, 01 or 00, these conditional probabilities are generally expressed by ω<sub>1|<em>i</em></sub> and ω<sub>0|<em>i</em></sub>.</p>

<h4>Modeling the Mean-Covariance Structures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Functional mapping models the mean vector and the structure of covariance matrix for longitudinal traits. The genotypic means for growth rate over a range of continuous temperatures can be specified by a biologically meaningful mathematical equation. In a thermal experiment for brown trout, Ojanguren et al. <a href="#pone.0000554-Ojanguren1">[21]</a> used a third-order polynomial function to sufficiently describe the thermal sensitivity of fish growth. Here, we use a rational function such that a general form of TPC across different temperatures for QTL genotype <em>j</em> is expressed as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e007&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(3)</span></span><br>where a combination of <em>a<sub>j</sub></em> and <em>b<sub>j</sub></em> describes the height and base width of the TPC and <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> and <em>d<sub>j</sub></em> describe the horizontal and vertical translation of the curve, respectively. If there are differences in a set of curve parameters, arrayed in <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e008&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>, between different genotypes at a QTL, this means that this QTL triggers an effect on TPCs. Further, by estimating different sets of parameters, three modes of variation for TPC, controlled by a hotter-colder, faster-slower and generalist-specialist QTL, respectively, can be elucidated (<a href="#pone-0000554-g001">Fig. 1</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>In statistics, theories and methods have been available to model the structure of covariances between measurements repeatedly made at a series of time points <a href="#pone.0000554-Diggle1">[22]</a>. Because of its elegant mathematical and statistical properties, the autoregressive process has been widely used for studies of longitudinal data measurements. The first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) model has been successfully applied to model the structure of the within-subject covariance matrix for functional mapping. The AR(1) model is basedon two simplified assumptions, i.e., variance stationarity – the residual variance (σ<sup>2</sup>) is unchanged over time points, and covariance stationarity – the correlation between different measurements decreases proportionally (in ρ) with increased time interval. Mathematically, the AR(1) is described as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e009&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>for the variance, and<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e010&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>for the covariance between any two time points <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>, where 0&lt;ρ&lt;1 is the proportion parameter with which the correlation decays with time lag. The parameters that model the structure of the covariance matrix are arrayed in Θ<em><sub>v</sub></em> = (ρ, σ<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>When the residual covariance matrix (<em>Σ</em>) is modeled by the AR(1) model, the closed forms can be derived for its inverse and determinant, which facilitate model computing and parameter estimating. The inverse <em>Σ</em><sup>−1</sup> is a tridiagonal symmetric matrix, whose diagonal elements are<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e011&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>and second diagonal elements are all<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e012&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>The determinant of the matrix is derived as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e013&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>Let <strong>z</strong><em><sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub> = [<em>z<sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub>(1),…,<em>z<sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub>(<em>T</em>)] = <strong>y</strong><em><sub>i</sub></em>−<strong>u</strong><em><sub>j</sub></em>, (<em>j</em> = 0,…,<em>j</em>), then we have<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e014&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>In practice, the two simplified assumptions of the AR(1) model may not hold so that the elegant expressions of the matrix cannot be used for functional mapping. To make longitudinal data well suited to the AR(1) model, some treatments are needed. For example, to remove the heteroscedastic problem of the residual variance, Carroll and Rupert's <a href="#pone.0000554-Carroll1">[23]</a> transform-both-sides (TBS) model is embedded into the growth-incorporated finite mixture model <a href="#pone.0000554-Wu2">[24]</a>, which does not need any more parameters. Both empirical analyses with real examples and computer simulations suggest that the TBS-based model can increase the precision of parameter estimation and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the TBS model preserves original biological means of the curve parameters although statistical analyses are based on transformed data.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>The TBS-based model displays the potential to relax the assumption of variance stationarity, but the covariance stationarity issue remains unsolved. Zimmerman and Núñez-Antón <a href="#pone.0000554-Zhao1">[25]</a> proposed a so-called structured antedependence (SAD) model to model the age-specific change of correlation in the analysis of longitudinal traits. The SAD model has been employed in several studies and displays many favorable properties for genetic mapping of dynamic traits <a href="#pone.0000554-Zimmerman1">[26]</a>.</p>


<h4>Likelihood and Estimation</h4>

All these unknowns are contained within the mixture model described by equation (1).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>The likelihood of phenotypic values measured at multiple temperatures can be written, in terms of a multivariate mixture model (1), as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e016&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e017&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> and <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e018&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>.

The iterations between the E and M steps are repeated until the estimates converge. The values at the convergence are regarded as the MLEs. In practice, the QTL position parameter (θ) can be viewed as a fixed parameter because a putative QTL can be searched at every 1 or 2 cM on a map interval bracketed by two markers throughout the entire linkage map. The log-likelihood ratio test statistic for a QTL at a particular map position is displayed graphically to generate a likelihood map or profile. The genomic position that corresponds to a peak of the profile is the MLEof the QTL location.</p>


<h4>Hypothesis Tests</h4>
<h5>Existence of a QTL.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>The merit of functional mapping includes the tests of a number of biologically meaningful hypotheses regarding the genetic and developmental control of dynamic traits. After the genetic parameters are obtained, we need to test whether there is a QTL that affects the shape of TPC. The existence of a QTL can be tested by formulating the following hypotheses:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e024&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(7)</span></span><br>where the null hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> states that the data can be fit with only one mean curve by parameters Θ<em><sub>u̅</sub></em> = (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>), whereas in the alternative hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> two distinct curves exist showing that there is a segregating QTL forTPC. The test statistic is the log-likelihood ratio (LR) of the full (<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) over reduced model (<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>), expressed as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e025&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where the tildes and hats denote the MLEs of the unknown parameters under the <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, respectively. Note that the estimation of (<em>Θ̂</em><em><sub>p</sub></em>, <em>Θ̂</em><em><sub>u</sub></em>, <em>Θ̂</em><em><sub>v</sub></em>) depends on both phenotypic values and marker data, whereas the estimation of <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000554.e026&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> only depends on phenotypic values. The critical threshold for the declaration of a QTL can be determined from permutation tests (Churchill and Doerge 1994).</p>

<h5>Type of QTL.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p1"></a><p>After a significant QTL for TPCs is identified, the next step is to test how this QTL affects the patterns of TPCs. Three different modes of variation are specified for thermal performance curves <a href="#pone.0000554-Huey2">[8]</a>. Each of these modes may be controlled by a different gene. The proposed model can be used to identify mode-specific QTL by formulating relevant hypotheses.

Thus, the rejection of the null hypothesis suggests that one QTL genotype performs better at all temperatures than the second genotype.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p2"></a><p>The identification of a so-called generalists-specialist QTL is more difficult, compared with that of the hotter-colder and faster-slower QTL.

<h4>Monte Carlo Simulation</h4>
<h5>Design.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec1.p1"></a><p>We performed simulation studies to investigate the statistical behavior of the proposed model. A backcross design with two genotypes 1 and 0 at each locus is simulated. We simulated 10 equally spaced markers, with the recombination fraction of <em>r</em> = 0.2 apart, to construct a linkage map of 229.87 cM. Assume that a putative QTL is located at 5.27 cM from the second marker (with the recombination fraction (<em>r</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.05) between the second marker and QTL). The first marker was randomly generated using Bernoulli (0.5). The succeeding markers were randomly generated using Bernoulli (<em>p</em>) where <em>p</em> depends on the genotype of the previous marker; that is, if the previous marker genotype was 0, then the next marker genotype was Bernoulli (<em>r</em>) and ifit was 1, then Bernoulli (1−<em>r</em>). The QTL was generated using Bernoulli (<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>) if the second marker genotype was 0 and Bernoulli (1−<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>), if it was genotype 1.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec1.p2"></a><p>The phenotypic values for TPCs are simulated by summing the QTL genotypic curves and multivariate-normally distributed residual errors with mean vector zero and covariance matrix Σ structured by the AR(1) model. The genotypic TPCs are assumed separately for different modes of variation in temperature-dependent performance, hotter-colder, faster-slower and generalist-specialist. Each mode corresponds to the control of a different QTL accordingly defined as the hotter-colder, faster-slower and generalist-specialist QTL. The TPC parameters that specify each of these modes for different types of QTL were chosen from the space of these curve parameters (see an example in <a href="#pone-0000554-g001">Fig 1</a>). The simulation studies were designed for different sample sizes (<em>n</em> = 100 and 400) and different heritabilities (<em>H</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.1 and 0.4). The covariance-structuring AR(1) parameters are given to assure the heritability of the phenotypic values at the middle temperature at <em>H</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.1 and 0.4.</p>

<h5>Results.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.sec2.p1"></a><p>The simulated marker and phenotypic TPC data are analyzed by the proposed model. By assuming a putative QTL at every 2 cM on the simulated linkage group, the log-likelihood ratio test statistics (LR) calculated for hypotheses (7) were plotted (<a href="#pone-0000554-g003">Fig. 3</a>). The peak of the LR profile corresponds to the MLE of the QTL location. The critical value for declaring the existence of a QTL was determined from 100 permutation tests.</p>
