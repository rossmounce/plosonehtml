                Figure 5.  Results from simulation scenarios for a hotter-colder QTL.Scenario 1–the coefficients of determination (R2) equal to 0.9–1.0 for all individuals; Scenario 2–R2 = 0.9–1.0 for a half of individuals and R2 = 0.5–0.6 for the other half; Scenario 3–R2 = 0.5–0.6 for all individuals. Upper panel: LR plotted over the interval of markers. Lower panel: Estimated (solid) and given (broken) TPCs for two different QTL genotypes.
