                Figure 1.  Experimental design for crosses and backcrosses performed with the E and Z strains to obtain the different lines – except BC11 – used in Experiment 2 and reported in Table 2.The BC11 line was obtained by crossing a female from the E strain with an F1 male from a female E×male Z cross. rE and rZ are the coefficient of relatedness of one female with E and Z parental strain, respectively.
