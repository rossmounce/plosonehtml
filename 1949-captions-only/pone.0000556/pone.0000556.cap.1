                Figure 1.  Spectral reflectance profiles of the violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee blue) artificial flowers used in colour preference tests.Reflectance can vary from 0 (no reflectance) to 1 (all incident light is reflected). Reflectance functions for each flower type were measured in 1 nm increments over the wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm using a spectrophometer (Ocean Optics S2000) with a deuterium/ halogen light source. Violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee blue) flowers differ in the position of their short wave reflectance peak, which are at wavelengths of 435 and 460 nm respectively. Differences in reflectance above 650 nm are not relevant for bees since their visual spectrum ends around that value [46], [47].
