Flowers were protected from visitation with gauze for 3 hours after being emptied by a <em>B. terrestris</em> worker <a href="#pone.0000556-Chittka3">[17]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000556-Raine2">[27]</a>. After the 3 hour exclusion period, the nectar volume was quantified for 30–60 flowers per species: nectar concentration was measured with a pocket refractometer (Atago HSR-500, Atago Co. Ltd., Japan). Data given here are the mean (± 1 SE) amounts of sugar produced (µg in 24 hours) by species in each bee-subjective colour category.</p>
