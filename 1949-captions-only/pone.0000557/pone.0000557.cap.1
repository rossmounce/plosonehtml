                Figure 1.  Haplotypes shared among different regions of the world.The area of the rectangles is proportional to the size of the sample from each region. Arrow widths are proportional to the percentage of haplotype sharing from one region to another and the percentages are displayed in the arrows. For instance, 50% of the haplotypes of Oceania are present in East Asia, 20% are present in America, 20% are present in Africa and 30% are present in Eurasia. In contrast only 7.4% of East Asian haplotypes are shared with Oceania. This asymmetry suggests that East Asia is a parental population of Oceania. This figure was inspired by a similar diagram in Conrad et al. [33].
