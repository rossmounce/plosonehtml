Arrow widths are proportional to the percentage of haplotype sharing from one region to another and the percentages are displayed in the arrows. For instance, 50% of the haplotypes of Oceania are present in East Asia, 20% are present in America, 20% are present in Africa and 30% are present in Eurasia. In contrast only 7.4% of East Asian haplotypes are shared with Oceania. This asymmetry suggests that East Asia is a parental population of Oceania. This figure was inspired by a similar diagram in Conrad et al. <a href="#pone.0000557-McDougall1">[33]</a>.</p>
