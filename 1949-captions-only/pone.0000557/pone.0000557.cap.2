                Figure 2.  (A) Median joining network of all the haplotypes found in 667 individuals from the HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel [6], color coded according to region of origin.(B) The same median joining network as in (A) with only the haplotypes containing the DXS2250 allele shown in color. The most widespread and most common haplotypes are concentrated on two clusters (arrows). (C) The same median joining network as in (A) with only the haplotypes containing the DXS2251 allele shown in color. The most frequent haplotypes belong to a cluster composed of 1,25,18,14,11 and 1,25,17,14,10 (arrows) and a few others.
