                Figure 3.  Results from BATWING analysis of the full data set (except Karitiana and Oceania samples).Posteriors histograms (shared bars) and prior densities (solid lines) shown for the mutation rate per generation for the four microsatellites (labels in figure) within the non-recombining region. Posterior histograms are from 200,000 BATWING outputs. Prior density is a gamma(1.35,740.4) for all four microsatellites.
