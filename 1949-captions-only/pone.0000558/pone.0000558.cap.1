Interphase FISH with chromosome-enumeration DNA probes: (A) two nuclei characterized by additional chromosomes Y and X and a normal nucleus; (B) a nucleus with monosomy of chromosome 15 and a normal nucleus; (C) a nucleus with monosomy of chromosome 18 and a normal nucleus. (D to G) interphase chromosome-specific MCB: nuclei with monosomy, disomy, trisomy and G-banding ideograms with MCB color-code labeling of a chromosome (from left to right), (D) - chromosome 9, (E) - chromosome 16, and (F) - chromosome 18. (G) interphase QFISH: (1) a nucleus with two signals for chromosomes 18 (relative intensities: 2058 and 1772 pixels), (2) a nucleus with one paired signal mimics monosomy of chromosome 18 (relative intensity: 4012 pixels), (3) a nucleus with two signals for chromosomes 15 (relative intensities: 1562 and 1622 pixels), (4) a nucleus with one signal showing monosomy of chromosome 15 (relative intensity: 1678 pixels).</p>
