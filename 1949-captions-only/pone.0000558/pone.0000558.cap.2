                Figure 2.  The frequency of chromosome losses and gains in the fetal human tissues exhibiting chromosomal mosaicism confined to the fetal brain.Aneuploidy frequency involving chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, X and Y was determined by interphase mFISH, MCB and PRINS techniques. (A) demonstration of selective chromosome X and chromosome Y gains, (B) demonstration of selective chromosome 15 loss, (C) demonstration of selective chromosome X loss, and (D) demonstration of selective chromosome 18 loss.
