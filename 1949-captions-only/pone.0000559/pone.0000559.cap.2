                Figure 2.  Effects of CDDO and CDDO-Im on apoptosis of human CLL and TRAF2DN/Bcl-2 cells.Human CLL cells (A) and splenocytes isolated from TRAF2DN/Bcl-2 transgenic mice (B) were cultured with or without CDDO and CDDO-Im at the indicated concentrations. Human CLL cells (n = 4) were obtained from 2 patients previously untreated with standard therapies (⋄ and X), one patient refractory to chlorambucil (▪) and one patient refractory to F-ara-A (Δ). Cells were harvested after 24 h, washed and incubated with Annexin-V-FITC and PI. Mouse splenocytes (n = 6) were also harvested after 24 h, but first they were incubated with APC-anti-B220 mAb for 30 min, then washed and incubated with Annexin-V-FITC and PI. Lymphocytes (A) or B lymphocytes (B220+ cells) (B) were gated and the percentage of apoptotic cells (Annexin V+) was determined by flow cytometry. The percentage of non-apoptotic viable cells is shown. Data were corrected for differences in spontaneous cell death.
