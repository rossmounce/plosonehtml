                Figure 3.  In vivo effect of CDDO and CDDO-Im on CLL/SBL cells and normal lymphocytes (A).Mice with leukemia were treated as indicated. Total numbers of circulating B cells (B220+) in blood were quantified 1–2 days before the beginning of the treatment (pre) and 7–10 days after the end of treatment (post). Statistical significance was determined by Student's two-tailed paired t-test. (B) Total numbers of circulating B (B220+) and T (CD4+) cells were quantified in blood before and after treatment with empty liposomes (n = 5), CDDO (20 mg/Kg; n = 5), or CDDO-Im at 5 (n = 6) or 10 mg/Kg (n = 9). The ratio of the concentration of cells before and after the treatment was calculated. Figure shows the average percentages ±SEM. (C). Wild-type mice were treated with 5 or 10 mg/Kg CDDO-Im and the concentration of B (B220+) or T (CD4+) lymphocytes in blood before and after the treatment was determined. Figure shows the average percentages ±SEM as described in B.
