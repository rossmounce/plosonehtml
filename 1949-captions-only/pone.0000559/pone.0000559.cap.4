Viability was assessed using an assay based on the alterations in the permeability of cells at different viability stages using a combination of DNA-binding dyes (ViaCount, Guava Technologies) and a Guava PCA96 fluorometer and analyzed with Guava's multi-caspase software. <strong>B.</strong> Representative flow cytometry profile of the viability of blood cells from mice treated with empty liposomes or liposomes containing CDDO-Im using Viacount (Guava Technologies). Analysis was performed with Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, OR). PM2 (red channel) shows nuclear staining of cells using a cell permeable dye. PM1 (yellow-orange channel) shows staining of non-viable cells with a non-cell permeable dye.</p>
