Mice were euthanized 7–10 days after the final drug administration, and the spleens were weighted. The average weight ±SEM of the spleens after the different treatments was: empty liposomes: 1405±133 mg, n = 7; CDDO: 937±117, n = 4; CDDO-Im (5 mg/Kg): 821±83, n = 4; and CDDO-Im (10 mg/Kg): 635±71 mg, n = 6. Statistical significance of liposomes vs CDDO (*, p = 0.04) and liposomes vs CDDO-Im (5 mg/Kg**, p = 0.013; 10 mg/Kg*** p = 0.0005) was determined using unpaired t-test. <strong>B.</strong> Total number of lymphocytes isolated from spleens of mice treated with empty liposomes (324±44.7×10<sup>6</sup>; n = 3) or with liposomes containing CDDO-Im (10 mg/Kg) (12.7±6.7×10<sup>6</sup>; n = 3) is shown.</p>
