                Figure 7.  Analysis of B cell populations in spleen and blood of leukemic mice treated with empty liposomes or liposomes containing CDDO (20 mg/Kg) or CDDO-Im (10 mg/Kg).Three-color flow-cytometry analysis was performed to determine the phenotype of B lymphocytes. Two different gates were used to identify normal B cells and CLL/SBL. First, lymphocytes were selected by gating the lymphocyte population in a forward scattered (FSC) and side scattered (SSC) plot (not shown). Then, B cell populations were identified by plotting B220 expression and FCS. Gate R1 contains cells with high expression of B220 (B220H) and small size (FSCL). Red dots within gate R1 were also contained in the lymphocyte gate and represent normal B cells. Gate R2 includes cells with medium expression of B220 (B220M) and larger in size (FSCM). Purple dots within gate R2 were also contained in the lymphocyte gate and represent CLL/SBL cells. The analysis of the lymphocyte populations expressing B220 and CD5 is also shown. Representative results are provided for mice that completed the treatment with each drug.
