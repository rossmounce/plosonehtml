Two different gates were used to identify normal B cells and CLL/SBL. First, lymphocytes were selected by gating the lymphocyte population in a forward scattered (FSC) and side scattered (SSC) plot (not shown). Then, B cell populations were identified by plotting B220 expression and FCS. Gate R1 contains cells with high expression of B220 (B220<sup>H</sup>) and small size (FSC<sup>L</sup>). Red dots within gate R1 were also contained in the lymphocyte gate and represent normal B cells. Gate R2 includes cells with medium expression of B220 (B220<sup>M</sup>) and larger in size (FSC<sup>M</sup>). Purple dots within gate R2 were also contained in the lymphocyte gate and represent CLL/SBL cells. The analysis of the lymphocyte populations expressing B220 and CD5 is also shown. Representative results are provided for mice that completed the treatment with each drug.</p>
