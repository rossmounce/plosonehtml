The percentages of the B220<sup>H</sup> FSC<sup>L</sup> normal B cells and of the B220<sup>M</sup> FSC<sup>M</sup> CLL/SBL cells were assessed by FACS (see <a href="#pone-0000559-g006">Figure 6</a>). The total number of CLL/SBL cells (white) and normal B lymphocytes (grey) in 3 mice treated with 10 mg/Kg CDDO-Im and 3 mice treated with empty liposomes is shown.</p>
