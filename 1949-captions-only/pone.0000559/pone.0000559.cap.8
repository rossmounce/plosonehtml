                Figure 8.  Determination of the total number of normal B lymphocytes and CLL/SBL cells in spleen of mice treated with empty liposomes or with CDDO-Im containing liposomes.The total number of B lymphocytes (CD45+/B220+) in spleen was quantified using a cell analysis and microfluorocytometer (Guava technologies). The percentages of the B220H FSCL normal B cells and of the B220M FSCM CLL/SBL cells were assessed by FACS (see Figure 6). The total number of CLL/SBL cells (white) and normal B lymphocytes (grey) in 3 mice treated with 10 mg/Kg CDDO-Im and 3 mice treated with empty liposomes is shown.
