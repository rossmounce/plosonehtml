                Figure 1.  Immune sera enhance MHV-68 infection of Fc receptor+ cells.A. BAC+ MHV-68 virions (4×106PFU/ml) were incubated (1 h, 37°C) with sera from MHV-68-immune C57BL/6 mice. The serum/antibody mixtures were then added to BHK-21 fibroblasts (1PFU/cell) or RAW264.7 macrophages (3PFU/cell). 18h later infection was measured by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. Each line corresponds to 1 serum sample, pooled from 2 mice. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. B. An equivalent experiment using sera from naive or MHV-68-immune BALB/c mice was analyzed by fluoresence microscopy. Each picture shows a 50% confluent culture of RAW264.7 cells. EGFP+ cells appear black. C. BAC+ MHV-68 virions and immune serum (20 µL/3×105PFU) were incubated together (1 h, 37°C) and then divided between BHK-21 cells (0.3PFU/cell), murine embryo fibroblasts (MEF, 0.3PFU/cell), RAW264.7 cells (1PFU/cell) and peritoneal macrophages (1PFU/cell). Viral eGFP expression in each population was determined 18h later by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. CD19+ peritoneal cells were always &lt;1% eGFP+. D. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells or 293T epithelial cells were infected with MHV-68 (3PFU/cell) that expressed eGFP-tagged gM and had been pre-treated with 1% MHV-68-immune or naive mouse serum. 21 h later, gM-eGFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry. Dendritic cells were CD11c+ and co-stained for MHC class II as shown.
