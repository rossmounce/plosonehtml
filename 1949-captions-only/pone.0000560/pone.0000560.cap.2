                Figure 2.  The effect of immune serum on macrophage infection depends on IgG Fc receptors.Wild-type and FceRIγ−/−FcγRIIB−/− (FcR−/−) bone marrow-derived macrophages were incubated overnight with BAC+ MHV-68 (5PFU/cell) that had been preincubated with dilutions of serum from either naive or MHV-68-immune mice, and then analyzed for viral eGFP expression by flow cytometry. The dashed lines show the level of infection with no antibody. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments.
