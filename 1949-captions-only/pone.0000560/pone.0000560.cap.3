                Figure 3.  MHV-68 glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies enhance the infection of Fc receptor+ cells.A. Purified BAC+ virions (106PFU/ml) were incubated (1 h, 37°C) either alone (virus only) or with isotyped-matched mAbs (all IgG2a at 10 µg/ml): gp150-T1A1, gH/gL-T2C12, gB-T7H9, gp48-6D10. MAbs LP2 (anti-HSV gD) and W6/32 (Anti-HLA-ABC) provided negative controls. The virion/antibody mixtures were added to RAW264.7 cells (3PFU/cell). Infection was quantitated 18h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. The data shown are representative of &gt;10 different experiments with at least 4 different mAbs tested for each viral protein. T2C12 is a neutralizing mAb, but 10 µg/ml corresponds to a sub-neutralizing dose for the amount of virus used. B. BAC+ MHV-68 virions were incubated (1 h, 37°C) with no serum (virus only), 1% MHV-68-immune serum (imm serum), or mAbs of different isotypes as indicated (10 µg/ml) and then added to RAW264.7 cells (5PFU/cell). Viral eGFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry 18h later. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. C. Wild-type (WT) and FceRIγ−/−FcγRIIB−/− (FcR−/−) bone marrow-derived macrophages were incubated overnight with BAC+ MHV-68 virions plus mAb dilutions as shown. T1A1 and T4G2 recognize gp150, 58-16D2 recognizes gp60 and Y3 is an H2-Kb-specific control. The dashed lines show infection with no antibody for WT (coarse dashes) and FcR−/− macrophages (fine dashes). The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. D. Wild-type (WT) or CD16−/−CD32−/−CD64−/− (FcR−/−) bone marrow-derived macrophages were left uninfected (nil) or infected (3PFU/cell) with BAC+ virions that had been preincubated or not (virus only) with gp150-specific mAbs as shown (T4G2, T1A1). Infection was quantitated 18 h later by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression. Virus alone typically gave eGFP expression in 1–2% of bone marrow macrophages. The bars show mean±SD results from 3 experiments.
