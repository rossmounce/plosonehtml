MAbs LP2 (anti-HSV gD) and W6/32 (Anti-HLA-ABC) provided negative controls. The virion/antibody mixtures were added to RAW264.7 cells (3PFU/cell). Infection was quantitated 18h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. The data shown are representative of &gt;10 different experiments with at least 4 different mAbs tested for each viral protein. T2C12 is a neutralizing mAb, but 10 µg/ml corresponds to a sub-neutralizing dose for the amount of virus used. <strong>B.</strong> BAC<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 virions were incubated (1 h, 37°C) with no serum (virus only), 1% MHV-68-immune serum (imm serum), or mAbs of different isotypes as indicated (10 µg/ml) and then added to RAW264.7 cells (5PFU/cell). Viral eGFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry 18h later. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. <strong>C.</strong> Wild-type (WT) and FceRIγ<sup>−/−</sup>FcγRIIB<sup>−/−</sup> (FcR<sup>−/−</sup>) bone marrow-derived macrophages were incubated overnight with BAC<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 virions plus mAb dilutions as shown. T1A1 and T4G2 recognize gp150, 58-16D2 recognizes gp60 and Y3 is an H2-K<sup>b</sup>-specific control. The dashed lines show infection with no antibody for WT (coarse dashes) and FcR<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages (fine dashes). The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. <strong>D.</strong> Wild-type (WT) or CD16<sup>−/−</sup>CD32<sup>−/−</sup>CD64<sup>−/−</sup> (FcR<sup>−/−</sup>) bone marrow-derived macrophages were left uninfected (nil) or infected (3PFU/cell) with BAC<sup>+</sup> virions that had been preincubated or not (virus only) with gp150-specific mAbs as shown (T4G2, T1A1). Infection was quantitated 18 h later by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression. Virus alone typically gave eGFP expression in 1–2% of bone marrow macrophages. The bars show mean±SD results from 3 experiments.</p>
