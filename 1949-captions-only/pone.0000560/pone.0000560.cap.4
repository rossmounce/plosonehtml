UI = uninfected; vir only = virus without antibody. 18 h later viral eGFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. <strong>B.</strong> BAC<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 was incubated with the gp150-specific mAb T4G2 (20 µg/ml) or with medium alone (1 h, 37°C) and then added to RAW264.7 cells (5PFU/cell). The cells were washed with PBS after 2h and then added to a 5-fold excess of uninfected RAW264.7 cells to monitor viral spread. Replicate cultures were analyzed for eGFP expression at the time points indicated. <strong>C.</strong> Replicate samples from the experiment in B, either with (+) or without (−) mAb preincubation for the initial infection, were divided into cell and supernatant (sup) fractions, frozen and thawed, and plaque assayed for infectious virus. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. <strong>D.</strong> MHV-68 virions were incubated (1 h, 37°C) with 20 µg/ml mAb T4G2 (VIR+mAb) or with medium alone (VIR only), then added to RAW264.7 cells (8 h, 37°C). The cells were then washed in pH = 3 citrate buffer to remove accessible virus and lysed. Viral DNA content was quantitated by real-time PCR. Each bar shows mean±SD of 4 replicates. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. <strong>E.</strong> MHV-68-gM-GFP was pre-incubated with mAb T1A1 (100 µg/10<sup>7</sup>PFU) (dotted line) or with medium only (1 h, 37°C) (dashed line), then added to RAW264.7 cells (5PFU/cell). The cells were washed with PBS after 4 h at 37°C, and assayed for gM-eGFP uptake by flow cytometry. <strong>F.</strong> gM-eGFP MHV-68 was incubated with RAW264.7 cells at different multiplicities with or without the gp150-specific mAb T7F5 (10 µg/ml). 4h later the cells were washed either in PBS or in pH = 3 citrate buffer (acid). gM-eGFP uptake was then assayed by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
