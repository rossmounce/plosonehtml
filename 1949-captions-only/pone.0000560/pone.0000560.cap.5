LPS (100 ng/ml) was added to the infected cells for the full 18h, for 4h following infection, or not at all (virus only). Viral eGFP expression was then quantitated by flow cytometry. The bars show mean±SD of 3 replicate cultures. Equivalent results were obtained in 3 repeat experiments with RAW264.7 cells and 3 further experiments with peritoneal macrophages. <strong>B.</strong> RAW264.7 cells were incubated overnight with BAC<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 virions (2PFU/cell) with no LPS, with LPS for 4h before assay, or with LPS for the whole 18h. There was either no additional treatment (virus only), or the cultures were supplemented with the gp150-specific mAb T1A1 (10 µg/ml) or with LP2-treated HSV-1 virions. LP2, kindly provided by Ms. S.Bell (Division of Virology), is a gD-specific IgG2a neutralizing mAb and was added at concentrations sufficient to ablate HSV-1 infectivity (data not shown). Viral eGFP expression was measured by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
