The macrophages were also treated or not with LPS (100 ng/ml). 18h later the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the ORF65-specific mAb 12B8 plus Alexa 568-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG pAb (red). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). eGFP was visualized directly (green). The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments, and similar results were obtained with RAW264.7 cells. <strong>B.</strong> Peritoneal macrophages were infected as in <strong>A</strong> but with MHV-68 expressing eGFP-tagged gM, then fixed and stained for ORF65. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments, and similar results were obtained with RAW264.7 cells. C. RAW264.7 cells were left uninfected (UI) or infected overnight (2PFU/cell) with either BAC<sup>+</sup> or gM-eGFP MHV-68. The cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for a further 4 h to maximize HCMV IE1 promoter activity, then fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 and stained for ORF65 with mAb 12B8 plus Alexa 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG pAb. Control = secondary antibody only. The percentage of cells in each quadrant is shown. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
