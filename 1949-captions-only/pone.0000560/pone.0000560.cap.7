The cells were then fixed and examined for eGFP expression (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The thick arrows show gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells and the thin arrows BAC<sup>+</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. <strong>B.</strong> RAW264.7 cells were infected with BAC<sup>+</sup>gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 at different multiplicities. 18 h later the cells were treated for 4 h with LPS (100 ng/ml). Total eGFP expression (BAC<sup>+</sup> eGFP plus gM-eGFP) was then quantitated by flow cytometry.</p>
