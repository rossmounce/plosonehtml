                Figure 7.  BAC+eGFP and gM-eGFP are differentially affected by LPS.A. RAW264.7 cells were infected with BAC+gM-eGFP+ MHV-68 (2PFU/cell, 18 h), then treated for 4 h with LPS (100 ng/ml). The cells were then fixed and examined for eGFP expression (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The thick arrows show gM-eGFP+ cells and the thin arrows BAC+ eGFP+ cells. B. RAW264.7 cells were infected with BAC+gM-eGFP+ MHV-68 at different multiplicities. 18 h later the cells were treated for 4 h with LPS (100 ng/ml). Total eGFP expression (BAC+ eGFP plus gM-eGFP) was then quantitated by flow cytometry.
