The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. <strong>B.</strong> Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were left uninfected (UI), infected overnight with wild-type (WT) or K3-deficient (K3<sup>−</sup>) MHV-68 at different multiplicities, or incubated with dilutions of the immunodominant H2-D<sup>b</sup>-restricted MHV-68 peptide p56, to relate viral recognition to an equivalent peptide concentration. A p56-specific lacZ<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridoma was added the next day and β-galactosidase expression assayed by ELISA after a further 20 h. Each bar shows mean±SD results of triplicate cultures. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. Similar results were also obtained with bone marrow-derived macrophages.</p>
