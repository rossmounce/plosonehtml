                Figure 8.  MHV-68 inhibits MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation in macrophages.A. RAW264.7 cells were infected overnight with gM-eGFP MHV-68 (2PFU/cell), treated or not with IFNγ (20 U/ml) for a further 24 h, then stained for cell surface MHC class I. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. B. Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were left uninfected (UI), infected overnight with wild-type (WT) or K3-deficient (K3−) MHV-68 at different multiplicities, or incubated with dilutions of the immunodominant H2-Db-restricted MHV-68 peptide p56, to relate viral recognition to an equivalent peptide concentration. A p56-specific lacZ+ T cell hybridoma was added the next day and β-galactosidase expression assayed by ELISA after a further 20 h. Each bar shows mean±SD results of triplicate cultures. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. Similar results were also obtained with bone marrow-derived macrophages.
