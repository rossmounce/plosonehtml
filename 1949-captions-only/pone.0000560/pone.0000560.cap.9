                Figure 9.  Lytically infected macrophages show multiple functional abnormalities.A. Peritoneal macrophages were infected overnight with gM-eGFP MHV-68 (2PFU/cell), treated or not with LPS (100 ng/ml) for a further 6h in the presence of brefeldin-A, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for IL-6 or TNF-α. Cells infected and stimulated the same way, but without brefeldin-A, were stained for CD86 without permeabilization. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. B. Peritoneal macrophages were left uninfected or infected overnight with gM-eGFP MHV-68 (2PFU/cell), then incubated with 0.2 µm Crimson (625/624) Fluospheres or Alexa 647-conjugated dextran (molecular weight 10 kDa). After 90 min at 4°C (for no endocytosis) or 37°C (for endocytosis) the cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. The infected populations were gated according to high gM-eGFP expression (thick red lines, corresponding to lytic infection) or low gM-eGFP expression (thin black lines, corresponding to no infection or latent infection) and then assayed for red fluorescence. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments.
