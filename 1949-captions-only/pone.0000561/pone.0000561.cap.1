                Figure 1.  Interconversion of 7α-hydroxy-, 7β-hydroxy- and 7-keto-DHEA by 11β-HSD1 in intact cells.HEK-293 cells transfected with a plasmid for 11β-HSD1 and either a control vector or a plasmid for H6PDH were incubated with 1 µM of 7α-hydroxy-DHEA (7α-OH-DHEA) (A), 7β-hydroxy-DHEA (7β-OH-DHEA) (B) or 7-keto-DHEA (C) in absence or presence of 11β-HSD1 inhibitor T0504, followed by determination of C7-oxygenated DHEA metabolites after 3 h (A–C). Alternatively, cells were incubated with either 7α-hydroxy-, 7β-hydroxy- or 7-keto-DHEA (7-oxo-DHEA) for 24 h, followed by determination of C7-oxygenated DHEA metabolites as described in Materials and Methods (D). Data are given as percentage of initially supplied substrate. A representative experiment from three independent transfections is shown. Hatched bars, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA; filled bars, 7β-hydroxy-DHEA, open bars, 7-keto-DHEA.
