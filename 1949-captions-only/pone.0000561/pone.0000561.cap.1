Alternatively, cells were incubated with either 7α-hydroxy-, 7β-hydroxy- or 7-keto-DHEA (7-oxo-DHEA) for 24 h, followed by determination of C7-oxygenated DHEA metabolites as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> (<em>D</em>). Data are given as percentage of initially supplied substrate. A representative experiment from three independent transfections is shown. Hatched bars, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA; filled bars, 7β-hydroxy-DHEA, open bars, 7-keto-DHEA.</p>
