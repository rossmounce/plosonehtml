The catalytic tyrosine and nicotinamide C4 are favorably positioned to interact with the C7α-hydroxyl and C11β-hydroxyl on chenodeoxycholic acid and corticosterone, respectively. The D rings in chenodeoxycholic acid and corticosterone are oriented towards the interior of 7α-HSD and 11β-HSD1, respectively.</p>
