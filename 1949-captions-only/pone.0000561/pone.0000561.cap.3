                Figure 3.  Superposition of 7β-hydroxy-DHEA on corticosterone in 11β-HSD1.In this model, the A ring of 7β-hydroxy-DHEA (7β-OH-DHEA) is oriented towards the interior of 11β-HSD1. The C7β-hydroxyl in 7β-hydroxy-DHEA superimposes nicely on the C11β-hydroxyl in corticosterone with equal predicted distances to C4 of the nicotinamide ring and the hydroxyl of the catalytic tyrosine.
