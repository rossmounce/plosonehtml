                Figure 5.  Reduction of 7-ketopregnenolone and 5α-androstane-3β-ol-7,17-dione by 11β-HSD1 in intact cells.HEK-293 cells transfected with a plasmid for 11β-HSD1 and either a control vector or a plasmid for H6PDH were incubated with 1 µM of 7-ketopregnenolone (A) or 5α-androstane-3β-ol-7,17-dione (5-ADION) (B) in absence or presence of 11β-HSD1 inhibitor T0504, followed by determination of the 7-keto- and 7-hydroxy-metabolites after 3 h (A,B) or 6 h (B). Data are given as percentage of initially supplied substrate. A representative experiment from three independent transfections is shown. (A) 7β-hydroxy-pregnenolone is shown as filled bars and 7-ketopregnenolone as open bars; (B) 5α-androstane-3β-ol-7,17-dione (5-ADION) after incubation for 3 h is shown as open bars, and after 6 h as closed bars.
