                Figure 1.  The abstract representation in our model of the network shown in Figure 1(a) is shown in Figure 1(b).The gene corresponding to each protein is represented by different colors. Each protein (colored gray) has a certain number of binding domains. For eg., protein P1 can bind to genes G1, G3 and G4 (showed by the colored bars). The red and green boxes refer to the effect of binding while the red and green circles refer to PTMs.: red represents repression and green, activation
