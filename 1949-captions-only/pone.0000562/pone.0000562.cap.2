<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>In order to identify the network that replicates the data, we used a genetic algorithm (GA) that finds the optimum connectivity between the genes and RNAP-cofactor complexes in the system under study. In this case, this equates to finding the best combination of domains in the g proteins and r RNAP-cofactor complexes that results in the minimization of the fitness function. The number of genes, RNAP-cofactor complexes and proteins are denoted by <em>g</em>, <em>r</em> and <em>p</em> respectively. Each protein is represented using <em>2g+2</em> bits (also called alleles) while each RNAP-cofactor complex is represented using g bits (alleles), one for each gene. The first <em>g</em> bits of each protein represent the binding domains to each of the <em>g</em> promoter regions (1 for presence and 0 for absence of the domains), while the next <em>g</em> bits indicate the type of regulatory action directed towards the respective proteins (1 for promotion and 0 for inhibition. The last 2 bits represent the effect of PTM, with bit 2<em>g</em>+1 representing the presence or absence of PTM and bit 2<em>g</em>+2 representing the nature of the PTM (1 for activating or 0 for inhibiting). For example a protein with a representation 1001 − 0001 − 11 (separated by a hyphen for ease of understanding) implies that it can bind to the promoter regions for genes 1 and 4 and that while the regulatory action is negative for gene 1, it is positive for gene 4 (since the first and fourth bits for the second half of the bitstring are 0 and 1 respectively. The protein also requires PTM for activation as suggested by the last two bits (11 implies that PTM is required and it is an activating modification). A similar representation is made for the RNAP-cofactor complex using one bit for each gene. The <em>p</em> proteins are encoded using a <em>(2g+2)p</em>-long bit string (<em>2g+2</em> bits for each protein) and we do the same for the RNAP-cofactor complexes using an <em>rg</em>-long bit string. The two encodings are then concatenated to give a chromosome of length <em>(2g+2)p+rg</em> bits (alleles). The fitness function to be minimized, <em>D</em>(<em>m, ê</em>) is given by the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the model values <em>m</em>, from the “pseudo” experimental values, <em>é</em> as: <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000562.e010&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where the number of samples is given by <em>n</em>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>Thus in our case, the fitness function itself is more like a “distance” function and will be referred to as such in the rest of the manuscript. As mentioned earlier, a GA was used to find the optimal network acting on the above-described representation. The GA is a stochastic global search method representing a metaphor of natural biological evolution. GAs operate on the population of potential solutions applying the principle of survival of the fittest to produce hopefully, better and better solutions <a href="#pone.0000562-Chipperfield1">[27]</a>. In each generation, a new set of approximations to the solution is created by a process of selecting individuals according to their level of fitness in the problem domain and breeding them together with operators borrowed from genetics such as crossover, mutations and selections. This process leads to the evolution of populations of individuals (solutions) that are better fitted to the problem domain than their predecessors thereby approaching an optimal solution.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>In this case, a population of 500 individuals was seeded. In each generation, two individuals in the population are chosen at random to mate in order to produce offspring. The crossover points in the chromosomes for the mating individuals are based on a certain crossover probability. Mutations can affect chromosomes that are not mating in a given generation with a certain mutation probability (0.8 in our case). Since the GA is a stochastic algorithm, the optimization needs to be done a number of times in order to obtain a ‘near-optimal’ solution. In our case, 25 different runs of the algorithm were carried out and the 6 runs with the smallest distance function values were selected.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4"></a><p>The optimization was carried out for two different cases:</p>


<ul class="bulletlist">

<li>In the first case, the kinetic parameters, represented here by the reaction probabilities, were kept the same as those for the run that generated the data. As a result only the network connections were optimized in order to obtain the network that has the smallest RMSD value.</li>

<li>In the second case, the search space included the 10 kinetic parameters as well as the network connections.</li>

Interestingly, both the optimized networks had a distance function value of 0; that is, the protein levels at the sampling points were identical to those produced by the template network. While a comparison of the two networks with the template shows some points of similarity, there are also significant differences in the wiring pattern. For example, in both the optimized networks, protein 2 requires an activating PTM in addition to that required by protein 1 whereas it is not so in the original network in which only protein 1 requires an activating PTM. In addition the network in</p>
