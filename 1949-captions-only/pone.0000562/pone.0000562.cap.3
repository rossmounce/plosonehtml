                Figure 3.  The original (template) network that gave rise to the data and the two best networks obtained from minimizing the error.Only the network connections were optimized in this case, with the kinetic parameters taking on the same values as those that generated the “data”. Both Optimized Network-1 (Figure 3(b)) and Optimized Network-2 (Figure 3(c)) had a value of 0 for the minimization function which was the RMSD of the model and the “data” values.
