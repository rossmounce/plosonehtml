                Figure 5.  Protein Levels for both experiments: (5(a)): The case where only the network connections are optimized.(5(b)): Case were network connections and reaction probabilities are optimized. Notice that in both cases, the protein expression patterns are very similar despite the differences in network connectivities as seen from Figures 3 and 4.
