                Figure 6.  The optimal (template) network and the best network inferred from minimizing the RMSD between the two expression levels.Only the network connectivities were optimized. All other parameters including the kinetic parameters were kept constant. Although the two networks are very similar, there is a slight difference in the activation of P1 and P2.
