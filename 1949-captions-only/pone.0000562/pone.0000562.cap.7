                Figure 7.  “Equilibrium” phase space for proteins 1, 3 and 4.The reaching of equilibrium was assessed by the stabilization of the protein levels on almost invariant values. In our case, the protein levels at a time corresponding to 300 seconds were assumed to indicate equilibrium levels. There is a lack of a clear separation of the protein levels from the three different networks.
