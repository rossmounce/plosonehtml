Runs 1–25 pertain to the template network, 26–50 to the first optimized network (R2) and runs 51–75 to the second optimized network (R3). The colors range from blue (very low correlation) to dark brown (high correlation). The fact that there is no clear discrimination between the networks implies that the protein levels obtained from the three networks occupy similar regions in phase-space.</p>
