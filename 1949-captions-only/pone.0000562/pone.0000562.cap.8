                Figure 8.  Correlation coefficient of the individual runs for the three different networks against one another.The correlation coefficients are computed as the correlation of the three protein levels for each run and plotted as a matrix with the different runs making up the abscissa and ordinate. Runs 1–25 pertain to the template network, 26–50 to the first optimized network (R2) and runs 51–75 to the second optimized network (R3). The colors range from blue (very low correlation) to dark brown (high correlation). The fact that there is no clear discrimination between the networks implies that the protein levels obtained from the three networks occupy similar regions in phase-space.
