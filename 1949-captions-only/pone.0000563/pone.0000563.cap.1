Areas predicted to be refugia are in green, areas not predicted are in gray, and hatching indicates approximate locations of ice sheets <a href="#pone.0000563-Ray1">[68]</a>. Gray lines indicate present day coastlines. (A) <em>Crotalus atrox</em> and (B) <em>Polioptia californica</em>, examples of significant overlap and minimal over-prediction. (C) <em>Elaphe obsoleta</em>, an example of lack of resolution in ENM predictions in cases of riverine barriers dividing likely LGM refugia. (D) <em>Desmognathus wrighti</em>, an example in which both LGM refugium reconstructions are minuscule and in close apposition (although non-overlapping).</p>
