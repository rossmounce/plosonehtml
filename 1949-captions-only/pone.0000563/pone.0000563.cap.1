                Figure 1.  Ecological niche modeling reconstructions of Pleistocene Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refugia for four taxa.Refugia identified in phylogeographic studies are shown as black outlines. Areas predicted to be refugia are in green, areas not predicted are in gray, and hatching indicates approximate locations of ice sheets [68]. Gray lines indicate present day coastlines. (A) Crotalus atrox and (B) Polioptia californica, examples of significant overlap and minimal over-prediction. (C) Elaphe obsoleta, an example of lack of resolution in ENM predictions in cases of riverine barriers dividing likely LGM refugia. (D) Desmognathus wrighti, an example in which both LGM refugium reconstructions are minuscule and in close apposition (although non-overlapping).
