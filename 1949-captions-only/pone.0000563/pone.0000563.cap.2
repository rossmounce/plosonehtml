For binary predictions, areas predicted as suitable at Last Glacial Maximum are shown in green, and those not so predicted are in gray. Hatching indicates approximate locations of ice sheets <a href="#pone.0000563-Ray1">[68]</a>, and dotted lines indicate present day coastlines. (A) Present day occurrences (black dots) and binary ENM prediction of <em>Myodes gapperi</em> using GARP, based on a threshold of 5 of 10 replicate models. (B) LGM projection of present-day ENM to climates reconstructed in CCSM model for <em>M. gapperi</em> using GARP. (C) LGM projection of present-day ENM to climates reconstructed in MIROC model for <em>M. gapperi</em> using GARP. (D) LGM binary prediction of <em>M. gapperi</em> from CCSM or MIROC models, using GARP threshold of 5. (E) LGM binary prediction of <em>M. gapperi</em> from CCSM or MIROC models, using Maxent threshold of 10. (F) Logical combination of GARP5 ‘and’ Maxent10 models for LGM prediction of <em>M. gapperi</em>.</p>
