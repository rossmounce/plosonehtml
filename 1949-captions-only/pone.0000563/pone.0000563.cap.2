                Figure 2.  Process diagram summarizing the assembly of ecological niche model predictions for Pleistocene distributions.For continuous predictions, colors shift from gray to green as prediction values increase from 0 to 10 (GARP) or 100 (Maxent). For binary predictions, areas predicted as suitable at Last Glacial Maximum are shown in green, and those not so predicted are in gray. Hatching indicates approximate locations of ice sheets [68], and dotted lines indicate present day coastlines. (A) Present day occurrences (black dots) and binary ENM prediction of Myodes gapperi using GARP, based on a threshold of 5 of 10 replicate models. (B) LGM projection of present-day ENM to climates reconstructed in CCSM model for M. gapperi using GARP. (C) LGM projection of present-day ENM to climates reconstructed in MIROC model for M. gapperi using GARP. (D) LGM binary prediction of M. gapperi from CCSM or MIROC models, using GARP threshold of 5. (E) LGM binary prediction of M. gapperi from CCSM or MIROC models, using Maxent threshold of 10. (F) Logical combination of GARP5 ‘and’ Maxent10 models for LGM prediction of M. gapperi.
