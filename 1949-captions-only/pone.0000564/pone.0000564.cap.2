                Figure 2.  The flgE Mutant Is Attenuated in SP-A+/+ Mice.(A) In vivo competition between the PA01 and flgE was assessed after intranasal pulmonary inoculation of 6-week old SP-A+/+ and SP-A−/− mice. The mean competitive index (CI) was calculated from bacterial colonies recovered 16 hr after infection. The competitive index (CI) is defined as the output ratio of mutant to wild-type bacteria divided by the input ratio of mutant to wild-type bacteria. Data are the mean±SE, n = 4. *p&lt;0.05. (B) Single respiratory tract infection of flgE mutant bacteria was performed by intranasal inoculation in SP-A+/+ and SP-A−/− mice. CFU were counted in lung homogenates 16 hr after inoculation. Data are the mean CFU±SE, n = 5. *p&lt;0.01.
