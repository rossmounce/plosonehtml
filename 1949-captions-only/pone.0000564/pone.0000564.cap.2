The mean competitive index (CI) was calculated from bacterial colonies recovered 16 hr after infection. The competitive index (CI) is defined as the output ratio of mutant to wild-type bacteria divided by the input ratio of mutant to wild-type bacteria. Data are the mean±SE, <em>n</em> = 4. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. (B) Single respiratory tract infection of <em>flgE</em> mutant bacteria was performed by intranasal inoculation in SP-A<sup>+/+</sup> and SP-A<sup>−/−</sup> mice. CFU were counted in lung homogenates 16 hr after inoculation. Data are the mean CFU±SE, n = 5. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
