                Figure 3.  SP-A-Mediated Opsonization Does Not Play A Critical Role in the Preferential Clearance of flgE Bacteria.(A) Analysis of in vivo phagocytosis was performed by intranasally inoculating live, GFP-expressing PA01 and flgE bacteria into SP-A+/+ and SP-A−/− mice (n = 3). Macrophages were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage 2 hr later. The percentage of macrophages with internalized bacteria was determined using a phase contrast fluorescence microscope. Two hundred macrophages were counted for each mouse. Data are the mean±SE, n = 3. *p&lt;0.05. (B) Analysis of in vitro phagocytosis was performed using live, GFP-expressing PA01 and flgE bacteria with alveolar macrophages isolated from SP-A−/− mice. The percentage of macrophages with internalized bacteria was determined using a phase contrast fluorescence microscope. Two hundred macrophages were counted for each mouse. Data are the mean±SE, n = 3. *p&lt;0.01. (C) In vitro phagocytosis of PA01 and flgE by human neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers. Phagocytosis experiments were performed as described for (A). Two hundred neutrophils were counted. Data are the mean±SE, n = 3. *p&lt;0.05. PMN = Neutrophils. M∅︀ = Macrophages.
