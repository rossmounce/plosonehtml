Macrophages were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage 2 hr later. The percentage of macrophages with internalized bacteria was determined using a phase contrast fluorescence microscope.

(B) Analysis of <em>in vitro</em> phagocytosis was performed using live, GFP-expressing PA01 and <em>flgE</em> bacteria with alveolar macrophages isolated from SP-A<sup>−/− </sup>mice. The percentage of macrophages with internalized bacteria was determined using a phase contrast fluorescence microscope. Two hundred macrophages were counted for each mouse.
