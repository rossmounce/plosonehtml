Bacterial cells from the wild-type PA01 and mutant strains <em>flgE, fliC</em> (PAO-fliC), and <em>fliD</em> (PAO-fliD) were exposed to 50 µg/ml human SP-A in the presence of the phosphatase substrate ELF97. Fluorescence was measured for 120 min using a fluorimeter and expressed as arbitrary units (<em>a.u.</em>). Data are the mean±SE, <em>n</em> = 6–8. The difference in membrane permeabilization between <em>flgE</em> mutant and PA01 was significant from 31<sup>st</sup>-min onward. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. The differences in membrane permeabilization between PAO-fliC and PA01, and between PAO-fliD and PA01 were both significant from 32<sup>nd</sup>-min onward, respectively. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. (D) Genetic complementation of flagellar function restores resistance to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization. PAOC-fliC (open square), a <em>fliC</em> mutant harboring a copy of wild-type <em>fliC</em> gene is as resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization as the parental strain PA01 (open circle). Data are the mean±SE, <em>n</em> = 6. The differences in membrane permeabilization between <em>fliC</em> and PA01, and between <em>fliC</em> and PAOC-fliC, were significant from 32<sup>nd</sup>-min, and 34<sup>th</sup>-min onward, respectively. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
