                Figure 4.  SP-A Preferentially Permeabilizes Flagellum-Deficient Mutants of P. aeruginosa.(A–C) SP-A preferentially permeabilizes flagellum-deficient flgE, fliC and fliD mutants. Bacterial cells from the wild-type PA01 and mutant strains flgE, fliC (PAO-fliC), and fliD (PAO-fliD) were exposed to 50 µg/ml human SP-A in the presence of the phosphatase substrate ELF97. Fluorescence was measured for 120 min using a fluorimeter and expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.). Data are the mean±SE, n = 6–8. The difference in membrane permeabilization between flgE mutant and PA01 was significant from 31st-min onward. *p&lt;0.05. The differences in membrane permeabilization between PAO-fliC and PA01, and between PAO-fliD and PA01 were both significant from 32nd-min onward, respectively. *p&lt;0.05. (D) Genetic complementation of flagellar function restores resistance to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization. PAOC-fliC (open square), a fliC mutant harboring a copy of wild-type fliC gene is as resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization as the parental strain PA01 (open circle). Data are the mean±SE, n = 6. The differences in membrane permeabilization between fliC and PA01, and between fliC and PAOC-fliC, were significant from 32nd-min, and 34th-min onward, respectively. *p&lt;0.05.
