                Figure 5.  SP-A Directly Kills flgE by Membrane Permeabilization.(A) Live/dead staining was performed on E. coli K12, PA01 and flgE cells following incubation with 50 µg/ml SP-A. Green-stained cells are alive whereas red-stained cells are dead. Robust aggregation of E. coli K12 but not P. aeruginosa strains by SP-A was observed. (B) Enumeration of live or dead bacteria following a 1 h exposure to hSP-A. At least 1,000 bacterial cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope. The mean±SD of two experiments is shown.
