Green-stained cells are alive whereas red-stained cells are dead. Robust aggregation of <em>E. coli K12</em> but not <em>P. aeruginosa</em> strains by SP-A was observed. (B) Enumeration of live or dead bacteria following a 1 h exposure to hSP-A. At least 1,000 bacterial cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope. The mean±SD of two experiments is shown.</p>
