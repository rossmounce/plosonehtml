The wild-type strain PA01was used as control for motility assay. (C–D) Both CF51N and CF90N were more resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization than their parental isolates, CF51 and CF90, respectively. Data are the mean±SE, <em>n</em> = 8 for each bacterial strain. The differences in membrane permeabilization between CF51 versus PA01; CF51 versus CF51N; and CF51N versus PA01 were significant from 43<sup>rd</sup>-min, 53<sup>rd</sup>-min and 53<sup>rd</sup>-min onward, respectively. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. The difference in membrane permeabilization between CF90 versus PA01; CF90 versus CF90N; and CF90N versus PA01 was significant from 38<sup>th</sup>-min, 28<sup>th</sup>-min, and 43<sup>rd</sup>-min onward, respectively. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
