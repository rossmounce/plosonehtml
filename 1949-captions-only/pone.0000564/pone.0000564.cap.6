                Figure 6.  Nonmucoid Motile Revertants of Clinical CF P. aeruginosa Strains Are More Resistant to SP-A-Mediated Membrane Permeabilization Than Their Parental Isolates.(A–B) The mucoid clinical CF P. aeruginosa strains CF51 and CF90 were nonmotile, whereas their nonmucoid motile revertants CF51N and CF90N had regained their flagellar-based motility on swimming motility agar plates. The wild-type strain PA01was used as control for motility assay. (C–D) Both CF51N and CF90N were more resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization than their parental isolates, CF51 and CF90, respectively. Data are the mean±SE, n = 8 for each bacterial strain. The differences in membrane permeabilization between CF51 versus PA01; CF51 versus CF51N; and CF51N versus PA01 were significant from 43rd-min, 53rd-min and 53rd-min onward, respectively. *p&lt;0.05. The difference in membrane permeabilization between CF90 versus PA01; CF90 versus CF90N; and CF90N versus PA01 was significant from 38th-min, 28th-min, and 43rd-min onward, respectively. *p&lt;0.05.
