                Figure 7.  Susceptibility to SP-A-Mediated Membrane Permeabilization Is Dependent on Intact Flagellum Structure but Independent of Flagellar-Mediated Swimming Motility.(A) Wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and its isogenic derivative δmotAB, δmotCD and δmotAB, δmotCD were tested for swimming motility and susceptibility to SP-A-mediate membrane permeabilization. Mutant strains δmotAB and δmotCD were motile, but δmotAB, δmotCD was nonmotile on swimming motility agar plate. (B) All δmotAB, δmotCD and δmotAB, δmotCD mutant strains were resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization, indicating that susceptibility to SP-A is independent of flagellar-mediated motility. (C) The flgK mutant, which could not assemble flagellum, was nonmotile. (D) The flgK mutant was susceptible to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization. Data were the mean±SE, n = 8 for each bacterial strain. The difference in membrane permeabilization between flgK and PA14 was significant from 31st-min onward. *p&lt;0.05.
