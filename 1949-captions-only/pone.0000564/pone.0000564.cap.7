Mutant strains δ<em>motAB</em> and δ<em>motCD</em> were motile, but δ<em>motAB</em>, δ<em>motCD</em> was nonmotile on swimming motility agar plate. (B) All δ<em>motAB</em>, δ<em>motCD</em> and δ<em>motAB</em>, δ<em>motCD</em> mutant strains were resistant to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization, indicating that susceptibility to SP-A is independent of flagellar-mediated motility. (C) The <em>flgK</em> mutant, which could not assemble flagellum, was nonmotile. (D) The <em>flgK</em> mutant was susceptible to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization. Data were the mean±SE, <em>n</em> = 8 for each bacterial strain. The difference in membrane permeabilization between <em>flgK</em> and PA14 was significant from 31<sup>st</sup>-min onward. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
