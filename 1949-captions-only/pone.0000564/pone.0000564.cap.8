The induction of LPS biosynthesis was measured using a monocloncal antibody against the inner core sugars and B-band O-antigen of LPS. The fold of increase was quantified against controls using a densitometer. (C) Flagellar mutants are more susceptible to cell lysis by SDS. Wild-type PA01 and the complemented PAOC-fliC strains are more resistant to 0.25% SDS than the flagellum-deficient mutants <em>flgE, fliC</em> and <em>fliD</em>. Experiments were repeated five times with similar results. The results from one typical experiment are shown.</p>
