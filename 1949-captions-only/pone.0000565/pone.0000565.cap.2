                Figure 2.  Midline incision is critical in mitigating the outcome in severe contusion injury.Plotted are the percent of damaged area in 5 severely contused cord-groups: control, and with midline slits at either 1, 2, 4, or 24 h postinjury (n = 8 per group). Note, myelotomy at 3 time points, 1-4 h, significantly reduced the lesion size and altered the outcome of injury: * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. Error bars, SEM.
