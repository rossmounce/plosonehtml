                Figure 3.  Structural repair by radiation therapy made possible by myelotomy.Micrographs of thionin-stained sagittal sections through normal intact cord and through the epicenter of 3 differently treated severely contused cords seen 90 days postinjury: A. normal; B. control, CNTS; C. incision, CNTS+TOMY; and D. incision followed by radiation therapy, CNTS+TOMY+XRAY. E. Schematic cartoon of the critical role of midline slits in making repair possible (compare with figure 1D); once the secondary damage is halted intrinsic repair can be facilitated by radiation therapy. Note, the tissue preservation and the substantial wound repair in the irradiated cord which contains in its epicenter motoneurons and other neuronal cells. Abbreviations: contusion  =  CNTS; myelotomy  =  TOMY; and radiation therapy  =  XRAY. Bar  =  3 mm.
