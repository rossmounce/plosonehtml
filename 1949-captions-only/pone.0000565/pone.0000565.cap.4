                Figure 4.  Midline incision is critical for facilitating repair in severe contusion injury: Ex vivo quantitative data.Degree of tissue preservation/repair, as measured by area of remaining tissue, in 3 differently treated severely contused cords: control, CNTS (n = 6); incision, CNTS+TOMY (unirradiated, n = 10); and incision followed by radiation therapy, CNTS+TOMY+XRAY (irradiated, n = 7). These 3 groups were either A. without training or B. with treadmill exercised. Note, tissue preservation was enhanced by midline incision from 19% to 26.1%, and radiation therapy increased it to 35% of the normal tissue; further treadmill exercising increased it in the unirradiated from 26.1% to 35% and in the irradiated from 35% to 56.3%. Abbreviations: contusion  =  CNTS; myelotomy  =  TOMY; and radiation therapy  =  XRAY. Significance, * p &lt; 0.05. Error bars, SD.
