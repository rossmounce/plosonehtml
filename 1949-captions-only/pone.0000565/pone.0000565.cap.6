Midline incision and treadmill exercising both increased the hindlimb locomotor performance: going from a severe paralysis of the hindlimb joints to a complete control of the hindlimb movement as defined by Basso et al. <a href="#pone.0000565-Basso2">[19]</a>; at about 2 months postinjury enhancement became significant and remained thereafter as such for some of the time points tested. Note, comparison for significance was performed between the following: cnts+tomy vs. cnts group; and cnts+tomy+train vs. cnts+tomy group. Significance, * <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05. Abbreviations: contusion  =  cnts; myelotomy  =  tomy; and radiation therapy  =  xray.</p>
