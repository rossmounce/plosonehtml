                Figure 6.  Hindlimb locomotor function improved by myelotomy and exercising.The BBB locomotor scores of the 4 differently treated severely contused groups: -⧫- no further treatment (cnts), -•- midline incision (cnts+tomy), -▴- incision and exercise (cnts+tomy+train), and -⊠- incision followed by radiation therapy and exercise (cnts+tomy+xray+train) are plotted as a function of time postinjury. Midline incision and treadmill exercising both increased the hindlimb locomotor performance: going from a severe paralysis of the hindlimb joints to a complete control of the hindlimb movement as defined by Basso et al. [19]; at about 2 months postinjury enhancement became significant and remained thereafter as such for some of the time points tested. Note, comparison for significance was performed between the following: cnts+tomy vs. cnts group; and cnts+tomy+train vs. cnts+tomy group. Significance, * p &lt; 0.05. Abbreviations: contusion  =  cnts; myelotomy  =  tomy; and radiation therapy  =  xray.
