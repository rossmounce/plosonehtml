                Figure 2.  Relationships between mean male quality and female mate choice, mass loss and follicle size.Female marine iguanas that spent more time on the territories of high-quality, high activity males (a) spent more energy on mate choice (r = 0.731, n = 10, P = 0.016), (b) lost more body mass during the mate choice period (r = 0.646, n = 15, P = 0.009), and (c) displayed a trend towards producing smaller follicles (r = −0.660, n = 11, P = 0.027). Males were assigned quality scores (1–5) based on copulation success. Data represent the mean quality score of the males a female visited, weighted for time spent with each male.
