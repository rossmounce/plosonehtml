                Figure 2.  Relative transcription of PmpD.Total RNA was isolated from C. trachomatis serovar L2 infected McCoy cells at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 35, and 48 h p.i., random primed, and assayed by real time RT-PCR for 16S rRNA and pmpD copy number. Averaged pmpD copy numbers were indicated relative to the rRNA numbers at the same time points. Error bars were based on the standard error of the mean [26].
