                Figure 4.  Fluorescent photographs of McCoy cells infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2.McCoy cells were methanol fixed at 24 (A, C, and E), and 48 (B, D, and F) h p.i. and probed with pAb against fragment 2 of PmpD (A and B), anti-MOMP PAb (C and D) and rabbit pre-immune sera (E and F). Ring shaped RBs of Chlamydia stained with anti-PmpD pAb indicate surface localization of PmpD in Chlamydia. Note: the lack of staining in the infected cell cytoplasm indicating that PmpD is not transported outside the inclusion. The Figure was scanned using Image Pro-Plus 4.1 and prepared with Adobe Photoshop 6.0.
