                Figure 5.  Fluorescent photographs of unfixed RBs and EBs of C. trachomatis serovar L2.RBs (A, B, and C) and EBs (D, E, and F) were harvested and purified at 24 and 48 h p.i. respectively, and probed with pAb against fragment 2 of PmpD (A and D), anti-MOMP pAb (B and E), and rabbit pre-immune sera (C and F). Staining of EBs with anti-PmpD pAb was negligible while anti-MOMP Pab stained both RBs and EBs indicating that the PmpD passenger domain may be secreted during the conversion of RBs into EBs. The Figure was scanned using Image Pro-Plus 4.1 and prepared with Adobe Photoshop 6.0.
