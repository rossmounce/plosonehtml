                Figure 6.  PmpD translation, processing, and secretion.McCoy cells infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2 were harvested at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after infection and soluble and insoluble protein fractions separated. A. The insoluble fractions were loaded for equal MOMP amounts. B. The soluble fractions were loaded as described in METHODS. Both nitrocellulose membranes were reacted with antibodies against fragment 2 of PmpD. Lane 1, 0 h p.i. (uninfected cells). Lane 2, 6 h p.i. Lane 3, 12 h p.i. Lane 4, 24 h p.i. Lane 5, 36 h p.i. Lane 6, 48 h p.i. Reaction of MOMP used for the total protein normalization in the insoluble fractions, with anti-MOMP pAb is shown in a separate box. The quantity of MOMP was determined using the Packard Instrument OptiQuant software (version 03.10).
