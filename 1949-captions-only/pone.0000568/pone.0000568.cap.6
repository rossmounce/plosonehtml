A. The insoluble fractions were loaded for equal MOMP amounts. B. The soluble fractions were loaded as described in METHODS. Both nitrocellulose membranes were reacted with antibodies against fragment 2 of PmpD. Lane 1, 0 h p.i. (uninfected cells). Lane 2, 6 h p.i. Lane 3, 12 h p.i. Lane 4, 24 h p.i. Lane 5, 36 h p.i. Lane 6, 48 h p.i. Reaction of MOMP used for the total protein normalization in the insoluble fractions, with anti-MOMP pAb is shown in a separate box. The quantity of MOMP was determined using the Packard Instrument OptiQuant software (version 03.10).</p>
