Both nitrocellulose membranes were reacted with pAb against fragment 2 of PmpD. A. Lines 1–5, the insoluble fractions were loaded for equal MOMP amounts (reaction with MOMP is shown in the small box). Lines 6–10, soluble fractions were loaded as described in METHODS. Lane 1 and 6, 0 penicillin. Lane 2 and 7, 0.01 U/ml penicillin. Lane 3 and 8, 0.1 U/ml penicillin. Lane 4 and 9, 1 U/ml penicillin. Lane 5 and 10, 10 U/ml penicillin. Note: a doublet of protein bands with molecular weights of ≈160 and 157 kDa is visible in both the insoluble and soluble fractions corresponding to penicillin concentrations of 0.1 U/ml and higher. B. Soluble fractions were loaded as described in METHODS. Lane1, 0 penicillin. Lane 2, 0.01 U/ml penicillin. Lane 3, 0.1 U/ml penicillin. Lane 4, 1 U/ml penicillin. Lane 5, 10 U/ml penicillin (indicated concentrations of penicillin were used before penicillin removal at 24 h p.i.). The quantity of MOMP and PmpD was determined using the Packard Instrument OptiQuant software (version 03.10).</p>
