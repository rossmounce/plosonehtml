                Figure 1.  Gluc as a reporter in mammalian cells.(A) Schematic representation of the expression cassettes for Gluc-IRES-CFP cloned in the CSCW lentivirus vector. (B) High infection rate of cells with lentivirus vectors (M.O.I. = 30) as monitored by cerulean fluorescence. Scale bar, 100 µm. (C) Levels of Gluc activity in cells vs. medium vs. cells+medium. 293T cells were infected with the lentivirus vector carrying the expression cassette for Gluc-IRES-CFP and 20,000 cells were plated in wells of a 96-well plate. 48 hrs post-infection, new medium was added to the wells and Gluc activity was measured 24 hrs later in conditioned medium, viable washed cells or cells+conditioned medium after adding 2.5 µM coelenterazine.
