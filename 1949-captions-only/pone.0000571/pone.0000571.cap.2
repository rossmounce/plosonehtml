Gluc activity was monitored over time in 10 µL of conditioned medium after addition of 20 µM coelenterazine. The release of Gluc to the conditioned medium is linear with time. (B) 293T cells were co-transfected with pHGC-Fluc and either pHGC-Gluc or pSEAP expression plasmids. Gluc and SEAP activities were assayed in conditioned medium 24 hrs later. The signal over background ratio (S/B) values, normalized to the intracellular levels of Fluc, are plotted against the number of cells. The Gluc assay can detect a single cell with S/B of 40 whereas the SEAP assay requires 20,000 cells to get similar S/B under similar assay conditions. The mean ± S.E.M. is presented on the graphs (n = 3).</p>
