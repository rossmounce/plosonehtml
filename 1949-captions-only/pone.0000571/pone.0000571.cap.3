Cells were treated for 24 hrs with different drugs which interfere with the secretory pathway. (A) Cell-free conditioned media were assayed for Gluc activity which showed that Gluc secretion is decreased upon blocking the secretory pathway. *p≤0.01 as predicted by student T-test. (B) Immunocytochemistry on cells expressing Gluc with and without treatment with BFA showing that Gluc (cy3, red) co-localizes with the ER marker PDI (Alexa488, green). Scale bar, 10 µm.</p>
