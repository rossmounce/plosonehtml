                Figure 3.  Gluc as a reporter to monitor secretory pathway.293T cells were infected with the lentivirus vector expressing Gluc and were plated in wells of 96-well plate. Cells were treated for 24 hrs with different drugs which interfere with the secretory pathway. (A) Cell-free conditioned media were assayed for Gluc activity which showed that Gluc secretion is decreased upon blocking the secretory pathway. *p≤0.01 as predicted by student T-test. (B) Immunocytochemistry on cells expressing Gluc with and without treatment with BFA showing that Gluc (cy3, red) co-localizes with the ER marker PDI (Alexa488, green). Scale bar, 10 µm.
