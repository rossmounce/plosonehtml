(A) Real-time RT-PCR for spliced XBP-1 mRNA which increased in response to &gt;1 mM DTT 4 hrs after treatment. Fold induction is calculated with respect to the control non-infected/non-treated cells. (B&amp;F) Western blot analysis showing upregulation of BiP and/or phosphorylated eIF2alpha levels in response to ER stress 24 hrs after treatment. Blot is also probed with Gluc antibody as well as beta-tubulin antibody for equal loading. (C&amp;E) Conditioned medium assayed for Gluc activity 4 hrs after DTT or thapsigargin treatment showing that Gluc secretion is decreased in response to ER stress. (D) Untreated or treated cells with 1 mM DTT were monitored overtime for the level of Gluc secretion by assaying an aliquot of the conditioned medium for Gluc bioluminescence. The mean ± S.E.M. is presented on the graphs (n = 3), with *p≤0.01 as calculated by the student's t-Test.</p>
