                Figure 1.  Polo::GFP dynamics during cell division.Selected images from time-lapse recordings of Drosophila S2 cells expressing a Polo::GFP transgene. The arrows indicate the centrosomes and the arrowheads the spindle midzone. The bracket marks the diffused localization of Polo::GFP along the central spindle microtubules. Time is in min:sec relative to anaphase onset. Bar, 10 Âµm.
