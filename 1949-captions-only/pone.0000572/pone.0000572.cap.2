                Figure 2.  Polo::GFP does not localize to the spindle midzone after depletion of Feo or Klp3A.Selected images from time-lapse recordings of Drosophila S2 cells expressing a Polo::GFP transgene after RNAi depletion of Pav (pav RNAi), Feo (feo RNAi) and Klp3A (klp3A RNAi). Cells were treated for 48 hours with dsRNAs directed against Pav or 72 hours with dsRNAs directed against Feo and Klp3A or with no dsRNA (control). The arrowheads indicate the spindle midzone. Time is in min:sec relative to anaphase onset. Bar, 10 Âµm.
