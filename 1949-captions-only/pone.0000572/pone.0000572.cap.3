                Figure 3.  feo RNAi specifically disrupts Polo localization to the spindle midzone.(A) Pav::GFP accumulates to the spindle midzone after feo RNAi. Selected frames from a time-lapse series showing PAV::GFP localization in S2 cells after depletion of Feo. Cells were treated for 72 hours with dsRNAs directed against Feo and then recorded to visualize Pav dynamics during cytokinesis. The white arrowheads mark the spindle midzone. Time is in min:sec relative to anaphase onset. Bar, 10 µm. (B) Simultaneous detection of Polo::GFP and Pav after RNAi depletion of Pav (pav RNAi) and Feo (feo RNAi). Cells expressing Polo::GFP were treated for 48 hours with dsRNAs directed against Pav or 72 hours with dsRNAs directed against Feo or with no dsRNA (control). The cells were then fixed and stained to detect GFP (green in the merged panels), DNA (blue in the merged panels) and Pav (red in the merged panels). Bar, 10 µm.
