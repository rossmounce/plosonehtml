                Figure 4.  Polo co-localizes with Feo and Klp3A during cytokinesis.Localization of Feo and Klp3A during early and late telophase in S2 cells expressing Polo::GFP. Cells were fixed and stained to detect GFP (green in the merged panels), DNA (blue in the merged panels) and either Feo or Klp3A (red in the top and bottom merged panels respectively). Bar, 10 Âµm.
