                Figure 5.  Feo and Klp3A form a complex in S2 cells.(A) Colloidal coomassie stained gel of Feo::PtA purifications from cells treated with (+) or without (−) the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and in the presence (+) or absence (−) of PPI in the lysis buffer. Feo::PtA, Klp3A and the IgG heavy (hc) and light (lc) chains are indicated. The numbers on the left indicate the size in kD of the molecular weight marker. (B) Western blots of the pull down assays from cells expressing Feo::PtA (+) or only PtA (−). The Feo::PtA purifications were performed in the presence (+) or absence (−) of PPI in the lysis buffer. The same membrane was first incubated with a mouse monoclonal Polo antibody (bottom; which also detected the IgG heavy chain) and subsequently with a Klp3A rabbit antibody (top) that cross-reacted with the IgG binding domains present in Feo::PtA.
