                Figure 1.  TRPC channel structure and mechanisms of activation.Schematic showing the six transmembrane structure of the nonselective cation channels, TRPC4 and 5, and the conserved N-terminal ankryin and C-terminal TRP, CIRB, and PDZ domains. The channels are proposed to be activated by releases of intracellular Ca2+ stores from the ER, conformational changes following binding of IP3 to IP3R, and vesicular translocation. The channels are inhibited by PKC and potentiated by La3+.
