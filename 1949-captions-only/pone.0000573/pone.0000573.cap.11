                Figure 11.  Induction of a nonselective cation current-mediated dADP in brain regions expressing high levels of TRPC mRNA and protein.(A) The group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG (50 uM; Red trace) induces a burst-triggered dADP in the prefrontal cortex (n = 6; p&lt;0.05), (B) Lateral septum (n = 4; p&lt;0.05) and (C) Subiculum (n = 6; p&lt;0.05). Black traces show the baseline before bath application of DHPG (A–D). The inset shows the response to a suprathreshold 600ms square wave input at 200pA or hyperpolarizing input at −100 pA in each cell region (A–D). (D) The lack of a DHPG-induced burst-triggered dADP in medium spiny neurons from the dorsal striatum (n = 6) or nucleus accumbens (n = 4), together labeled Striatum. All recordings were held between −65 and −70mV during the baseline and DHPG application. There were no qualitative differences in the dADP that varied according to the holding potential during the DHPG application in any brain region.
