                Figure 4.  Quantification of the cRNA labelling densities of TRPC4 and 5 in the cortical layers of rat.(A) (Left) In situ hybridization of TRPC4 in a rat coronal brain slice. (Right) In situ hybridization of TRPC5 in a rat coronal brain slice. Scale bars in µm. (B) (Upper) Magnification of TRPC4 5 cRNA labeling in the PFC layers. (Lower) Magnification of TRPC4 5 cRNA labeling in the SCx layers. (C) Quantification of the cRNA labelling densities of TRPC4 and 5 in the PFC and SCx layers expressed as a % change from background (n = 3). Scale bars in µm.
