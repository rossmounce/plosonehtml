                Figure 8.  Developmental and surface expression of TRPC5 protein in the mouse hippocampus.(A) Quantification of TRPC5 protein levels in the HIP of E18 through P48 day old mice. (n = 4) (Top inset) Representative bands from the immunoblot showing TRPC5 expression in the HIP of E18-P48 mice. (B) Representative bands from an immunoblots showing surface (cross-linked) and intracellular TRPC5 protein in P0 and P48 mice (n = 6). (C) Quantification of TRPC4 and 5 protein levels in the HIP of P0 and P48 mice (n = 6; for P0, p = 0.002; for P48, p = 3.16e-5) (top inset) Representative bands from an immunoblots showing TRPC4 and TRPC5 protein in the HIP of P0 and P48 mice (n = 6)
