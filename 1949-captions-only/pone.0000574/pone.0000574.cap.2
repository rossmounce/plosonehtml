                Figure 2.  Responses to contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli in the regions of interest.(A) The response (percent signal change relative to the fixation condition) in each ROI is shown for each stimulus condition (F: faces, O: objects, Se: scenes, Sa: scrambled images). (B) Preference index in each ROI averaged across all stimulus conditions. (C) Preference index in each ROI for the stimulus condition that elicited the strongest responses. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean across subjects.
