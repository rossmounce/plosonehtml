                Figure 1.  Sulf1 and Sulf2 gene trap alleles are hypomorphic.(A) Sulf1 retroviral insertion gene trap allele. The VICTR48 retrovirus inserted into position 12,733,618 of chromosome 1 (February 2006 (mm8) assembly of the mouse genome, UCSC Genome Browser), which corresponds to intron 2 of Sulf1. Primers a, b, and c correspond to Sulf1-F, Sulf1-R1, and LTR, respectively, and were used to genotype the mice. Primers d and e in the 3′ untranslated region refer to Sulf1-4535F and Sulf1-4611R, which were used for Q-RT-PCR amplification of the Sulf1 transcript. The position of the open reading frame is indicated by the taller boxes; the untranslated region is represented by the shorter boxes. Not to scale. (B) Sulf2 retroviral gene trap allele. The VICTR37 retrovirus inserted into position 165,818,084 of chromosome 2, which is intron 1 of Sulf2. Primers a, b, and c correspond to Sulf2-F2, Sulf2-R, and LTR2, respectively, and were used to genotype the mice. Primers d and e in the 3′ untranslated region refer to Sulf2-3364F and Sulf2-3428R, which were used for Q-RT-PCR amplification of the Sulf2 transcript. (C and D) Q-RT-PCR analysis of Sulf1 (C) and Sulf2 (D) in tissues from mice with different Sulf1 genotypes (white bars, Sulf1+/+; grey bars, Sulf1+/-; black bars, Sulf1-/-). The Cycle to Threshold (Ct) values for duplicate or triplicate samples were averaged. Each bar represents a single animal. After normalization to GAPDH or RPL19, relative Sulf1 expression levels (compared to an average of the two WT littermate controls analyzed) were calculated based upon the 2-ΔΔCt method [21]. MG refers to mammary gland. (E and F) Q-RT-PCR analysis of Sulf1 (E) and Sulf2 (F) expression in tissues from Sulf2+/+, Sulf2+/-, or Sulf2-/- adult mice. Analysis was done as described above for the Sulf1 mice. Abbreviation used: MG refers to mammary gland tissue.
