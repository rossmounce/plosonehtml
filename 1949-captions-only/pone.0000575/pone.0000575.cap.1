The VICTR48 retrovirus inserted into position 12,733,618 of chromosome 1 (February 2006 (mm8) assembly of the mouse genome, UCSC Genome Browser), which corresponds to intron 2 of <em>Sulf1</em>. Primers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> correspond to Sulf1-F, Sulf1-R1, and LTR, respectively, and were used to genotype the mice. Primers <em>d</em> and <em>e</em> in the 3′ untranslated region refer to Sulf1-4535F and Sulf1-4611R, which were used for Q-RT-PCR amplification of the <em>Sulf1</em> transcript. The position of the open reading frame is indicated by the taller boxes; the untranslated region is represented by the shorter boxes. Not to scale. (B) <em>Sulf2</em> retroviral gene trap allele. The VICTR37 retrovirus inserted into position 165,818,084 of chromosome 2, which is intron 1 of <em>Sulf2</em>. Primers <em>a, b</em>, and <em>c</em> correspond to Sulf2-F2, Sulf2-R, and LTR2, respectively, and were used to genotype the mice. Primers <em>d</em> and <em>e</em> in the 3′ untranslated region refer to Sulf2-3364F and Sulf2-3428R, which were used for Q-RT-PCR amplification of the <em>Sulf2</em> transcript. (C and D) Q-RT-PCR analysis of <em>Sulf1</em> (C) and <em>Sulf2</em> (D) in tissues from mice with different <em>Sulf1</em> genotypes (white bars, <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/+</sup>; grey bars, <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/-</sup>; black bars, <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup>). The Cycle to Threshold (Ct) values for duplicate or triplicate samples were averaged. Each bar represents a single animal. After normalization to GAPDH or RPL19, relative <em>Sulf1</em> expression levels (compared to an average of the two WT littermate controls analyzed) were calculated based upon the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method <a href="#pone.0000575-Livak1">[21]</a>. MG refers to mammary gland. (E and F) Q-RT-PCR analysis of <em>Sulf1</em> (E) and <em>Sulf2</em> (F) expression in tissues from <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/+</sup>, <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/-</sup>, or <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> adult mice. Analysis was done as described above for the <em>Sulf1</em> mice. Abbreviation used: MG refers to mammary gland tissue.</p>
