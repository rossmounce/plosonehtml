                Figure 2.  Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- mice have decreased body and kidney weights at birth and (for the few that survive) as adults.(A) Representative image of Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- and littermate control E18.5 day embryos just after birth, but prior to feeding. Note the pink skin-tone and apparently normal vascularization and circulation. (B) Quantification of embryo weight (mean±SEM) at E18.5. Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- embryos show a 19% decrease in weight. These embryos also have a 12% decreased crown-rump length (data not shown). Number of embryos analyzed were as follows: Control (pooled +/+;+/+, +/-;+/+, +/+;+/-, and +/-;+/- embryos), n = 31; Sulf1+/- Sulf2-/-, n = 32; Sulf1-/- Sulf2+/-, n = 26, and Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/-, n = 24. (C) Representative image of a typical small Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- 10-week-old male and a control littermate. Note the proportionate small stature and the lack of gross morphological differences. (D) Body weights (mean±SEM) of 15-week-old males. Weights of Sulf2-/- and Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- mice were ~20% and ~30% smaller, respectively, than controls. Number of adult males analyzed were as follows: Controls (Sulf1+/- Sulf2+/-), n = 26; Sulf1+/- Sulf2-/-, n = 8; Sulf1-/- Sulf2+/-, n = 10, and Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/-, n = 5. (E, F, G) Kidneys of Sulf1-/- Sulf2-/- mice were small at E18.5 (E) and remain disproportionately small (mean±SEM) into adulthood (F, G). The Sulf2-/- mutants also had kidneys of decreased size, though the degree of reduction was more proportional to these animals' decrease in body weight. The weights of 15-week-old adult male kidneys are represented as a percentage of total body weight in panel G. The kidneys analyzed here are from the same cohort of animals whose body weights were presented in panel D. Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test; *, p&lt;0.05. ***, p&lt;0.001.
