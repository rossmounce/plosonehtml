Note the pink skin-tone and apparently normal vascularization and circulation. (B) Quantification of embryo weight (mean±SEM) at E18.5. <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> embryos show a 19% decrease in weight. These embryos also have a 12% decreased crown-rump length (data not shown). Number of embryos analyzed were as follows: Control (pooled <sup>+/+</sup>;<sup>+/+</sup>, <sup>+/-</sup>;<sup>+/+</sup>, <sup>+/+</sup>;<sup>+/-</sup>, and <sup>+/-</sup>;<sup>+/-</sup> embryos), <em>n</em> = 31; <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 32; <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 26, and <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 24. (C) Representative image of a typical small <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> 10-week-old male and a control littermate. Note the proportionate small stature and the lack of gross morphological differences. (D) Body weights (mean±SEM) of 15-week-old males. Weights of <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> and <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> mice were ~20% and ~30% smaller, respectively, than controls. Number of adult males analyzed were as follows: Controls (<em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/-</sup>), <em>n</em> = 26; <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 8; <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 10, and <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup>, <em>n</em> = 5. (E, F, G) Kidneys of <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/-</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> mice were small at E18.5 (E) and remain disproportionately small (mean±SEM) into adulthood (F, G). The <em>Sulf2</em><sup>-/-</sup> mutants also had kidneys of decreased size, though the degree of reduction was more proportional to these animals' decrease in body weight. The weights of 15-week-old adult male kidneys are represented as a percentage of total body weight in panel G. The kidneys analyzed here are from the same cohort of animals whose body weights were presented in panel D. Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's <em>t</em>-test; *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05. ***, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
