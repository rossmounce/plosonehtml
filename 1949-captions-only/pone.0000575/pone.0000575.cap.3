(D–G) Sagittal sections of the distal forelimb from E15.5 embryos revealed altered cartilage zonation in the ulna (D, E) and radius (F, G) bones. Yellow lines indicate the transition from distal/low proliferating (above line) to high proliferating (below line) chondrocyte populations as assessed by cellular morphology. (H, I) Sagittal section of the skull base of E18.5 embryos demonstrating abnormal fusion at the cartilaginous interface between the basisphenoid (bs) and basioccipital (bo) bones. (J–M) Coronal section (at the midbrain level) of the skull base at E18.5 showing abnormal midline fusion of the basisphenoid (bs) bone in the double mutant embryos. Bones depicted in panels K, L, and M were from three separate <em>Sulf1</em><sup>−/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>−/−</sup> embryos. Occasionally the pituitary gland descended into the gap at the midline of <em>Sulf1</em><sup>−/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>−/−</sup> embryos (as indicated by the arrow in panel L). (N–P) Representative sections through the proximal tibia of adult females. Arrows indicate regions of retained cartilage in regions that normally consist only of ossified bone. Representative control animals had the <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>+/−</sup> genotype in panels A, D, F, H, and N, and the <em>Sulf1</em><sup>+/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>−/−</sup> genotype in panel J. Representative <em>Sulf1</em><sup>−/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>−/−</sup> double mutant animals are shown in panels B, C, E, G, I, K, L, M, O, and P. Abbreviations used: bo, basioccipital; bs, basisphenoid; p, pituitary gland. The scale bar in (A) represents 500 µm in panels A–C; the scale bar in (H) represents 500 µm in panels H–M; the scale bar in (N) represents 500 µm in panels N–P.</p>
