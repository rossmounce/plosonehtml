(A, B) Whole-mount images demonstrating the reduced size of the double mutant skeleton. All bones are present, and no obvious fusion defects are apparent in any class of joints. (C, D) Skulls viewed from the posterior side. Note the hole in the dorsal side of the basisphenoid bone of the <em>Sulf1</em><sup>-/−</sup> <em>Sulf2</em><sup>−/−</sup> skeleton (to the right in D). Also note that the palate appears to be developing properly. (E–H) Rib cages (skeletal double staining; E, F) and sternums (thresholded µCT; G,H) revealing sternebral asymmetry about the midline in double knockout mice (black arrowheads in F, and yellow arrowhead in H). The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> sternebrae (counting from rostral to caudal) have a slender site of ossification bridging them at the midline (F, with another example in panel H [yellow arrow]). Scale bars in panels B, D, F, and G represent 1 mm for panels A/B, C/D, E/F, and G/H, respectively.</p>
