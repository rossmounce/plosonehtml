                Figure 4.  Embryos deficient for both Sulf1 and Sulf2 had several distinct defects in bone development.(A–F) Representative images of E18.5 littermate control Sulf1+/− Sulf2+/− (A, C, E, G) and Sulf1−/− Sulf2−/− (B, D, F, H) fetuses double-stained with alcian blue and alizarin red to demonstrate skeletal elements. (A, B) Whole-mount images demonstrating the reduced size of the double mutant skeleton. All bones are present, and no obvious fusion defects are apparent in any class of joints. (C, D) Skulls viewed from the posterior side. Note the hole in the dorsal side of the basisphenoid bone of the Sulf1-/− Sulf2−/− skeleton (to the right in D). Also note that the palate appears to be developing properly. (E–H) Rib cages (skeletal double staining; E, F) and sternums (thresholded µCT; G,H) revealing sternebral asymmetry about the midline in double knockout mice (black arrowheads in F, and yellow arrowhead in H). The 4th and 5th sternebrae (counting from rostral to caudal) have a slender site of ossification bridging them at the midline (F, with another example in panel H [yellow arrow]). Scale bars in panels B, D, F, and G represent 1 mm for panels A/B, C/D, E/F, and G/H, respectively.
