                Figure 5.  Sulf1−/− Sulf2−/− embryonic fibroblasts are hyper-sensitive to fibroblast growth factors.Fibroblasts were stimulated with differing doses of FGF1 (A, B) or FGF2 (C, D) for 10 minutes, then assessed for activation of signaling by Western analysis of phosphorylated FRS2. Results are representative of three independent experiments.
