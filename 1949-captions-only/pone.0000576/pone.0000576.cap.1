Somatic deletion mapping in 118 GBM and 26 OD WHO grades II and III was performed using 43 microsatellite markers. Four markers at deletion hotspots (D1S2845 at 1p36.3, D1S507 at 1p36.1, D1S216 at 1p22 and D1S2696 at 1p11) were selected to define chromosome 1p haplotypes. In GBM, 10 haplotypes were grouped into tumors with centromeric (H8–H10), interstitial (H5–H7) and telomeric (H2–H4) deletion patterns. In OD, only haplotypes H1 and H10 were observed. Chromosomal positions of 1p markers are shown on the left and areas of allelic loss are shown in grey. (B) Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curve of the haplotype groups.</p>
