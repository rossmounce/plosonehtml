                Figure 3.  Refined somatic 1p deletion mapping in OD and GBM converge to the NOTCH2 gene.(A) Schematic drawing of the chromosome 1 pericentric duplication and principle of the PCR-based N2/N2N test. NOTCH2 markers are in black and N2N markers are in grey. (B) The N2/N2N test distinguishes GBM (left) from OD (right). Electrophoretograms of GBM with (G10 and 091) or without (G49) 1p loss always show N2/N2N balance while OD have reduced NOTCH2 copy number relative to N2N. In GBM, NOTCH2 and N2N copy numbers indicated underneath are deduced from allelic retention (G10) or loss (091) at marker 210WF10. AO80 and AO84 are two recent OD with 1p/19q loss not included in the initial statistics. (C) Refined somatic deletion mapping deduced from the N2/N2N test. Chromosomal positions of markers and pericentric duplication are shown on the left. In GBM, minimally lost area is distally delimited by marker D1S514 (GBM G40 and G01) and proximally by NOTCH2 exon 4 (GBM G10). In OD, the minimal centromeric boundary of 1p loss is given by NOTCH2 exon 1 (all OD), while 2 homozygous losses target Notch2 exon 4 (OD AO80 and AO84). Conventional LOH data are shown by circles, data from the N2/N2N test are shown by squares. White: retention of both alleles; black: loss of heterozygosity; black on a black background: homozygous loss; grey: non informative. Areas of minimal allelic loss, highlighted in grey, are aligned with the targeted gene NOTCH2 shown with its sense of transcription.
