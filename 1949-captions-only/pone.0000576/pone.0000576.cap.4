                Figure 4.  The N2/N2N test provides the highest accuracy to predict glioma patient survival.Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves indicating the specificities (or 1-specificities, respectively) and the corresponding sensitivities at continuously varying cut-off points for survival time. Thus, a given cut-off (particular survival time), the test result was determined for all individual tests (based on either molecular markers D19S589, D1S2845, D1S216, D1S2696, N2/N2N, or histology) as being true or false positive, or true or false negative, respectively. Based on these data, the specificities (or 1-specificities, respectively) and sensitivities calculated for each of the cut-off points.
