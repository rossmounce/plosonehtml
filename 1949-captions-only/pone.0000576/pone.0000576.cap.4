Thus, a given cut-off (particular survival time), the test result was determined for all individual tests (based on either molecular markers D19S589, D1S2845, D1S216, D1S2696, N2/N2N, or histology) as being true or false positive, or true or false negative, respectively. Based on these data, the specificities (or 1-specificities, respectively) and sensitivities calculated for each of the cut-off points.</p>
