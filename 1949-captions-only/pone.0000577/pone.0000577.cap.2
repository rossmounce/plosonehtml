                Figure 2.  Representative virtual protein analysis gel of 188 proteins produced via the high-throughput protein production pipeline.The label NTFT02#### indicates the unique identifier for each ORF of Francisella tularensis. The expected molecular weights (based on predicted protein coding sequences of the ORFs) are shown below each lane. Black arrows (left side) indicate protein bands observed at approximately the expected molecular weight. MW, molecular weight; NS, no sample.
