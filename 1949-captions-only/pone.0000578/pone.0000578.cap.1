                Figure 1.  Natural variation among 16 Arabidopsis accessions for insect resistance, growth and defense-related traits.Accessions are ranked according to increasing susceptibility to herbivory by Pieris brassicae larvae. Shown are least squares means and standard errors (vertical bars) for Pieris brassicae herbivory, Plutella xylostella herbivory, plant diameter, leaf upper-side trichomes, myrosinase activity, aliphatic and indole glucosinolates. Values for Da(1)-12 are set as 100.
