                Figure 2.  Genetic map of Da(1)-12Ã—Ei-2 recombinant inbred lines.Shown are markers and genetic distances between adjacent markers along the chromosomes. Triangles indicate the approximate location of centromeres. The white bar for chromosome 1 indicates a region with marker distortion. Grey bars indicate 2-LOD support intervals for Pieris resistance QTL. Known genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, hydrolysis, and gene regulation are shown below chromosomes; explanations, AGI numbers and references are given in Table S2.
