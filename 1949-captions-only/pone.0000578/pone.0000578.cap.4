                Figure 4.  Epistatic interactions in the biosynthesis of homomethionine-derived glucosinolates.Left: 3-methylsulfinylpropyl glucosinolate (3MSOP) is produced when the genotype at the AOP locus (marker F4C21) is Da(1)-12. An Ei-2 allele at marker nga139 reduces the accumulation of this glucosinolate by 60%. Right: allyl glucosinolate is produced when the genotype at AOP is Ei-2. A Da(1)-12 allele at 3FM12 increases and a Da(1)-12 allele at nga249 decreases leaf allyl glucosinolate accumulation. N indicates the number of RILs with a particular combination of genotypes at the different markers.
