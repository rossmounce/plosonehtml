An Ei-2 allele at marker <em>nga139</em> reduces the accumulation of this glucosinolate by 60%. Right: allyl glucosinolate is produced when the genotype at <em>AOP</em> is Ei-2. A Da(1)-12 allele at <em>3FM12</em> increases and a Da(1)-12 allele at <em>nga249</em> decreases leaf allyl glucosinolate accumulation. <em>N</em> indicates the number of RILs with a particular combination of genotypes at the different markers.</p>
