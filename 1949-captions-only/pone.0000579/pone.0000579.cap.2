                Figure 2.  Runtime comparisons on the human genome.Runtime comparisons between fetchGWI using plain and compressed index files, tagger, and megablast. Each point is computed from the average of three runs on the human genome with different input data, except the last run done on the whole dataset. Only perfect matches are sought, except for the 2 experiments explicitly noted were 2 mismatches were allowed.
