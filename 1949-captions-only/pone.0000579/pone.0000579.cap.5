                Figure 5.  Runtime comparisons on different filesystems.Runtime comparisons of fetchGWI when the index file is stored either on a filesystem on local disks, or on a SFS cluster filesystem. Each point is computed from the average of three runs with different input data, except the last run done on the whole dataset. Only perfect matches were sought.
