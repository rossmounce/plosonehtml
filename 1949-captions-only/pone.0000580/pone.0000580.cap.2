                Figure 2.  Differences in mating behaviour between three female colour morphs.a) Proportion of females caught in copula in the field ±SE (χ2 = 60.229, d.f. = 2, P = &lt;0.001; N = 772). b) Average number of matings obtained by each morph ±SE (F2,269 = 4.014, P = 0.019; N = 275). Infuscans-obsoleta was not significantly different from either morph (Tukey HSD A = 0.6202, I = 0.1551) although the sample sizes for this morph were low (N = 8). c) Proportion of multiply mated females ±SE (χ2 = 6.981, d.f. = 2, P = 0.031; N = 258). All tests remain significant if the rarest morph, Infuscans-obsoleta, is removed from the analysis.
