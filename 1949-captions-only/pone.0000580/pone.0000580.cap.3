                Figure 3.  Morph-specific variation in female resistance to male mating attempts.Relationships between the number of matings (Y-axis) and the number of male clasping attempts received by each morph (X-axis). The fine dotted line marks a (hypothetical) 1:1 slope, where every clasping attempt by a male ends in a mating. Regression lines below the 1:1 relationship reveals morph-specific levels of female resistance towards mating attempts from males. The regression slopes differ significantly between the three female morphs (Morph * No. Male Claspings: F2,266 = 5.373, P = 0.005). Differences between androchrome females (solid regression line) and infuscans-females (dashed line) remains significant even if the morph with the lowest sample size (Infuscans obsoleta (dash-dot line)), is excluded from the data-set (F1,260 = 10.072, P = 0.002). Regression slopes of both androchrome females and infuscans-females differ significantly from unity (upper 95 % CL: 0.987 and 0.697 respectively), showing that both morphs do not accept all male mating attempts and show some degree of resistance. Sizes of the data points are proportional to the sample size at each position (range: 1â€“97 mean = 23.1).
