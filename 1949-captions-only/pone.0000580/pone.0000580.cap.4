Androchrome females (n = 200, solid lines and circles) and Infuscans-females (n = 78, broken lines and triangles), differ both with respect to a) Male clasping attempts (Morph * No. claspings: χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.657, d.f. = 1, P = 0.006) and with respect to b) Number of matings (Morph * No. matings: χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.755, d.f. = 1, P = 0.029). Interaction tests were estimated in generalized linear models (GLZ; with Poisson error, see <a href="#s4">methods</a>). Because there were only 5 individuals across all morphs that had mated four times, these were excluded from the final model, however, results remained significant with their inclusion. Data-points show mean fecundity values for each particular morph and mating category.</p>
