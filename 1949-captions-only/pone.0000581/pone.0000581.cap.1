The fluorescently labeled control peptides at the periphery indicate the grid of 144 different peptides. (b) Kinetics of EFS peptide phosphorylation by control embryo lysate (pink), Fyn/Yes morpholino injected embryo lysate (green) and Fyn/Yes morpholino, Fyn/Yes RNA co-injected embryos (Fyn/Yes rescue, brown) is shown with a data point every three min and the fluorescence in arbitrary units. (c,d) Endpoint measurements of peptide phosphorylation by Nacre- or Fyn/Yes morpholino-injected embryo lysates. (eâ€“h) Quantification of PTK profiles. The relative intensities of peptide phosphorylation by lysates of control, non-injected embryos were plotted against Nacre- or Fyn/Yes knock down embryos. The fluorescently labeled reference spots all lie within the indicated oval. (g,h) are a close-up of the low range of panels e and f. The five highlighted peptides are: 1,EFS; 2, FAK2; 3, LTK; 4, PAXI and 5, SYN1.</p>
