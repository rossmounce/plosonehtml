                Figure 2.  Similarities in PTK activity profiles of Fyn/Yes and Wnt11 knock downs. (a–f) Morphology of 24 hpf zebrafish embryos after knock down of Fyn/Yes (F/Y), Wnt11 or Nacre and of recues of the indicated knock downs using the corresponding synthetic RNAs.(g–l) Relative intensities of phosphorylation of a selection of five peptides. The signal was determined in duplicate and calculated relative to non-injected wild type control (set to 100%). (m–n) Relative intensities of phosphorylation of the same set of five peptides by purified Yes and Fyn kinases.
