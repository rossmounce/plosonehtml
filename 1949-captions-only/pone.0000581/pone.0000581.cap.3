                Figure 3.  Peptide phosphorylation profiles of Fyn/Yes and Wnt11 knock down embryos are largely overlapping.Peptide phosphorylation of Fyn/Yes (FYmorph), Wnt11 (Wntmorph) or Nacre knock down was determined relative to wild type (WT), which was set to 100%. The average of a duplicate experiment is depicted here. Phosphorylation intensities were color coded, &lt;25%, red; 25–75%, yellow and 75–125%, green. Protein identities of the peptides are indicated as well as their start and end residues. The sequence of the peptides and numerical representation of the data is given in Table S1. The peptides are listed from most affected at the top to least affected at the bottom. Phosphorylation of the bottom six peptides is also reduced upon injection of the control Nacre morpholino and these may represent non-specific effects.
