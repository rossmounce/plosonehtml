Each gene variation (for each of the seven genes) is assigned a unique allele number. The combination of the 7 allele numbers (allelic profile) for each strain defines the multi-locus sequence type, or ST. The relatedness of isolates based on sequence type is shown as an unrooted cladogram, determined by (UPGMA) analysis of the allelic profiles. Boxed isolates represent the most common serotypes found in human populations in previous studies <a href="#pone.0000582-Maekawa1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000582-Yoshioka1">[40]</a>.</p>
