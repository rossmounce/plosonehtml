                Figure 2.  Dendogram of isolates aligned with capsule type, pathogenicity island segments, and antibiotic resistance traits.MLST-based dendrogram showing genetic relationship of all E. faecalis isolates in this study. Small yellow highlights indicate a serotyping type strain, while black boxes designate the five most common serotypes [40]. Arrows designate isolates used for comparative genomic microarray analysis. Abbreviations are defined as follows: ST = sequence type; CPS = capsule type; PAI = pathogenicity island fragment outlined as letter designations in Fig. S1 (A = nuc1; B = cylB; C = esp; D = hydrolase homolog similar to xylS; E = psaA homolog; F = gls-24 like); A red letter B indicates strains that readily transfer cytolysin via mating; AbR = antibiotic resistance; T = tetracycline resistance; TM = tetM+; TL = tetL+; E = ermB+; VA = vanA+; VB = vanB+; G = gentamicin resistant; C = cat+; A = blaZ+; CBH = bile salt hydrolase; GEL = gelatinase; CYL = cytolysin. More detailed strain information is listed in Table 1.
