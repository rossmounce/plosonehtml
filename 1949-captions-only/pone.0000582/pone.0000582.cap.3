                Figure 3.  Dendrogram and composite virulence determinants among sequence types.MLST-based dendrogram compiling data from isolates of the 51 identified sequence type lineages. PAI = number pathogenicity island genes present per lineage; AbR = number of antibiotic resistance determinants per lineage. Brackets encompass abundant clonal isolates and their single and double locus variants where applicable.
