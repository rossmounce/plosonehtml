                Figure 4.  Virulence-associated phenotypes and corresponding genotype for all isolates.Phenotypes were determined by microdilution assay for antibiotic resistance or enzyme-specific tests for auxiliary enzymatic traits. Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification and/or hybridization for genes known to encode each phenotype. A positive genotype is indicated by the presence of one or more genes known to produce a given phenotype (e.g. genotypically positive vancomycin strains may contain the vanA or vanB genesâ€”a strain containing both would only be counted once).
