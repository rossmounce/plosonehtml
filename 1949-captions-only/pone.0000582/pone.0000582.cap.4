Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification and/or hybridization for genes known to encode each phenotype. A positive genotype is indicated by the presence of one or more genes known to produce a given phenotype (e.g. genotypically positive vancomycin strains may contain the <em>vanA</em> or <em>vanB</em> genesâ€”a strain containing both would only be counted once).</p>
