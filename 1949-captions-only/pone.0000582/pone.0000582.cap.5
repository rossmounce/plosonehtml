                Figure 5.  Visualization of final absent and present calls for all probe sets across 8 distinct E. faecalis isolates.Comparative genomic hybridization was performed on DNA from isolates V583, MMH594, JH1, HIP11704, D6, ARO1/DG, Com6, and Fly1 as described in materials and methods. Probe sets are ordered according to the E. faecalis V583 gene sequence and the Affymetrix library file. Absent probe sets are in white; present probe sets are in black. Clustering of the strains was based on complete linkage using the Pearson correlation coefficient for the Absent/Present calls (A = 0, P = 1). The same clustering pattern is generated when average signal intensity values are used instead of Absent/Present calls (not shown). The numbered regions on the left correspond to the following previously identified and unidentified mobile genetic regions from strain V583: 1) EF_0125-EF_0166, 2) EF_0302-EF_0355 (PHAGE01), 3) EF_0479-EF_0628 (V583 PAI), 4) EF_1275-EF_1293 (PHAGE02), 5) EF_1416-EF_1489 (PHAGE03), 6) EF_1847-EF_1897, 7) EF_1987-EF_2043 (PHAGE04), 8) EF_2084-EF_2145 (PHAGE05), 9) EF_2240-2282/EF_2335-2351, 10) EF_2284-EF_2334 (Tn/vanB), 11) EF_2512-EF_2545, 12) EF_2798-EF_2856 (PHAGE06), and 13) EF_2936-EF_2955 (PHAGE07) (see text).
