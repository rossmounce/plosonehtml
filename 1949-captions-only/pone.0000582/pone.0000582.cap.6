                Figure 6.  Classification of core and dispensable sequences in 8 strains of Enterococcus faecalis.Data from comparative genomic hybridization analysis of isolates V583, MMH594, JH1, HIP11704, D6, ARO1/DG, Com6, and Fly1 are organized by the number of strains for which each probe set is detected (top to bottom). Absent probe sets are in white; present probe sets are in black. Clustering of the strains was based on complete linkage using the Pearson correlation coefficient for the Absent/Present calls (A = 0, P = 1). Genetic elements were classified as part of the core genome if present in all strains tested. COG designations were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Some genes/probe sets represent more than one COG category.
