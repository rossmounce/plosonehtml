                Figure 7.  Antibiotic determinants and pathogenicity island composition per sequence type lineage, aligned by capsule locus (cps) variation (CPS type).The percentage of sequence type lineages positive for each antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity island listed in Fig 3 were alligned by CPS capsule type and arranged in descending order. Capsule types are invariant for strains within individual sequence type lineages. Details of capsule operon (cps) arrangements are outlined in Materials and Methods.
