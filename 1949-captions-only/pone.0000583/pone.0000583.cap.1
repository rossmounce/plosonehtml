                Figure 1.  Generation and characterization of LCL-stimulated CD4+ T cell lines.T cell lines established from EBV-positive donors by LCL stimulation lysed autologous LCL but not PHA blasts after 4–8 passages at different effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. (B) FACS analysis of CD4+ cell lines established from LCL-stimulated bulk T cell lines by magnetic sorting demonstrated that &gt;95% of the cells were TCRα/β+ and CD4+. (C) As demonstrated for donor GB, all TH cell lines established from healthy virus carriers responded against autologous and MHCII-matched allogeneic LCL, as well as MHCII-matched EBV-positive (BL41-B95.8) but not EBV-negative (BL41) Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. TH cell lines from IM patients showed similar responses against autologous LCL, but as exemplified by the T cell line from IM4, some of these lines also recognized EBV-negative BL cell lines. (D) LCL-stimulated TH cell lines from EBV-negative donors showed minimal if any responses against autologous LCL, but vigorous responses against some allogeneic targets. (E) EBV-reactive TH cell lines secreted GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, but not IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, or TGF-β1 in response to stimulation with autologous (GB) or MHCII-matched allogeneic (JM) LCL, or non-specific activation by PHA. The MHC-mismatched LCL DA served as negative control. The following standards were included: GM-CSF: 1,900 pg/ml; IFN-γ: pg/ml; IL-4: 250 pg/ml; IL-10: 2,100 pg/ml; TNF-α: 2,900 pg/ml; TGF-β1: 1,450 pg/ml; IL-17: 1,700 pg/ml. (F) The T cell line IM7 displayed a novel “non-responder” phenotype. This T cell line proliferated in response to stimulation with autologous LCL and IL-2, but failed to secrete any of the indicated cytokines even after stimulation with autologous LCL plus PHA.
