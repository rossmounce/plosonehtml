                Figure 2.  Latent cycle antigens of EBV are not the principal targets of LCL-stimulated TH cells.EBV-specific TH cell lines from different donors at different passages were tested for recognition of autologous PBMC pulsed separately with the eight antigenically distinct latent cycle proteins of the virus. Except for the T cell lines from donors DA and MS, which showed weak responses against EBNA3C, neither early nor late passage TH cell lines responded against EBV latent cycle proteins.
