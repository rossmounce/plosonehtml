                Figure 3.  EBV-reactive TH cell lines recognize autologous LCL but not mini-LCL.LCL-stimulated TH cell lines showing EBV reactivity were tested for recognition of autologous LCL and mini-LCL established by infection of B cells with an EBV mutant unable to enter the lytic cycle. After three to twenty passages, mini-LCL reactivity of all TH cell lines had dropped to background levels while responses against LCL were maintained even after extended periods of in vitro culture. (B) Responses against LCL and mini-LCL of different passage TH cell lines were assessed by IFN-Î³ ELISPOT. With the exception of the T cell line from SM, early passage TH cell lines from healthy virus carriers recognized LCL and mini-LCL, but responses against mini-LCL disappeared with further rounds of stimulation. By contrast, early and late passage T cell lines from IM3, which had failed to show EBV-reactivity in earlier experiments, responded similarly against both types of target cells.
