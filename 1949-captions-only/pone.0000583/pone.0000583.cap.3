After three to twenty passages, mini-LCL reactivity of all T<sub>H</sub> cell lines had dropped to background levels while responses against LCL were maintained even after extended periods of in vitro culture. (B) Responses against LCL and mini-LCL of different passage T<sub>H</sub> cell lines were assessed by IFN-Î³ ELISPOT. With the exception of the T cell line from SM, early passage T<sub>H</sub> cell lines from healthy virus carriers recognized LCL and mini-LCL, but responses against mini-LCL disappeared with further rounds of stimulation. By contrast, early and late passage T cell lines from IM3, which had failed to show EBV-reactivity in earlier experiments, responded similarly against both types of target cells.
