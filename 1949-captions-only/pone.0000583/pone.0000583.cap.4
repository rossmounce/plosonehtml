                Figure 4.  EBV-reactive TH cell lines target lytic cycle antigens of the virus.The antigens recognized by TH cell lines that responded against LCL but had lost mini-LCL reactivity were identified using mini-LCL pulsed with recombinant EBV proteins. Responses of three representative CD4+ T cell lines (IM1, DA, and GB) against 30 different lytic cycle proteins are shown.
