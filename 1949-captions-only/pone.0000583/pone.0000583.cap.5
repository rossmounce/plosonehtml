Whereas BcLF1, BLLF1, and BNRF1-specific T cells responded against mini-LCL pulsed with less than 1 genome equivalent (geq) of the virus/cell, BMRF1-specific T cells failed to recognize mini-LCL pulsed with much higher doses of virus. (B) To detect transfer of antigen between cells, BMRF1-specific T cells were tested for recognition of mini-LCL, MHC-mismatched LCL, and the mix of these two lines. While neither line alone was recognized by the T cells, 24 hours of co-culture sensitized the cell mix for recognition.</p>
