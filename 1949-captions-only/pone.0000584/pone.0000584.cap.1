                Figure 1.  The clustering of 52 patients according to viral titer measurements across days.All viral titer values of each patient are normalized by the same patient day 0 viral titer measurement. The Euclidean measure based hierarchical (UPGM) clustering indicates a good separation of the early response Marked (pink) and Poor response (green) patients. The Slow (yellow) patients are mostly concentrated at the intermediate branch of the clustering tree.
