                Figure 2.  The PCA visualization of inter-patient proximities according to day 0 normalized per day viral titer values.First two Principal Components cover 93% of data variability and thus gives the good presentation of the patient distribution in the 5 dimensional space. There is the clear divergence of Marked (dark blue points) and Poor (green points) response patients. The separation line (dotted blue line) indicates the virtual border between these two populations. Slow patients (pink points) are mostly concentrated along the borderline.
