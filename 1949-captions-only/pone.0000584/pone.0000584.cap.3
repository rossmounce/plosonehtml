There are two main vectors in this space; the inter-patient matrix according to viral titer (blue dotted vector) and inter-patient matrix according to expression of all genes (black vector). The expression of every gene is presented as a point (vector) in the same space: the inter-patient matrix according to the expression values of this gene. Some genes could be close to viral-titer vector VT or/and to all gene expression vector MV. Inter-patient matrices according to expression of individual genes (G) at specific days (GD) are dots of the figure. Points of high correlation with VT vector (pink dots) are VT-linked genes. MV linked genes (green dots) define individual variability of patients according to their gene expression. The genes not linked with the two main vectors genes are in red.</p>
