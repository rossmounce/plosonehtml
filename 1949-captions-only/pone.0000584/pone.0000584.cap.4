Follow to multidimensional-scaling method the proximities between gene based inter-patient matrices as estimated through their correlations with MV and VT matrices were represented by inter-gene (gene-days) Euclidian distances in the PCA two-dimensional space. Positions of VTeu, MVeu (Euclidean metrics) and VTcov, MVcov (covariance metrics) matrices in the PCA space are seen on the insert. VT linked genes are denoted by pink dots. MV-linked genes are in the frame on the figure right.</p>
