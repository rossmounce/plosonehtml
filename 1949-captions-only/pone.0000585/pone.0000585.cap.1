(A) Histomorphometric analysis was performed on long bones after Von Kossa/Von Gieson staining. (B) Efficiency of ovariectomy was assessed by weighing uteri. (C) Bone mass was quantified. Results of the quantification show that WT mice lost 30% of bone mass after ovariectomy, whereas KΔ75 mice lost around 45%. (D and E) Hematopoietic populations from bone marrow (D) or spleen (E) were characterized by flow cytometry using the B220 antibody for B lymphocytes; CD11b for monocytes; CD11c for dendritic cells; Gr1 for granulocytes and CD3 for T lymphocytes.
