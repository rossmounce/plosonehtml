                Figure 2.  Lymphocytes enhance osteoclastogenesis from KΔ75 but not from WT mouse spleen cells.(A) WT and KΔ75 mice spleen cells were isolated using different lymphocyte separation media to collect osteoclast precursors without (upper panels) or with (lower panels) lymphocytes. Osteoclast differentiation was carried out in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. Seven days later, cell cultures were fixed and stained for TRAP activity. Lymphocytes increased the formation of TRAP positive osteoclasts from KΔ75 spleen cells (KΔ75+Ly). Pictures of representative fields from several experiments. (B) Quantification under the different culture conditions, of the number of TRAP+ cells per dish; TRAP+ osteoclasts with more than 3 nuclei; average number of nuclei per multinucleated osteoclast. These figures are representative of three different experiments. (* p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.001, *** or ††† p&lt;0.0001)
