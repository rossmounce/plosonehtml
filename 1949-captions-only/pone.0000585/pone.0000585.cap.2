Osteoclast differentiation was carried out in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. Seven days later, cell cultures were fixed and stained for TRAP activity. Lymphocytes increased the formation of TRAP positive osteoclasts from KΔ75 spleen cells (KΔ75+Ly). Pictures of representative fields from several experiments. (B) Quantification under the different culture conditions, of the number of TRAP+ cells per dish; TRAP+ osteoclasts with more than 3 nuclei; average number of nuclei per multinucleated osteoclast. These figures are representative of three different experiments. (* p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.001, *** or ††† p&lt;0.0001)</p>
