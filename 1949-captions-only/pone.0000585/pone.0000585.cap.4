The bone phenotype of KΔ75;Rag1-/- mice (called DKO), as well as control littermates (DWT, Rag1-/- and KΔ75 mice), was quantified by histomorphometric analysis. (A) Bone mass was assessed after Von Kossa/Von Gieson staining; trabeculae numbers, thickness and space between trabeculae were quantified using specific softwares. KΔ75 mice have a mild but significant osteopetrosis compared with DWT mice. Rag1-/- mice did not exhibit any bone phenotype whereas osteopetrosis in KΔ75 mice increased in the absence of lymphocytes (DKO mice) and was statistically significant, compared to DWT or KΔ75 mice. (B) TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclast numbers per bone surface unit were assessed directly on bone slices. No statistical differences were observed between animals of the four different genotypes. (D and E) Deoxypyridinoline cross-link degradation products were measured in evening urines and expressed as a ratio with creatinine in 3-month-old females (C) and 6-month-old males (D).
