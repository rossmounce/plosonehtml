                Figure 5.  Mature lymphocytes and DAP12 protect against gonadal failure induced bone loss.Ovariectomies were performed on 8-week-old Rag1-/- and DKO mice. Four weeks later, both ovariectomized and sham operated animals were sacrificed. (A) Bone mass was assessed by histomorphometric analysis after Von Kossa/Von Gieson staining. (B) The efficiency of ovariectomy was evaluated by weighing the uteri. (C) Results of the quantification show that Rag1-/- mice, as well as KΔ75;Rag1-/- mice, lost more than 50% of their bone mass after ovariectomy. (*** or ††† p&lt;0.0001)
