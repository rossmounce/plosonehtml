Trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (A), trabecular thickness (B), and trabecular number (C) of LVB6, and cortical thickness of tibia at distal tibiofibular junction (D) are shown. WT: wild-type mice; DKO: mice lacking both DAP12 and FcRγ. N = 5 in each group. *: p&lt;0.05; **: p&lt;0.01; ***: p&lt;0.001; when compared to SHAM groups, respectively.</p>
