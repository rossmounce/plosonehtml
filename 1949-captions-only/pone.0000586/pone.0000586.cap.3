Representative figures of 3D reconstructed µCT results are shown in (A), with average BV/TV indicated below. Trabecular BV/TV (B); mean bone mineral density of TV (C); mean bone mineral density of trabeculae (D); trabecular number (E); trabecular spacing (F) and trabecular thickness (G) are shown. Scale bar in (A) shows 1 mm physical size. WT: wild-type mice; DKO: mice lacking both DAP12 and FcRγ. N = 5 in each group. *: p&lt;0.05; **: p&lt;0.01; ***: p&lt;0.001; when compared to SHAM groups, respectively. ** in (G) indicates p&lt;0.01 when DKO sham group were compared to sham group of all three other mice. N = 5 for each group.</p>
