Brightfield and fluorescence images were taken with 40× objective. Red staining in brightfield indicates TRACP<sup>+</sup>cells. Magenta arrow indicates mononuclear TRACP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts; red asterisk indicates TRACP<sup>+</sup> multinuclear osteoclasts (MNCs). (B) Mononuclear, multinuclear, and total osteoclast number per section was counted. *: p&lt;0.05; ***: p&lt;0.001; when compared between groups indicated by dotted line. N = 3 each group.</p>
