                Figure 5.  OVX-induced osteoclast activity is not self-sustained in osteoclasts from DAP12-/- and DAP12-/-FcRγ-/- mice.At six weeks post-OVX, non-adherent bone marrow macrophages were cultured with 10 ng/mL M-CSF and 25 ng/mL RANKL on BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ Bone Cell Culture dishes. (A) Representative images of resorption pits where white represents pits and black in unresorbed substrate. Total resorption area (B) and pit number (C) were calculated and shown. Standard error is shown. WT: wild-type mice; DKO: mice lacking both DAP12 and FcRγ. N = 5 in each group. Experiment was repeated three times. Representative images and results were shown.
