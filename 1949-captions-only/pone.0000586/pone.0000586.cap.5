(A) Representative images of resorption pits where white represents pits and black in unresorbed substrate. Total resorption area (B) and pit number (C) were calculated and shown. Standard error is shown. WT: wild-type mice; DKO: mice lacking both DAP12 and FcRγ. N = 5 in each group. Experiment was repeated three times. Representative images and results were shown.</p>
