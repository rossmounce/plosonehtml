                Figure 7.  Stimulatory effect of FSH has no effect on DAP12-deficient osteoclastogenesis.BMMs from WT, DAP12-/-, and DAP12-/-FcRγ-/- were separated and non-adherent BMMs were cultured with 30 ng/ml FSH alone (Aa, Ad, Ag), 3 ng/ml RANKL alone (Ab, Ae, Ah), or FSH and RANKL (Ac, Af, Ai) for 4 days. TRACP staining was performed at the end of the experiment, as described. Dark purple staining indicates that cells are TRACP positive. The number of multinucleated (&gt;3nuclei) -osteoclasts were calculated and shown in (B). DKO: mice lacking of both DAP12 and FcRγ. Experiment was repeated three times with representative results shown.
