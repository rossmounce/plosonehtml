TRACP staining was performed at the end of the experiment, as described. Dark purple staining indicates that cells are TRACP positive. The number of multinucleated (&gt;3nuclei) -osteoclasts were calculated and shown in (B). DKO: mice lacking of both DAP12 and FcRγ. Experiment was repeated three times with representative results shown.</p>
