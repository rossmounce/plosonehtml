                Figure 3.  Nighttime low- or high-dose cocaine exposure fails to alter the expression of zDAT, zBmal1, zGH and melatonin receptor genes during zebrafish development but continues to affect zPer3, and this effect is counteracted by melatonin.(A–E) Melatonin (100 nM for 45 min), Low (0.3 µM) or High (30 µM) cocaine doses (15 min), with or without melatonin pre-treatment (100 nM, 30 min) administered to 36-hpf embryos. N = 3–4 samples/treatment group, 25 embryos per sample. Mean±SEM, t-test (vs. control), * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001; One way ANOVA (between treatments), a: p&lt;0.05, vs. cocaine-only group. Mlt-melatonin; Coc-cocaine.
