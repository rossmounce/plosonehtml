Daily variation in <em>zBmal1</em> and <em>zMel1a-1</em> (and other melatonin receptors) is abolished in LL (B vs. E; C vs. F). Y-axis in all plots: fold change relative to LD-Day level ( = 1).

Mean±SEM, <em>t</em>-test, * <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, *** <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 indicates difference between LD and LL, at Day or Night, accordingly.</p>
