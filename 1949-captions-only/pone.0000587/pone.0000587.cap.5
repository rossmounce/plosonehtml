                Figure 5.  Normal diurnal variation in zPer3, zBmal1 and melatonin receptors is altered in embryos raised under constant light conditions.Daytime increase in zPer3 expression in LD (A) is partially preserved in LL (D; p&lt;0.05). Daily variation in zBmal1 and zMel1a-1 (and other melatonin receptors) is abolished in LL (B vs. E; C vs. F). Y-axis in all plots: fold change relative to LD-Day level ( = 1). N = 3–4 samples/time point in LD or LL group, 25 embryos/sample. Mean±SEM, t-test, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001 indicates difference between LD and LL, at Day or Night, accordingly.
