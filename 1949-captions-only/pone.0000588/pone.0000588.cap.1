MRI detectable gel polymer (IZI Medical Products, Baltimore MD) was placed over the area defined by the shield opening and sagittal MRI images performed (B, C) in order to demonstrate the brain volumes exposed to radiation. Red lines demonstrate the path of the radiation beam, at 5.7 degrees from the vertical. This is represented schematically in (D) to clearly illustrate the exclusion of the olfactory bulb and the distal most portion of the RMS from the radiation field. Stereological estimates of absolute BrdU counts in the SVZ, corpus callosum (CC) and cortex (Cx) (E–G) in irradiated (blue) and normal aging (red) rats. There is significant suppression of proliferation on day 1 post radiation in all 3 regions. BrdU levels are most significantly suppressed in the SVZ. In the cortex there is recovery to age-matched control levels at 3–6 months post radiation. In parallel, doublecortin labeled neuroblasts in the SVZ (H) are completely suppressed as of day 1 post radiation and do not recover up to 15 months post XRT. Stars indicate statistical significance (*** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05; ANOVA). Bars = SEM. Scale bar = 100 µm.</p>
