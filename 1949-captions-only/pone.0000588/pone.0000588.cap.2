Quantitative measurements of total BrdU cells, BrdU/doublecortin in the distal RMS, doublecortin cells in the granular cell layer (DCX) and periglomerular calretinin-expressing interneurons are shown in B–E. Suppression of BrdU and DCX cells is delayed to 2 weeks post radiation but is followed by an immediate attempt at recovery peaking at 6 months post XRT. The origin of this recovery is thought to be due to proliferating neuroblasts in the distal RMS just proximal to the olfactory bulb. Concomitantly the SVZ and proximal RMS are devoid of proliferative activity and DCX expressing neuroblasts (F–G). Stars indicate statistical significance (*** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05; ANOVA). Bars = SEM. Scale bar in (A) corresponds to 50 µm; in (F) and (G) to 35 µm.</p>
