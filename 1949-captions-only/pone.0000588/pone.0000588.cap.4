                Figure 4.  MRI imaging post radiation.Representative sagittal (A, upper panel) and axial (A, lower panel) images of control or irradiated rats. At 12 months, subtle T2 changes are seen in the corpus callosum (arrows) that correspond to demyelination changes observed histologically. At 14 months post radiation, the T2 signal changes are more definite. (B) Graph depicts changes in the corpus callosum volume in irradiated animals as compared to aging control.
