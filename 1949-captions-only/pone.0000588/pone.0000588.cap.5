                Figure 5.  Endothelial cell number and capillary length post radiation.(A) Representative images of sections from the corpus callosum immunostained for rat endothelial cell antigen (RECA) at various time points post radiation. RECA expression declines immediately post radiation but is restored and maintained through 15 months. Stereological estimates of the number of capillary segments in the cortex (B) and corpus callosum (C) and of capillary length in both regions (D, E). (*** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05; ANOVA). Bars = SEM. Scale bar in A corresponds to 100 Âµm.
