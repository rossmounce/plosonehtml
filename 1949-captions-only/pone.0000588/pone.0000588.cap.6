                Figure 6.  Radiation effects in human tissue samples.Human white matter samples acquired from non-irradiated brain (normal), irradiated specimens up to 7 months post XRT (labeled “early”), and irradiated specimens beyond 9 months up to 7 years (labeled “late”). Immunohistochemistry for early oligodendrocyte progenitor markers (O4, PDGFR), more mature oligoprogenitors (CNP) and fully differentiated oligodendrocytes (MBP) and endothelial cells (von Willebrand factor, vWF). Human tissues exhibit a pattern of early loss of young oligodendrocyte progenitors and delayed loss of more mature oligodendrocyte lineage cells, similar to what was described in the irradiated rat brain. Endothelial cells are scarce in early post radiation tissues and commonly normal in number in late post XRT tissues (7 years in this panel). DAPI in blue. Scale bar corresponds to 100 µm in all panels.
