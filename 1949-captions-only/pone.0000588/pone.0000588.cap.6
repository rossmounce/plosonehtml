Immunohistochemistry for early oligodendrocyte progenitor markers (O4, PDGFR), more mature oligoprogenitors (CNP) and fully differentiated oligodendrocytes (MBP) and endothelial cells (von Willebrand factor, vWF). Human tissues exhibit a pattern of early loss of young oligodendrocyte progenitors and delayed loss of more mature oligodendrocyte lineage cells, similar to what was described in the irradiated rat brain. Endothelial cells are scarce in early post radiation tissues and commonly normal in number in late post XRT tissues (7 years in this panel). DAPI in blue. Scale bar corresponds to 100 µm in all panels.</p>
