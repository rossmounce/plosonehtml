                Figure 1.  NF-κB exists in a complex with dynein/dynactin in vivo.NF-κB p65 co-immunoprecipitates with dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein. 10 mg soluble rat brain extract were cross-linked with DSP to stabilize transient protein-protein interactions and subsequent immunoprecipitated with an anti-p65 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting with an anti- NF-κB p65 or NF-κB p50 antibody or with antibodies against dynein intermediate chain (IC 74) or the motor-associated proteins dynamitin and p150Glued. Control IP was done with a non-immune monoclonal antibody.
