The NLS of NF-κB p65 consists of a stretch of a basic amino acids, arginines and lysines. The three point mutations were introduced into the NLS (depicted in yellow). The construct was tagged with polyhistidine to enable purification from bacterial extracts and pull-down assays. (B) Polyhistidine-tagged wild-type p65 and p65 with mutant NLS (NLSmut) purified from bacterial extracts were immobilized separately on nickel-coated matrix and incubated with the rat brain extract. The bound material was eluted from the matrices, fractionated by SDS–PAGE and examined by Western blot with anti-IC74 and anti-dynactin p50 antibodies. As expected, wild-type p65 associates with dynein/dynactin <em>in vitro.</em> In contrast, p65 with mutant NLS failed to form this complex.</p>
