                Figure 3.  Inhibition of dynein function by overexpression of dynamitin impairs nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and reduces NF-κB-dependent transcription activity.(A) Cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with dynamitin or mock vector were left untreated or incubated with 300 µM glutamate for 5 min. After 90 min neurons were fixed and analyzed for subcellular NF-κB p65 destribution. Nuclei were stained with SYTOX (green). Anti-p65 immunoreactivity is depicted in red. (B) Quantification of nuclear/dendritic ratio of α-p65 fluorescence in dynamitin-transfected and control-transfected neurons with and without glutamate stimulation. Note that transfection with dynamitin impaired redistribution of NF-κB p65 from distal sites to the nucleus following glutamate stimulation. Fluorescence measurements were made from 20 to30 neurons in each experimental condition. (C) Reporter gene assay showed reduced NF-κB-dependent transcription activity in neurons overexpressing dynamitin.
