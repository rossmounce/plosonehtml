                Figure 5.  Schematic presentation for the NF-κB activation by synaptic activity and its dynein-mediated retrograde transport to the nucleus along microtubules.Upon stimulation of primary neurons with glutamate, different signalling pathways (represented here by CaMKII) originating from intracellular Ca2+ elevation induces phosphorylation of IκB, which subsequently leads to its degradation within the proteasome. Thereby, the nuclear localisation signals (NLS) of NF-κB subunits are unmasked, allowing its binding to importin α/β heterodimer. This complex is then transported retrogradely towards the nucleus via an association with motor protein dynein/dynactin, where it activates NF-κB target genes.
