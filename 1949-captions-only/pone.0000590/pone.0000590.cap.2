                Figure 2.  Results for selected molecular markers.ISSR banding pattern data for primer 7 (a) and primer 14 (b) indicating no variation between Egypt (EG, green), Namibia (NAM, yellow), South Africa (SA, orange) and Hawaii (HI, red). Electropherograms and their associated gel images are shown for 3 individuals from each of these locations. An illustration of 4 selected microsatellite loci (c) shows complete fixation for all alleles between all locations.
