                Figure 3.  Genotypic reaction norms for (A) nutrient and soil pH gradient, (B) water gradient and (C) nitrogen gradient showing mean (Â±s.e.m.) biomass accumulated in response to each treatment level.Egyptian populations were only included for the nitrogen treatments. The corresponding QST values for fitness correlates are indicated on each graph.
