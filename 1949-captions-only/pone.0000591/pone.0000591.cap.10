Each arc represents an association predicted by the conditional model that is significant at <em>q</em>&lt;0.2. Arc color reflects the <em>q</em>-value of the association. Dark gray residues denote positions where there were fewer than three sequences with a non-consensus residue. The associations used to construct the figure are available as <a href="#pone.0000591.s001">Dataset S1</a>. Annotations of individual residues are: P, phosphorylated residue; Ub, site of ubiquitinization; +/âˆ’, charged residue.</p>
