                Figure 10.  Correlated amino-acid pairs in HIV-1 p6.The fifty two consensus amino acids of P6 are drawn as a circle, with the N-terminal end shown at the far right and the protein extending counter-clockwise. Each arc represents an association predicted by the conditional model that is significant at q&lt;0.2. Arc color reflects the q-value of the association. Dark gray residues denote positions where there were fewer than three sequences with a non-consensus residue. The associations used to construct the figure are available as Dataset S1. Annotations of individual residues are: P, phosphorylated residue; Ub, site of ubiquitinization; +/âˆ’, charged residue.
