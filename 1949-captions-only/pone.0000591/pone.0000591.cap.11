For each haplotype, the four conditional models were run and negative log<sub>10</sub> of the most significant <em>q</em>-value is plotted. For each phenotype, the most significant association is a locus within 10 kb of the corresponding R gene (yellow lines). The dotted line shows the <em>q</em> = 0.2 threshold.</p>
