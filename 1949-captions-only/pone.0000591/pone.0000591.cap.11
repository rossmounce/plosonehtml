                Figure 11.  Genomic distribution of genotype-phenotype association scores for Arabidopsis bacterial response.4681 haplotypes were compared against each of the three bacterial response phenotypes, Rpm1 (top), Rpt2 (middle) and Pph3 (bottom). For each haplotype, the four conditional models were run and negative log10 of the most significant q-value is plotted. For each phenotype, the most significant association is a locus within 10 kb of the corresponding R gene (yellow lines). The dotted line shows the q = 0.2 threshold.
