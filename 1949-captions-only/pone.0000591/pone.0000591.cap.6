<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4"></a><p>To validate our use of BIC to evaluate model performance on real data, we compared the BIC scores of the undirected joint and conditional models on the synthetic data sets representing conditional influence and coevolution. As expected, we found that the conditional model had a significantly higher score than the undirected joint model on the conditional-influence data set (<em>p</em> = 7.6×10<sup>−53</sup>, <em>N</em> = 157317), and the joint model performed better model on the synthetic coevolution data set (<em>p</em> = 0.06, <em>N</em> = 10025).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5"></a><p>Finally, we note that, over a wide variety of data sets, the conditional model runs an order of magnitude faster than the undirected joint model, which requires optimization over a larger number of parameters and more complex Eigen decompositions.</p>
<h5>Sensitivity to tree structure.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Our approach raises the question of how sensitive the results are to the structure of the tree used by the models. To address this question, we ran the conditional model on the synthetic conditional influence data using four different trees: the tree used to generate the data (<em>T<sub>gen</sub></em>), a tree with the same structure as <em>T<sub>gen</sub></em> but with the leaf-to-patient assignments randomized (<em>T<sub>rand</sub></em>), and two trees reconstructed from the synthetic amino acids using either a generalized maximum likelihood method (<em>T<sub>ML</sub></em>, the method we use throughout this work ) or a naïve parsimony method (<em>T<sub>pars</sub></em>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>As expected, the conditional model performed best using <em>T<sub>gen</sub></em>, though the discrimination curves were not significantly different from those of <em>T<sub>M</sub></em><sub><strong><em>L</em></strong></sub> and <em>T<sub>pars</sub></em>, indicating that the conditional model is robust to variations of the tree on this data set (<a href="#pone-0000591-g007">Figure 7</a>). Importantly, although the discrimination curve was significantly worse using <em>T<sub>rand</sub></em> rather than <em>T<sub>gen</sub></em> (<em>p</em> = 0.016), the conditional model was calibrated on all four trees, indicating that, on this data set, poor trees resulted in a loss of power but not in an inflation of false discovery rates (<a href="#pone-0000591-g008">Figure 8</a>). This point is reinforced by the number of associations identified at <em>q</em>&lt;0.2 for the different methods: <em>T<sub>gen</sub></em> yielded eighty nine predictions whereas <em>T<sub>rand</sub></em> yielded only sixty five, <em>T<sub>ML</sub></em> yielded seventy eight, and <em>T<sub>pars</sub></em> yielded eighty two. The positive predictive value for these predictions ranged from 0.80 to 0.85.</p>
