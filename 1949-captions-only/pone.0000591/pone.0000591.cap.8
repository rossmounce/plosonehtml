<h4>Application 1: Effect of immune pressure on HIV evolution</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>To investigate the effects of immune pressure on HIV evolution, Moore <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0000591-Moore1">[33]</a> obtained HIV sequences from 234 individuals along with the HLA-A and HLA-B alleles of the infected individuals. Performing several analyses, none of which explicitly incorporated phylogenetic structure, they found strong correlations between the presence or absence of amino acids at particular positions and the presence or absence of particular HLA alleles in the infected patients, presumably reflecting the “escape” of amino acids under immune pressure. In Bhattacharya <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0000591-Bhattacharya1">[12]</a>, we analyzed a similar data set (N = 96, MHC-I and MHC-II alleles) and showed that use of the conditional model substantially improved the accuracy of identification of such amino-acid-HLA associations. Here, we analyzed a superset (N = 205) of the data used in <a href="#pone.0000591-Bhattacharya1">[12]</a> (MHC-I alleles only) using both the conditional and undirected joint model.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>First, we constructed a phylogenetic tree from the full set of sequences (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). We then used the single-variable model to determine whether any HLA alleles followed the tree. We found that two pairs of HLA-1 alleles—B*4201, Cw*1701, and A*0207, B*4601, where each pair is in tight linkage disequilibrium—followed the tree and thus separated the HLA data into two sets: (1) “C1701” consisting of these four alleles and (2) “notC1701” consisting of the remaining alleles, and analyzed these two sets separately.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>Our results using BIC show that the conditional model better explains the notC1701 data, (<em>p</em> = 0.0001, <em>N</em> = 256296 ) whereas the undirected joint model better explains the C1701 data (<em>p</em> = 1.9×10<sup>−24</sup>, <em>N</em> = 5664). In the case of the C1701 data, it seems that the phylogenetic tree is more a confounder of the data in the traditional sense, wherein the tree is associated with both the HLA data and the sequences and induces false correlations between HLA allele and sequence.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4"></a><p>In this application, we were fortunate that additional information was available to help confirm the HLA-sequence associations that we found. In particular, a known epitope in the vicinity of a found association supports the validity of that association, as immune pressure is focused on epitopes and the immediate surrounding regions that participate in the presentation of the those epitopes on the HLA molecules at the cell surface <a href="#pone.0000591-Kloetzel1">[38]</a>. Thus, we constructed discrimination curves where an HLA-sequence association was considered “true” if it is within three amino acids of a known epitope (as described in the database at <a href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov">www.hiv.lanl.gov</a> as of July 2006) with the corresponding HLA allele and “false” otherwise. This “bronze” standard does not take into account undiscovered epitopes or linkage disequilibrium, but should nonetheless be unbiased with respect to a comparison of the alternative methods for identifying associations. The discrimination curve in <a href="#pone-0000591-g009">Figure 9</a> for the notC1701 data is consistent with the BIC and synthetic results, indicating that the conditional model best fits this data. We could not construct a discrimination curve for the C1701 data, as there are no known A*0207, B*4201, B*4601, or Cw*1701 epitopes in Gag.</p>
