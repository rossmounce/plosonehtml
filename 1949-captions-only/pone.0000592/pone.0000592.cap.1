<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p8"></a><p>The main factor to cause the variance between the ASSET weightings based estimate and the actual total Italian prescribing cost was the cost of the non-assignable items, not included in the calculation of weights (4.23% of total ASSET costs). Most of the non-assignable items were prescribed to patients whose identity was not included in the demographic databases, possibly either because they were non-resident or because they just moved in from a different healthcare district. The demographic databases are aligned with census data at a given frequency; therefore a time lag effect is always to be taken into consideration when measuring the accuracy of cost data analysis for large cohorts. Less than 1% of the total analysed prescription data were non-assignable due to errors in compilation or missing data.</p>


<h4>Testing the explanatory power of the ASSET model</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The ASSET weightings were used to retrospectively explain the evolution of total Italian prescribing costs of reimbursed drugs (class A) between 2000 to 2005.This relatively short time frame was chosen because age/sex weightings reflect clinical needs and prescribing patterns that may change over a longer period of time, due to the availability of improved diagnostic tools or innovative therapeutic options <a href="#pone.0000592-Smith2">[15]</a>.</p>
