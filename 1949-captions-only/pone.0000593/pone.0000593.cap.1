                Figure 1.  Social dilemmas and payoffs to cooperators and defectors.a, Common social dilemmas organized on the ‘sucker’, ‘temptation’ (S, T) plane (R and P normalised to 1 and 0; see text for details). b–d, expected relative payoff of cooperators as a function of public goods e is fc-fd = S+e(1-T-S), for 0≤e&lt;∞. Cooperator and defector payoffs are equal on the dashed lines (fc = fd). b, Dominance games. Red line, Prisoner's Dilemma, S = −0.5, T = 1.6. Blue line, cooperator dominance, S = 0.3, T = 0.4. c, Coexistence games. Red line, Snowdrift Game, S = 0.5, T = 1.5. Blue line, cooperator dominance, S = 0.5, T = 0.9 (but becomes snowdrift if u/c decreases sufficiently to allow e*p = 1&gt;S/(S+T-1), here if u/c&lt;4/5). d, Bistability games. Blue line, Stag-hunt Game, S = −0.5, T = 0.5. Red line, Prisoner's Dilemma, S = −0.5, T = 1.1 (but becomes Stag-hunt if u/c decreases sufficiently to allow e*p = 1&gt;S/(S+T-1), here if u/c&lt;4/5). Unless otherwise stated, game identities are consistent with u = c. See methods for more details.
