                Figure 2.  Impact of durability on Snowdrift (coexistence) game dynamics.Snowdrift game (T = 1.5, S = 0.5, c = u = x), stable coexistence of cooperators and defectors at p* = e* = S/(S+T-1) = 0.5, threshold to oscillations x&lt;1 (see methods). a, b Temporal dynamics of cooperators p (black) and public good e (grey). Initial values of p range from 0.1 to 0.9. Initial value of e is zero. a, x = 10. b, x = 0.01. c public good (e)â€“cooperator (p) phase plane. Lines illustrate simulated trajectories for differing values of x (10, 0.1, 0.01) from initial position p0 = e0 = 0.05.
