                Figure 3.  Impact of durability on Stag-hunt (bistable) game dynamics.Staghunt game (T = 0.5, S = −0.5, c = u = x), repellor at p* = e* = S/(S+T-1) = 0.5. a,b Temporal dynamics of cooperator p (black) and public good e (grey). Initial values of p range from 0.1 to 0.9. Initial value of e is zero. a, x = 10. b, x = 0.1. c public good (e)–cooperator (p) phase plane. Lines illustrate simulated separatrices demarcating the basins of attraction for pure cooperator and pure defector equilibria (closed circles). Unstable equilibrium (open circle) at p* = e* = S/(S+T-1) = 0.5. Lines represent differing values of x (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01).
