                Figure 4.  Prisoner's dilemma (defector dominance) game dynamics given durable public goods.Public good (e)–cooperator (p) phase plane. T = 1.1, S = −0.5, c = u = x = 0.1. Sole stable equilibrium, p* = e* = 0. Lines illustrate simulated trajectories for differing initial values of e (0.2 to 1.2 in red; 1.3 to 1.9 in black) for initial p = 0.5
