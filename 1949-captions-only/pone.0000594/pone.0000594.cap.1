B) SAM plot sheet illustrating a signature for differentially expressed genes in aggressive melanomas. Gene expression profiles from the two groups of melanomas were compared (Group1 vs. Group 2) and a differentially expressed gene signature was identified by SAM. Red and green dots represent gene probesets upregulated and downregulated respectively in Group 2. C) The melanoma gene signature was visualized using Java TreeView. Genes over four-fold differentially expressed are indicated on the right side of the image. D) Validation of select differentially expressed genes by real-time RT-PCR. Three genes upregulated in aggressive melanomas (Group 2) were selected for analysis and their differential expression was verified. 3.0 µg of total RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis reaction as described in the <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a>. 1.0 µl of the final cDNA samples (100 µl) were used for real-time Q-PCR reaction. For the measurement of gene transcript level, standard curves were generated for each gene using known amount of PCR amplified product from the corresponding genes. Error bars are SD of three independent experiments.</p>
