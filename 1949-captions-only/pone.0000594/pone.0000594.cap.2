B) SAM plot sheet illustrating a signature of down-regulated genes in group 2 melanomas compared to HPMs. Gene expression profiles of two pools of human primary melanocytes (HPM1 and HPM2) were compared to those of aggressive melanomas (Group 2) and a differentially expressed gene signature was identified by SAM. C) The melanoma gene signature was visualized using Java TreeView. Genes over five-fold downregulated are indicated on the right. D) Validation of differential expression for selected genes by semi-quantitative duplex RT-PCR. Four genes (CDH3, KIT, DPP4, SYK) downregulated in the aggressive melanoma cells (Group 2) were selected for analysis and their differential expression was verified.</p>
