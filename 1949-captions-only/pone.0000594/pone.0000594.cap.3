(see detailed description in Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis section of <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). B) Relative expression levels of melanoma invasion-specific signature genes in all cells analyzed including human primary melanocytes (HPM1, HPM2). C) Validation of differential expression for selected genes by semi-quantitative duplex RT-PCR. Four genes (IL-8, IGFBP3, CXCL1, CXCL2) that are upregulated in invasive melanomas were selected and their differential expression was verified. D) Promoter analysis of selected genes from the melanoma invasion-specific signature identifies putative NF-κB binding <em>cis</em> elements. E) Immunofluorescence staining of NF-κB in invasive (WM902B) vs. non-invasive (WM1552C) melanoma cells demonstrates constitutive activation and nuclear trafficking of NF-κB in invasive melanomas.</p>
