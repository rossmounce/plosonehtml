                Figure 2.  Percentile plots for selected CSF metabolite concentrations [mM] in patients with or without inflammatory brain MS plaques (abbreviated ‘inflamm’ and ‘non-inflamm’, respectively), and controls.These plots show the percentage of data less than or equal to an observed value. Marked deviations from normal distribution are readily recognized by major deviations from a straight line. The percentile plots for fructose illustrate the presence of CSF with particularly increased concentrations in CIS patients, independently of the presence of inflammatory plaques.
