                Figure 3.  Scattergrams for lactate and acetate CSF concentrations [mM] in patients with or without inflammatory brain MS plaques (abbreviated ‘inflamm’ and ‘non-inflamm’, respectively), and controls.Marked deviations from normal distribution are readily recognized for lactate (inflamm) since data are clustered at low values (around 2.2 mM), but also for acetate (inflamm) where data are clustered at high values (around 0.16 mM).
