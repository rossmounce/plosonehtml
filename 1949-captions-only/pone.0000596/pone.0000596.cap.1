Weight loss in response to DSS is presented as percent of the starting weight (* p&lt;0.05 versus control, # p&lt;0.05 versus DSS alone) (A). Colonic histological sections were scored as described in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a> section (* p&lt;0.05 versus control, # p&lt;0.05 versus DSS alone) (B).</p>
