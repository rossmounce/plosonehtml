                Figure 1.  2% luteolin diet worsens DSS-induced experimental colitis as measured by weight loss and histologic score.2% luteolin or AIN-76 fed mice (n = 7 per group) were exposed to 3% DSS in drinking water ad libitum for the indicated time and monitored as described in the Methods section. Weight loss in response to DSS is presented as percent of the starting weight (* p&lt;0.05 versus control, # p&lt;0.05 versus DSS alone) (A). Colonic histological sections were scored as described in the Methods section (* p&lt;0.05 versus control, # p&lt;0.05 versus DSS alone) (B).
