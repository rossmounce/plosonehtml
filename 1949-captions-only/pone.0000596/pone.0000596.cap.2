Photomicrographs (Nikon cool-pix digital camera) are shown on the left. Representative images are shown (A). Confocal imaging of colonic sections from NF-κB<sup>EGFP</sup> mice (n = 3 per group) after 6 days of 3% DSS exposure was performed immediately after dissection as described in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. Representative results are shown (B). A schematic representation of the colon indicates the plane depicted in the confocal microscopic images. Importantly, EGFP accumulation (NF-κB activation) is predominantly seen in lamina propria mononuclear cells located in between the crypts (LPMNC, light purple and green), and not in surface and crypt epithelium, which is damaged by DSS (light grey) (C).</p>
