                Figure 2.  Enhanced EGFP expression in luteolin fed, DSS exposed NF-κBEGFP mice as compared to control diet is confined to lamina propria mononuclear cells.NF-κBEGFP mice (n = 7 per group) were sacrificed after 6 days of 3% DSS exposure, and dissected colon (left panel) and duodenum/proximal jejunum (right panel) were imaged at this time for EGFP using the Lightools Research macroimaging system with a dual output lighting (right). Photomicrographs (Nikon cool-pix digital camera) are shown on the left. Representative images are shown (A). Confocal imaging of colonic sections from NF-κBEGFP mice (n = 3 per group) after 6 days of 3% DSS exposure was performed immediately after dissection as described in the Methods. Representative results are shown (B). A schematic representation of the colon indicates the plane depicted in the confocal microscopic images. Importantly, EGFP accumulation (NF-κB activation) is predominantly seen in lamina propria mononuclear cells located in between the crypts (LPMNC, light purple and green), and not in surface and crypt epithelium, which is damaged by DSS (light grey) (C).
