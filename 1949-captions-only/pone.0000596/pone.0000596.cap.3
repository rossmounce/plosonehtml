COX-2 expression and caspase 3 processing were evaluated using specific antibodies against cleaved caspase 3 and COX-2, respectively, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique (A). NF-κB<sup>EGFP</sup> mice (n = 7/group) were sacrificed after 2 days of 3% DSS exposure, and cellular localization of COX-2 proteins (top panel) and caspase 3 processing (middle panel) were analyzed in the colon using IHC. Sections were counterstained with a mixture of methyl-green and alcian-blue. An isotype-control antibody was used to determine staining specificity on the same colonic section (lower panel). Representative results out of 2 different sections per each animal (n = 14/group) are shown (B).</p>
