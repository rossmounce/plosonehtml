                Figure 3.  2% luteolin enhances caspase 3 activation and suppresses COX-2 protein accumulation in enterocytes after DSS exposure.NF-κBEGFP mice (n = 7/group) were sacrificed after 2 days of 3% DSS exposure and protein (20 µg) from primary enterocytes (A, left) and total colonic lysates (A, right) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. COX-2 expression and caspase 3 processing were evaluated using specific antibodies against cleaved caspase 3 and COX-2, respectively, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique (A). NF-κBEGFP mice (n = 7/group) were sacrificed after 2 days of 3% DSS exposure, and cellular localization of COX-2 proteins (top panel) and caspase 3 processing (middle panel) were analyzed in the colon using IHC. Sections were counterstained with a mixture of methyl-green and alcian-blue. An isotype-control antibody was used to determine staining specificity on the same colonic section (lower panel). Representative results out of 2 different sections per each animal (n = 14/group) are shown (B).
