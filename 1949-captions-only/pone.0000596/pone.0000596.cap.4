                Figure 4.  2% luteolin diet ameliorates cecal colitis and decreases lamina-propria EGFP expression in SPF-associated IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice.Germ-free IL-10wt/wt;NF-κBEGFP and IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice were transferred to a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) environment and immediately placed on a diet containing 2% luteolin versus AIN-76 control chow (7/subgroup). After 4 weeks, mice were euthanized, and colonic EGFP-expression was imaged macroscopically and by confocal microscopy as described in figure 2 (A). Colonic histological sections from 4 weeks SPF-associated IL-10wt/wt;NF-κBEGFP and IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice were taken and scored as described in the Methods section (* p&lt;0.05 versus AIN-76 control chow) (B).
