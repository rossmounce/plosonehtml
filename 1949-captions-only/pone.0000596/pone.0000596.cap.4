After 4 weeks, mice were euthanized, and colonic EGFP-expression was imaged macroscopically and by confocal microscopy as described in <a href="#pone-0000596-g002">figure 2</a> (A). Colonic histological sections from 4 weeks SPF-associated IL-10<sup>wt/wt</sup>;NF-κB<sup>EGFP</sup> and IL-10<sup>−/−</sup>;NF-κB<sup>EGFP</sup> mice were taken and scored as described in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a> section (* p&lt;0.05 versus AIN-76 control chow) (B).</p>
