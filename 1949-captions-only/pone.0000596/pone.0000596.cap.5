Luciferase activity after 16h was measured using an Lmax microplate reader and results were normalized for extract protein concentrations. Representative results of at least 3 independent experiments are shown (* p&lt;0.01 versus TNFα alone) (A). HT29 cells were pretreated with luteolin (100 µM) for 45min, and then stimulated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA (1 µg) was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using specific human C-IAP1, C-IAP2, X-IAP and β-actin primers. Results are representative of three independent experiments (B).</p>
