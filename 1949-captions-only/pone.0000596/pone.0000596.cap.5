                Figure 5.  Luteolin blocks TNFα-induced NF-κB activity and suppresses TNFα-induced C-IAP1 and C-IAP2 mRNA accumulation in HT29 cells.HT29 cells were infected with Ad5κB-LUC, and TNFα (5 ng/ml) was added in the presence or absence of various concentrations of luteolin. Luciferase activity after 16h was measured using an Lmax microplate reader and results were normalized for extract protein concentrations. Representative results of at least 3 independent experiments are shown (* p&lt;0.01 versus TNFα alone) (A). HT29 cells were pretreated with luteolin (100 µM) for 45min, and then stimulated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA (1 µg) was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using specific human C-IAP1, C-IAP2, X-IAP and β-actin primers. Results are representative of three independent experiments (B).
