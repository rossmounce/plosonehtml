                Figure 6.  Luteolin-treatment sensitizes TNFα-exposed HT29 cells to DNA fragmentation and cytoplasmic accumulation of oligonucleosome-bound DNA.HT29 cells were pretreated with various concentration of luteolin alone or in combination with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were lysed, DNA extracted and separated on a 1% agarose gel. Results are representative of three independent experiments (A). HT29 cells were treated as described above for 12 and 24 h. Cells were lysed and apoptosis measured using an ELISA-based assay as described in the Method section. Representative results of at least 3 independent experiments are shown (* p&lt;0.01 versus TNFα alone) (B).
