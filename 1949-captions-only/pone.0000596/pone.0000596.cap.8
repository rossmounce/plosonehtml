                Figure 8.  Luteolin-treatment inhibits TNFα-induced COX-2 gene expression in HT29 cells.HT29 cells were pretreated with luteolin (100 µM) for 45 min, and then stimulated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA (1 µg) was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and COX-2 mRNA was amplified using specific human primers (A). Cells were treated as described above for 12 h and 24 h, and COX-2 protein accumulation was detected using Western blot analysis (B). Cells were treated as described above for 24 h and PGE2 production was measured from the cell culture supernatants using ELISA (* p&lt;0.01 versus TNFα plus luteolin) (C). All data are representative of 3 independent experiments.
