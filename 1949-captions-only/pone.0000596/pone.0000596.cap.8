Total RNA (1 µg) was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and COX-2 mRNA was amplified using specific human primers (A). Cells were treated as described above for 12 h and 24 h, and COX-2 protein accumulation was detected using Western blot analysis (B). Cells were treated as described above for 24 h and PGE<sub>2</sub> production was measured from the cell culture supernatants using ELISA (* p&lt;0.01 versus TNFα plus luteolin) (C). All data are representative of 3 independent experiments.</p>
