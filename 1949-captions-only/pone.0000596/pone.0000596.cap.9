                Figure 9.  Proposed model for the differential effect of luteolin in DSS-induced acute colitis and in spontaneous chronic colitis in IL-10−/−-mice.DSS-induced acute colitis in NF-κBEGFP transgenic mice correlates with enhanced EGFP expression (NF-κB activation) in the lamina propria due to the disruption of the epithelial monolayer and the uptake of luminal antigens by lamina propria mononuclear cells (A; middle panel). An impaired epithelial wound-healing response and increased apoptosis in luteolin-fed mice lead to enhanced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells and exacerbate DSS-induced colitis (A; right panel). In the context of a primarily intact epithelial layer during colitis in IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice, luteolin decreases bacteria-induced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells, which correlates with an attenuation of colitis (B; middle and right panel). Schematic representation of luteolin's impact on intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells: NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells is likely protective (wound-healing response, anti-apoptotis), and its inhibition by luteolin consequently aggravates intestinal damage. As opposed, antigen- (e.g. bacteria-) induced NF-κB activation in lamina propria mononuclear cells leads to NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, thus its inhibition by luteolin likely ameliorates intestinal inflammation (C).
