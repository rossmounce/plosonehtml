An impaired epithelial wound-healing response and increased apoptosis in luteolin-fed mice lead to enhanced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells and exacerbate DSS-induced colitis (A; right panel). In the context of a primarily intact epithelial layer during colitis in IL-10<sup>−/−</sup>;NF-κB<sup>EGFP</sup> mice, luteolin decreases bacteria-induced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells, which correlates with an attenuation of colitis (B; middle and right panel). Schematic representation of luteolin's impact on intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells: NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells is likely protective (wound-healing response, anti-apoptotis), and its inhibition by luteolin consequently aggravates intestinal damage. As opposed, antigen- (e.g. bacteria-) induced NF-κB activation in lamina propria mononuclear cells leads to NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, thus its inhibition by luteolin likely ameliorates intestinal inflammation (C).</p>
