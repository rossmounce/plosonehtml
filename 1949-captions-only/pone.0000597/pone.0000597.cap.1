This acquisition provides a 3D diffusion function at every location in the brain. This data set is called a <em>diffusion map</em>. It is shaped by the local tissue characteristics, in particular by the orientation of axonal bundles existing in the brain. Second, based on this map we generate a number of 3D curves (called fibers) that follow the path laid by the white matter axonal bundles. Third, independently from the previous step, we use a heuristic that partitions the brain white matter-gray matter interface into small areas of equal surface (called Regions Of Interest-ROIs) covering the whole cortex and deep cerebral nuclei boundaries. Finally, in the fourth step, we combine the output of steps two and three: the ROIs become nodes and the fibers are transformed into edges in the resulting graph. This graph estimates the density of white matter connections between any two regions of gray matter.</p>
