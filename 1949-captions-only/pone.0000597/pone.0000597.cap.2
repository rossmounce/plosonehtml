                Figure 2.  Tractography.A) The result of the “diffusion MRI acquisition” step. In every voxel of a coronal slide the Orientation Density Function (ODF) captures locally for every direction the diffusion “intensity”. B) Zoom in the centrum semi-ovale C) Each ODF is replaced by a set of vectors defining its local maxima. D) Fibers are computed following the local diffusion maxima; they are uniformly initiated over the whole brain white matter. See also Video S1 in Supporting Information.
