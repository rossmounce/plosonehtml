                Figure 3.  Basic characteristics of nodes in the graph of brain connectivity.P(d) [P(s)] is the probability that a randomly chosen node has the degree [strength] equal to d [s]. The node degree distribution (a) and node strength distribution (b) are lin-binned and plotted in log-lin scale. Color code: subject 1 (blue circles), subject 2 (green diamonds)
