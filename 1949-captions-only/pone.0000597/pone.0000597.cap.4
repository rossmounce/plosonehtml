                Figure 4.  Basic characteristics of edges in the graph of brain connectivity.(a) The distribution of edge lengths l in log-lin scale, lin-binned. (b) The distribution of edge weights w in log-log scale, log-binned. (c) Scatter plot of w vs l. The symbols are lin-binned average values for subject 1 (blue circles) and subject 2 (green diamonds).
