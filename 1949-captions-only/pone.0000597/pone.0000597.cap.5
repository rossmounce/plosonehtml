As a reference we take a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges, and the same degree distribution. Color code: subject 1 (blue circles), subject 2 (green diamonds), random graph reference (black filled circles). The results are averaged over 10 realizations of the “random fibers” filtering and random graphs; the confidence intervals (not shown) are comparable with the symbol size.</p>
