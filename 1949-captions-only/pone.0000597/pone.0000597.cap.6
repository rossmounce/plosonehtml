Visual system white matter connectivity derived from tractography: Views from the left (a), from the top (b), zoomed anterior (c) and posterior (d).White matter–gray matter interfaces: Magenta = posterior part of the thalamus, blue and gray = right and left V1, orange = V2, cyan = V3, red = V5. Fibers: yellow = homotopic V1, red = V1–V2, white = V2–V3, green = V2–V5, blue = lateral geniculate body–V1. See also Video S3 in Supporting Information.
