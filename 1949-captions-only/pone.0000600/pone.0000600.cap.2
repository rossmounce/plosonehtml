                Figure 2.  Phloem amino acid content.Amino acid concentrations (mM) in phloem samples from three transgenic varieties belonging to three transformation events and their correspondent near isogenic lines. Different letters indicate significant differences between amino acid concentration within one transgenic/isogenic pair (p&lt;0.05). Amino acid abbreviations: arg, arginine; tyr, tyrosine; lys, lysine; orn, ornithine; phe, phenylalanine; leu/ile, leucine/isoleucine; his/val, histidine/valine; gln, glutamine; pro, proline; thr, threonine; ala, alanine; ser, serine; asn, asparagine; gly, glycine; glu, glutamate; asp, aspartate. Asterisks indicate the essential amino acids.
