                Figure 3.  Correlating transformation with amino acid content.Distribution of amino acid concentrations (plotted as vectors) in samples of transgenic/isogenic pairs of maize plants belonging to three transformation events (vector Mon 810 denotes the pair MEB307Bt/Monumental; vector Bt11 denotes the pair N4640Bt/N4640; vector Event 176 denotes the pair Valmont/Prelude, vector trans indicates transgenic varieties belonging to all three transformation events) in the ordination biplot of an redundancy analysis (RDA). Axis 1 (Eigen Value = 0.054) and axis 2 (Eigen Value = 0.018) are presented. The ellipses group the different transgenic/isogenic pairs. For amino acid abbreviations see figure 2. Asterisks indicate the essential amino acids.
