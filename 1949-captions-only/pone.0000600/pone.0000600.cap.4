                Figure 4.  Amino acid content and aphid performance.Distribution of amino acid concentrations (plotted as vectors) in samples of transgenic/isogenic pairs of maize plants in the ordination biplot of a principal component analysis (PCA). Axis 1 (Eigen Value = 0.56) and axis 2 (Eigen Value = 0.19) are presented. The two clusters formed by either the transgenic or the isogenic varieties are indicated. The vector aphid performance indicates the colony performance of aphids (for details see figure 3). For amino acid abbreviations see figure 2. Asterisks indicate the essential amino acids.
