Lines are rank-ordered by failure rate in 1 week old flies. (B) Similarly for 5-week old flies. Cutoff lines show 55% and 25% failure rates, respectively. (C) The two measures are significantly correlated (p&lt;0.01) for all but six lines that account for most of the extreme effects, as shown by the crossing of line means between 1 week (left) and 5 week (right) failure rates. (D) Correlation between failure rates at the two ages, with the six extreme lines shown in red.</p>
