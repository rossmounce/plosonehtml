                Figure 2.  Visualization of arrhythmicity in 1 week old flies.Each panel shows a 30 second M-mode profile underneath an expanded 5-second profile. Lines NC88 and NC68 have normal rhythmicity, and lines 70, 14 and 1 show different modes of arrhythmia. A representative F2 progeny of the yw × NC1 cross is also shown. Histograms to the right of each profile indicate the distribution of beat lengths (heart period) for all flies in each genotype. Data were normalized to the average of the median values and expressed as a percentage of the total beats recorded. Heart periods longer than 1.5s were grouped together and are shown in the final bar of the histograms (they can be considered as ‘asystoles’). (B) Heart beat rhythmicity was quantified as the standard deviation of heart period, which clearly shows the increased variance of beat length in the arrhythmic lines. (C) Fractional shortening, computed as the ratio of the systolic to the diastolic diameters (see red lines in panel A), is a measure of the ejection volume, which is significantly reduced in NC70 relative to that in NC88.
