                Figure 3.  Linkage of NC1 defect to interval 97C.The plot of SFP score according to chromosomal position shows a clear peak toward the end of chromosome 3R with a maximum at interval 97C (the second peak at the tip of 3R was only seen in the second replicate). A second peak in the yw region at the tip of the X chromosome is also seen. Dashed lines show 99% permutation limits for sliding window analysis of scores.
