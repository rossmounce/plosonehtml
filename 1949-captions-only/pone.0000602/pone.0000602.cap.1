The compartments are named after the position that their cells and progeny will occupy by the end of development. (B, C) Early in development (B), Serrate (Ser) signals to V cells to activate Notch (N). Likewise, Delta (Dl) signals to D cells to activate Notch modified by Fringe (Fng) along the DV boundary. Later in development (C), ligands expression becomes symmetric with respect to the boundary and a positive feedback-loop between Wingless (Wg) and Ser/Dl-expressing cells maintains the signaling center along the DV boundary. Notch activity elicits Cut expression that represses Dl and Ser in boundary cells.</p>
