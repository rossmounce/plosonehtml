(B) Clones of cells lacking <em>cut</em> activity marked by the absence of GFP (red). Sens (in blue) starts to be expressed in boundary cells. (C) Mature <em>cut<sup>6</sup></em> mutant wing disc that expresses the intracellular domain of Notch (N<sup>intra</sup>) under <em>dpp<sup>Gal4</sup></em> control. Wg protein expression is shown in red and Sens protein expression in blue. (D) Mature wing disc that expresses Cut and GFP (green) under <em>dpp<sup>Gal4</sup></em> control. Note the loss of Sens expression (blue) and ectopic expression of Wg (red) in non-boundary cells. (A'–D') <em>In silico</em> counterparts of the results shown in (A–D).</p>
