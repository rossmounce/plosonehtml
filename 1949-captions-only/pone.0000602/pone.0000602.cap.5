                Figure 5.  Cut blocks the Wg pathway at the level or upstream of Armadillo.(A–C) Mature wild-type (A), cut6 (B) and dppGal4; UAS-Cut UAS-GFP (C) wing discs labeled to visualize Armadillo (Arm) protein expression levels (in white or red) and GFP (in green). (D–I) Mature wing discs that expressed dFz2 (D), Dsh (F), ArmS10 (H), dFz2 and Cut (E), Dsh and Cut (G), or ArmS10 and Cut (I) under the control of the ptcGal4 driver and labeled to visualize Senseless (Sens) protein expression levels (in blue) and Cut (in red).
