                Figure 6.  Proposed regulatory network for the establishment of the DV boundary: Cut renders stability to the DV boundary.(A) Proposed regulatory network for stable formation and maintenance of the DV boundary. The network includes the capacity of boundary cells, defined by the activity of Cut, to block the Wg signaling pathway at all levels (both positive and negative regulations). (Bâ€“E) Wg expression in wild-type (B, C) or cut6 mutant (D, E) wing discs at 90 hr (B, D) or at 120 hr (C, E) after egg laying (AEL).
