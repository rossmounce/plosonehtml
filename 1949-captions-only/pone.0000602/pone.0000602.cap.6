The network includes the capacity of boundary cells, defined by the activity of Cut, to block the Wg signaling pathway at all levels (both positive and negative regulations). (Bâ€“E) Wg expression in <em>wild-type</em> (B, C) or <em>cut<sup>6</sup></em> mutant (D, E) wing discs at 90 hr (B, D) or at 120 hr (C, E) after egg laying (AEL).</p>
