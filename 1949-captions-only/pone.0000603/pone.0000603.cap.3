C, Coding GC% of paralogs of processed pseudogenes with (light blue filled) and without PCIs (open blue stroke) shift towards lower GC content. D, Coding GC% of housekeeping genes with (purple fill) and without PCIs (purple stroke) shift towards higher GC. See <a href="#s4">Methods</a> for subset derivation.</p>
