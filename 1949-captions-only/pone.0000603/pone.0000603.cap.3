                Figure 3.  Distribution of coding GC% of RefGenes with PCIs.Unimodal (A) and bimodal distribution curves (B) were fitted to coding GC% distribution. C, Coding GC% of paralogs of processed pseudogenes with (light blue filled) and without PCIs (open blue stroke) shift towards lower GC content. D, Coding GC% of housekeeping genes with (purple fill) and without PCIs (purple stroke) shift towards higher GC. See Methods for subset derivation.
