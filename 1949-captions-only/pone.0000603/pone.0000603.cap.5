                Figure 5.  Principal component analysis (PCA). A, PCA analysis using six variables at either 53% (left) or 59% (right) variance.B, Two-dimensional dot plots confirming the existence of distinct PCI+ gene subsets (red cross, low GC; blue circle, high GC) based on intron size/number, transcription, and evolutionary rate. C, Three-dimensional dot plot of the GC-rich (blue) and GC-poor (red) PCI+ gene clusters.
