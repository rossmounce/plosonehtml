Note that the large majority of cortical neurons are not labelled (open arrow). Both the apical dendrite (arrows) and basal dendrites (arrowhead) are clearly visible. (B–D) Electron micrographs revealing the subcellular distribution of pERK immunoreactivity in visual cortical neurons. At low power magnification, the immunoperoxidase reaction product is visibles in the cell nucleus (nu) and the cytoplasm (cyt) of a pyramidal neuron (B). C and D show pERK labelling at asymmetric synaptic contacts in cortical layer I. Arrows indicate an axo-dendritic (C) and an axo-spinous synapse (D) in which pERK immunoreactivity is postsynaptic. Note that pERK immunoperoxidase labelling is also present over the PSD of both contacts. In C, two presynaptically labelled axo-spinous contacts are also visible (arrowheads). Scale bars: A = 20 µm. B = 0.8 µm. C and D = 0.2 µm. de, dendrite; ax, axon terminal; sp, dendritic spine.</p>
