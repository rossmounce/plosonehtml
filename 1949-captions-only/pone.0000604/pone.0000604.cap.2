(B) At higher magnification, gold particles decorate the external membranes of the rough ER. Note that symmetric synaptic contacts (empty arrows) appear to be mostly unlabelled. (C) Low power view of the neuropil of layers II/III showing intense pERK immunogold labelling in dendritic profiles. The immunoreactivity is distributed both in the dendritic cytoplasm and near or over the plasma membrane. An intensely labelled dendritic spine is also visible (arrow). (D) pERK immunogold signals in a dendritic process and a protruding spine (Sp) receiving an asymmetric synapse (arrow). Note that the presynaptic profile is completely unlabelled. (E) pERK labelling in a presynaptic terminal establishing an axospinous contact. Scale bars: A = 400 nm. Bâ€“E = 200 nm.</p>
