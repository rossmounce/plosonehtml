                Figure 1.  Early transformation induces higher growth rate and enables growth in soft agar.A. Methylene blue assay for cell growth. Primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells were plated at equal densities and grown for three days. Each day a representative plate was fixed. All plates were stained with methylene blue as described elsewhere [10]. Error bars represent standard deviations of triplicates. Similar results were obtained in at least 5 independent experiments. B. Cells were plated at equal densities in soft agar. Two weeks later, live cells were stained with MTT. The figure shows two fields of each cell type (Bar = 200 Âµm). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.
