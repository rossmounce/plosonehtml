Representative western blots of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 in their phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms under normal growth conditions. Blots were reacted with the indicated antibodies as described in “Experimental Procedures”. Tubulin serves as a loading control. Graph shows quantification of phosphorylated protein normalized to the total protein level. Results were normalized to the levels in early HF1 cells. Error bars are standard errors of three independent experiments. B. Representative western blots of cells under normal growth conditions and after 24 h starvation. Blots were reacted as in A. Graphs show quantification of protein phosphorylation level vs. total protein level. Results were normalized to the protein level in untreated keratinocytes. Error bars are standard errors of three independent experiments.</p>
