Early and late HF1 cells were serum starved for 48 h in the presence of 50 ng/ml IGF1, 30 ng/ml EGF, 30 ng/ml NRG or 10 µM LPA. Stimulated cells were compared to starved and non-starved (FBS) cells. Cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 fraction was quantified as a measure of the apoptotic cells. Error bars represent the standard error of at least three independent experiments. B. Cell cycle analysis of non-starved and starved cells in the presence or absence of IGF1. After 48 h treatment cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Error bars represent the standard error of at least three independent experiments. C. Representative western blots of cells after IGF1 stimulation. HF1 cells were starved for 24 h and stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF for the last 10 minutes or the whole 24 h of treatment. Stimulated cells were compared to starved and non-starved cells. Blots were reacted with the indicated antibodies. On the right, the densities of the phosphorylated proteins were normalized to the levels of the “total” proteins (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated), where the starved cells were assigned a value of 1. Tubulin serves as a loading control. Error bars are standard errors of three independent experiments. D. Real-time PCR results of NOXA expression vs. HPRT expression in cells under normal condition or under starvation with or without IGF1. Results were normalized to the results from untreated controls of each cell. Error bars are standard errors of three independent experiments.</p>
