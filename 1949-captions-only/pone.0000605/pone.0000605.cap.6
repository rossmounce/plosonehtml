Cells were starved for 48 h in the presence of IGF1 and treated with either 10 µM Akt inhibitor, 50 µM PD98059, 10 µM SP600125 or 1 µM SB203580. Control cells were non-starved and starved cells with or without IGF1 treatment. Cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 fraction represents cell death. Error bars represent standard error of three independent experiments. B. Real-time PCR results of NOXA vs. HPRT of cells under normal conditions or during starvation with or without IGF1 in the presence or absence of 10 µM Akt inhibitor or 10 µM SP600125. Results were normalized to the results from untreated controls of each cell. Error bars are standard errors of two independent experiments.</p>
