Cells were starved for 48 h with or without IGF1. Cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The subG1 fraction represents cell death. B. Real-time PCR results of NOXA vs. HPRT of cells under normal conditions or during starvation with or without IGF1. C. Representative western blots of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 in their phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms under normal growth conditions and upon 24 h starvation. Reaction with anti-beta-Catenin serves as a loading control. Blots were reacted with the indicated antibodies as described in “Experimental Procedures”. Graph shows quantification of phosphorylated protein normalized to the total protein level. Results were normalized to the levels in untreated SiHa cells. Error bars are standard errors of three independent experiments. D. Cells were starved for 48 h with or without IGF1 and treated with either 10 µM Akt inhibitor, 10 µM U0126, 10 µM SP600125 or 1 µM SB203580. Cell death analysis was performed as in A. Error bars represent standard error of four experiments.</p>
