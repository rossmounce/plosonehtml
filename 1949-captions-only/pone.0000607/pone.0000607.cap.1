The structure of FtsY is comprised of the N-terminal helix (residues 1–10), shown in cyan; the N-domain in blue; the G-domain in green; the insertion box domain (IBD) in gold and the conserved GTPase motifs (MI, MII, MII and MIV) in purple. (B) A ribbon diagram of the structure of FtsY in complex with non-hydrolyzable substrate analog GMPPNP crystallized in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. No evidence for a coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion was observed similar to the structure of GDP-bound FtsY <a href="#pone.0000607-Padmanabhan1">[10]</a>. (C) A simulated annealing 2Fo–Fc omit map, contoured at 1σ, is shown. The bound GMPPNP was omitted. (D) Ribbon diagram of the structure of FtsY in complex with GMPPNP crystallized in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. (E) A simulated annealing 2Fo–Fc omit map, contoured at 1σ with bound GMPPNP omitted. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the guanine and ribose moieties of the bound GMPPNP are less ordered than in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (C).</p>
