                Figure 4.  SRP-induced nucleotide specificity of FtsY.The specificity-determining hydrogen bonding interactions between GMPPNP and Asp258 are on average 0.6 Ã… more distant in the (A) monomeric nucleotide bound form of FtsY (F1) than for (D) FtsY in complex with Ffh. This additional spacing allows for the non-specific binding and hydrolysis of (B) ATP and (C) XTP in the monomeric form but not the complexed form of FtsY as observed in biochemical studies by Shan and Walter [24]. The ATP and XTP molecules were modeled based on the position of GMPPNP in the monomeric form of FtsY (F1).
