This additional spacing allows for the non-specific binding and hydrolysis of (B) ATP and (C) XTP in the monomeric form but not the complexed form of FtsY as observed in biochemical studies by Shan and Walter <a href="#pone.0000607-Shan3">[24]</a>. The ATP and XTP molecules were modeled based on the position of GMPPNP in the monomeric form of FtsY (F1).</p>
