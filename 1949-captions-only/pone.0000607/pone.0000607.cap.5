In the structures of apo and GMPPNP-bound FtsY the N-terminal helix, N1 (cyan), extends into the N-domain and packs against the conserved GTPase motif IV which positions the nucleotide-specifying Asp258 to interact with the nucleotide. The α4 helix (yellow) anchors the interface between the N and G domains. The C-terminal helix, αC (red), which along with N1 pack together at the N/G interface, is observed in a similar arrangement in the three monomeric forms (A, B, D) but rearranges in the complex form of FtsY (C).</p>
