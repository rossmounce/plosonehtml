                Figure 6.  N1 mediates domain shift between the N and G domains.(A) FtsY:GMPPNP, (B) FtsY:GDP, and (C) apo FtsY superimposed with FtsY:GMPPCP from the targeting complex with Ffh (transparent grey) (alignment on P-loop as in Figure 5). The N/G domain organization is similar for the apo, monomeric GMPPNP-bound form and complex form of FtsY, but differs in the GDP structure. Deletion of the N1 helix (cyan) in the GDP structure allows for this observed shift in the N-domain (blue) relative to the G-domain (green).
