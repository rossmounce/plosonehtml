                Figure 1.  Sequences of retroviral LTR-LTR junctions and oligonucleotide substrates.A) The retroviral sequences found at the LTR-LTR junctions of 2-LTR circles are almost perfect palindromes [15]–[18]. The bases underlined correspond to imperfect palindromic sequences. The 5′-CA dinucleotide (U5-LTR) or its complementary sequence GT (U3-LTR), essential for the 3′-processing reaction, is shown in bold. The vertical dashed line indicates the axis of symmetry. B) Summary of the various DNA substrates used for palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing reactions (only the top strands are shown). The mutations in the Mut1 and Mut2 sequences are underlined.
