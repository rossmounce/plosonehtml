The 38-mer duplex was radiolabelled either on the 5′-extremity of the PalB ODN (top strand) (lanes 1-7) or on the 5′-extremity of the PalA ODN (bottom strand) (lanes 8–10). The metallic cofactor was Mg<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 2–4, 9–10) or Mn<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 5–7). Lanes 3, 6 and 9: 1.5 µM IN; Lanes 2, 5 and 10: 3 µM IN. Lanes 4 and 7: 3 µM IN + 1 mM EDTA. Lanes 1 and 8: PalA/PalB DNA substrate digested with <em>Sca</em>I. B) Relative cleavage efficiencies for the various DNA positions in the HIV-1 palindromic junction and 3′-processing substrate. The relative cleavage efficiency corresponds to a ratio between cleavage occurring at one position and total IN cleavage activity. This ratio is directly related to the specificity of the cleavage.</p>
