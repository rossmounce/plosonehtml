                Figure 2.  Endonucleolytic activity of HIV-1 IN on the palindromic U5-U3 junction.A) IN was incubated with 12.5 nM of 38-mer PalA/PalB duplex mimicking the HIV-1 palindromic U5-U3 junction in the presence of 7.5 mM divalent cation, for 2 h at 37°C. The 38-mer duplex was radiolabelled either on the 5′-extremity of the PalB ODN (top strand) (lanes 1-7) or on the 5′-extremity of the PalA ODN (bottom strand) (lanes 8–10). The metallic cofactor was Mg2+ (lanes 2–4, 9–10) or Mn2+ (lanes 5–7). Lanes 3, 6 and 9: 1.5 µM IN; Lanes 2, 5 and 10: 3 µM IN. Lanes 4 and 7: 3 µM IN + 1 mM EDTA. Lanes 1 and 8: PalA/PalB DNA substrate digested with ScaI. B) Relative cleavage efficiencies for the various DNA positions in the HIV-1 palindromic junction and 3′-processing substrate. The relative cleavage efficiency corresponds to a ratio between cleavage occurring at one position and total IN cleavage activity. This ratio is directly related to the specificity of the cleavage.
