IN was incubated with DNA substrates in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer for 2 h at 37°C. Lanes 1 and 2: FP53B/FP53A substrate (PFV). Lanes 3 and 4: PalB/PalA substrate (HIV). Lanes 5–8: Mut1 substrate (CA-&gt;GT). Lanes 9–12: Mut2 substrate (GTAC-&gt;CATG). Lanes 2, 4, 6 and 10: 3 µM IN. Lanes 7 and 11: 1.5 µM IN. Lanes 1, 3, 5 and 9: negative control with 3 µM IN + 1 mM EDTA. Lanes 8 and 12: <em>Sca</em>I activity on mutated DNA duplexes. B) Histogram of cleavage efficiencies for the different DNA positions in the HIV-1 LTR-LTR junction. Black bars, wt. White bars, Mut1.</p>
