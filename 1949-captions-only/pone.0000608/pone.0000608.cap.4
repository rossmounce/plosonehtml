                Figure 4.  Differential responses of palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing activities to increasing IN concentrations.PalB/PalA or HIV38A/HIV38B duplexes (12.5 nM) were incubated with increasing concentrations of IN for 2 h at 37°C. Palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing activities were quantified as indicated in Materials and Methods and plotted versus IN concentration: Palindrome cleavage (straight line); 3′-processing (dashed line). A) Ionic strength increased with IN concentration. B) The experiment was performed as in A, except that ionic strength was kept constant ([NaCl]  =  200 mM final concentration). The time courses of product formation for palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing were compared under conditions of optimal IN concentration (3 µM), with 200 mM NaCl (inset). FDNA represents the fractional saturation function of DNA sites, as measured by fluorescence anisotropy (see Materials and Methods), using either PalB/PalA or HIV38A/HIV38B duplexes. FDNA is indicated for two IN concentrations (1.5 and 3 µM).
