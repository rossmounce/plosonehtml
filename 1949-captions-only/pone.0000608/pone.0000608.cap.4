Palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing activities were quantified as indicated in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a> and plotted versus IN concentration: Palindrome cleavage (straight line); 3′-processing (dashed line). A) Ionic strength increased with IN concentration. B) The experiment was performed as in A, except that ionic strength was kept constant ([NaCl]  =  200 mM final concentration). The time courses of product formation for palindrome cleavage and 3′-processing were compared under conditions of optimal IN concentration (3 µM), with 200 mM NaCl (inset). F<sub>DNA</sub> represents the fractional saturation function of DNA sites, as measured by fluorescence anisotropy (see <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>), using either PalB/PalA or HIV38A/HIV38B duplexes. F<sub>DNA</sub> is indicated for two IN concentrations (1.5 and 3 µM).</p>
