                Figure 5.  HIV-1 IN oligomer recruitment to the LTR-LTR junction.The 38-bp duplex PalB/PalA (1 pmol) was incubated with IN (5 pmol) for 0 to 60 min (lanes 2–7) in the presence of AHDAP (300 µM) in a final volume of 10 µL (yielding DNA and IN concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 µM, respectively). Crosslinked products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and gel autoradiography. MW: Molecular weight markers (kDa). Lane 1: no IN. The weak reduction of the signal observed lanes 6 and 7 as comparison to the lane 5 is due to the time-dependent formation of higher-order oligomeric states of IN which are dependent on the AHDAP [10].
