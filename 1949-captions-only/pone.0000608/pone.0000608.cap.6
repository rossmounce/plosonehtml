                Figure 6.  Palindrome cleavage by purified IN oligomers.The pJCT plasmid (12.5 nM) containing the LTR-LTR junction was incubated alone (lanes 1 and 4) or with 3 µM of either pure crosslinked dimers (Di) (lanes 2–3) or pure crosslinked tetramers (Te) of IN (lanes 5–6) for 4 hours at 37°C. It was then subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel (1%, 50V, 30 min) in the presence of BET (50 µg). Plasmid cleavage by IN was followed by partial digestion with EcoRI (lanes 3 and 6).
