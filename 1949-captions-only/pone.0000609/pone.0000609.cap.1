                Figure 1.  Maximum likelihood tree of the STIM protein family.The phylogenetic tree constructed with the program PROML [45] shows the evolutionary relationship of the STIM protein family. The two vertebrate branches, STIM-1 and STIM-2, are indicated with black arrows. Fish-specific duplications in vertebrate STIM branches are indicated with black bars. Sequences that failed in the 5% chi-square test of Tree Puzzle [44] were removed for further phylogenetic analysis (Table S1). The unit of branch length is the expected fraction of amino acids substitution. Aae, A. aegypti; Aga, A. gambiae; Ame, A. mellifera; Bta, B.
