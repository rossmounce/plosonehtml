                Figure 2.  Evolution of the protein domains in the STIM protein family.Schematic representations of protein domains of representative STIM molecules based on phylogeny of bilaterian animals [51]. The proline-rich domain and the lysine-rich domain of STIM molecules, which are absent in worms, insects and sea urchin, first appeared in Urochordata, as shown in C. intestinalis. Duplication of STIM molecules speculated to have occurred after Cephalochordata/Urochordata divergence is indicated with “?”. Fish-specific duplication of STIMs (Fig. 1) is not illustrated here. C, C-terminus; K-rich, lysine-rich domain; N, N-terminus; P-rich, proline-rich domain; TMS, transmembrane segment.
