The proline-rich domain and the lysine-rich domain of STIM molecules, which are absent in worms, insects and sea urchin, first appeared in Urochordata, as shown in <em>C. intestinalis</em>. Duplication of STIM molecules speculated to have occurred after Cephalochordata/Urochordata divergence is indicated with “<em>?</em>”. Fish-specific duplication of STIMs (<a href="#pone-0000609-g001">Fig. 1</a>) is not illustrated here. <em>C</em>, C-terminus; <em>K-rich</em>, lysine-rich domain; <em>N</em>, N-terminus; <em>P-rich</em>, proline-rich domain; <em>TMS</em>, transmembrane segment.</p>
