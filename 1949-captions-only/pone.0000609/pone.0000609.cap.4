Sequence alignment of the EF-hand domain of representative STIM proteins and the chicken troponin C site III sequence (PDB entry 1CTA). The structural characteristics of 1CTA including two α-helices and the central Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop are indicated above the sequence alignment. The positions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding ligands are indicated with <em>dark circle</em> symbols below the alignment. The three residues of the β-sheet structure are marked with <em>asterisk</em> symbols. B. Sequence alignment of the SAM domain of representative STIM proteins and PDB entry 1V85. The two hydrophobic residues (Leu216 and Leu218 in IV85) at the oligomeric interface of SAM domains are indicated with <em>asterisk</em> symbols. One acidic residue (Glu185 in IV85) possibly affecting the aggregation state of SAM domains <a href="#pone.0000609-Grimshaw1">[39]</a> is also indicated.</p>
