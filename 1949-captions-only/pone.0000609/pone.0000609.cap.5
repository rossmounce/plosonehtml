The posterior probability of functional divergence between vertebrate STIM-1 and STIM-2 branches were calculated with the program DIVERGE <a href="#pone.0000609-Gu1">[31]</a>. 11 of the aligned sites showed posterior probabilities &gt;0.33. The 9th site fell in a less defined region and was excluded for further analysis. The neighbor-joining tree used for DIVERGE (Fig. S1) is available in Supplementary Information. B. The localization of the residues with significant posterior probabilities was mapped onto the structural model of vertebrate STIM molecules, indicated with <em>black arrows</em>. The highly conserved double cysteine-pair region is shown as a double “C” before the EF-hand domain in the N-terminus. <em>C</em>, C terminus; <em>N</em>, N terminus.</p>
