Total RNA from skin biopsies was labeled and hybridized to microarrays containing probes corresponding to known miRNA sequences. The heat map summarizes the biological replicates for the skin specimens, and four technical replicates for each set. Color intensity is scaled within each row so that the highest expression value corresponds to bright red and the lowest to bright green. Gene names are listed to the right. (B) miRNAs showing more than 1.7-fold change between psoriasis and healthy skin (left) and atopic eczema and healthy skin (right) according to the SAM algorithm. miRNAs that are over-expressed in both psoriasis and in atopic eczema are highlighted in yellow, miRNAs that are down-regulated in both diseases are highlighted in blue. (C) The expressions of the functionally active, mature forms of four miRNAs were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR in the skin of 26 healthy individuals, and lesional skin samples of 20 patients with atopic eczema and 25 patients with psoriasis. The results for individual patients and mean are shown. Data are expressed in relative units compared to U48 RNA. ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01.</p>
