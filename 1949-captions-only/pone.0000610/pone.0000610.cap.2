                Figure 2.  Expression of miR-203, miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in human organs.The expressions of the functionally active, mature forms of miR-203, miR-21, miR-146a and miR-125b were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR in 20 healthy organs and tissues (each a pool of three donors) as well as in healthy skin (n = 26), lesional atopic eczema (n = 20) and psoriasis (n = 25) skin samples. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Data are expressed in relative units compared to U48 RNA. ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01.
