                Figure 3.  Expression of miR-203, miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in the cellular constituents of the skin.The expressions of the functionally active, mature forms of miR-203, miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b were analyzed in the cellular constituents of the skin including primary adult keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), granulocytes, eosinophils, CD69+ cells, CD19+ cells, CD56+ cells, CD4+CD25high cells, CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells and mast cells using quantitative real-time PCR. Data are expressed in relative units compared to U48 RNA.
