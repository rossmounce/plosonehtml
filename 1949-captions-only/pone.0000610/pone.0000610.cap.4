                Figure 4.  SOCS-3 may be a molecular target of miR-203 posttranscriptional repression.(A) SOCS-3 is an evolutionarily conserved target of miR-203. The putative targets site of miR-203 is highly conserved among species. The 8mer seed sequence in the 3′UTR of SOCS-3 gene corresponding to miR-203 binding site is underlined. (B) In situ hybridization with LNA-oligonucleotide probes specific to miR-203 in skin sections from healthy skin and psoriatic lesional skin. Data are representative of 6 healthy and 6 psoriatic individuals. Note strong staining in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis in psoriatic skin. The expression of SOCS-3 in healthy and psoriasis skin samples was detected using immunohistochemistry. Original magnification 200x. (C) The expression of SOCS-3 in skin from healthy individuals or lesional skin of psoriatic patients was analyzed using Western blot analysis. SOCS-3 protein levels are expressed as relative units. Bars represent means of SOCS-3 protein levels in healthy skin (n = 6) and psoriatic lesional skin (n = 11) ± SEM. ** p&lt;0.01.
