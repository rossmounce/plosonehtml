                Figure 1.  Motion analysis of the opening movement.(A) Five morphological features were identified as trace-points: (1) corner of the mouth, (2) outer corner of the nostril, (3) canthus, (4) corner of the white spot of the forehead, (5) a corner at the base of the ear-tufts. (B) Representation of the model's head position in 1/25 s time intervals: black dots represent the center of gravity of the trace-points, while thin red lines indicate head inclination.
