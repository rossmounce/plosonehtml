Results are expressed as the percentage of control±SEM for each series of experiments. a, superfusion of the ganglion compartment with 6 µM C2-ceramide for 5 min. Ctrl, control; C2, C2-ceramide. b, superfusion of the nerve trunks compartment with 16 µM GW4869 for 30 min, then of the ganglion with 6 µM C2-ceramide. Ctrl-GW, control in the presence of GW; GW+C2, C2-ceramide in the presence of GW. c, GD performed before and after superfusion of the nerve trunks with 16 µM GW4869 for 30 min. Ctrl, control; GD, gastric distension; Ctrl-GW, control in the presence of GW; GD+GW , gastric distension in the presence of GW. d, recording of duodenal contractions before and after superfusion of the nerve trunks with 16 µM GW4869 for 30 min.Ctrl, control; GW, superfusion of the nerve trunks with GW. e, superfusion of the nerve trunks with 6 µM C<sub>2</sub>-ceramide in the presence of 3 µM tetrodotoxin. Ctrl-TTX, control in the presence of TTX; C2+TTX, C2-ceramide in the presence of TTX. f, superfusion of the nerve trunks with 6 µM C<sub>2</sub>-dihydroceramide. Ctrl, control; C2-dihydro, superfusion of the nerve trunks with C2-dihydroceramide. g, superfusion of the ganglion compartment with 6 µM C2-ceramide for 5 min. Ctrl, control; C2, superfusion of the coeliac plexus with C2-ceramide, . h, superfusion of the nerve trunks with sphingomyelinase (1 UI/100 µl). Ctrl, control; SMase, superfusion of the nerve trunks with SMase . Differences with control were significant in a Student's t test, *** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05 or non significant (ns).</p>
