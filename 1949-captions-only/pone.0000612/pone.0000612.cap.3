                Figure 3.  Characterization of lipid rafts isolated from the nerve trunks and their role in the organization of GIR.a, quantification of the total protein • and cholesterol □ in sucrose gradient density fractions. The low density fraction (3) exhibited high cholesterol content and low protein/cholesterol ratio compared to the high density fractions. b, c, Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions showed the enrichment of the fraction 3 in ganglioside GM1 and annexin II. c, d, decrease in annexin II (Western blot) in the rafts fraction isolated from the nerve trunks and depletion of cholesterol by 10 mM MβCD (mean of four assays from one experiment, see methods). Ctrl, control; MβCD, after treatment with MβCD. e, effects of superfusion of the nerve trunks with 10 mM MβCD for 30 min on GIR, ceramide and cholesterol content of the nerve trunks. Ctrl, control; GD, gastric distension; Ctrl-MβCD, control in the presence of MβCD; GD+MβCD, gastric distension in the presence of MβCD. Differences with control were significant in a Student's t test, *** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05 or non significant (ns).
