                Figure 4.  Calcium, NO and cGMP are activated in cascade within the nerve fibres during the organization of the GIR.The GIR is blocked by superfusion of the nerve trunks with 13 µM BAPTA A/M (a), 1 mM L-NAME (b), 2 µM ODQ (f) and is unaffected by 3 µM carboxy-PTIO (c). Inhibition of duodenal contractions mimicking the GIR is triggered by superfusion of the nerve trunks with 40 µM DEA/NO (d) or 200 µM 8Br-cGMP (g). Inhibition of duodenal contractions triggered by superfusion of the ganglion compartment with 40 µM DEA/NO is blocked by superfusion of the nerve trunks with 16 µM GW4869 for 30 min (e). Differences with control were significant in a Student's t test, *** p&lt;0.001; ** p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05 or non significant (ns).
