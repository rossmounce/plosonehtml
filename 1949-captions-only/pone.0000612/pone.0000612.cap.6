                Figure 6.  Model of a neuronal conduction of excitation without action potentials.Activation of neutral sphingomyelinase triggers ceramide production in rafts then the release of calcium from intracellular stores which activates the NO-cGMP pathway. This pathway activates downstream sphingomyelinase in neighbouring rafts which ensures the propagation of the excitation. L-Arg: L-arginine, NOS: NO synthase, GC: guanylate cyclase, nSmase: neutral sphingomyelinase.
