Haplotypes shown in blue were mostly found in the western portion of the species' geographical range (localities A–F; <a href="#pone-0000614-g001">Fig. 1</a>) and those in red were mostly found in the eastern portion of its range (localities G–J). Haplotypes are represented as ovals, with sizes being proportional to a haplotype's frequency. Letters within ovals indicate in which sampling localities a particular haplotype was found and correspond to the letters in <a href="#pone-0000614-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Small white circles are interior node haplotypes not present in the samples. Grey areas around groups of haplotypes depict two-step nested clades.</p>
