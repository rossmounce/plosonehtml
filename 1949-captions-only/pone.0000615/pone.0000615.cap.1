Adhered MCF10A or HEK293T cells treated with 2 mM DTT or 5 µg/ml tunicamycin (Tn) respectively, were used as positive controls. (B) Quantification of the rate of DNA synthesis using a BrdU incorporation assay and flow cytometry to measure the percentage of BrdU-positive cells (filled diamonds) at different time points in suspension. The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry to identify the sub-G0 apoptotic fraction for adhered (dashed line) or suspended (dotted line) MCF10A cells for different time points. Data points show the mean±SD for BrdU–positive cells in each sample as a percentage of the total. (C) Autoradiogram of [<sup>35</sup>S] Met/Cys incorporation (right panel) into newly synthesized proteins in MCF10A cells adhered or suspended for 24 hrs (two independent samples). Coomassie Blue staining of an identical gel (left panel) shows equal protein loading. (D) Polysome profiles from 24 hr adhered (left) and suspended (right) MCF10A cells showing an increase and decrease in the monosome and polysome peaks, respectively in suspended cells. Absorbance at 254 nm (Y-axis, RNA concentration) was plotted against migration in the sucrose gradient (X-axis, bottom to top). Total RNA was isolated from individual fractions to visualize the 18S and 28S rRNAs by ethidium bromide staining.</p>
