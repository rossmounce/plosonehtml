(B) Immunoblot showing increased levels of p-eIF2α (upper panels) or ATF4 (lower panels) protein comparable to that induced by suspension, in MCF10A cells pretreated with AIIB2, a β1-integrin function-blocking Ab (10 µg/ml). Control cells were treated with an isotype-matched IgG (10 µg/ml). Total eIF2α was used as loading control. (C) Immunofluorescent staining for ATF4 (red) in MCF10A cells immediately after detachment (0 hrs) and placed in suspension for the indicated time points or treated with thapsigargin (4 µM) for 6 hrs before fixing on poly-lysine-coated coverslips to facilitate detection. (D) Photomicrographs of MCF10A cells plated on Laminin-1 coated tissue culture dishes, pre-incubated with AIIB2 (10 µg/ml) or a control IgG antibody (10 µg/ml) prior to plating or placed in suspension on agar-coated dishes in the presence of 0.5% methylcellulose in media containing 1% serum.</p>
