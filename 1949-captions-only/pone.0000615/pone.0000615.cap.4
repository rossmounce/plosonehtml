Note that only a faint phospho-protein band for phospho-GCN2 was observed at the 220 kD position but in adhered conditions. GAPDH was used to show equal loading. (C) IB for phospho-(top blot) and total- (bottom blot) eIF2α in PERK wild-type and PERK-/-MEFs grown in adhesion (A) or in suspension (S) for 24 hrs. (D) IB for phospho- and total PERK in MCF10A cells grown adhered (A) or in suspension (S) for 24 hrs. (E) IB for phospho- PERK and myc in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with empty vector control or mouse WT-myc tagged-PERK and placed in adhered (A) or suspended (S) conditions for 24 hrs. GAPDH serves as loading control. (F) IB for Myc-PERKΔC expression in parental and in MCF10A cells stably expressing either pBabepuro-myc-PERKΔC or a vector control pBabepuro-β-galactosidase construct. (G) IB for phospho- and total eIF2α and ATF4 expression in β-Gal or myc-PERKΔC expressing cells either adhered or suspended for 24 and 48 hrs. GAPDH was used as loading control. (H) IB for Myc, phospho and total eIF2α and GAPDH in MCF10A cells stably expressing β-Gal (vector control) or a pBabeneo-PERK-K618A (kinase dead) mutant. (I) Cells obtained in (H) were used in a suspension vs. adhesion assay for 24 hrs and ATF4 and GADD153 expression was detected through IB in the cell lysates. GAPDH was used as a loading control.</p>
