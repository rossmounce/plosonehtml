                Figure 5.  PERK is Required to Maintain Normal Mammary Acini Growth and Morphogenesis through Regulation of Cell Proliferation.(A) Representative images through the equatorial cross sections of acini from myc-PERKΔC, myc-PERK-K618A or β-gal expressing MCF10A cells on Day 8 of culture in 3D Matrigel, using LSCM. Nuclei are stained green using CyQuant dye. Note the increase in acinar size, luminal filling and the multi-lobular nature of the PERKΔC structures as compared to the vector control acini. PERK-K618A expressing acini were also significantly larger and always showed luminal cells, but were not frequently multi-lobulated. Scale bars = 20 µm. (B) Acinar size was measured on different days in Matrigel for β-Gal and PERKΔC or PERK-K618A cells, using SPOT™ software to measure two perpendicular diameters per acinus and calculate acinar volume considering an ellipsoid structure; volume for 50–200 acini were quantitated per time point, shown as percentage of total for the given size range, Mean±SD. (C) Confocal images for β-Gal and PERKΔC cells immunostained for cleaved (*) caspase-3 (red, top panels) or Ki-67 (red, bottom panels) on Day 8 in Matrigel. Acini are outlined with white dotted lines to delineate the normal β-Gal vs. disorganized large PERKΔC acini, which shows Ki-67 positively stained cells in the lumen. Scale bars = 20 µm. (D) Graphs showing distribution of the percentage of cells per acinus that stained positively for Ki-67 or cleaved caspase-3 in β-Gal and PERKΔC cells on Day 8 in Matrigel; between 50–100 acini were scored and statistical significance was determined by the t test for independent samples with P&lt;0.001 defined as statistically significant. #N.S-not significant.
