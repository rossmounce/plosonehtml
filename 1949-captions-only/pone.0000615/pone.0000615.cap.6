Note the presence of ESA in cells occupying the luminal space of PERKΔC acini (bottom) as compared to proper basolateral localization of ESA in the β-Gal control acini (top). (B) Representative confocal images of β-Gal and PERKΔC acini co-stained for E-cadherin (green) and Ki-67 (red), on Day 8 in Matrigel. Note the presence of strong E-cadherin staining in the cell-cell junctions of luminal cells in PERKΔC acini that also stain positive for Ki-67 while β-Gal control acini show little to no Ki-67 staining in luminal cells and the expected apicolateral staining for E-cadherin in the outer rim of cells. Scale bars = 10 µm. (C) Proliferation assay using BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry to measure the percentage of BrdU-positive β-Gal or PERKΔC cells at different time points in suspension, mean±SD. (D) Immunoblot showing an increase in BimEL levels in suspension but no significant change between β-Gal and PERKΔC cells, GAPDH serves as loading control. (E) Autoradiogram of [<sup>35</sup>S] Met/Cys incorporation into newly synthesized proteins in β-Gal or PERKΔC cells in full (5%) serum media placed in adhered or suspended growth conditions for 8 hrs, 12 hrs or 24 hrs, showing complete attenuation of protein synthesis in suspension. Coomassie Blue staining of identical gels (left panels) shows protein loading. (F) Autoradiogram of [<sup>35</sup>S] Met/Cys incorporation into newly synthesized proteins in adhered β-Gal or PERKΔC cells placed in low (1%) serum media, treated with or without DTT (2 mM for 1hr), showing increased protein synthesis in PERKΔC cells. Coomassie Blue staining of an identical gel (left panel) shows equal protein loading. Densitometric analysis and surface plotting of the bands illustrates the increase in intensity in the PERKΔC cells.</p>
