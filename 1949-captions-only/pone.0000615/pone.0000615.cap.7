                Figure 7.  Unscheduled Activation of PERK Restricts Acinar Growth and Promotes Apoptosis in 3D Matrigel.(A) Time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of eIF2α in MCF10A cells expressing an Fv2E-ΔNPERK construct, upon treatment with the dimerizing drug, AP20187 (2 nM). AP20187 has no effect on P-eIF2α levels in β-Gal cells. Total eIF2α was used as loading control. (B) Photomicrographs of Fv2E-ΔNPERK cells in 3D Matrigel treated with 2 nM AP20187 or equal volume of ethanol as control, added every 24 hrs from Day 4 up to Day 6 of morphogenesis; representative phase-contrast images depict the effect of forced PERK activation on acini development; (B-a and B-e) A×10 magnification image of several developing acini; (B-b) Normal acinus, (B-c) 2 cell cluster, (B-f) 4 cell cluster, (B-g) 4 cell cluster containing apoptotic cells. (B-d and h) Confocal images through the equatorial region of Fv2E-ΔNPERK cells in 3D Matrigel immunostained for active caspase-3 (red) or LN-5 (green) with (B-h) and without (B-d) treatment with 2nM AP20187 every 24 hrs, (B-h) cell cluster where the majority of cells have entered apoptosis. (C) Quantitation of phase contrast images of Fv2E-ΔNPERK cells on Day 6, treated every 24 hrs with or without 2nM AP20187. Over 400 acini were visually scored for the presence of apoptotic or growth arrested 2–4 celled acini and calculated as a percentage of the total number of acini; graph shows mean±SD. (D) Photomicrographs of β-Gal vector control cells treated with 2nM AP20187 or with equal volume EtOH as control, every 24 hrs from Day 4 up to Day 6 in Matrigel. Note that AP20187 treatment caused no noticeable changes in acini size or morphology, consistent with the absence of modulation of P-eIF2α levels in the same cells (A). (E) Confocal images showing Fv2E-ΔNPERK cells treated with (+AP) or without (-AP) AP20187 every 12 hrs stained for LN-5 (green) to delineate the acini and active caspase-3 (red). Note that a majority of cells even in large acini can be pushed into apoptosis by strong activation of PERK signaling. Scale bars = 10 µm.
