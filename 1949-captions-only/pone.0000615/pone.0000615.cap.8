(Ac-f) Representative images of GADD153 staining (red) in β-Gal (Ac and Ae) and PERKΔC (Ad and Af), cells on Day 8 in Matrigel. Scale bars = 10 µm. (B) Graph showing the distribution and median of GADD153- positive acini/field; 21 fields adding up to a total of 215 acini were scored.* P&lt;0.001 determined by <em>t</em> test for independent samples.</p>
