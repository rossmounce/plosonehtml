                Figure 8.  GADD153 Upregulation During Acini Development in 3D Cultures is PERK-dependent.(Aa and Ab) Representative confocal images through the equatorial section of Day10 MCF10A acini depicts strong GADD153-positive staining (red) in cells in the luminal space (arrowheads) that also display condensed nuclei, co-stained with CyQuant (green) as well as in some cases, in cells that localize to the outer basal layer of cells (arrow) that do not have condensed nuclei. (Ac-f) Representative images of GADD153 staining (red) in β-Gal (Ac and Ae) and PERKΔC (Ad and Af), cells on Day 8 in Matrigel. Scale bars = 10 µm. (B) Graph showing the distribution and median of GADD153- positive acini/field; 21 fields adding up to a total of 215 acini were scored.* P&lt;0.001 determined by t test for independent samples.
