                Figure 1.  Switching between active and inactive Rab3a stimulates large dense core vesicle docking.Typical example micrographs of wild-type chromaffin cells expressing (A, C) IRES-EGFP control construct, (B, D) Rab3a wild-type-IRES-EGFP, (E, G) Rab3a GDP-IRES-EGFP and (F, H) Rab3a GTP-IRES-EGFP. (A, B, E, F) Examples of the total cell. Magnification 8,000×. Scale bar: 1 µm. (C, D, G, H) Detailed micrographs of the cell membrane region. Arrowheads indicate the morphological docked large dense core vesicles contacting the cell membrane. Magnification 20,000×. Scale bar: 200 nm. (I) Distribution profile of LDCVs in the cell section as percentage of the total number LDCVs present. Asterisk indicate significant difference between Rab3a wild-type and EGFP control as determined by T-Test (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA on all groups p = 0.002. Other quantified parameters are shown in (J) the total number of LDCV present per cell section, (K) the average diameter of the LDCVs, (L) the length of the cell membrane in the cell section, (M) the surface area of the cell section in which the LDCV were quantified and (N) the size of the docked pool in the cell section as percentage of EGFP control. Asterisks indicate significant difference as tested by T-Test (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA on all groups p = 0.023. All errorbars represent SEM.
