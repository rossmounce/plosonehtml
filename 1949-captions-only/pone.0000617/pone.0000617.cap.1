(B) The poly-A trap relies on the poly-A (pA) of the endogenous gene because the neomycin-resistance gene does not have a poly-A tail. Note that the poly-A trap has its own constitutive promoter (prom). Also indicated are the splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and neomycin resistance (NeoR). The major components of each trap were excluded from this diagram to emphasize on the essential elements needed to understand the trapping models. Detailed maps of each major vector type are referenced in the <a href="#s3">Methods</a> section.</p>
