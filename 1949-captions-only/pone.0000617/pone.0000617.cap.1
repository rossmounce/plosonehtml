                Figure 1.  Diagram of major mechanisms of gene trapping of an endogenous gene with two exons.(A) In the SA-trap, the SA site allows trapping when inserted into any part of the gene via plasmid or viral integration. (B) The poly-A trap relies on the poly-A (pA) of the endogenous gene because the neomycin-resistance gene does not have a poly-A tail. Note that the poly-A trap has its own constitutive promoter (prom). Also indicated are the splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and neomycin resistance (NeoR). The major components of each trap were excluded from this diagram to emphasize on the essential elements needed to understand the trapping models. Detailed maps of each major vector type are referenced in the Methods section.
