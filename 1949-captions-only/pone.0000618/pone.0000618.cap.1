                Figure 1.  A genetic method to generate anucleate cells.(a) Outline of the strategy to generate anucleate cells. cdc16-116 mutant cells were treated with HU for 6 hours at 24°C to arrest cells in interphase. In the presence of HU, cells were shifted to 36°C to inactive Cdc16p, leading to the formation of septa even when the cells were in interphase. The formation of septa divides the cells into two compartments, one of which lacks a nucleus. (b) cdc16-116 mutant cells, treated with HU as described above, were fixed and stained with DAPI and aniline blue to visualize nuclei and septa, respectively. Shown are the un-cleaved septa formed in interphase cells dividing the cell into two compartments, one of which lacks a nucleus. (c) Anucleate cells do not contain SPBs. cdc16-116 cells expressing Pcp1p-GFP were shifted to the restrictive temperature in the presence of HU, fixed and stained with DAPI and aniline blue to visualize nuclei and septa, respectively. Pcp1p-GFP (green) is associated with nuclei (red) and is not observed in anucleate compartments. Scale, 5 µm.
