Temperature sensitive <em>cdc16</em>-116 cells were treated with hydroxyurea (HU) for 6 h to arrest cells at S phase, and shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 36°C for 2 h. The three cells shown are in different stages of septation, ranging from early septation (cell c) and mid-septation (cell d) with shared cytoplasm between the two daughter cell halves, to completed septation with a distinct cell wall separating the two daughter cell halves (cell e). (b) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed on cells at various stages of septation. Cell regions c, d, and e are regions that were photobleached (red dotted boxes). Shown is a time-lapse montage of the behavior of Rad24p-GFP within 60 s after photobleaching. (c, d, e) Normalized fluorescence recovery curves of cell c, d, and e, respectively. Cell c and d showed complete recovery within ~60 s after photobleaching (□<sub>1/2</sub> ~8 s). The unbleached cell halves (blue lines) showed fluorescence decay as a mirror image to the fluorescent recovery of the bleached cell halves (red lines). Cell e showed no significant recovery in the bleached half, and no decay in the unbleached half. Scale, 5 µm.</p>
