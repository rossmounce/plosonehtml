                Figure 3.  Dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules are present in anucleate compartments.Shown are two time-lapse montages of cdc16-116 Pcp1p-GFP cells expressing GFP-Atb2p (α-tubulin). The larger nucleate cells, indicated by arrows, have multiple robust and dynamic microtubule bundles. In contrast, the smaller anucleate cells, indicated by arrowheads, have fewer, yet dynamic microtubules. Scale, 5 µm.
