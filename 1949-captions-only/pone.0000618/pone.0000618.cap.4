                Figure 4.  Assembly of cell division structures in anucleate cells.(a) F-actin ring assembly. Shown is a collage of fixed cdc16-116 cells expressing the nuclear membrane marker Uch2p-GFP stained with the F-actin specific dye Alexa 488-phalloidin. F-actin rings/cables present in the anucleate compartments are indicated with arrows, while asterisks identify the nucleate compartments. Scale, 10 µm. (b) Actomyosin rings in anucleate cells are unstable and do not constrict. Shown is a time-lapse montage of a live cdc16-116 cell expressing the nuclear membrane marker Uch2p-GFP and the actomyosin ring marker Rlc1p-GFP. The connected but distinct cells have a nucleate half and an anucleate half. During time point 0 min to 25 min, a newly formed actomyosin ring was organized in the nucleate cell (arrow, 0 min). This ring underwent complete constriction within ~30 min. In contrast, although the anucleate cell organized an actomyosin ring (arrow, 40 min), this ring failed to undergo constriction during ~60 min of observation. Scale, 5 µm.
