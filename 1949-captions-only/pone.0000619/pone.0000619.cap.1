<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>The <em>in</em>homogeneous Poisson process, which is characterized by time-varying rate that is independent of the history of the spike train, is the simplest point process that can describe firing rate modulations <a href="#pone.0000619-Snyder1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Johnson2">[21]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Dayan1">[22]</a>. For inhomogeneous Poisson processes, the variance of the spike-count <em>Var</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>] is related to the variance of the bin-rate <em>Var</em>[Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>] according to <em>Var</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>] = <em>Var</em>[Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>]+<em>E</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>] <a href="#pone.0000619-Snyder1">[20]</a>. This relationship can be interpreted as a decomposition of the total variance in the binned spike-count into the variance of the underlying information bearing parameter, or bin-rate <em>Var</em>[Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>], and the variance that would have occurred if <em>N<sub>b</sub></em> was generated by a homogenous Poisson process, <em>E</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>], i.e., the neural noise (<a href="#pone-0000619-g001">Figure 1</a>). Thus, the variance of the modulated bin-rate is the excess variance of the binned spike-count beyond the level expected from a homogeneous Poisson process. The resulting <em>POM</em> can be evaluated from the statistics of the binned spike-count as (<a href="#pone-0000619-g001">Figure 1</a>): <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(2)</span></span><br>where <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e003&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> is the Fano factor <a href="#pone.0000619-Fano1">[23]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Dayan1">[22]</a>. Given spike-trains of finite duration, we estimated the <em>POM</em> using the sample-mean and sample-variance of the binned spike-counts, instead of the mean and variance, respectively.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>The <em>POM</em> analysis can be extended to cases where the binned spike-count include signal-dependent zero-mean noise, i.e., <em>N<sub>b</sub></em> = Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>+<em>e</em> <a href="#pone.0000619-Harris1">[24]</a>. The probability distribution of the noise <em>e</em> is assumed to be conditionally normal with signal dependent variance: <em>f</em>(<em>e</em>|Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>)~<em>N</em>(0,<em>γ</em><sup>2</sup>Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>). Note that this model converges to the inhomogeneous Poisson process for large rates and <em>γ</em> = 1. Since for any signal level the error is zero mean, the variance of the spike counts is given by: <em>Var</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>] = <em>Var</em>[Λ<em><sub>b</sub></em>]+<em>γ</em><sup>2</sup><em>E</em>[<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>], as shown in the Supplemental text (<a href="#pone.0000619.s001">Text S1</a>). The resulting <em>POM</em> can be evaluated as: <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e004&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(3)</span></span><br>where <em>POM</em>(1) is the <em>POM</em> of an inhomogeneous Poisson process (<em>γ</em> = 1) as defined in Equation (2). Thus, the results and conclusions based on the <em>POM</em> defined in Equation (2) can be easily extended for the general case of additive signal-dependent noise. In particular: <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e005&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>, so increasing/decreasing trends in estimated <em>POM</em> based on Equation (2) reflect increasing/decreasing trends in <em>POM</em>(<em>γ</em>).</p>


<h4>Significantly Modulated Neurons</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The <em>POM</em> of spike-trains that are evoked by homogeneous Poisson processes is zero. However, when estimated from finite spike-trains, the sample-<em>POM</em> is randomly distributed and may take non-zero, either positive or negative, values. Under the homogeneous Poisson process assumption, the distribution of the sample-<em>POM</em>, estimated from a finite sample of <em>n</em> bins, is asymptotically normal with zero mean and variance of 2/<em>n</em>. We defined neurons as significantly modulated if their estimated <em>POM</em> indicated that the homogeneous Poisson process hypothesis could be rejected at 95% confidence level for at least one control mode (pole, BCWH, or BCWOH). For a typical sample of 12000 bins (20 minutes of an experiment with 100 msec bins), the standard deviation of the sample- <em>POM</em> is 1.3%. Note that neurons that are significantly modulated in only one or two control modes may exhibit zero of even negative sample-<em>POM</em> in the other mode(s) due to the limited length of the analyzed spike-train.</p>


<h4>Percent Velocity Modulation (PVM)</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Velocity tuning is often determined in center-out reaching experiments, where the direction of movement is approximately constant <a href="#pone.0000619-Georgopoulos3">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Moran1">[16]</a>. For general arm movements, this method was generalized to characterize the tuning of the neural activity to the velocity at a specific time lag <a href="#pone.0000619-Lebedev1">[17]</a>: <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e006&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(4)</span></span><br>where <em>k</em> is the index of the current time-bin, <em>N</em>(<em>k</em>) is the spike counts (in bins of 100msec), <em>V<sub>x</sub></em> and <em>V<sub>y</sub></em> are the x- and y-components of the velocity, <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e007&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> is the speed, <em>l</em> is the relative lag (positive/negative <em>l</em> corresponds to rate-modulations preceding/ succeeding the velocity measurement, respectively), <em>a<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>), <em>a<sub>y</sub></em>(<em>l</em>) and <em>a<sub>s</sub></em>(<em>l</em>) are the tuning parameters, <em>a<sub>c</sub></em>(<em>l</em>) is a bias parameter, and <em>ε</em>(<em>k, l</em>) is the residual error. The coefficient of determination of the single-lag regression <em>R<sup>2</sup>(l)</em> quantifies the fraction of the variance in the neural spike-count that is attributed to, or explained by, the velocity at lag <em>l</em>. However, since the velocity values at different lags are correlated, the lag-by-lag analysis cannot be used to determine the fraction of the variance that is attributed to the spatio-temporal velocity profile. Hence, we further generalized the analysis to account for the tuning of the neural activity to the spatio-temporal velocity profile in the surrounding window according to: <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e008&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(5)</span></span><br>where <em>ε</em>(<em>k</em>) is the residual error, and <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>L</em><sub>2</sub> are the number of preceding and succeeding lags in the velocity profile, respectively. We used <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>L</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>L</em> = 9 to include a 1900-ms window around the current bin. The regression in Equation (5) was evaluated using truncated Singular Value Decomposition to stabilize the solution despite the large condition number of the spatio-temporal velocity matrix (around 10<sup>6</sup>) <a href="#pone.0000619-Hansen1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Golub1">[26]</a>. Truncation was performed at the singular value that preserved 95% of the variance in the velocity measurements.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>The coefficient of determination of the spatio-temporal regression of Equation (5), <em>R<sup>2</sup></em>, describes the fraction of the variance in the binned spike-count that is linearly related to variations in the spatio-temporal velocity profile in the surrounding window. Expressed as a percentage, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> is referred to as the percent velocity-related modulation, or <em>PVM</em>.</p>


<h4>Percent Kinematics Modulation (PKM)</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>The above analysis was further extended to include other kinematics variables that may modulate the neural activity, including the position and magnitude of acceleration: <a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e009&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(6)</span></span><br>Where <em>P<sub>x</sub></em> and <em>P<sub>y</sub></em> are the x- and y-components of the position, and <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e010&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> is the magnitude of the acceleration vector whose x-component is given by <em>A<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>) = <em>V<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>)−<em>V<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>−1) = <em>P<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>)−2<em>P</em>(<em>l</em>−1)+<em>P<sub>x</sub></em>(<em>l</em>−2) and y-component given by the corresponding expression. Note that the velocity and acceleration vectors are implicitly included in Equation (6) as the first and second order differences between the positions in consecutive lags.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>The coefficient of determination of the spatio-temporal regression in Equation (6) was expressed as a percentage and referred to as the percent kinematics modulation, or <em>PKM</em>.</p>


<h4>Variations in percent modulations</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>In order to evaluate the variations in the percent modulations (i.e., <em>POM, PVM</em> or <em>PKM</em>) within and across different control modes and training sessions, we estimated their values for each neuron in 2-minute non-overlapping intervals. Within each control mode, the <em>POM, PVM</em> and <em>PKM</em> of individual neurons were determined by averaging across all the relevant 2-minute intervals. The ensemble-<em>POM</em>, ensemble-<em>PVM</em> and ensemble-<em>PKM</em> in a specific 2-minute interval were determined by averaging across all the significantly modulated neurons. Comparisons between control modes and training sessions were based on the mean-<em>POM</em>, mean-<em>PVM</em> and mean-<em>PKM</em>, which were computed by averaging the corresponding ensemble values across all the intervals in the same control mode.</p>


<h4>Principal Component Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard technique for discovering the dimensionality of a data set and decomposing it into uncorrelated components <a href="#pone.0000619-Mardia1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000619-Kirby1">[28]</a>. The sequences of spike-counts from <em>N<sub>n</sub></em> neurons is transformed linearly (with unit norm weight vectors) into <em>N<sub>n</sub></em> principal components, which are uncorrelated with each other and have extreme variance values. Since the principal components in this application are weighted sums of the recorded spike-counts they may be referred to as “principal-neurons”.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2"></a><p>Specifically, we computed the <em>N<sub>n</sub></em>×<em>N<sub>n</sub></em> sample-correlation matrix of the normalized spike-counts of the <em>N<sub>n</sub></em> neurons, whose <em>i-j</em> element is the sample-correlation between the normalized spike-counts <em>N<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>N<sub>j</sub></em> of the <em>i-th</em> and <em>j-th</em> neurons, recorded during the relevant part of the experiment. The variance of the principal-neurons was determined by the eigen-values <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e011&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> of the sample-correlation matrix. In particular, <em>λ</em><sub>1</sub> is the maximum variance of any weighted-combination of the recorded spike-counts with a unit norm weight vector. The normalized eigen-value <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000619.e012&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> describes the fraction of the variance in the original data that is captured by the <em>i-th</em> principal-neuron. Expressed as a percentage, it defines the percent of the total variance in the neural ensemble carried by the <em>i-th</em> principal-neuron.</p>

Generally, rate variability was higher than would be predicted by a homogeneous Poisson process, as indicated by variance that exceeded the mean (<a href="#pone-0000619-g002">Figure 2</a>, top panels). The variance of the binned spike-count (in 100-ms bins) exceeded the mean spike-count for most of the <em>N<sub>n</sub></em> = 183 neurons recorded in this session, (83%, 88% and 92% during pole control, BCWH and BCWOH, respectively). This excess variability was also evident in the ratio of the variance to the mean (the Fano factor), which was found to be mostly above 1.0 (<a href="#pone-0000619-g002">Figure 2</a>, bottom panels). Most importantly, the transition to brain control resulted in even higher excess variability and larger Fano factor for most of the neurons (78% and 87% of the recorded cortical neurons during BCWH and BCWOH, respectively) as evident from the scatter plots of <a href="#pone-0000619-g002">Figure 2</a>.</p>
