Percent Overall Modulation (POM) for Nsig = 160 significantly modulated units recorded in the same session analyzed in Figure 2.Top: Scatter plot of POM in brain versus pole control. Bottom: distribution of POM of all significantly modulated units (left) and those in M1 (right upper, Nsig = 56) and PMd (right lower, Nsig = 55).
