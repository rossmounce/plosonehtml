                Figure 5.  Variations in POM (top) and spike-count statistics (bottom) during the same experimental session analyzed in Figure 4 (ensemble-average–left panels; single PMd unit–right panels).The POM and spike-count statistics were computed in 2-minute non-overlapping intervals and averaged across all the Nsig = 160 significantly modulated neurons to obtain the ensemble-average.
