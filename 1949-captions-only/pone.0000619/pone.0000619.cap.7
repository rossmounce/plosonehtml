                Figure 7.  Mean-POM of the Nsig significantly modulated units in different cortical regions during different control modes in a single session with each monkey.Full bars mark the mean values across all the 2-minute intervals in the same control mode, and error bars represent the standard deviation. M1–primary motor cortex, PMd–dorsal premotor cortex, S1–primary somatosensory cortex, SMA–supplementary motor area, PP–Posterior Parietal Cortex (medial intraparietal).
