                Figure 8.  Percent variance carried by the different principal neurons during the same session analyzed in Figure 5.The analysis decomposed the variance carried by the ensemble of the significantly modulated neurons recorded from all brain regions. Inset: zoomed-in version of the same plot for the initial 20 principle neurons.
