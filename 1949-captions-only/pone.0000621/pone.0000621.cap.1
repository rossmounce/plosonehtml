The sequence of the upstream Sp1 site (upSp1) found in the indicated genera and species is shown, with fixed nucleotide differences from the human sequence indicated in red. The thymine at position −9, which is invariant in all non-human primates studied previously <a href="#pone.0000621-Leung1">[9]</a> and in this study, is also shown in red.</p>
