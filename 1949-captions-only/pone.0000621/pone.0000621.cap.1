                Figure 1.  The human TNF gene promoter.The sequence of the human TNF promoter from −200 to +1 nt relative to the start site of transcription is shown, along with previously identified phylogenetic footprints [9] and binding sites for the indicatedtranscription factors, including sites identified as binding sites for multiple factors (crosshatched) in quantitative DNase I footprinting assays, by EMSA analysis, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays [1]–[7]. The sequence of the upstream Sp1 site (upSp1) found in the indicated genera and species is shown, with fixed nucleotide differences from the human sequence indicated in red. The thymine at position −9, which is invariant in all non-human primates studied previously [9] and in this study, is also shown in red.
