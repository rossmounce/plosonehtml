                Figure 2.  Primate species examined in this study.The common and taxonomic designation for each species or subspecies [110], [111], number of individuals from which DNA for sequence analysis was isolated, and the source of the sampled individuals are indicated. The region of the promoter corresponding to the upstream Sp1 site (Figure 1) was sequenced for Cercopithecus ascanius, Trachypithecus francoisi, Pygathrix nemaeus, and Lemur catta (Figure 7A). For all other species and subspecies, the complete proximal and distal TNF promoter regions (âˆ’1153 to +69 nt relative to the start site of transcription) were sequenced.
