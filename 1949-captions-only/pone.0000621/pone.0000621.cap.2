The region of the promoter corresponding to the upstream Sp1 site (<a href="#pone-0000621-g001">Figure 1</a>) was sequenced for <em>Cercopithecus ascanius, Trachypithecus francoisi, Pygathrix nemaeus</em>, and <em>Lemur catta</em> (<a href="#pone-0000621-g007">Figure 7A</a>). For all other species and subspecies, the complete proximal and distal TNF promoter regions (âˆ’1153 to +69 nt relative to the start site of transcription) were sequenced.</p>
