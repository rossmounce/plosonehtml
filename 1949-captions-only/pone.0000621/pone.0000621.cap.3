                Figure 3.  TNF promoter-based primate phylogenetic trees.Extended majority rule consensus trees derived from 1000 replications by bootstrap analysis generated from a distance matrix between ~1.2 kb of sequence for each taxon using the Kimura 2-parameter model (A) and maximum parsimony (B) is shown. Values at internodes indicate the number of times the group consisting of the species to the right of the internode occurred among the trees (out of 1000 trees).
