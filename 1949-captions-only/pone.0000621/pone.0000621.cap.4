                Figure 4.  Conservation of the proximal TNF promoter region in primates.Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the TNF promoter (âˆ’1153 to +69 nt relative to the start site of transcription) for human and all other primate species examined in this study using eShadow [47]. Nucleotide position relative to the TNF start site of transcription is on the x-axis. Percentage variation (inversely proportional to conservation) is on the y-axis. Peaks and valleys of the conservation plot correspond to regions of low and high variation, respectively, and 0% variation signifies 100% sequence identity in the MSA. Black shading indicates regions of highest sequence conservation.
