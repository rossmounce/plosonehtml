Nucleotide position relative to the TNF start site of transcription is on the x-axis. Percentage variation (inversely proportional to conservation) is on the y-axis. Peaks and valleys of the conservation plot correspond to regions of low and high variation, respectively, and 0% variation signifies 100% sequence identity in the MSA. Black shading indicates regions of highest sequence conservation.</p>
