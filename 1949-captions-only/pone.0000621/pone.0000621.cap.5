                Figure 5.  Fixed differences in the TNF promoter distinguish primate species and subspecies.Column headers indicate the position in the human TNF promoter relative to the start site of transcription. The corresponding nucleotide sequence, deletion, or insertion for each species is indicated for each row. Blue shading in a column indicates groups of primate subspecies within a species (or species within a genus) distinguished by a fixed difference.
