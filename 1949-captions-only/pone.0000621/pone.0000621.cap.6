Groups of fixed genetic differences (the total number in parenthesis) completely conserved within clades are marked at the appropriate branch points (see <a href="#pone.0000621.s004">Table S3</a>). Human TNF promoter SNPs which are ancestral in the primate lineage are listed. Ancestral sequences and transitions or transversions in the TNF promoter are noted at the appropriate branchpoints.</p>
