                Figure 6.  Fixed differences in the TNF promoter mark primate ancestry.Clade diagram illustrating the basic and approximate evolutionary relationships among the primate species in this study, with selected times of divergence (in millions of years) noted. Groups of fixed genetic differences (the total number in parenthesis) completely conserved within clades are marked at the appropriate branch points (see Table S3). Human TNF promoter SNPs which are ancestral in the primate lineage are listed. Ancestral sequences and transitions or transversions in the TNF promoter are noted at the appropriate branchpoints.
