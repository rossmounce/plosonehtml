                Figure 7.  Functional analysis of fixed genetic differences in the upstream Sp1 site in primate TNF promoters.A. Sequence of the upstream Sp1 site in the TNF promoter from humans and the indicated non-human primates, with the horse (Equus caballus) and pig (Sus scrofa) sequences for comparison. Nucleotide positions relative to the start site of TNF transcription are shown. B. EMSA of nuclear extracts from the indicated cell lines incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the indicated primate TNF upstream Sp1 site. Positions of the Sp1- and Sp3-DNA complexes, confirmed by antibody supershift assays (data not shown) are indicated. C. Transfections in the indicated cell lines with luciferase reporter genes fused to the proximal TNF promoter (âˆ’200 to +87 nt) of the indicated primate species. Fold induction of luciferase activity in response to treatment with ionomycin (I) in 68-41 T cells, treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in J774 monocytic cells, or infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) in J774 monocytic cells is shown.
