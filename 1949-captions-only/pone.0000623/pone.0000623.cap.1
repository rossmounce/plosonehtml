The arrows indicate the cleavage sites for factor Xa (fXa1 Arg273-Thr274 and fXa2 Arg322-Ile323) and thrombin (*1 Arg155-Ser156 and *2 Arg286-Thr287). The molecular mass of the fragments shown was calculated based on the primary sequence (Swiss-Prot entry P08709). B) The observed cleavage pattern of prothrombin incubated with factor Xa (FXa) (lane 1) or trMASP2 (lane 2) for 4 h at 37Â°C and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The bands were identified by N-terminal sequencing together with theoretical and observed size. The 33.8 kDa fragment migrates faster than the 31.5 kDa fragment due to differences in the number of N-linked glycosylations. C) The sites of cleavage by factor Xa and trMASP2 are identical as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing as described in the text.</p>
