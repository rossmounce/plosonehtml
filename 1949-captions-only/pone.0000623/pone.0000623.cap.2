                Figure 2.  Thrombin activity generated by factor Xa and trMASP2 measured by cleavage of VPR-AMC.Samples (100 µl) contained 10 µg prothrombin (PT)+25 ng factor Xa (fXa), 25 ng factor Xa alone, 10 µg prothrombin+100 ng trMASP2, 100 ng trMASP2 alone or 10 µg prothrombin alone. As can be observed the cleavage of the substrate by factor Xa, trMASP2 and prothrombin is negligible, but incubation of prothrombin with factor Xa or trMASP2 generates activity. The figure shows the development of the relative fluorescence at different time points. A typical result from 3 experiments is shown.
