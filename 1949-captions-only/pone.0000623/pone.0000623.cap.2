As can be observed the cleavage of the substrate by factor Xa, trMASP2 and prothrombin is negligible, but incubation of prothrombin with factor Xa or trMASP2 generates activity. The figure shows the development of the relative fluorescence at different time points. A typical result from 3 experiments is shown.</p>
