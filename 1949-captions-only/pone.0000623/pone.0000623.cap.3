Column 1 shows the VPR-AMC turn-over when MBL/MASP2K was incubated with mannan in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, followed by addition of prothrombin. Column 2 is the control for column 1 where MBL/MASP2K complexes were bound in the presence of EDTA. Column 3 is a further control with no rMASP2 added, and Column 4 is the same as column 1, but without prothrombin. The figure shows the cleavage of VPR-AMC by thrombin (as relative fluorescence) after 4h at 37°C. <a href="#pone-0000623-g003">Fig 3B</a> shows the MBL/MASP2K dose-dependent fibrin polymerization in a microtiter well after incubation with prothrombin and fibrinogen for 3.5 hours. The X-axis shows a 2-fold dilution series of the MBL/MASP2K complexes starting at 200 ng/well. The background was defined as the activity from a sample in which MBL/MASP2K complexes were prevented from binding by the presence of EDTA and subtracted. <a href="#pone-0000623-g003">Fig 3C</a> shows generation of fibrinogen γ chain dimer and α chain oligomers. Sample numbers correspond to those in <a href="#pone-0000623-g003">fig 3A</a>. Only in lane 1 have the γ chain dimer as well as α chain oligomers been formed. This arises from fibrinogen activation followed by factor XIIIa mediated cross-linking. This occurs only in the presence of activated MBL/MASP2K complexes bound to mannan, and in the presence of prothrombin. A typical result from 3 experiments is shown.</p>
