                Figure 5.  Fibrin deposition on MBL target surface.Fig 5A shows 125I-fibrin deposition on a mannan/fibrinogen coated surface to which rMBL/rMASP2K complexes are bound. The background (a control in which rMBL/rMASP2K complexes were prevented from binding to the surface due to the presence of EDTA) has been subtracted from the remaining samples. The figure shows that deposition above background level only occurs if rMASP2K is present and if the incubation with fibrinogen is in the presence of prothrombin. Incubation was for 4h at 37°C. Fig 5B 125I-fibrin deposition on S. aureus-derivatized beads. S. aureus-derivatized beads were incubated at 4°C with rMBL/rMASP2 complexes and subsequently with prothrombin and 125I-fibrinogen for 7 h at 37°C. The figure shows that fibrin gets deposited on the beads upon activation of prothrombin by rMBL/rMASP2 complexes (columns 2 and 5, closed bars). The fibrin bound to the surface also gets covalently cross-linked to the bacteria since it was not removed by washing the beads with urea (column 2, open bar). If the deposition was done in the presence of iodoacetamide (IAM), which inhibits factor XIIIa, the radioactivity associated with the beads was reduced to background level upon urea extraction (column 5, open bar). In the controls in which no rMASP2 was added or in the presence of protease inhibitors (C1 inhibitor or Pefabloc SC) no deposition on the beads could be observed. Each sample was tested twice and the error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean.
