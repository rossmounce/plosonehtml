                Figure 4.  Population dynamics with unbiased and male-biased parasitism.(A) h = 1, μf = μm = 1, α = 0.95, γ1 = γ2 = 0.025, βf = βm = 1.2; (B) same as (A) except βf = 0.4 and βm = 2; (C) h = 1, μf = 0.4, μm = 1.6, α = 0.8, γ1 = γ2 = 0.1, βf = βm = 1.2; (D) same as (C) except βf = 0.6 and βm = 1.8. The rate of vertical transmission is δ = 0.2.
