                Figure 6.  Stability plots, under the assumption of no host self-regulation.Regions shaded light grey correspond to a stable equilibrium, dark grey regions correspond to 2-point limit cycles, and regions shaded black correspond to higher-period cycles or chaotic dynamics; (A) βf = βm = 2.5; (B) βf = 1.25 and βm = 3.75. Other parameters are: α = 0.495, γ1 = 0, γ2 = 0.005 and δ = 1.
