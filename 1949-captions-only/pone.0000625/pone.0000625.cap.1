                Figure 1.  Molecular modeling of G6PD variants of German ancestry.(A) Wild-type structure of G6PD, with NADP+ entries from 2BH9 and G6P entries from 2BHL (shown as van der Waals representation). The two chains are shown in green and blue. (B) The locations of the six mutations is shown as green Van der Waal radii, highlighted by red circles. Beta sheets are shown in yellow color, while alpha helices are shown in blue color. (C and D) The root mean square is taken over one monomer, comparing the optimized structure of the mutant and that of the wild type. Figures were created with VMD software [28].
