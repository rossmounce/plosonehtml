The two chains are shown in green and blue. (B) The locations of the six mutations is shown as green Van der Waal radii, highlighted by red circles. Beta sheets are shown in yellow color, while alpha helices are shown in blue color. (C and D) The root mean square is taken over one monomer, comparing the optimized structure of the mutant and that of the wild type.
