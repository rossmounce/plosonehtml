TCR mediated signal transduction proceeds for thirty minutes via a contact with APCs in a collagen matrix. After thirty minutes, signaling is aborted with the T-cell-APC contact intact. Following a period of approximately 20 mins, signaling is allowed to resume. The procedure is repeated periodically. b.) Cytokine (i.e. IFN-γ) production is measured. The first 30 minutes of signaling results in no IFN-γ production. Upon the next 30 minute round of TCR signaling, IFN-γ is produced. The final round of stimulation results in IFN-γ production as well. Curiously, the first round of signaling, while insufficient for IFN-γ production, prepares (i.e. establishes a memory) for more rapid IFN-γ production in subsequent rounds of stimulation.</p>
