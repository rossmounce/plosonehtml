                Figure 2.  Diagrams of the simplified signaling networks used in the computer simulations.a.) An overall scheme for the signaling model to be simulated. Parallel pathways, whose activation occurs at different time scales, converge to produce cytokine. bâ€“d.) Reaction schemes for each model, b.) linear c.) cooperative and d.) feedback induced models for persistent activity cFOS.
