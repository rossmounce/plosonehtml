Under strong stimulation (a). Activity cycles roughly in phase with the duration of stimulation. Under weak stimulation (b), activity also cycles approximately in phase with the duration of signaling. However, such activity is less consistent than that observed in the case of strong stimulation and subject to large fluctuations. c,d.) Trajectories of active IEGs (e.g. cFOS) (c) and cytokine (d) for the case of cooperative cFOSp/Erkp dynamics in the presence of sufficiently strong stimulation. Other qualitatively similar cases are presented in the supporting online information.</p>
