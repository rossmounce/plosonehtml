                Figure 4.  Representative dynamics for models with positive feedback.Scenarios involving strong (a,b) and weak (c,d) stimulation are considered. Representative timecourse for the activity of IEGs (a,c) and cytokine production (b,d) are shown. Memory effects are acquired in the case of strong stimulation. While weak stimulation triggers IEG activity, such activity is effectively reset upon interruption of the signal.
