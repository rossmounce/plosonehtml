Probability distributions are computed at three time points, t = 30 minutes (after first round of stimulation) red , t = 50 minutes (after first period of interrupted signaling) green , and t = 80 minutes (after the completion of the second round of signaling) blue. IEG products (a,b,e) and Cytokine production (c,d,f) are considered. In the presence of a feedback loop, two separate cases (strong (a,c) and weak (b,d) signal strength are analyzed.</p>
