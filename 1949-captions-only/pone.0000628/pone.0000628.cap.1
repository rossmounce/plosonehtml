                Figure 1.  Analysis of growth and energetic parameters during cell transformation (A) Cells were grown for several hours under standard growth conditions.Growth was monitored with methylene blue staining (O.D. 630 nm, Materials and Methods). The slope of each curve represents the growth rate of the particular cell type. Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples. (B) Time course of glucose uptake by K, E, L and BP cells, measured using the Amplex® Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit [Molecular Probes (Invitrogen)]. Glucose consumption (O.D. 560 nm) was normalized to cell mass (O.D. 630 nm), as measured by methylene blue. The slopes represent glycolysis rates. Error bars represent the SD of duplicate samples. (C) A Clark-type oxygen electrode was used to measure oxygen consumption in primary keratinocytes (K = 1) and papilloma-transformed cells. Oxygen consumption indicates respiration rate, and was expressed as nmoles of oxygen consumed per minute per total protein amount. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. (D) Cellular ATP levels were measured by the CELLTITER-GLO™ Luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Luminescence was normalized to cell mass (O.D. 630 nm), as measured using methylene blue. Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples.
