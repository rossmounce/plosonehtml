Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples. (B) 64 aliquots of each cell type were counted, using a counting chamber (hemocytometer). The amount of protein per 250,000 cells was measured (K = 100%), using the bound Coumassie blue method (<a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples.</p>
