                Figure 2.  Cell size and protein amount (A) Cell size was measured using FACS.Cell size (cell diameter) as a function of FSC is presented (K = 1). Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples. (B) 64 aliquots of each cell type were counted, using a counting chamber (hemocytometer). The amount of protein per 250,000 cells was measured (K = 100%), using the bound Coumassie blue method (Materials and Methods). Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples.
