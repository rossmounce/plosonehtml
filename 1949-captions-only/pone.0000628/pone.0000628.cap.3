                Figure 3.  Protein synthesis and degradation in primary and transformed keratinocytes (A) Cells were seeded in 6-well plates.After 48 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing Promix (35S-Methionine/Cysteine), and cells were incubated for another 1 h. Labeled proteins were precipitated with trichloro acetic acid (TCA) and counted in a scintillation counter. 35S incorporation (cpm) was normalized to protein amount (µg), measured using the bound Coumassie blue method. Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples. (B) Activity of translation factors required for cap-dependent protein synthesis. Representative western blot. Protein levels and phosphorylation of translation factors were lower in L and BP cells than in K and E cells, under standard growth conditions. ERK2 served as a gel loading control. (C) Cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing Promix (35S-Methionine/Cysteine) for 1 h, washed three times, and incubated in normal growth medium for another hour. Labeled proteins were precipitated with TCA and counted in a scintillation counter. 35S incorporation retained during the “chase” was normalized to 35S incorporation during the “pulse”. Error bars represent the SD of quadruplicate samples.
