                Figure 4.  IRES-dependent translation increases in transformed cells (A) Levels of proteins that are subject to both cap and IRES-mediated translation under standard growth conditions.A representative western blot is shown. ERK2 served as a gel loading control. (B) Reciprocal constructs for cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation of firefly luciferase (FFL) and renilla luciferase (SPL) constructs are illustrated. The ratio of IRES-dependent to cap-dependent product is represented by SPL/FFL activity for construct 1 (C1, left) and by FFL/SPL activity for construct 2 (C2, right). Bars represent the SD of duplicate samples
