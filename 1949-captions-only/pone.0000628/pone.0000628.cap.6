PKB and AMPK were visualized on one blot and P-ACC on a separate blot. The activity of PKB dropped and the activity of AMPK rose in L and BP. (B) The phosphorylation of c-Src (Y416) was induced during transformation. The amount of total c-Src protein (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) remained unchanged. (C) Cells were treated with PP1 to inhibit c-Src. After 4 h cells were lysed, and western blot analysis was performed. ERK2 served as a gel loading control. Representative western analysis is shown.</p>
