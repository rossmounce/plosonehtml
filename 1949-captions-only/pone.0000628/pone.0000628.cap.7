                Figure 7.  AMPK as a regulator of protein synthesis (A) Cells were transfected with the reciprocal bicistronic constructs and IRES vs. cap-dependent translation was measured in the presence of the AMPK inhibitor (compound C).IRES-dependent translation was reduced in all the cell types when AMPK was inhibited. Similar results were obtained with the reciprocal construct (not shown). Error bars represent the SD of duplicate samples. (B, C) Cells were transfected with the c-Myc or HIF-1Î± bicistronic constructs. Activation of AMPK led to an increase in FFL/SPL (IRES/cap) activity. Error bars represent the SD of duplicate samples.
