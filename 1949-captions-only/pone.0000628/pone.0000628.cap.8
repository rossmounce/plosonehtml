                Figure 8.  AMPK is involved in the regulation of IRES-dependent translation.L (A) and BP cells (B) were treated with 150 nM rapamycin (R) or 10 µM compound C (C) or 150 nM rapamycin in the presence of 10 µM compound C (R+C) for 24 hours. (C) E cells were treated with 150 nM rapamycin (R) or 2 mM AICAR (A) or 150 nM rapamycin in the presence of 2 mM AICAR (R+A) for 24 hours. Levels of proteins subject to both cap and IRES-translation were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. ERK2 served as a gel loading control.
