Aliquots were taken and diluted to the desired concentration using the phosphate buffer, and the samples were dropped onto mica surfaces and dried in air before observed under the atomic force microscope. The frequency counts of the horizontal diameters (explained in the text) of the protein particles in images A–E were shown in A'–E', respectively. The scale bars equal 100 nm.</p>
