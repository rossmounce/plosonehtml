Immunolabelling with the monoclonal antibody HA was used to visualize tau expression (A) and tau aggregation in the presence of 0.0002% formaldehyde for different times (B). β-actin was used as a protein loading control. Immunostaining detected tau aggregation in 293 cells after treated with formaldehyde for 72 h (C, Bar: 25 µm). Other conditions were similar to SY5Y cells shown in <a href="#pone-0000629-g009">Figure 9</a>. Quantitative analysis is presented in D. Apoptotic cells are characterized by nuclear condensation and diffraction. At least 200 apoptotic cells were counted in each experiment.</p>
