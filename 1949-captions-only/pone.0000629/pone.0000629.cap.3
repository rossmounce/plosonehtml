The scale bars equal 100 nm. The parallel SDS-PAGE study (H) shows tau incubated with 0.1% formaldehyde for different time periods, with Lanes 1 to 8 representing 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 min, respectively. Lane M is the protein molecular mass marker. Acetaldehyde (0.1%) was used as a control and the result is shown in I.</p>
