The DTNB absorbance (A, 412 nm) was measured. Under the same conditions, native tau (Curve 1) and 0.005% formaldehyde-treated tau (Curve 2) were re-suspended in 2 µM DTNB (B), and aliquots were taken to measure the absorbance at different time intervals. The same data shown in B are also plotted in semilogarithm (C) according to Tsou's method <a href="#pone.0000629-Tsou1">[29]</a>.</p>
