                Figure 6.  Reaction of formaldehyde with thiol groups of neuronal tau.Neuronal tau (2 µM) was re-suspended in phosphate buffer containing DTNB (20 times in excess to the protein in molar ratio) in the presence of formaldehyde at different concentrations at 37°C for 120 min. The DTNB absorbance (A, 412 nm) was measured. Under the same conditions, native tau (Curve 1) and 0.005% formaldehyde-treated tau (Curve 2) were re-suspended in 2 µM DTNB (B), and aliquots were taken to measure the absorbance at different time intervals. The same data shown in B are also plotted in semilogarithm (C) according to Tsou's method [29].
