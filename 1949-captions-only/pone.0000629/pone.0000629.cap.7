RNase A (3 mg/ml) was pretreated with DTT (10 mM) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37°C for 1 h and dialysed at 4°C over night as described <a href="#pone.0000629-Dunten1">[31]</a>. The dialysed RNase A (10 µg) was incubated with formaldehyde at different concentrations as indicated at 37°C for 4 h (C). Aliquots were then taken for SDS-PAGE. RNase A incubated without DTT was used as control (D).</p>
