                Figure 7.  Formaldehyde-treated α-synuclein and RNase A on SDS-PAGE.Protein tau (A) or α-synuclein (amino acid sequence referred to NP_000336) (B) was incubated in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing formaldehyde at different concentrations as indicated at 37°C over night, and then aliquots were taken for SDS-PAGE. RNase A (3 mg/ml) was pretreated with DTT (10 mM) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37°C for 1 h and dialysed at 4°C over night as described [31]. The dialysed RNase A (10 µg) was incubated with formaldehyde at different concentrations as indicated at 37°C for 4 h (C). Aliquots were then taken for SDS-PAGE. RNase A incubated without DTT was used as control (D).
