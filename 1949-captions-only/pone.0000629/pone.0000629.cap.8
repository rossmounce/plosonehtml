                Figure 8.  Effect of 10% methanol on neuronal tau aggregation.Conditions were referred to Figure 1, except that additional methanol was used to disturb the reaction of formaldehyde with neuronal tau. The images show neuronal tau incubated in phosphate buffer in the presence of 0.1% formaldehyde only (A); mixture of 10% methanol and 0.1% formaldehyde (B); 10% methanol only (C); and tau alone (D). The scale bars equal 100 nm. The corresponding horizontal diameters are summarized in E.
