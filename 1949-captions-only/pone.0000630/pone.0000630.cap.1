Total RNA was prepared from erythroid tissues at two developmental stages – E11.5 embryonic blood (Embryonic) and adult anemic spleen (Adult). cDNA was produced and quantified by real-time PCR using primer pairs across the human <em>β</em>-globin locus. Bar plots represent relative transcript quantities normalised to the most 5′ primer pair in the olfactory receptor gene region, which shows low levels of transcription at both developmental stages. Primer pair positions are relative to the <em>HBE</em> gene transcription start site at position 1; they are aligned with a map of the locus shown below the graphs. Shaded regions of the graphs correspond to the locus control region (LTR promoter to downstream of LCR HS1) and the δβ domain (δβ intergenic promoter to 3′HS1). Map features: red arrowheads, globin genes; pink rectangle, <em>β</em>-like pseudogene; white arrowheads, olfactory receptor genes (<em>HOR</em>, human olfactory receptor); vertical blue lines, hypersensitive sites; blue arrows, intergenic transcription start sites; LTR, long terminal repeat; δβ, δβ intergenic promoter.</p>
