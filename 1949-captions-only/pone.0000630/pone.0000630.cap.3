Chromatin from anemic spleen was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me2), acetylated histone H3 (K9/14, H3ac), and acetylated histone H4 (two different antibodies: ChIP grade antibody, K5/18/12/16, H4ac<sub>Ch</sub>; penta lysine, H4ac<sub>P</sub>). The fold-enrichment of antibody-bound sequences over input was analysed by real-time PCR using primer pairs across the <em>β</em>-globin locus. Bar plots represent enrichment normalised to the most 5′ primer pair in the olfactory receptor gene region, which shows low enrichment for all antibodies; horizontal dashed lines mark the level of the normalisation data point (value 1). Primer pair positions are relative to the <em>HBE</em> gene transcription start site at position 1; they are aligned with a map of the locus shown below the graphs. Shaded regions of the graphs correspond to the locus control region (LTR promoter to downstream of LCR HS1) and the δβ domain (δβ intergenic promoter to 3′HS1). Map features: red arrowheads, globin genes; pink rectangle, <em>β</em>-like pseudogene; white arrowheads, olfactory receptor genes (<em>HOR</em>, human olfactory receptor); vertical blue lines, hypersensitive sites; blue arrows, intergenic transcription start sites; LTR, long terminal repeat; δβ, δβ intergenic promoter.</p>
