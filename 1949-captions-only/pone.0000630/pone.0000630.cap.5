                Figure 5.  Non-coding transcripts originate 230 kb upstream of the β-globin locus.(A) A schematic representation of the human β-globin locus. Red arrowheads, globin genes; pink rectangle, β-like pseudogene; white arrowheads, olfactory receptor genes; black arrowhead, UBQLN3 gene; vertical blue lines, hypersensitive sites; blue arrows, intergenic transcription start sites; LTR, long terminal repeats; δβ, δβ intergenic promoter; coordinates in kilobases (kb) are relative to the HBE gene transcription start site at position 1. (B) ESTs originating from the LTR promoter 235 kb upstream of the ε gene. Intervening spliced regions are depicted along with the location of exons. Coordinates (in base pairs) of the start sites (arrows) are indicated; NCBI Nucleotide database accession numbers are shown on the right. (C) RNA FISH analysis of intergenic transcription in the 5′ olfactory receptor gene cluster region in human primary erythroid precursor cells. Intergenic transcription signals are detected in green, HBB signals are detected in red, DAPI staining of nuclear DNA is in blue. Examples for 3 individual intergenic probes and one probe cocktail are shown, as indicated; for probe labels and positions see (D) and Materials and Methods; scale bar, 5 µm. Each intergenic probe detects signals only in a proportion of all β-globin loci in the cell population. The percentage of cells with intergenic signals was scored for individual probes or cocktail; results from the quantitative analysis are presented in (D). (D) Bar plot representing percentages of cells with intergenic signals. Bar positions on the x axis correspond to probe positions and are aligned with the map below the graph; coordinates in kilobases (kb) are relative to the HBE gene transcription start site at position 1. Probes are depicted as green boxes below the map. Probe cocktails are indicated by open boxes. Probes from 5′ to 3′: 5′UBQLN3, 3′UBQLN3, 5′ORG14, 3′ORG14, 3′ORG8, 3′ORG7A, 3′ORG7B, 5′ORG6, HS5, HS3, 3′ε, 5′γ, 5′δ, and 5′β. Map features as in (A). Relatively high levels of intergenic transcription are detected in the β-globin LCR and the active δβ domain.
