Intergenic transcription signals are detected in green, <em>HBB</em> transcript signals are red, PCNA is pseudocoloured in blue; scale bar, 2 µm. Shown are single focal planes from several representative PCNA-positive cells and one PCNA-negative cell with various probe combinations. For all probe positions, see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. PCNA-negative cell (bottom right): the brightness of the blue channel is enhanced to demonstrate the absence of PCNA staining. (B) Percentage of PCNA-positive intergenic signal-containing cells was scored for individual probes or the indicated probe cocktails. Bar plot representing percentages of cells with intergenic signals (as in <a href="#pone-0000630-g005">Figure 5D</a>) with the proportion of PCNA-positive cells (S phase) shown in blue. The percentage of intergenic signal-containing S-phase cells is relatively uniform throughout the 5′ <em>ORG</em> and <em>β</em>-globin loci (average 3.3% marked by dashed line). Bar positions on the x axis correspond to probe positions and are aligned with the map below the graph; coordinates in kilobases (kb) are relative to the <em>HBE</em> gene transcription start site at position 1. Probes are depicted as green boxes below the map. Probe cocktails are indicated by open boxes. Probes from 5′ to 3′: 3′ORG14, 3′ORG8, 3′ORG7A, 3′ORG7B, 5′ORG6, HS5, HS3, 3′ε, 5′γ, 5′δ, and 5′β. Map features: red arrowheads, globin genes; pink rectangle, <em>β</em>-like pseudogene; white arrowheads, olfactory receptor genes; black arrowhead, <em>UBQLN3</em> gene; vertical blue lines, hypersensitive sites; blue arrows, intergenic transcription start sites; LTR, long terminal repeats; δβ, δβ intergenic promoter. The high level of intergenic transcription in the <em>β</em>-globin LCR and the active δβ domain is accounted for by higher percentages of non-S-phase cells with intergenic signals.</p>
