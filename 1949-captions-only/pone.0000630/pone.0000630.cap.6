                Figure 6.  Upstream transcripts occur predominantly in S phase.(A) Cell cycle analysis of intergenic transcription in the 5′ olfactory receptor gene cluster region in human primary erythroid precursor cells by RNA immuno-FISH. Intergenic transcription signals are detected in green, HBB transcript signals are red, PCNA is pseudocoloured in blue; scale bar, 2 µm. Shown are single focal planes from several representative PCNA-positive cells and one PCNA-negative cell with various probe combinations. For all probe positions, see Materials and Methods. PCNA-negative cell (bottom right): the brightness of the blue channel is enhanced to demonstrate the absence of PCNA staining. (B) Percentage of PCNA-positive intergenic signal-containing cells was scored for individual probes or the indicated probe cocktails. Bar plot representing percentages of cells with intergenic signals (as in Figure 5D) with the proportion of PCNA-positive cells (S phase) shown in blue. The percentage of intergenic signal-containing S-phase cells is relatively uniform throughout the 5′ ORG and β-globin loci (average 3.3% marked by dashed line). Bar positions on the x axis correspond to probe positions and are aligned with the map below the graph; coordinates in kilobases (kb) are relative to the HBE gene transcription start site at position 1. Probes are depicted as green boxes below the map. Probe cocktails are indicated by open boxes. Probes from 5′ to 3′: 3′ORG14, 3′ORG8, 3′ORG7A, 3′ORG7B, 5′ORG6, HS5, HS3, 3′ε, 5′γ, 5′δ, and 5′β. Map features: red arrowheads, globin genes; pink rectangle, β-like pseudogene; white arrowheads, olfactory receptor genes; black arrowhead, UBQLN3 gene; vertical blue lines, hypersensitive sites; blue arrows, intergenic transcription start sites; LTR, long terminal repeats; δβ, δβ intergenic promoter. The high level of intergenic transcription in the β-globin LCR and the active δβ domain is accounted for by higher percentages of non-S-phase cells with intergenic signals.
