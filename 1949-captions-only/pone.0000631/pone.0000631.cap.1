                Figure 1.  B. abortus does not induce augmented levels of fibrinogen, fibrin-breakdown products or important platelet aggregation.Balb/c mice (6 mice per group) were intraperitoneally injected with 106 CFU of B. abortus 2308, 105 CFU S. typhimurium (6 mice per group) or 0.1 ml of PBS (10 mice per group) and blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus and the blood from the various individuals subjected to analysis. (A) The number of platelets was determined by flow cytometry. (B) The levels of fibrinogen were determined in plasma. (C) The levels of fibrin D-dimers in the plasma from infected and PBS injected control mice were determined by agglutination of sensitized beads, after 48 h pos-infection. Minimum positive cut-off (0.5 Âµg/ml) is represented with a dashed line. Values of p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.
