(A) The number of platelets was determined by flow cytometry. (B) The levels of fibrinogen were determined in plasma. (C) The levels of fibrin D-dimers in the plasma from infected and PBS injected control mice were determined by agglutination of sensitized beads, after 48 h pos-infection. Minimum positive cut-off (0.5 Âµg/ml) is represented with a dashed line. Values of p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.</p>
