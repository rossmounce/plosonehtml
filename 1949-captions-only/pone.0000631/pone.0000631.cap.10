                Figure 10.  B. abortus replicates in na√Øve and BrLPS vaccinated TLR4 deficient mice(A) TLR4 deficient mutant C3H/HeJ and the WT counterpart C3H/HeAu mice were infected with 106 CFU B. abortus S19 and the number of replicating bacteria counted from the spleen at different time periods (5 mice per group). (B) WT and TLR4-/- C57Bl/6 mice were injected with PBS (5 mice per group) or intraperitoneally immunized with BrLPS (5 mice per group) and after two weeks infected with 106 CFU B. abortus S19 and the number of replicating bacteria in the spleen of mice counted at 14 days of infection.
