                Figure 2.  B. abortus does not induce leukocytosis or significant recruitment of PMN.Leukocyte counts were determined in the peritoneal fluids, heparinized blood or in the air pouch of Balb/c mice intraperitoneally injected with 106 CFU B. abortus 2308, 105 CFU S. typhimurium or 0.1 ml PBS. (A) Blood PMN were counted in 8 mice/group, during different periods. (B) Leukocyte values in the peritoneum were determined from fluids of 5 mice/group, in time. The inserted graph indicates the values of peritoneal lymphocytes and monocytes at 24 h. (C) The peritoneal PMN recruited were determined as in “(B)”. (D) PMN in air pouches were determined from the fluids of 5 mice/group, during 4 periods. PMN average numbers of PBS injected mice in each period (blue-dashed line) and the ranges of normal maximum upper and lower limits are depicted in each graphic (gray bar).
