                Figure 3.  PMN are not required for innate control of B. abortus infection.(A) Balb/c mice were given repeated injections of the anti-RB6 antibody to deplete PMN. Untreated or PBS injected mice were used as controls. Two days later, all mice were intraperitoneally infected with 106 CFU of B. abortus 2308 or 105 S. typhimurium. During the infection, mice were treated with anti-RB6 antibody every two days, for a maximum of 7 days. Spleen bacterial counts were determined 3 days of infection for Salmonella and 7 and 14 days of infection for B. abortus. (B) In situ respiratory burst was estimated as the rate of Brucella or Salmonella infected rat PMN containing NBT positive granules at proportion of 1 or 10 bacteria/cell. (C) Degranulation of infected rat PMN (5±4 bacteria/cell) at two cell densities/well was estimated by microscopic examination (40× upper panel and 20× lower panel) at 3 h and expressed as the proportion of degranulated cells versus intact PMN in 5 fields. Standard error was less than 10% in all cases. (D) The rate of B. abortus or S. typhimurium survival in human and rat PMN was tested at 5±4 bacteria/cell, at two post infection times. Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.
