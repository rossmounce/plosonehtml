Untreated or PBS injected mice were used as controls. Two days later, all mice were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>6</sup> CFU of <em>B. abortus</em> 2308 or 10<sup>5</sup> <em>S. typhimurium</em>. During the infection, mice were treated with anti-RB6 antibody every two days, for a maximum of 7 days. Spleen bacterial counts were determined 3 days of infection for <em>Salmonella</em> and 7 and 14 days of infection for <em>B. abortus</em>. (B) <em>In situ</em> respiratory burst was estimated as the rate of <em>Brucella</em> or <em>Salmonella</em> infected rat PMN containing NBT positive granules at proportion of 1 or 10 bacteria/cell. (C) Degranulation of infected rat PMN (5±4 bacteria/cell) at two cell densities/well was estimated by microscopic examination (40× upper panel and 20× lower panel) at 3 h and expressed as the proportion of degranulated cells versus intact PMN in 5 fields. Standard error was less than 10% in all cases. (D) The rate of <em>B. abortus</em> or <em>S. typhimurium</em> survival in human and rat PMN was tested at 5±4 bacteria/cell, at two post infection times. Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.</p>
