(B) Bactericidal activity was determined by incubating 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU of bacteria with 5 µM of cationic peptide pEM-2 or 5 mg/ml of PMN-extract in 0.2 ml PBS-1 % peptone, for 20 and 30 min. Complement bactericidal activity was estimated on 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml bacterial suspensions dispensed in wells of microtiter plates (45 µl/well) containing fresh normal human serum (45 µl/well). Bactericidal action was estimated as the percentage of CFU with respect to controls without pEM-2, PMN extract or decomplemented inactivated serum, respectively. Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.</p>
