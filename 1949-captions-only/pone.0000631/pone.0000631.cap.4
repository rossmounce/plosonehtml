                Figure 4.  B. abortus does not consume complement and is resistant to PMN extracts, cationic peptides and serum.(A) Packed bacteria were incubated with normal rabbit serum and the remaining hemolytic activity of complement in serum measured in a complement fixation indicator system: higher hemolytic activity corresponds to less complement consumption by the bacteria. (B) Bactericidal activity was determined by incubating 4 × 105 CFU of bacteria with 5 µM of cationic peptide pEM-2 or 5 mg/ml of PMN-extract in 0.2 ml PBS-1 % peptone, for 20 and 30 min. Complement bactericidal activity was estimated on 105 CFU/ml bacterial suspensions dispensed in wells of microtiter plates (45 µl/well) containing fresh normal human serum (45 µl/well). Bactericidal action was estimated as the percentage of CFU with respect to controls without pEM-2, PMN extract or decomplemented inactivated serum, respectively. Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.
