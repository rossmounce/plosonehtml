                Figure 5.  B. abortus infections induce a blunted cytokine response.The levels of IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined in the sera of Balb/c mice (6 per group) intraperitoneally infected with 106 CFU of B. abortus 2308, 105 CFU of S. typhimurium or injected with 106 CFU of HK-B. abortus (upper and center panels). Alternatively, mice were infected with 5×109 CFU of B. abortus 2308, or injected with 5×109 of HK-B. abortus. Untreated or intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml PBS control groups displayed negligible quantities of cytokines (not shown). Notice that the scales of the graphics between the upper and center panels differ in at least one order of magnitude.
