Then, halve of the mice from each group were intraperitoneally injected with 5 µg/0.05 ml PBS of <em>Ec</em>LPS, and the other halve with 0.05 PBS alone, and TNF-α levels determined in sera at 2 and 8 hours after the last injection. (B) RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with 50 µg/well with each of the various preparations described in <a href="#pone-0000631-t001">Table 1</a>. After 30 min, halve of the cultures were challenged with 5 µg/well of <em>Ec</em>LPS and the levels of TNF-α determined from culture supernatants at 4 and 24 hours. (C) Omp10, Omp16 and Omp19 lipoproteins in <em>Brucella</em> OMF revealed by Western blots with the respective monoclonal antibodies. Value of p&lt;0.05 (*) is indicated.</p>
