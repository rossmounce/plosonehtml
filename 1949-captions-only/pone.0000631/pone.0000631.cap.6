                Figure 6.  B. abortus PAMP-bearing molecules and extracts do not block the generation of TNF-α in vivo and in vitro.(A) Balb/c mice (10 per group) were intraperitoneally. injected with 50 µg/0.05ml PBS of each of the different B. abortus preparations described in Table 1, or with 0.05 ml PBS alone. Then, halve of the mice from each group were intraperitoneally injected with 5 µg/0.05 ml PBS of EcLPS, and the other halve with 0.05 PBS alone, and TNF-α levels determined in sera at 2 and 8 hours after the last injection. (B) RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with 50 µg/well with each of the various preparations described in Table 1. After 30 min, halve of the cultures were challenged with 5 µg/well of EcLPS and the levels of TNF-α determined from culture supernatants at 4 and 24 hours. (C) Omp10, Omp16 and Omp19 lipoproteins in Brucella OMF revealed by Western blots with the respective monoclonal antibodies. Value of p&lt;0.05 (*) is indicated.
