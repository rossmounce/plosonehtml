Under these conditions no significant cytotoxicity was recorded in these phagocytic cells. (B) Naïve macrophages were infected at rate of 10±5 bacteria/cell and bacteria replication estimated; after 24 h, half of the infected macrophages were activated with 0.5 µg/well <em>EcLPS</em> (black squares) and the rest of the cells treated with PBS (white squares) and bacterial replication followed until 48 h post inoculation. Immunofluorescence of replicating <em>Brucella</em> at 24 h of infection (arrows) is shown in the inserted figure. (C) TNF-α measured in the supernatants of non-infected <em>Ec</em>LPS 0.5 µg/well activated macrophages (black circles), non-activated <em>B. abortus</em> infected cells (white triangles), or <em>Ec</em>LPS activated cells after 24 h of <em>B. abortus</em> infection (red circles). Value of p&lt;0.0005 (***) is indicated.</p>
