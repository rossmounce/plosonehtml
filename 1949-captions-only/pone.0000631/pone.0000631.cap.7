                Figure 7.  Macrophages activated before infection are significantly more brucellacidal than macrophages activated after infection.(A) Naïve or activated RAW264.7 macrophages with EcLPS 0.5 µg/well 15 h prior to infection, were infected with B. abortus 2308 at 10±5 bacteria/cell and the microbicidal function estimated after 2 h post inoculation. Under these conditions no significant cytotoxicity was recorded in these phagocytic cells. (B) Naïve macrophages were infected at rate of 10±5 bacteria/cell and bacteria replication estimated; after 24 h, half of the infected macrophages were activated with 0.5 µg/well EcLPS (black squares) and the rest of the cells treated with PBS (white squares) and bacterial replication followed until 48 h post inoculation. Immunofluorescence of replicating Brucella at 24 h of infection (arrows) is shown in the inserted figure. (C) TNF-α measured in the supernatants of non-infected EcLPS 0.5 µg/well activated macrophages (black circles), non-activated B. abortus infected cells (white triangles), or EcLPS activated cells after 24 h of B. abortus infection (red circles). Value of p&lt;0.0005 (***) is indicated.
