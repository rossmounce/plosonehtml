                Figure 8.  Brucella intracellular replication is TLR4 and TLR2 independent but TNF-α production is TLR4 and TLR2 dependent.(A) BM macrophages from WT, TLR4-/-, TLR2-/- and TLR4/TLR2-/- C57Bl/6 mice were inoculated with 50 µg/well of B. abortus OMF, 50 µg/well of BrLPS or 0.1 µg/well of EcLPS (A) and TNF-α measured after 24 h. (B) BM macrophages from WT, TLR4-/-. TLR2-/- and TLR4/TLR2-/- C57Bl/6 mice were infected with B. abortus 2308 (infection rate of 10±5 bacteria/cell) or treated with 10 HK-B. abortus/cell and TNF-α measured after 48 h. (C) BM macrophages were infected as in “(B)” and bacterial replication determined as the number of CFU during different periods. Values of p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.
