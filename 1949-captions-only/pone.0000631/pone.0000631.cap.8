(B) BM macrophages from WT, TLR4-/-. TLR2-/- and TLR4/TLR2-/- C57Bl/6 mice were infected with <em>B. abortus</em> 2308 (infection rate of 10±5 bacteria/cell) or treated with 10 HK-<em>B. abortus</em>/cell and TNF-α measured after 48 h. (C) BM macrophages were infected as in “(B)” and bacterial replication determined as the number of CFU during different periods.
