(B) Survival of macrophages infected with <em>B. abortus</em> S19 at MOI of 50. (C) Survival of macrophages treated with 50 µg/ml of HK-<em>B. abortus</em> S19. (D) Survival of WT and IL-1β/IL-18-/- macrophages infected with <em>B. abortus</em> S19 (MOI 50). (E) Untreated (panel 1) and CNF treated (panels 2, 3 and 4) HeLa cells were infected with <em>B. abortus</em> 2308 at a MOI of 500 and incubated for 48 h. Untreated cells (panel 1) were incubated with BrdU. All cells were processed for immunofluorescence <a href="#pone.0000631-ChavesOlarte1">[39]</a> using anti-<em>Br</em>LPS antibodies (green in panel 1 and red in panels 2, 3 and 4) or antibodies against BrdU epitope (red in panel 1). CNF treatment inhibits the cytokinesis while not affecting karyokinesis resulting in the generation heavily infected cells during the mitotic cycle (panel 2, cell in anaphase), binucleated cells (panel 3) or multinucleated cells (panel 4). Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.</p>
