                Figure 9.  Brucella is not cytotoxic for macrophages and HeLa cells.(A) Survival rate of uninfected WT, TLR4-/-, TLR2-/- and TLR4/TLR2-/- BM macrophages from C57Bl/6 mice was followed using MTT assay for seven days. (B) Survival of macrophages infected with B. abortus S19 at MOI of 50. (C) Survival of macrophages treated with 50 µg/ml of HK-B. abortus S19. (D) Survival of WT and IL-1β/IL-18-/- macrophages infected with B. abortus S19 (MOI 50). (E) Untreated (panel 1) and CNF treated (panels 2, 3 and 4) HeLa cells were infected with B. abortus 2308 at a MOI of 500 and incubated for 48 h. Untreated cells (panel 1) were incubated with BrdU. All cells were processed for immunofluorescence [39] using anti-BrLPS antibodies (green in panel 1 and red in panels 2, 3 and 4) or antibodies against BrdU epitope (red in panel 1). CNF treatment inhibits the cytokinesis while not affecting karyokinesis resulting in the generation heavily infected cells during the mitotic cycle (panel 2, cell in anaphase), binucleated cells (panel 3) or multinucleated cells (panel 4). Values of p&lt;0.005 (**) and p&lt;0.0005 (***) are indicated.
