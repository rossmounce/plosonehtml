                Figure 1.  Schematic of the mathematical model.The circumference represents the surface of the TC, on which TCR is distributed by lateral diffusion. Position on the surface is specified by the angular coordinate Φ as shown. Φ1 and Φ2 denote the instantaneous positions of the two moving boundaries of the TC-APC contact area shown as the heavy arc. TCR is internalized from the contact area with the high ligand-induced rate constant ki, and from the rest of the surface, with the lower constitutive rate contact kc. Polarized recycling of the internalized receptors is directed to the position denoted Φr, which is adjacent to the eccentric intracellular RC not shown in the diagram. The recycling position and the positions of the boundaries as shown are arbitrary. In the model, the recycling position Φr is fixed and the boundaries Φ1 and Φ2 can move along the surface, expanding or contracting the contact area according to whether the local receptor density P(Φ, t) at the boundaries is above or below the critical density pcrit for attachment to the APC.
