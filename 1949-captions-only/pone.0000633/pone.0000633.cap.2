On the axes, <em>p<sub>crit</sub></em> is the critical TCR density for attachment to the APC, and <em>k</em><sub>ω</sub> is the rate constant of the contact expansion. Other parameters values are as measured experimentally. <em>Dark-blue</em>, no contact develops; <em>light-blue</em>, a stable contact develops that is insignificant in size (&lt;30° arc); <em>yellow</em>, contact collapses incompletely after exceeding 30° arc transiently; <em>orange</em>, contact stabilizes above 30° arc; <em>red</em>, infeasible expansion &gt;180° is predicted. <em>Cross</em> denotes the parameter combination for the dynamic example shown in panel <em>B</em>: <em>p</em><sub>crit</sub> = 0.09 rad<sup>–1</sup>, <em>k</em><sub>ω</sub> = 4.7 rad<sup>2</sup>/min. (<em>B</em>) Dynamics of the surface TCR distribution <em>P</em>(<em>Φ</em>, <em>t</em>) and contact boundaries <em>Φ</em><sub>1,2</sub>(<em>t</em>). TCR density <em>P</em> is color-coded in the units of the fraction of the total amount of TCR in the cell per radian of the cell circumference. Solid lines give the position of the contact boundaries <em>Φ</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>Φ</em><sub>2</sub>. Dashed line is the isoline of the critical TCR density for contact expansion, <em>P</em> = <em>p</em><sub>crit</sub>. <em>Φ</em> is the angular coordinate around the TC, with 270° corresponding to the bottom of the cell where the recycling is assumed to be directed and where the contact with the TCR-binding substrate is initialized in our experiments. <em>t</em> is time after the contact initiation (therefore a horizontal line through the plot gives an instantaneous distribution of TCR and the positions of the contact boundaries at the time corresponding to the height at which the imaginary line is drawn).</p>
