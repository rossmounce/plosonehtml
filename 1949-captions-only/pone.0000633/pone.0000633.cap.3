Color coding is the same as in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2a</a>, with two additional regimes possible in the present case: <em>medium-blue</em> (a thin boundary domain separating the light- and dark-blue ones), in which the contact collapses completely without exceeding 30° arc, and <em>turquoise</em>, in which the contact collapses completely after exceeding 30° arc transiently. The domain <em>outlined in black</em> is determined as an intersection of the domains in this figure and in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2a</a>: inside the black outline, the formation of a significant (&gt;30°) contact is predicted to be stable if the point of the initial contact coincides with the point of recycling, and transient if the two points are diametrically opposed. Thus, inside the black boundary, the model reproduces our previous experiments. <em>Cross</em> denotes the parameter combination for the dynamic example shown in panel <em>B</em>, which is the same parameter combination as for the example in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2b</a>. (<em>B</em>) Dynamics of the surface TCR distribution and contact boundaries. The plotting conventions are the same as in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2b</a>. Recycling is directed to <em>Φ</em> = 90° (the top of the cell in the experiments), and the contact is initiated at <em>Φ</em> = 270° (cell bottom).</p>
