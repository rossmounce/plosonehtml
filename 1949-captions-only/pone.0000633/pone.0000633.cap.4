Color coding is the same as in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2a</a> and <a href="#pone-0000633-g003">3a</a>, with the additional regime denoted <em>brown</em>: in this novel regime, the contact area not only stabilizes at &gt;30° arc in size, but also covers the point of recycling no later than in 30 min. The domain <em>outlined in black</em> is the same as in <a href="#pone-0000633-g003">Fig. 3a</a>, representing the parameter combinations that predicted model behavior compatible with our previous experiments. Note that the domain predicting the novel behavior (<em>brown</em>) overlaps with the domain compatible with the previous experiments (<em>black outline</em>). <em>Cross</em> denotes the parameter combination for the dynamic example shown in panel <em>B</em>, which is the same parameter combination as for the examples in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2b</a> and <a href="#pone-0000633-g003">3b</a>. (<em>B</em>) Dynamics of the surface TCR distribution and contact boundaries. The plotting conventions are the same as in <a href="#pone-0000633-g002">Fig. 2b</a> and <a href="#pone-0000633-g003">3b</a>. Recycling is directed to <em>Φ</em> = 150°, and the contact is initiated at <em>Φ</em> = 270°, which positions are separates by 120° along the TC circumference.</p>
