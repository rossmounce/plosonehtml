                Figure 4.  Model behavior when the recycling point is separated from the contact initiation point by 120°.(A) Domains of the parameter space that determine qualitatively different dynamic scenarios. Color coding is the same as in Fig. 2a and 3a, with the additional regime denoted brown: in this novel regime, the contact area not only stabilizes at &gt;30° arc in size, but also covers the point of recycling no later than in 30 min. The domain outlined in black is the same as in Fig. 3a, representing the parameter combinations that predicted model behavior compatible with our previous experiments. Note that the domain predicting the novel behavior (brown) overlaps with the domain compatible with the previous experiments (black outline). Cross denotes the parameter combination for the dynamic example shown in panel B, which is the same parameter combination as for the examples in Fig. 2b and 3b. (B) Dynamics of the surface TCR distribution and contact boundaries. The plotting conventions are the same as in Fig. 2b and 3b. Recycling is directed to Φ = 150°, and the contact is initiated at Φ = 270°, which positions are separates by 120° along the TC circumference.
