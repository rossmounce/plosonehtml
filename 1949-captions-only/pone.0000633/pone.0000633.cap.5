The cell sits on the horizontal, non-fluorescent TCR-binding substrate. A time-sequence of side views of three-dimensional confocal images is shown. The level of the non-fluorescent substrate under the cell is roughly indicated by the 10-Âµm scale bar in the first image. The GA is seen approaching the substrate on an arc. Since the TCR-binding substrate is immobile in this experimental setup, this kind of cell movement is consistent with migration of the cell-substrate contact area over the cell surface towards the eccentric GA.</p>
