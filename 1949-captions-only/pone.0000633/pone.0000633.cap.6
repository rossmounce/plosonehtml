Scale bar, 10 Âµm. Time interval, 1 min. (<em>D-F</em>) Transmitted-light images of the same cell at the same time points. The median of the asymmetrically extended cell-substrate contact (lamellipodium) is indicated by <em>arrow</em> in <em>E</em>. Note that the contact extends most strongly on its side that is the closest to the GA, and that its asymmetry can be unequivocally determined at the beginning of extension (<em>E</em>). (<em>G</em>) Histogram of angles, as seen from the top, between the direction from the cell centroid to the GA centroid and the direction from the cell centroid to the median of the lamellipodium.</p>
