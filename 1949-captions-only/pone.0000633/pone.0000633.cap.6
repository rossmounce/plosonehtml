                Figure 6.  Preferential extension of the TC-substrate contact side that is the closest to the GA.(A-C) Time sequence of top views of three-dimensional images of fluorescently labeled GA (arrow in B) in a TC sitting on the TCR-binding substrate. Scale bar, 10 Âµm. Time interval, 1 min. (D-F) Transmitted-light images of the same cell at the same time points. The median of the asymmetrically extended cell-substrate contact (lamellipodium) is indicated by arrow in E. Note that the contact extends most strongly on its side that is the closest to the GA, and that its asymmetry can be unequivocally determined at the beginning of extension (E). (G) Histogram of angles, as seen from the top, between the direction from the cell centroid to the GA centroid and the direction from the cell centroid to the median of the lamellipodium.
