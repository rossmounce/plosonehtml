                Figure 1.  Aggregation lag times and anti-1C2 signal intensity of polyQ expansions.(A). Inverted values of the repeat-length-dependent differences in aggregation lag times of a series of polyQ peptide encoding repeats length of 28, 36 and 47 (Q28, Q36 and Q47) by Chen et al. [11] (closed rectangles) and length-dependent intensity differences of anti-1C2 signals on soluble monomers of huntingtin encoding repeats length of 27, 33 and 39 (Q27, Q33 and Q39) by Trottier et al. [2] (closed triangles). The Spearman's correlation coefficient was 1.00, with the relationship represented by the function, y = 0.72(x−25)2−2.75(x−25)+7.1. (B). Relationship between aggregation lag times of polyQ tracts and intensity of anti-1C2 signal on soluble monomers of huntingtin from the results of Figure 1A (y = ax−1, a is relative value). Each of the rectangles shows a constant area ( = a).
