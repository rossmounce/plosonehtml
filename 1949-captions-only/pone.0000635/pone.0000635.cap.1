Inverted values of the repeat-length-dependent differences in aggregation lag times of a series of polyQ peptide encoding repeats length of 28, 36 and 47 (Q28, Q36 and Q47) by Chen et al. <a href="#pone.0000635-Chen2">[11]</a> (closed rectangles) and length-dependent intensity differences of anti-1C2 signals on soluble monomers of huntingtin encoding repeats length of 27, 33 and 39 (Q27, Q33 and Q39) by Trottier et al. <a href="#pone.0000635-Trottier1">[2]</a> (closed triangles). The Spearman's correlation coefficient was 1.00, with the relationship represented by the function, y = 0.72(x−25)<sup>2</sup>−2.75(x−25)+7.1. (B). Relationship between aggregation lag times of polyQ tracts and intensity of anti-1C2 signal on soluble monomers of huntingtin from the results of <a href="#pone-0000635-g001">Figure 1A</a> (y = ax<sup>−1</sup>, a is relative value). Each of the rectangles shows a constant area ( = a).</p>
