Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products amplified by a set of primers covering the inserted fragments of the constructs (Lane M, pBR322 digested with MspI as size marker; lane 1, pQBI25; lane 2, pQBI25-L13; lane 3, pQBI25-L24; lane 4, pQBI25-L32), and yielding PCR of sizes 153 bp, 228 bp, 261 bp, and 285 bp, respectively. Migration of the PCR products was slightly different in proportion to the number of CTG repeats. (B). Fluorescence micrograph of the expressed GFP or polyL-GFP fusion protein. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. (C). Summary of the time course of aggregation of cells transfected with pQBI25-L13, L-24 and -L32. Percent aggregation represents the number of cells with aggregates relative to the number of GFP-positive cells at each time point. Values represent the mean of duplicate experiments.</p>
