                Figure 3.  Detection of dead cells induced by polyL-GFP fusion proteins.(A). Fluorescence micrograph of propidium iodide (PI) stained dead cells expressing GFP or polyL32-GFP fusion protein. (B). Summary of the time course of cell death following transfection with pQBI25, pQBI25-L13, -L24 and -L32. The percentage of dead cells is reported relative to the number of GFP-positive cells at each time point transfection. Values represent the mean of duplicate experiments.
