                Figure 4.  Expression of epitopes binding anti-GFP and anti-1C2 on soluble monomers of polyL-GFP fusion proteins.(A). Time course of anti-GFP Ab binding of cells expressing polyL-GFP fusion proteins (M, lysate from mock transfected cells; V, lysate from cells transfected with the pQBI25 vector). (B). Western blot analysis of GFP and polyL-GFP fusion proteins successively immunoprobed with 1C2 and anti-GFP Ab. (C). Expression of anti-GFP signal on polyL-GFP fusion proteins. The signal intensity of each band on Western blots (Figure 4A) was adjusted to be equal to that shown in Figure 2C. Values represent mean of duplicate experiments. (D). Expression of anti-1C2 signal on the polyL-GFP fusion proteins L13, L24 and L32. The relative signal intensities of each was determined by the results of Figure 4B, and the time course of anti-1C2 signal intensity was calculated from the data in Figure 4C, since anti-1C2 signal intensity of 13 leucine fused to GFP was weak. (E). Integration of anti-1C2 signal intensity on polyL-GFP fusion proteins, calculated from the results of Figure 4D using Simpson's formula. Spearman's correlation coefficients calculated from the data in Figure 2C and Figure 4E were, for L13, R = 0.821 (p = 0.025); for L24, R = 0.973 (p = 0.009); and for L32, R = 0.986 (p = 0.014).
