Time course of anti-GFP Ab binding of cells expressing polyL-GFP fusion proteins (M, lysate from mock transfected cells; V, lysate from cells transfected with the pQBI25 vector). (B). Western blot analysis of GFP and polyL-GFP fusion proteins successively immunoprobed with 1C2 and anti-GFP Ab. (C). Expression of anti-GFP signal on polyL-GFP fusion proteins. The signal intensity of each band on Western blots (<a href="#pone-0000635-g004">Figure 4A</a>) was adjusted to be equal to that shown in <a href="#pone-0000635-g002">Figure 2C</a>. Values represent mean of duplicate experiments. (D). Expression of anti-1C2 signal on the polyL-GFP fusion proteins L13, L24 and L32. The relative signal intensities of each was determined by the results of <a href="#pone-0000635-g004">Figure 4B</a>, and the time course of anti-1C2 signal intensity was calculated from the data in <a href="#pone-0000635-g004">Figure 4C</a>, since anti-1C2 signal intensity of 13 leucine fused to GFP was weak. (E). Integration of anti-1C2 signal intensity on polyL-GFP fusion proteins, calculated from the results of <a href="#pone-0000635-g004">Figure 4D</a> using Simpson's formula. Spearman's correlation coefficients calculated from the data in <a href="#pone-0000635-g002">Figure 2C</a> and <a href="#pone-0000635-g004">Figure 4E</a> were, for L13, R = 0.821 (p = 0.025); for L24, R = 0.973 (p = 0.009); and for L32, R = 0.986 (p = 0.014).</p>
