Median age at onset of HD relative to particular repeat size. Data were obtained from a large cohort study consisting of 661 affected and 205 asymptomatic individuals at risk <a href="#pone.0000635-Brinkman1">[14]</a> (rectangles). The median age at onset is the age at which 50% of individuals will be affected. Inverted values of the quadratic function, y = 0.72(x−25)<sup>2</sup>−2.75(x−25)+7.1, were obtained from the results in <a href="#pone-0000635-g001">Figure 1A</a> (triangles). Spearman's correlation coefficient was 1.00, p = 0.00046. (B). Correlation between the quadratic function and the median age at onset of HD relative to repeat size, from the results of <a href="#pone-0000635-g005">Figure 5A</a> (circles).</p>
