                Figure 5.  Determinant of HD age-of-onset.(A). Median age at onset of HD relative to particular repeat size. Data were obtained from a large cohort study consisting of 661 affected and 205 asymptomatic individuals at risk [14] (rectangles). The median age at onset is the age at which 50% of individuals will be affected. Inverted values of the quadratic function, y = 0.72(x−25)2−2.75(x−25)+7.1, were obtained from the results in Figure 1A (triangles). Spearman's correlation coefficient was 1.00, p = 0.00046. (B). Correlation between the quadratic function and the median age at onset of HD relative to repeat size, from the results of Figure 5A (circles).
