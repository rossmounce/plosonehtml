The polyQ expansion mutation results in a gain of the amyloid-precursor epitope, leading to the nucleation process of polyQ aggregation. During the nucleated growth polymerization reaction, the diversity of amyloid conformations results from the protein's primary structure containing the polyQ segment. Aberrant interactions between amyloid conformations and cellular factors determine the toxic effects on the cells, resulting in selective injury.</p>
