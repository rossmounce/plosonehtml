                Figure 1. Slow and fast periods of hydrogen isotope ratios (H) from hair and oxygen (O) and carbon (C) isotope ratios from teeth of Paranthropus robustus.
The fast periods occurred every 1.2 weeks in the mammoth. The fastest cycling in all our subjects. This is consistent with fast growth rate and the thermoregulatory function of hair, of importance to this animal living in western Siberia. The patient with PAF had neither slow nor fast periods in keeping with the absence of autonomic modulation of biologic rhythms in this neurodegenerative disease. Both, fast and slow periods, were delayed in the high altitude dwellers of Ladakh, most likely the result of life long chronic hypoxia. Teeth, unlike hair, grow only during early childhood and adolescence. And the hominin was a vegetarian. This may account for the differences in slow and fast periodicities between the hydrogen isotope ratios in hair of the Italian woman and the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in teeth of hominins. PAF = patient suffering from pure autonomic failure.
