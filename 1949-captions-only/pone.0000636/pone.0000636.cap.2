                Figure 2.  Power spectra derived from hydrogen isotope ratios in hair of humans (A) and oxygen isotope ratios in Paranthropus robustus teeth (B).Note that the slow and fast power peaks, in terms of normalized frequencies, are similar to those derived from power spectra of heart rate variability of the Italian subject and especially the virtual absence of frequency modulations in the patient with PAF (see Figure 3). X =  very slow frequency cycling at 32 weeks.
The frequency of spectral power peaks of hydrogen isotope ratios in hair in the normal human and oxygen isotope ratios in Paranthropus robustus is also very similar (B) giving additional support to the influence of the ANS on biologic rhythms derived from different tissues.
