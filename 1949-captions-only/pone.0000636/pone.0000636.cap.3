Note low and high frequency power occur, when normalized, at similar frequencies to those obtained from hydrogen isotope ratios from these same subjects (see Fig. 2). In the patient with PAF only a high frequency peak in heart rate variability can be seen. The high frequency peak is due to respiration, as is shown in A. The low frequency peak could not be observed on head-up tilt when it normally increases in amplitude due to sympathetic activation. In this patient heart rate variability is not modulated by the ANS; this is also reflected in the spectra derived from his hydrogen isotope ratios (Fig. 2). RR = heart beat intervals; SAP = systolic arterial pressure variability; RESP = variability in respiratory frequency.
