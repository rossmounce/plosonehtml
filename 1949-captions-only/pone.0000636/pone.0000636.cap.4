                Figure 4.  Power spectra derived from tooth enamel growth lines of carbon isotope and oxygen isotope ratios of Paranthropus robustus, a hominin that lived in the South African savanna ~1.8 million years ago.The carbon isotope ratios provide a measure of the type of diet consumed and a guide to local climate at the time. The oxygen isotope ratios also shed light on diet and climate. The oxygen isotope ratio increases with surface temperature of water, evaporation and with low humidity. This in turn influences the water content in leaves from which most herbivores, including this hominin, satisfy their water requirements (raw data from on line supplement to reference 6). Note the slow and fast power peaks of the stable isotope ratios, characteristic of ANS modulation of food and water intake and the similar power spectral peaks of oxygen to those obtained from hydrogen isotopes in hair of living normal humans (see Fig. 2). Carbon isotope ratios are shifted to the right.
