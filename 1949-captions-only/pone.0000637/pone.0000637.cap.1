                Figure 1.  Signal spectra and electrode placement.Typical signal spectrum from proposed dry electrode (each trace corresponds to averaged spectra for each class). b) Comparable signal from conventional electrode with electrolyte gel (same subject, same conditions). c) Illustration of dry cap. d) Contralateral CSPs of left/right classes from full cap and location of 6 dry cap electrodes.
