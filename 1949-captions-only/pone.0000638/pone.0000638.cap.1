HIV-1 template generated from RT-PCR of viral RNA is subjected to both total copy and mutation-specific real-time reactions. B. The difference in the total copy and mutation-specific reactions (ΔCT) is used to differentiate mutant and wildtype specimens. In this example, the experimental cutoff is a ΔCT of 10.5 cycles. A mutation-specific CT within 10.5 cycles of the total copy reaction CT would indicate the presence of mutant virus.</p>
