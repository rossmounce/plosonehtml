                Figure 2.  Mutation-specific assay reactivity on plasmids.Cloned L90M (A.) and K103N (B.) mutant virus sequence was diluted 10-fold, from 100% to 0.001%, in backgrounds of wildtype sequence to determine assay detection limits. Plotted are the mean ΔCT versus log10 of the mutant dilution series (•), and the mean ΔCT for wildtype sequence alone (▪). The lower detection limit (lower dotted line) was placed at the ΔCT equivalent to 0.5 log10 below (0.5-log greater reactivity than) the wildtype ΔCT. Dilutions that fall outside the linear range are not considered. For comparison, the mutant virus frequency equivalences for the established clinical cutoffs are also shown (dashed line).
