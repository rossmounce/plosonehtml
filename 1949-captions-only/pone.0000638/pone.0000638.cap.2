Plotted are the mean ΔCT versus log<sub>10</sub> of the mutant dilution series (•), and the mean ΔCT for wildtype sequence alone (▪). The lower detection limit (lower dotted line) was placed at the ΔCT equivalent to 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> below (0.5-log greater reactivity than) the wildtype ΔCT. Dilutions that fall outside the linear range are not considered. For comparison, the mutant virus frequency equivalences for the established clinical cutoffs are also shown (dashed line).</p>
