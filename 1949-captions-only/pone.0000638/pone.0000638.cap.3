                Figure 3.  Assay reactivities with clinical samples having sequence-detectable mutations and with pre-antiretroviral wildtype virus samples.The range of reactivity for each assay is shown for wildtype and mutant samples. The upper and lower Î”CT and the mean (hash) for each group are indicated. Assay cutoffs (horizontal line) were established to exclude all wildtype viruses from the pre-antiretroviral era.
