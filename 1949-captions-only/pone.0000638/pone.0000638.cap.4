                Figure 4.  Detection of other associated resistance mutations in mutation-specific amplicons.A. The undecipherable codon 215 in the bulk sequence of this sample was resolved (positive) with the T215Y test. The sequence of the T215Y-positive amplicon showed that the mutations present in the bulk sequence were linked. B. The low-frequency K103N amplicon sequence from this sample uncovered another previously undetected mutation, M184V. 215X, undecipherable codon 215.
