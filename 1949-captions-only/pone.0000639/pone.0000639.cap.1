The relationship is significant: log(acuity) = −0.00168 log(illumination)<sup>2</sup> + 0.0125 log(illumination) + 0.0889. Symbols represent individual birds: ▴, ▵, ⧫, ◊, □. Mean values±SEM: 0.034±0.006, 0.055±0.004, 0.063±0.005, 0.064±0.007, 0.077±0.006, 0.087±0.006 for illuminations of 0.0012, 0.0058, 0.011, 0.028, 0.11, and 1.4 lux, respectively. ○ = mean data±SEM for five great cormorants determined by Strod et al <a href="#pone.0000639-Strod1">[17]</a>; • = mean aquatic visual acuity threshold for unaided humans <a href="#pone.0000639-Gisln1">[19]</a>. The range of mean illumination encountered during the bottom phase of dives is shown for European shags <em>Phalacrocorax aristotelis</em> and blue-eyed shags <em>Phalacrocorax atriceps</em> <a href="#pone.0000639-Wanless1">[18]</a>, as are the illumination levels equivalent to those received at the earth's surface from natural sources between full daylight and an overcast night.</p>
