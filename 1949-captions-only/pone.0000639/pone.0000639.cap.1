                Figure 1.  Effect of ambient illumination (lux) on the visual acuity of five great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo.Visual acuity is expressed as the reciprocal of minutes of arc. The relationship is significant: log(acuity) = −0.00168 log(illumination)2 + 0.0125 log(illumination) + 0.0889. Symbols represent individual birds: ▴, ▵, ⧫, ◊, □. Mean values±SEM: 0.034±0.006, 0.055±0.004, 0.063±0.005, 0.064±0.007, 0.077±0.006, 0.087±0.006 for illuminations of 0.0012, 0.0058, 0.011, 0.028, 0.11, and 1.4 lux, respectively. ○ = mean data±SEM for five great cormorants determined by Strod et al [17]; • = mean aquatic visual acuity threshold for unaided humans [19]. The range of mean illumination encountered during the bottom phase of dives is shown for European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis and blue-eyed shags Phalacrocorax atriceps [18], as are the illumination levels equivalent to those received at the earth's surface from natural sources between full daylight and an overcast night.
