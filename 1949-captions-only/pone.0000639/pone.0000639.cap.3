                Figure 3.  Effect of viewing distance on visual acuity of five great cormorants.The relationship is significant: log(acuity) = −0.751–0.151 (viewing distance). Symbols represent individual birds: ▴, ▵, ⧫, ◊, □. Mean values±SEM: 0.15±0.03, 0.12±0.03, and 0.087±0.006 (minutes of arc)−1 for viewing distances of 0.62, 1.05, and 2.12 m, respectively
