                Figure 4.  Visual acuity surfaces of great cormorants describing the effects of contrast, illumination and viewing distance.Three surfaces are presented, corresponding with viewing distances of 2.12 m (upper surface), 1.05 m (middle surface) and 0.63 m (lower surface). Visual acuity is expressed as the minimum width of a detectable object (mm).
