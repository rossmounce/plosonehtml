                Figure 5.  Prey detectability model for a great cormorant based upon the data of Fig. 4 demonstrating the effects of contrast and viewing distance.The model is based upon a great cormorant foraging on a capelin (Mallotus villosus, 10 cm TL) type fish at an ambient illumination of 10 lux, which has a contrast of 90, 60 and 30% viewed from a distance of 0.63, 1.05 or 2.12 m. Each frame depicts a scene with an angular width of 10Â°. Scenes were generated by determining the angular resolution appropriate to each set of conditions from Fig. 4, and appropriately downsampling the high resolution images in the upper row.
