These span the range of target light levels used in this series of experiments and span the range of ambient light levels that are known to be encountered by cormorants during natural dives <a href="#pone.0000639-Wanless1">[18]</a> (ca 0.5 to 100 lux). Each frame depicts a scene with an angular width of 10Â°.</p>
