When the gate (B) was raised by the experimenter, signalling the start of a trial, the birds entered the swimway and performed the simultaneous discrimination at a point (C) a known distance from the stimuli (D and E). If the birds approached the correct stimulus they were provided with a fish reward (a single sprat). If they approached the incorrect stimulus, they received no reward. At the end of each trial, the birds exited the swimway at F or G, and returned to the starting position (A) to await the start of a new trial. Note that the stimuli are submerged beneath D and E in the photograph. Inset shows a single frame captured from a video of a bird swimming though the swimway, just prior to the choice point (C).
