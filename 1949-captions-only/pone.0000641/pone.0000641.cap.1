                Figure 1.  Expression of CB1 and CB2 in Rosa26.6 (Panel A) and E14 (Panel B) ES cells.Cells were washed with PBS, and then RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers for CB1, CB2, GAPDH and CXCR4. Panel C: RT-PCR analysis of the in vitro differentiation of Rosa26.6 ES cells, using specific primers for GAPDH, Flk-1, PECAM-1 and Sca-1. EBs: Embryoid bodies. ES cells: undifferentiated control ES cells. The following primers were used: GAPDH: 292 bp S 5′-CTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCG-3′ AS 5′-ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCC-3′ CB1: 430 bp S 5′-CGTGGGCAGCCTGTTCCTCA-3′ AS 5′-CATGCGGGCTTGGTCTGG-3′ CB2: 479 bp S 5′-CCGGAAAAGAGGATGGCAATGAAT-3′ AS 5′CTGCTGAGCGCCCTGGAGAAC-3′ PECAM-1: 260 bp S 5′-GTCATGGCCATGGTCGAGTA-3′ AS 5′-CTCCTCGGCATCTTGCTGAA-3′ Flk-1: 239 bp S 5′-CACCTGGCACTCTCCACCTTC-3′ AS 5′-GATTTCATCCCACTACCGAAAG-3′
