                Figure 2.  The expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors in Rosa26.6 and E14 ES cells as analyzed by Western blot analysis.Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and 100 mg of total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with CB1 or CB2 specific antibodies (at a dilution of 1:500). The cell lines 293T and SH-SY5Y were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, for CB1 expression. Actin was used as a control for loading. ES cells: undifferentiated ES cells; EBs: Embryoid bodies at different time points as indicated.
