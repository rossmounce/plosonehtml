                Figure 3.  Comparison of endocannabinoid levels in mES cells and EBs at days 7 and 14, when the number of cells in each group is normalized to 107 ( = 1e7).The groups depict the logarithms of each value. AEA, DHEA and EEA endocannabinoid levels were detected but were lower than the limit of quantitation (&lt;0.05 ng/1e7 cells) for the number of cells analyzed.
