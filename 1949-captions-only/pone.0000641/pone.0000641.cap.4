                Figure 4.  Effects of cannabinoid ligands on the chemotaxis of ES cells and hematopoietic differentiated ES-derived EB cells (EBs-day 10).Cells were placed in the upper well of the transwell in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors, as indicated. The ligands: 2-AG, Δ9-THC, JWH-015 and SDF-1α were placed in the lower chambers. Data show the mean value of 3 independent experiments (mean±SD). Error bars indicate SD. * P values with asterisk (*, P&lt;0.05) show significant differences from control with media alone.
