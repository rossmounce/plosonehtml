                Figure 5.  Effects of Δ9-THC and cannabinoid inhibitors (AM251 and AM630) on Rosa ES cell survival.Rosa ES cells were either untreated (as control) or treated with Δ9-THC, control DMSO (0.01%), control methanol (0.01%), or with the inhibitors AM251 (for the CB1 receptor) or AM630 (for the CB2 receptor), as indicated. After 48 hours, the cells were analyzed for their viability by light microscopy. This is a representative experiment out of three experiments.
