                Figure 1.  Characterization of gain-of-function alleles of lov1.(A) lov1-1D plants and 35S::LOV1 plants, an activation-tagged mutant and a cDNA overexpressor plant, respectively, grown under long-day conditions. These plants were germinated at the same time, and this photo was taken when a floral bud was seen in 35S::LOV1 plants. Bars = 1 cm (B) Expression of At2g02450 in 18-day-old wild-type plants and lov1-1D mutants. 25S RNA was used as a loading control. (C) Genomic Southern blot analysis of lov1-1D mutants using BAR gene as a probe. B; BamHI, E; EcoRI, H; HindIII, M; marker, P; PstI (D) Confirmation of overexpression of At2g02450 in 10-day-old transgenic plants (At2g02450 O/X) via northern blot analysis. UBQ10 was used for a loading control.
