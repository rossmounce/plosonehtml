Open boxes and closed boxes indicate exons and introns of <em>LOV1,</em> respectively. Grey boxes mark a conserved NAC-domain. A transposon is denoted as a reverse triangle. (B) Distribution of the total number of leaves of the original transposon allele of <em>lov1-4</em> (asterisk) and wild-type L<em>er</em> plants. (C) Absence of <em>LOV1</em> expression in <em>lov1-4</em> mutants grown under long-day conditions. (D) Slight early flowering of <em>lov1-4</em> mutants under long-day conditions. Bars = 1 cm (E) Flowering time of <em>lov1-1D</em>, <em>35S::LOV1</em> and <em>lov1-4</em> plants under long-day and short-day conditions. Note that changes in the flowering times of these mutants were more prominent under long-day conditions. (F) Expression of the LOV1:HA proteins in two independent 10-day-old <em>pLOV1::LOV1:HA</em> transgenic plants. (G) Distribution of the total number of leaves of <em>lov1-4</em> plants with or without <em>pLOV1::LOV1:HA</em> transgene grown under long-day conditions. #2-1 and #2-9 are two independent lines of <em>pLOV1::LOV1:HA lov1-4</em> plants.</p>
