                Figure 2.  lov1-4, a loss-of-function allele of LOV1, and its flowering time.(A) Transposon (Ds) insertion map of lov1-4 mutants. Open boxes and closed boxes indicate exons and introns of LOV1, respectively. Grey boxes mark a conserved NAC-domain. A transposon is denoted as a reverse triangle. (B) Distribution of the total number of leaves of the original transposon allele of lov1-4 (asterisk) and wild-type Ler plants. (C) Absence of LOV1 expression in lov1-4 mutants grown under long-day conditions. (D) Slight early flowering of lov1-4 mutants under long-day conditions. Bars = 1 cm (E) Flowering time of lov1-1D, 35S::LOV1 and lov1-4 plants under long-day and short-day conditions. Note that changes in the flowering times of these mutants were more prominent under long-day conditions. (F) Expression of the LOV1:HA proteins in two independent 10-day-old pLOV1::LOV1:HA transgenic plants. (G) Distribution of the total number of leaves of lov1-4 plants with or without pLOV1::LOV1:HA transgene grown under long-day conditions. #2-1 and #2-9 are two independent lines of pLOV1::LOV1:HA lov1-4 plants.
