                Figure 3.  Expression pattern of LOV1 in wild-type plants.(A) Time-course expression of LOV1 and AP1 in wild-type plants from day 6 to day 14 grown under long-day conditions. (B) Diurnal expression levels of LOV1 transcripts and LOV1:HA fusion proteins. The expression level of the transcripts and LOV1:HA proteins was normalized against that of UBQ10 and rbcS, respectively. The highest expression level was set to 1.0 for LOV1 transcripts and LOV1:HA proteins. The rbcS is Ponceau S-stained blot used for a loading control. Open and grey boxes indicate subjective days and nights, respectively. (C) Tissue-specific expression pattern of LOV1 in wild-type plants determined by RT-PCR. CL: cauline leaves; I: inflorescences; R: roots; RL: rosette leaves; S: stems (D) Histochemical GUS staining of 10-day-old LOV1::GUS transgenic plants. (E) Nuclear localization of LOV1:GFP protein. 35S::LOV1:GFP was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells and observed by fluorescence microscopy. smGFP was used as a control. DAPI was used to visualize the nucleus. An arrow indicates the nucleus.
