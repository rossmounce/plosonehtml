(B) Diurnal expression levels of <em>LOV1</em> transcripts and LOV1:HA fusion proteins. The expression level of the transcripts and LOV1:HA proteins was normalized against that of <em>UBQ10</em> and rbcS, respectively. The highest expression level was set to 1.0 for <em>LOV1</em> transcripts and LOV1:HA proteins. The rbcS is Ponceau S-stained blot used for a loading control. Open and grey boxes indicate subjective days and nights, respectively. (C) Tissue-specific expression pattern of <em>LOV1</em> in wild-type plants determined by RT-PCR. CL: cauline leaves; I: inflorescences; R: roots; RL: rosette leaves; S: stems (D) Histochemical GUS staining of 10-day-old <em>LOV1::GUS</em> transgenic plants. (E) Nuclear localization of LOV1:GFP protein. <em>35S::LOV1:GFP</em> was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells and observed by fluorescence microscopy. smGFP was used as a control. DAPI was used to visualize the nucleus. An arrow indicates the nucleus.</p>
