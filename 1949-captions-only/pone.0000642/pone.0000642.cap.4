Plants were harvested every 4 h for 48 h. Open and closed boxes indicate days and nights, respectively. (B) Time-course expression of <em>GI</em>, <em>CO</em>, and <em>FT</em> in <em>35S::LOV1</em> plants. Seedlings were harvested at ZT 10. (C) Time-course expression of <em>GI</em>, <em>CO</em>, <em>FT</em>, and <em>AP1</em> in <em>lov1-4</em> mutants. Seedlings were harvested at ZT 10. <em>AP1</em> was used as a molecular marker that indicates initiation of flower development. (D) Circadian expression of <em>CO</em> in <em>35S::LOV1</em> and <em>lov1-4</em> plants. Seedlings were harvested every 4 h for 48 h. <em>GI</em> and <em>UBQ10</em> were used as negative controls.</p>
