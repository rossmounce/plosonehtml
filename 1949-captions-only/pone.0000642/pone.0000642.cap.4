                Figure 4.  Expression patterns of the circadian clock and flowering time genes in wild-type plants and lov1 mutants grown under long-day conditions.(A) Circadian rhythms of CCA1 and LHY expression determined by RT-PCR analysis. Plants were harvested every 4 h for 48 h. Open and closed boxes indicate days and nights, respectively. (B) Time-course expression of GI, CO, and FT in 35S::LOV1 plants. Seedlings were harvested at ZT 10. (C) Time-course expression of GI, CO, FT, and AP1 in lov1-4 mutants. Seedlings were harvested at ZT 10. AP1 was used as a molecular marker that indicates initiation of flower development. (D) Circadian expression of CO in 35S::LOV1 and lov1-4 plants. Seedlings were harvested every 4 h for 48 h. GI and UBQ10 were used as negative controls.
