                Figure 5.  Genetic interaction of LOV1 with genes that act within the photoperiod pathway.(A) Flowering time of the plants with LOV1 gain-of-function alleles and mutants that double-overexpress LOV1 and a flowering time gene under long-day conditions. (B) Flowering time of the plants with LOV1 loss-of-function allele (lov1-4 mutants) and double mutants under long-day conditions. Each error bar denotes the standard deviation.
