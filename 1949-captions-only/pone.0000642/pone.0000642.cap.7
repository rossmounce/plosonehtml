                Figure 7.  Expression analysis of cold response genes in lov1 mutants grown under long-day conditions.(A) Expression patterns of CBF/DREB1 genes in lov1 mutants and wild-type plants. The plants were grown at 23°C for 10 days, and samples were harvested after 3 and 6 h with or without cold treatment (4°C). (B) Time-course expression of cold response genes in 35S::LOV1 and wild-type plants. (C) Time-course expression of cold response genes in lov1-4 and wild-type plants.
