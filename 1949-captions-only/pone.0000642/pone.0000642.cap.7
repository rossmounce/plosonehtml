The plants were grown at 23°C for 10 days, and samples were harvested after 3 and 6 h with or without cold treatment (4°C). (B) Time-course expression of cold response genes in <em>35S::LOV1</em> and wild-type plants. (C) Time-course expression of cold response genes in <em>lov1-4</em> and wild-type plants.</p>
