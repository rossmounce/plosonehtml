                Figure 1.  The transcription network controlled by Crx, Nrl, and Nr2e3.A, Venn diagram summarizing all genes dysregulated under high stringency criteria. A complete list of dysregulated genes is given in Table S2. The identity of all genes at points of intersection (including additional intersections not depicted here) are given in Table S7. B, Summary of rod-specific and cone-specific ISH patterns relative to a hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) stained section of retina. The scleral side of the retina is oriented up in all subsequent images. ONL = outer nuclear layer; INL = inner nuclear layer; GCL = ganglion cell layer. C-F, ISH with the indicated probes on four mutant and two wild-type backgrounds. Size bar (in C) = 100 Âµm G, Summary of transcription factors dysregulated in Crx-/-, Nrl-/-, and/or Nr2e3-/- under high stringency criteria. Green arrows indicate activation and red indicate repression. H and J, ISH with Crx and Prdm1 probes, respectively, on wild-type (CD-1) retinas at the indicated timepoints. J-L, ISH with the indicated probes on four mutant and two wild-type backgrounds. Note that all ISHs were performed on retinas from 6-9 week old animals with the exception of those on Crx-/- which derive from 4-5 week old animals.
