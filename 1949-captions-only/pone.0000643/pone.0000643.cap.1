A complete list of dysregulated genes is given in <a href="#pone.0000643.s006">Table S2</a>. The identity of all genes at points of intersection (including additional intersections not depicted here) are given in <a href="#pone.0000643.s011">Table S7</a>. B, Summary of rod-specific and cone-specific ISH patterns relative to a hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) stained section of retina. The scleral side of the retina is oriented up in all subsequent images. ONL = outer nuclear layer; INL = inner nuclear layer; GCL = ganglion cell layer. C-F, ISH with the indicated probes on four mutant and two wild-type backgrounds. Size bar (in C) = 100 Âµm G, Summary of transcription factors dysregulated in <em>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></em>, <em>Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></em>, and/or <em>Nr2e3<sup>-/-</sup></em> under high stringency criteria. Green arrows indicate activation and red indicate repression. H and J, ISH with <em>Crx</em> and <em>Prdm1</em> probes, respectively, on wild-type (CD-1) retinas at the indicated timepoints. J-L, ISH with the indicated probes on four mutant and two wild-type backgrounds. Note that all ISHs were performed on retinas from 6-9 week old animals with the exception of those on <em>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></em> which derive from 4-5 week old animals.</p>
