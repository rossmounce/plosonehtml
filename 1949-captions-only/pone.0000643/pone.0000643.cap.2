                Figure 2.  Retinal disease genes in the photoreceptor network.This figure is a manually curated list of all retinal disease genes which are known or are likely to have a photoreceptor-enriched expression pattern. Those gene symbols which differ between mouse and human are marked with a single asterisk, and the human equivalents are given here: Cngb1 = CNGB1; Gpr98 = USH2C; Grk1 = RHOK; Gucy2e = GUCY2D; Prom1 = PROML1; Rgs9bp = R9AP; Rp1h = RP1; Ush1g = SANS. ‘Known CRE’ indicates the location of published photoreceptor CREs which have experimental support (references are given in MATERIALS AND METHODS). Annotations in this column such as ‘6.5 Kb 5’’ means the tested CRE contained the first 6.5 Kb upstream of the TSS. Known CREs predicted by our algorithm are highlighted in light green. ‘Predicted CRE(s)’ lists candidate CREs predicted by our algorithm which lie within +/− 15 Kb of the TSS. In some cases, two locations are given which represent that CRE prediction closest to the TSS and that with the highest score. Only one location is given when they are the same. Experimentally tested CREs are highlighted in red. The CREs tested for Crx and Elovl4 lie more than 15 Kb downstream of the TSS. The CRE tested for Tulp1 scores below the cutoff threshold of 200. This CRE was selected for testing during the early phases of this project using an earlier version of PhastCons with which it scored above threshold. A third predicted CRE location is given for Opn1mw which corresponds to the locus control region. ‘CRE strength’ indicates the estimated strength of the indicated CRE as tested by electroporation (see Fig. S2). The last four columns of the table show the wild-type-to-mutant ratios of the averaged microarray scores for the given gene. Dark green = downregulated under high stringency (as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS); light green = downregulated under low stringency; red = upregulated under high stringency; orange = upregulated under low stringency. A dash indicates that the gene was not significantly altered in the given mutant. ‘NA’ indicates that this gene is not represented on the Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 microarray.
