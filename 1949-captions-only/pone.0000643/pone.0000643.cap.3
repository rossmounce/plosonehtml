The height of the bar representing a site indicates the ‘affinity’ of the site as measured as the percentile rank of that site's log odds score relative to the consensus site for that transcription factor = 1 (i.e., 100%ile). ‘CRE score’ indicates the likelihood that a given 500 bp stretch (on which the peak is centered) harbors a photoreceptor CRE (details about scoring are given in <a href="#s4">MATERIALS AND METHODS</a>). Color code: red if score ≥500, dark blue if 500&gt;score ≥200, light blue if score &lt;200. B, Pattern of phylogenetic conservation around <em>Rho</em> CRE as displayed by UCSC genome browser. C, Sections of mouse retina electroporated <em>in vivo</em> at P0 with the indicated constructs and harvested at P14. The <em>Rhodopsin</em> promoter used here derives from cow. The white arrows highlight CAG-eGFP-positive cells in the INL in which DsRed is not expressed. IS = inner segment.</p>
