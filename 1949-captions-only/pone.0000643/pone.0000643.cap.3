                Figure 3.  Computational algorithm to identify photoreceptor cis-regulatory elements.A, Output of computational algorithm for 12 Kb of genomic DNA around the Rho locus. ‘PhastCons’ indicates the degree of phlyogenetic conservation of a given stretch of DNA as determined by the PhastCons algorithm. ‘Conserved Crx sites’ indicates the occurrence of a phylogenetically conserved Crx site. The height of the bar representing a site indicates the ‘affinity’ of the site as measured as the percentile rank of that site's log odds score relative to the consensus site for that transcription factor = 1 (i.e., 100%ile). ‘CRE score’ indicates the likelihood that a given 500 bp stretch (on which the peak is centered) harbors a photoreceptor CRE (details about scoring are given in MATERIALS AND METHODS). Color code: red if score ≥500, dark blue if 500&gt;score ≥200, light blue if score &lt;200. B, Pattern of phylogenetic conservation around Rho CRE as displayed by UCSC genome browser. C, Sections of mouse retina electroporated in vivo at P0 with the indicated constructs and harvested at P14. The Rhodopsin promoter used here derives from cow. The white arrows highlight CAG-eGFP-positive cells in the INL in which DsRed is not expressed. IS = inner segment.
