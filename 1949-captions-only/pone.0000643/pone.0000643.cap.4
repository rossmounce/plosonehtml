The red bar indicates the region of genomic DNA assayed for CRE activity. The bottom panels show flatmount and cross-sectional images of a mouse retina electroporated at P0 with the indicated constructs, cultured as an explant, and harvested at P8. The CAG-eGFP is a ‘loading’ control expressed in all retinal cell types. ‘<em>Rgs9</em>-CRE’ consists of the <em>Rgs9</em> regulatory peak (indicated by the red bar in top panel) fused to DsRed. The cross-sectional image is a composite of images taken in the green and red channels. Size bar = 500 µm for flatmount images and 100 µm for cross-sections B, A control construct containing the indicated region of DNA from the first intron of <em>Rgs9</em> which does not correspond to a predicted regulatory peak. C–E, Additional examples of novel photoreceptor-specific CREs. Note that some annotations of the <em>Rgs9bp</em> locus suggest that the indicated regulatory peak falls within the 3′ UTR of this gene. F–H, CREs around the <em>Crx</em>, <em>Nrl</em>, and <em>Nr2e3</em> loci. The regulatory peak upstream of the TSS in F indicates a previously characterized <em>Crx</em> CRE <a href="#pone.0000643-Furukawa3">[44]</a>. The <em>Crx</em>-CRE depicted in the bottom panels corresponds to the downstream regulatory peak identified in the present study (indicated by the red bar). The <em>Nrl</em>-CRE shown in G was previously characterized <a href="#pone.0000643-Akimoto1">[24]</a> and is included here as a control.</p>
