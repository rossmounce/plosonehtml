                Figure 4.  Novel photoreceptor-specific cis-regulatory elements.A, The top panel shows the output of our computational algorithm for the first intron of Rgs9. The red bar indicates the region of genomic DNA assayed for CRE activity. The bottom panels show flatmount and cross-sectional images of a mouse retina electroporated at P0 with the indicated constructs, cultured as an explant, and harvested at P8. The CAG-eGFP is a ‘loading’ control expressed in all retinal cell types. ‘Rgs9-CRE’ consists of the Rgs9 regulatory peak (indicated by the red bar in top panel) fused to DsRed. The cross-sectional image is a composite of images taken in the green and red channels. Size bar = 500 µm for flatmount images and 100 µm for cross-sections B, A control construct containing the indicated region of DNA from the first intron of Rgs9 which does not correspond to a predicted regulatory peak. C–E, Additional examples of novel photoreceptor-specific CREs. Note that some annotations of the Rgs9bp locus suggest that the indicated regulatory peak falls within the 3′ UTR of this gene. F–H, CREs around the Crx, Nrl, and Nr2e3 loci. The regulatory peak upstream of the TSS in F indicates a previously characterized Crx CRE [44]. The Crx-CRE depicted in the bottom panels corresponds to the downstream regulatory peak identified in the present study (indicated by the red bar). The Nrl-CRE shown in G was previously characterized [24] and is included here as a control.
