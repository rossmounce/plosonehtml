                Figure 1.  Schematic illustrations for initial shapes of S. pistillata branches(A) Experiment 1: setting I, single-tip branches; setting II, initial dichotomous branches; setting III, dichotomous tip branches.
(B) Experiment 2: setting I, single-tip branches; preparative II, pairs of isogeneic branches with tip-to-tip contacts creating structures with two bases each (fused double tips); preparative III, pairs of isogeneic branches with center-to-center contacts, creating shapes with two tips and two bases each (crossed double tips).
