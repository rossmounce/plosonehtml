                Figure 2.  Two-dimensional MDS ordination for all (n = 136) daughter colonies. A and B are factored by the different settings; C and D are factored by genotypes(A) Experiment 1, triangle = setting I, single tip; circle = setting II, initial dichotomous tip; square = setting III, dichotomous tip.
(B) Experiment 2, triangle = l setting I, single tip; circle = setting II, fused double tip; square = setting III, crossed double tip.
(C) Experiment one, triangle = genotype A, tip-down triangle, donor colony B, square = genotype C, diamond = genotype D.
(D) Experiment two, triangle = genotype E; circle = genotype F; square = genotype G.
