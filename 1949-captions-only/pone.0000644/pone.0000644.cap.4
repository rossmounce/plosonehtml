                Figure 4.  ANOVA results of the morphometric parameters distinguishing between the setting groups(A–D) Experiment 1: group 1 = setting I, single-tip branches; group 2 = setting II, initial dichotomous branches and group 3 = setting III, dichotomous tip branches.
(E–F) Experiment 2: group 1 = setting I, single-tip branches; group 2 = preparative II, fused double tips and group 3 = preparative III, crossed double tips.
(A) Tip-born branches (TBB).
(B) Up-growing branches (UGB).
(C) Branches from generation 2 (N2).
(D) Branches from generation 4 (N4).
(E) Up-growing branches (UGB).
(F) Width to height ratio (Le/H).
