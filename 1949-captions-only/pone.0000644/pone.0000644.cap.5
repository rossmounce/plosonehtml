                Figure 5.  Phenotypic plasticity for the tested morphometric parameters (at the branch and the colonial levels) illustrated by one-year ex situ growth of different preparative shapesMP-Morphological parameter; Sâ€“Parameters found significantly different between preparatives (p&lt;0.05); N.S.-Parameters found non-significantly different between preparatives (p&gt;0.05).
