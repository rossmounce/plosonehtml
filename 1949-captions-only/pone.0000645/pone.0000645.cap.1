Grey: bright field images; blue staining: indicates DAPI nuclear staining of schizont stage parasites; red staining shows labeling of peptide specific antibodies by Cy3-conjugated anti-human or anti-mouse IgG specific antibody. Merge picture is an overlay of the blue and red fluorescence channel.</p>
