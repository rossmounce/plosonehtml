                Figure 1.  Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of Pf 3D7 parasites with peptide specific antibodies.Acetone/methanol-fixed schizonts and merozoites were reacted with A: human peptide specific, affinity purified antibodies obtained with peptides 12 and 14 (Table 1) and B: sera from mice immunized with peptide 27 (Table 1). Grey: bright field images; blue staining: indicates DAPI nuclear staining of schizont stage parasites; red staining shows labeling of peptide specific antibodies by Cy3-conjugated anti-human or anti-mouse IgG specific antibody. Merge picture is an overlay of the blue and red fluorescence channel.
