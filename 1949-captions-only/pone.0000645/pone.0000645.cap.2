                Figure 2.  ELISA inhibition assay using anti-human peptide specific antibodies.Binding of peptide specific antibodies to peptides 27 (A) and 45 (B) absorbed on ELISA plates was inhibited by incubating specific antibodies (1–2 µg/ml) with peptides 27 or 45 or shorter fragments of the two, designated as 27/short (NEEIEEIT) or 45/7 short (KEEIKE) (see Material and Methods).
