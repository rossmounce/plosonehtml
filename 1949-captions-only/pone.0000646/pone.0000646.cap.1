                Figure 1.  Schematic illustration of a hypothetical decision boundary relative to the input probability distribution, shown as a color plot.In this case, the decision boundary (red solid line) is shown as extending to infinity, but closed contours are also possible. Variations in contours' shape (as illustrated with a dashed curve) not only shift the position of the decision boundary relatively to the input probability distribution, but also change the overall length of the contour and its infinitesimal arc length element.
