(B) Extended solutions symmetric around <em>y</em> = <em>x</em> line are shown for <em>λ</em>  = 0,−0.25,−0.5,−0.75. (C) Extended solutions symmetric around <em>x</em> = 0 line are shown for <em>λ = </em>0,−0.5,−0.75 [this type turned out to be suboptimal, albeit by a small margin, compared to either A or B, cf. <a href="#pone-0000646-g004">Figure 4</a>].</p>
