                Figure 3.  Optimal solutions for 2D exponential inputs:(A) closed “stretched circle” solutions are shown for λ = −0.3,−0.9,−0.99, numbers correspond to the increasing size of the curved segment throughout this legend. (B) Extended solutions symmetric around y = x line are shown for λ  = 0,−0.25,−0.5,−0.75. (C) Extended solutions symmetric around x = 0 line are shown for λ = 0,−0.5,−0.75 [this type turned out to be suboptimal, albeit by a small margin, compared to either A or B, cf. Figure 4].
