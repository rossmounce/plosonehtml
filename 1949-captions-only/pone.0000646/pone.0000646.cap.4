                Figure 4.  Noise entropy H along various decision boundaries with exponential inputs:“stretched circles” with spiking outside A or inside A′, extended solutions B and C; straight lines parallel to coordinate axes (1) and at ±π/4 angle (2). Solutions (A-C) and (1) satisfy the optimality Eq. (9), but not (2), which is optimal only at a single point at p = 1/2 where it becomes part of family of extended solutions B. Inset shows that switching occurs between solutions A and B.
