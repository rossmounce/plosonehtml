The first and second components in the X space (NMR spectrum) are denoted PC<a href="#pone.0000647-Gatchel1">[1]</a> and PC<a href="#pone.0000647-Robbins1">[2]</a> respectively. PLS score plots (PC<a href="#pone.0000647-Gatchel1">[1]</a>/PC<a href="#pone.0000647-Robbins1">[2]</a>) of pair-wise compared groups show the greater variation within the NMR spectrum according to a priori classification with UHDRS. There is a clear separation between presymptomatic and early HD patients (a), as well as between early and mildly affected HD patients (b). Despite some overlap, presymptomatic mutation carriers can also be distinguished from controls (c).</p>
