                Figure 1.  Partial least square (PLS) analyses of NMR spectra of plasma samples from HD patients with no or little signs of the disease and controls.Three groups of presymptomatic, early and mildly affected HD patients were constituted on the basis of their UHDRS scores, as described in the methods. The first and second components in the X space (NMR spectrum) are denoted PC[1] and PC[2] respectively. PLS score plots (PC[1]/PC[2]) of pair-wise compared groups show the greater variation within the NMR spectrum according to a priori classification with UHDRS. There is a clear separation between presymptomatic and early HD patients (a), as well as between early and mildly affected HD patients (b). Despite some overlap, presymptomatic mutation carriers can also be distinguished from controls (c).
