NMR variables that have the greatest weight (w*<sub>1</sub>; scaled in units of standard deviation), therefore contributing most to the separation between HD groups, are decreased concentrations (&gt;2SD) of metabolites located between 0.85 and 1.0 ppm: valine, leucine and isoleucine. A similar contribution plot was obtained when plasma metabolic profiles from mildly affected HD patients were compared to early HD patients (data not shown).</p>
