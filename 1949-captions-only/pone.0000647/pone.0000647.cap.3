                Figure 3.  The levels of branched chain amino acids are significantly different in HD patients and controls.The concentrations of valine, leucine and isoleucine in plasma were determined by ion exchange chromatography. Comparisons of means (ANOVA) were made between men or women with HD and their respective controls. In men, there was a significant decrease of valine, leucine and isoleucine in the HD group. In women, similar results are observed for leucine and isoleucine.
