Introns are in black, exons in white. Regions cloned to create the double-strand RNA (RNAi) constructs are indicated in green (RNAi-A), blue (RNAi-B), red (RNAi-C), and yellow (RNAi-D) bars. Below each isoform the percent identity and the longest consecutive number of bases of perfect identity to the cloned region are noted for each construct.</p>
