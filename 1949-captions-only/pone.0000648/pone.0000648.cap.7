                Figure 7.  Developmental progression of common altered shoot meristem development phenotype.(a–f): Seedling with RNAi-A construct exhibiting delayed development of true leaves and shoot meristem organization defects resulting in overproliferation of leaves. (g–l): Seedling with control construct with normal morphology. (a and g) 7 days after germination; (b and h) 10 days; (c and i) 14 days; (d and j) 18 days; (e and k) 21 days; (f and l) 25 days. Scale bar 1 mm for a–c, g–h, 2 mm for i, and 1.5 cm for d–f, j–l. These seedlings are of the Shahdara ecotype and are used to illustrate the phenotype; the developmental progression of affected Col-0 seedlings is similar.
