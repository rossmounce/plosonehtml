Least-squares means of caterpillar weight are plotted for each genotype and treatment (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). Top: Basal and induced herbivore responses. For each pair, lighter colors denote basal response, darker colors indicate response after prior herbivore attack. Bottom: Herbivore response after treatment with different concentrations of Me-JA. Control in shades of green; <em>hsp90.2-3</em> in shades of blue. Lighter colors indicate higher Me-JA concentration. Statistical analysis by pairwise Student's t-tests; the response of lines sharing any letter is not statistically different. Separate statistical analysis conducted for top and bottom panels.</p>
