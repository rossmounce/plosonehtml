                Figure 8.  Response to herbivore attack differs in HSP90-reduced lines.Response to herbivory was measured by T. ni caterpillar dry weight. Least-squares means of caterpillar weight are plotted for each genotype and treatment (see Methods). Top: Basal and induced herbivore responses. For each pair, lighter colors denote basal response, darker colors indicate response after prior herbivore attack. Bottom: Herbivore response after treatment with different concentrations of Me-JA. Control in shades of green; hsp90.2-3 in shades of blue. Lighter colors indicate higher Me-JA concentration. Statistical analysis by pairwise Student's t-tests; the response of lines sharing any letter is not statistically different. Separate statistical analysis conducted for top and bottom panels.
