                Figure 1.  Validation of HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer staining and enrichment technology.A CD4+ T cell clone specific for HCV 1808-1817 was stained with the HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer and a control HLA-DR1 tetramer specific for the influenza epitope 307-319 and analysed by flow cytometry as described in the methods (A+B). The HCV clone was derived from patient AR1. Panel C shows staining of the clone diluted serially into PBMC negative for the tetramer at the concentrations shown. Panel D shows a strong correlation between observed pre-enrichment frequency and calculated post-enrichment frequency of HLA-DR1-HCV-tetramer positive CD4+ T cells in all PBMC samples with a frequency of HLA-DR1-HCV-tetramer positive CD4+ T cells of &gt;0.03% (R2 = 0.99, p&lt;0.001). The dotted line is the bisecting line, the solid line represents the trend line of the measured frequencies. Panel E shows the staining of control groups; four healthy and four HIV-infected HLA-DR1 positive individuals, and two healthy individuals and five acute hepatitis C patients without HLA-DR1.
