                Figure 2.  Examples of ex vivo HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer staining from the acute hepatitis C cohort.PBMC from one acute resolving patient (AR1) and one patient with acute hepatitis C and chronic evolution (AC1) were stained with the HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer as described in the methods. For each patient the upper panels represent pre-enrichment stainings and the lower-panels the post-enrichment stainings. The numbers in the upper right corner of the post-enrichment panels are calculated according to the input CD4+ T cell number. The insert on top of the figure shows in detail the calculation method. These figures are plotted over time in both cases in Figure 2 (lower panels).
