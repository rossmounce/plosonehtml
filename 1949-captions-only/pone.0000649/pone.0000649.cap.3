Note the time scale (days) is different in each case. The upper panel shows the ALT (IU/L; open boxes; left hand y axis) and the serum HCV RNA level (closed triangles; right hand y axis). For AR1, AR2 and AC3, at some time points only qualitative assays for HCV-RNA were available which have been marked with a +. Interferon alpha therapy is marked with a bar. In patients AC1 and AC2 time points where the sequence of epitope 1806-1818 was determined are indicated by arrows. The middle panel in each case corresponds to functional CD4+ T cell assays: proliferation in response to NS3/4-antigen (open boxes) and peptide-1806-1818 (open triangles) is shown as stimulation index (SI) on the left hand y axis and HCV-antigen induced interferon-gamma secretion as determined by Elispot (solid diamonds) is shown as spot forming units (SFU) on the right y-axis. The lower panel of each case shows the frequency of HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer positive CD4+ T cells (grey circles). The cut-off for detection was 0.001%. The upper limit of normal for ALT is indicated in panel AR2 as dotted line.</p>
