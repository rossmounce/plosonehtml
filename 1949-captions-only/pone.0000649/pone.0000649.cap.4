The responses to peptides including the sequence 1807-18 are marked with a dark bar. The ten peptides inducing the strongest proliferative response are shown in descending order with regard to the strength of the response. Asterisks indicate time points when the NS3-helicase/NS4 peptide library (covering aa 1207â€“2014) was used; all other assays were performed with a peptide library covering the entire HCV genome. A SI&gt;3.0 was considered significant.</p>
