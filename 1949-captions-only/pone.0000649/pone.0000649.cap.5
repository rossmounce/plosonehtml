The dot plots shown are gated on the DR1 tetramer positive cell population. Representative examples of the staining for AR1, AC1, and AC3 at early and late time points are shown and the percentage of CD38 positive cells is given for each plot. The inserted histograms show CD38 staining on all CD4+ T cells pre-enrichment and have been used to set the quadrants for the DR1 tetramer staining.</p>
