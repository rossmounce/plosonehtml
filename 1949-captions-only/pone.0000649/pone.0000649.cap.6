                Figure 6.  Ex vivo HLA-DR1-HCV-1806-1818 tetramer staining in stable resolved and chronic HCV infection.Tetramer staining was performed in five HLA-DR1-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C in comparison to three HLA-DR1-positive resolved patients. In all PBMC from control groups (five individuals with acute HCV who did not possess HLA-DR1, and four healthy and four HIV1+ individuals with HLA-DR1, respectively), tetramer staining was &lt;0.001%. In all patients and healthy controls, proliferation assays following stimulation with recombinant NS4-antigen were performed. The SI for healthy controls was 1.2±0.48 (mean±SD, range 0.71 to 1.66), for chronic hepatitis C patients 1.7±0.9 (range 0.76 to 3.7), and for recovered patients 22.1±22.1 (range 1.74 to 52.9).
