                Figure 2.  Nucleotide conservation in control region.Arrow denotes the conservation of a putative transcription control, a GC box, which is illustrated by a single elevated peak in control region. Nucleotide Change and G+C content are calculated in a hamming window of size 100. X-axis is the gene length, Y-axis-arbitrary units.
