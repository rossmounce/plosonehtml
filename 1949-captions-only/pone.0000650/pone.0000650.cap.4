                Figure 4.  Relationship between dn/ds ratios, dn, and ds values for Ymf genes.Values for each point are from 10 possible pairwise comparisons of five Tetrahymena species. For simplicity the values from pairwise comparison between T.thermophila and T.pyriformis are shown. They are from average window of size 180 sliding 30 nucleotides per permutation.
