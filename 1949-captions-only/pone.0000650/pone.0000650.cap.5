These ratios are from a codon-based alignment of all five <em>Tetrahymena</em> species. Comparisons are from a maximum window size of 20 amino acids. X-axis indicates types of variation for each codon. Plots A, B, and F are the 5â€² variable region of Ymf 64, 64, and 76 genes. Plots C, D, and E show variable regions throughout Ymf 69, 71, and 74 genes. HS- mutation hot spots, S- saturation of synonymous substitutions, NS- negative selection, AdN- accelerated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions, PS- positive selection.</p>
