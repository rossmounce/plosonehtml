                Figure 6.  dn/ds rate ratio Variation in Ymf genes.Y-axis represents values for dn/ds rate ratios generated by SWAPSC. These ratios are from a codon-based alignment of all five Tetrahymena species. Comparisons are from a maximum window size of 20 amino acids. X-axis indicates types of variation for each codon. Plots G and H show variable regions throughout Ymf 67 and 77 genes. HS- mutation hot spots, S- saturation of synonymous substitutions, NS- negative selection, AdN- accelerated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions, PS- positive selection.
