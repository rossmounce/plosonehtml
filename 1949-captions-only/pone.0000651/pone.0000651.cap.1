(B) <em>In silico</em> LD mapping <em>Pas1</em> using existing mouse SNP and tumor incidence data. (C) Enhanced view of LD mapping between 144.0–146.5 Mb. (D) Physical map of the complex multigenic <em>Pas1</em> locus. The <em>Casc1</em> gene carries a functional polymorphism at codon 60 (N60S) between lung tumor susceptible strains (e.g. A/J, SWR/J, MA/MyJ and 129/J) and resistant strains (e.g. C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ and AKR/J). (E) Lung tumorigenesis of <em>Casc1</em> knockout mice. Treatment of Casc1<sup>ko/ko</sup> mice with urethane produced more than six times as many tumors per mouse than did treatment of Casc1<sup>wt-B6/wt-B6</sup> mice. The horizontal coordinates were plotted using physical distance (Mb). In panel A, the horizontal line indicates lod = 3.3, and tumor multiplicity data were used in the linkage analysis. In panel B and C, the horizontal lines indicate –log(P) = 6.2, and urethane-induced lung adenoma incidence data were used in the analysis <a href="#pone.0000651-Liu1">[4]</a>.</p>
