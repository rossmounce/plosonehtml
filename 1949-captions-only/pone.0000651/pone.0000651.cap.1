                Figure 1.  Integration of genomics and phenomics approaches in mapping complex traits in mice.(A) Pulmonary adenoma susceptibility locus 1 (Pas1) was previously mapped to the distal region of chromosome 6 by linkage analysis in A×B and B×A recombinant inbred mice. (B) In silico LD mapping Pas1 using existing mouse SNP and tumor incidence data. (C) Enhanced view of LD mapping between 144.0–146.5 Mb. (D) Physical map of the complex multigenic Pas1 locus. The Casc1 gene carries a functional polymorphism at codon 60 (N60S) between lung tumor susceptible strains (e.g. A/J, SWR/J, MA/MyJ and 129/J) and resistant strains (e.g. C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ and AKR/J). (E) Lung tumorigenesis of Casc1 knockout mice. Treatment of Casc1ko/ko mice with urethane produced more than six times as many tumors per mouse than did treatment of Casc1wt-B6/wt-B6 mice. The horizontal coordinates were plotted using physical distance (Mb). In panel A, the horizontal line indicates lod = 3.3, and tumor multiplicity data were used in the linkage analysis. In panel B and C, the horizontal lines indicate –log(P) = 6.2, and urethane-induced lung adenoma incidence data were used in the analysis [4].
