                Figure 2.  937 QTLs identified by genome-wide association analysis.(A) Distribution of 937 QTLs on the mouse genome. The scatter plots were drawn for â€“log(P) against the peak of QTLs on the chromosomes. Each square represents an identified QTL. (B) The number of QTLs per trait. (C) Proportion of QTL intervals in Mb.
