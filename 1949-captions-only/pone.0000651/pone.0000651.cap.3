                Figure 3.  Dissection of multiple tightly linked QTLs.(A) Obesity QTLs were mapped to distal mouse hromosome 1 by linkage analysis from cross-breeding experiments [10]. Approximately one LOD interval was plotted against its LOD at the QTL peak. The diamonds indicate QTL peaks. Each peak lists the names of the defined QTL. (B) LD mapping of several obesity-related phenotypes in distal mouse chromosome 1. LD mapping identified two closely linked QTLs on distal chromosome 1. One is located within 153.5–155.5 Mb; another reproduced the previously refined QTL, Bwtq1. The analyzed phenotypes are body weight at the start of testing (8 weeks) (Tordoff3_bw_start), calculated weight of lean tissue (14 weeks) (Tordoff3_lean_wt), body weight after 8 weeks on an atherogenic diet (Naggert1_bw_fat8), total tissue mass after 8 weeks on an atherogenic diet (Naggert1_tissuemass_fat8), weight of lean portion of tissue mass after 8 weeks on an atherogenic diet (Naggert1_leanwt_fat8), bone mineral content after 8 weeks on an atherogenic diet (Naggert1_BMC_fat8), initial body weight (7–9 weeks) (Paigen1_initbw), and final body weight after 8 weeks on an atherogenic diet (Paigen1_finalbw).
