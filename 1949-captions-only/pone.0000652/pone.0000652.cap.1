                Figure 1.  Secondary structure propensity of T40 as predicted by hidden β-propensity method (available at http://opal.umdnj.edu).Propensities for helices (red squares), β-strands (blue squares) and random coil (green squares) are presented numerically using a 0-1 scale, with low values indicating zero to low propensity and high values indicating high propensity to near certainty.
