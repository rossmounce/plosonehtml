(B) Specificity of IDE activity. 16 µM T40 was incubated (37°C, 90 min) with no IDE, with 22 nM IDE or with 2–16 µM insulin, 2–16 µM IgG, 1 and 10 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, or 0.3 and 3 µL methanol. For (A) and (B), digestion products were resolved (10% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE), electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with KD69 (specific for the T40). Marker proteins are indicated. <em>Arrows</em> indicate the positions of T40 monomers and dimers. (C) 60 µM T40 was incubated with or without 50 nM IDE (37°C) and products separated by RP-HPLC (peaks annotated a–h). (D) Positions of IDE initial cleavages (<em>arrows</em>) within T40 (2 min digestion). (E) Identity of the major peptides (italics) and of CSR species in peaks a–h, analyzed by MS. (F) The relative abundance of CSR species was determined with reference to an internal standard on the MS spectra and is displayed as arbitrary units. ‘+’, 1 to 25 arbitrary units; ‘++’, 26 to 100; ‘+++’, 101 to 250; and ‘++++’, &gt;250. Potential precursors of CSR species are italicized and shown in bold. ‘*’ indicates CSR species that were not present after a 2 hour digestion of T40 by IDE.</p>
