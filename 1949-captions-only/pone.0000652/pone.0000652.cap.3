(B) Cleavage map after complete IDE digestion of AChE<sub>586-599</sub>. 63 µM AChE<sub>586-599</sub> was incubated with or without 45 nM IDE (A) or 273 nM IDE (B)(37°C, 30 min) and RP-HPLC peaks analyzed by MS. (C) IDE degrades AChE<sub>586-599</sub> oligomers. AChE<sub>586-599</sub> oligomers (16 µM) cross-linked by photo-induced cross-linking were incubated with or without 16.3 nM IDE (37°C). Digestion products were resolved (16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE), electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with Mab 105A (specific for AChE<sub>586-599</sub> in β-sheet conformation). Marker proteins are indicated.</p>
