                Figure 3.  IDE degrades both monomeric and oligomeric forms of AChE586-599.(A) Positions of IDE initial cleavages (arrows) within AChE586-599. (B) Cleavage map after complete IDE digestion of AChE586-599. 63 µM AChE586-599 was incubated with or without 45 nM IDE (A) or 273 nM IDE (B)(37°C, 30 min) and RP-HPLC peaks analyzed by MS. (C) IDE degrades AChE586-599 oligomers. AChE586-599 oligomers (16 µM) cross-linked by photo-induced cross-linking were incubated with or without 16.3 nM IDE (37°C). Digestion products were resolved (16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE), electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with Mab 105A (specific for AChE586-599 in β-sheet conformation). Marker proteins are indicated.
