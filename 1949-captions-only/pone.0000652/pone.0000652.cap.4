                Figure 4.  NEP preferentially degrades monomeric forms of AChE586-599.(A) 60 µM of either substance P or T40 were incubated with or without 1.2 µM NEP (37°C, 4 hours) and the digestion mixture subjected to RP-HPLC. (B) Positions of NEP initial cleavages (arrows) within AChE586-599. (C) Cleavage map after complete NEP digestion of AChE586-599. 40 µM AChE586-599 was incubated with 772 nM NEP (30 min (B) or 4 hours (C), 37°C) and RP-HPLC peaks analyzed by MS. (D) NEP degrades AChE586-599 oligomers. AChE586-599 oligomers (14.8 µM) cross-linked by photo-induced cross-linking were incubated with or without 285 nM NEP (37°C). Digestion products were analyzed as described in Figure 3C. Arrows indicate two digested AChE586-599 oligomers. (E) T40/IDE products are substrates for NEP. 60 µM T40 was incubated with 50 nM IDE (37°C, 30 min) and products separated by RP-HPLC. Peaks e–f (see Figure. 2C) were lyophilized, incubated with 772 nM NEP (37°C, 2 hours) and subjected to RP-HPLC.
