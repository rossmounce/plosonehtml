(B) Positions of NEP initial cleavages (<em>arrows</em>) within AChE<sub>586-599</sub>. (C) Cleavage map after complete NEP digestion of AChE<sub>586-599</sub>. 40 µM AChE<sub>586-599</sub> was incubated with 772 nM NEP (30 min (B) or 4 hours (C), 37°C) and RP-HPLC peaks analyzed by MS. (D) NEP degrades AChE<sub>586-599</sub> oligomers. AChE<sub>586-599</sub> oligomers (14.8 µM) cross-linked by photo-induced cross-linking were incubated with or without 285 nM NEP (37°C). Digestion products were analyzed as described in <a href="#pone-0000652-g003">Figure 3C</a>. A<em>rrows</em> indicate two digested AChE<sub>586-599</sub> oligomers. (E) T40/IDE products are substrates for NEP. 60 µM T40 was incubated with 50 nM IDE (37°C, 30 min) and products separated by RP-HPLC. Peaks e–f (see <a href="#pone-0000652-g002">Figure. 2C</a>) were lyophilized, incubated with 772 nM NEP (37°C, 2 hours) and subjected to RP-HPLC.</p>
