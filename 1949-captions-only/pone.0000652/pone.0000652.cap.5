T40 CD spectra (250 to 190 nm) before and after addition of IDE (A) and percentage of secondary structures (B). (C) CSR species are surface-active. T40/IDE digest (30 min) was subjected to RP-HPLC. Peaks (a–k, as annotated in the <em>inset</em>) were lyophilized, re-suspended in 200 mM sodium acetate pH 3 and surface tension measured before and after neutralization (1M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH7.2). Surface tension calculations were as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. ‘*’ p&lt;0.05, and ‘**’ p&lt;0.007.</p>
