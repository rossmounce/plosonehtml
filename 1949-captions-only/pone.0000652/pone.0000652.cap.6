Changes in ThT fluorescence were monitored (A and C) with the lag phase of Aβ fibrilization depicted (B and D). ‘*’ p&lt;0.006 (B) and p&lt;0.05 (D). Control experiments showed that there was no carry over of IDE activity in the T40/IDE digest under the sample preparation conditions (RP-HPLC and lyophilizations).</p>
