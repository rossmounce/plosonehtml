                Figure 2.  3D reconstructed images of metaphyseal trabecular bone from a tibia that was subjected to short durations of sinusoidal accelerations (ACC, right panel) and its contralateral control (CTR, left panel) at baseline (top row) and at completion of the 3 wk protocol (bottom row).The greater tissue quantity and quality in the accelerated tibia resulted from an enhanced preservation of tissue, as emphasized in the circled regions, during the 3 wk unloading period.
