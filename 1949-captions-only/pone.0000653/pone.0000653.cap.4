                Figure 4.  Osteocyte sitting in a lacuna within the matrix (left panel).The nucleus is coupled to the membrane by the cytoskeleton. Upon the application of large loads, the matrix strains and distorts the osteocyte (central panel). These large distortions result in the cytoskeleton pulling on the nucleus, and stimulating transcriptional activity. While this can stimulate a biologic response, it does so at risk of damaging the matrix. Upon the application of sinusoidal accelerations, the bone matrix moves forward and back (or up and down). The cell within the lacunae will oscillate out of phase with the matrix and the nucleus will oscillate out of phase with the cell body, causing the cytoskeleton to pull on the nucleus in the absence of matrix distortion (right panel). In this scenario, accelerations can alter biologic activity in the absence of direct loading, with the potential to distort the cell much greater than with direct loading of the calcified matrix.
