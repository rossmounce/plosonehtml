B, Implant p24 for the same groups as in panel A. C, Implant HIV-1 RNA in mice treated with 3TC beginning on day −1, day +1, day +3, and day +7 with respect to inoculation with the indicated HIV-1 strains. D, Implant p24 for the same groups as in panel C. Implants were collected 21 days after inoculation for NL4-3, 14 days for JD, and 42 days for Ba-L. *p≤0.05, compared with untreated mice for 5–7 mice per group.</p>
