Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining HIV-1 RNA (A), p24 (B), Gag-p24<sup>+</sup> thymocytes (C), and MHC-I expression on DP thymocytes (D). Thymocyte protection was assessed by total implant cellularity (E), thymocyte viability (F), percentage of DP thymocytes (G), and CD4/CD8 ratio (H) for 3TC-treated mice versus untreated mice (means±SEM). *p≤0.05, compared with untreated mice for 5–7 mice per group.</p>
