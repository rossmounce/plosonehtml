                Figure 3.  3TC treatment protects HIV-1 JD-infected Thy/Liv implants from thymocyte depletion.Flow cytometric analysis of representative implants stained for CD4 and CD8 obtained 28 days after inoculation with HIV-1 JD shows severe depletion of DP and CD4+ thymocytes in an untreated mouse and nearly complete protection from thymocyte depletion by 3TC treatment (300 mg/kg per day beginning on day +1 after inoculation).
