                Figure 4.  (–)-FTC is more potent than 3TC against HIV-1 NL4-3 in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice.Mice were treated by twice-daily oral gavage with 3TC or (–)-FTC at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg per day beginning on day –1. Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining HIV-1 RNA (A) and p24 (B), and thymocyte protection was assessed by percentage of DP thymocytes (C) (means±SEM). *p≤0.05, compared with untreated mice for the number of mice indicated under each bar.
