                Figure 5.  Efavirenz is more potent than nevirapine against HIV-1 NL4-3 in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice.Mice were treated by twice-daily oral gavage with nevirapine or efavirenz at the indicated dosage levels beginning on day −1. Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining HIV-1 RNA (A) and p24 (B), and thymocyte protection was assessed by percentage of DP thymocytes (C) (means±SEM). *p≤0.05, compared with untreated mice for the number of mice indicated under each bar.
