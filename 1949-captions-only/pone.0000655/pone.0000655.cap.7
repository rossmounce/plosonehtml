                Figure 7.  T-20 causes dose-dependent reductions in viral load in HIV-1 NL4-3 D36G-infected SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice.Mice were treated by twice-daily subcutaneous injection with T-20 at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg per day beginning on day −1. Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining cell-associated HIV-1 RNA and p24. Data are expressed as means±SEM; *p≤0.05 for treated mice versus untreated mice by the Mann-Whitney U test for the number of mice indicated under each bar.
