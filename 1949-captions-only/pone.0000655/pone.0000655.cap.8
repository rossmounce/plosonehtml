                Figure 8.  Multidrug-resistant (MDR) NY index case HIV-1 replicates and depletes thymocytes with kinetics comparable to HIV-1 NL4-3 in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice.Viral replication assessed by determining HIV-1 RNA (A), p24 (B), Gag-p24+ thymocytes (C), and MHC-I expression on DP thymocytes (D). Thymocyte protection was assessed by total implant cellularity (E), thymocyte viability (F), percentage of DP thymocytes (G), and CD4/CD8 ratio (H) for NL4-3 versus MDR NY index case HIV-1-infected mice (means±SEM). *p≤0.05, compared with untreated mice for 7 mice per group.
