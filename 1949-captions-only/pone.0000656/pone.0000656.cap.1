                Figure 1.  Analysis of Canonical Cdk Motif Clustering in Yeast and Mock Proteomes.(A) The number of proteins having a given score decreases as that score increases. Yeast proteins are represented in navy, and mock proteins are represented in magenta. At low score, (i.e. less than ~4), yeast and mock are similarâ€“ the ratio of mock to yeast, shown by black squares, approximates unity (B). However at higher scores (i.e. 5 and above), yeast proteome contains substantially more proteins than mock (A), and the ratio of mock/yeast approaches zero (B). All proteins from the yeast proteome scoring 5 or higher are considered candidate substrates.
