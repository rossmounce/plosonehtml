                Figure 2.  Analysis of kinetic-derived PSSM motif clustering.The number of proteins having a given score decreases as that score increases. Yeast proteins are represented in navy, and mock proteins are represented in magenta. At low score, (I.e. less than ~3.2), yeast and mock are similarâ€“ the ratio of mock to yeast, shown by black squares, approximates unity. (Proteins are grouped in bins 0.4 units wide) However at higher scores (I.e. 4.4 and above), yeast proteome contains substantially more proteins than mock, and the ratio of mock/yeast approaches zero. All proteins from the yeast proteome scoring 4.4or higher are considered candidate substrates. The region between 3.2 and 4.4 is considered a transition region and yeast proteins with these scores are considered borderline candidate substrates
