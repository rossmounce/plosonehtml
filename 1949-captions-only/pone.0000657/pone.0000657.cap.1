                Figure 1.  Tissue distribution of cadherin-9.An RT-PCR analysis of a human tissue RNA panel revealed that, apart from the brain, the strongest cadherin-9 expression can be detected in the kidney. Weaker signals could be found in testes (where cadherin-9 was originally described in mice), adipose tissue, colon and small intestine.
