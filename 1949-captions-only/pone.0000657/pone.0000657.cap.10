                Figure 10.  Model of antigen expression in different fibroblast pools, smooth muscle cells and monocytes in the human kidney.Together with FSP1, α-smooth muscle actin (α sm actin) and CD45, cadherin-9 is a novel cell surface marker, which can be used to differentiate the depicted renal fibroblast subpopulations from other renal cell types such as epithelial and endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes or macrophages.
