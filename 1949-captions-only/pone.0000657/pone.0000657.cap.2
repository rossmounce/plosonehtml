Positive signals were found throughout embryonic development and in the adult kidney. (B) RT-PCR screening of human renal cell lines detected cadherin-9 only in the renal fibroblast line TK 188 which was generated from a fibrotic kidney. Cadherin-9 was neither found in the fibroblast line TK 173 which originates from a normal kidney nor in the renal epithelial cell line TK 163. (C) These results were confirmed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-cadherin-9 antibody. The specificity of the anti-cadherin-9 antiserum was shown by pre-incubation of the antiserum with the peptide which the antibody was raised against (nb = non-blocked; b = blocked with peptide).</p>
