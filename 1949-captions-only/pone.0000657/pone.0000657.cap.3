                Figure 3.  Renal interstitial cells located between tubuli or at the border of glomeruli express cadherin-9.Cadherin-9-positive cells were identified by immunohistochemical staining with the affinity-purified anti-cadherin-9 polyclonal antibody. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Arrows point to some of the cadherin-9 expressing cells. Panel B shows a part of A in a higher magnification. Bars: (A) 50 µm, (B) 20 µm.
