                Figure 4.  Cellular localization and functional involvement in fibroblast cell aggregation.(A) Immunofluorescence staining of cadherin-9 labeled the whole cell surface of TK 188 cells, and not, as initially expected, only cell-cell contacts. The specificity of the staining was shown by blocking with the antigenic peptide. In double staining experiments, the integrin αv-chain which marks focal adhesions showed no co-localization with cadherin-9. Bars, 50 µm. The pictures of the blocking experiment and the double-staining were gamma-corrected (B) To verify the expression on the cell surface, cellular cadherins were digested with trypsin in the presence of EDTA and subjected to Western blotting. After 10 minutes already, no full length cadherin-9 product was detectable, whereas a digestion fragment of approximately 26 kDa appeared. This fragment is most likely the C-terminal end containing the cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane domain and a radically truncated extracellular domain. This fragment is protected from digestion in the absence of Triton X-100 and can be recognized by the antibody. In the presence of Triton X-100 no cadherin-9 signals were visible. The control cells which were not trypsin-treated showed the full length cadherin-9 product. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the interaction of cadherin-9 with β- and γ-catenin. The pictures of the different immunoblots were gamma-corrected. (D) Cadherin-9 was knocked-down in TK 188 cells by siRNA, and the efficiency of the down-regulation after two days of incubation was shown by Western blotting (on the right). The siRNA treated cells were used for an aggregation assay. The diagram summarizes the data collected in four independent experiments, each of them showing similar results. The capacity to form aggregates was significantly diminished (p&lt;0.00001) in cadherin-9 siRNA-treated cells, since these cells showed, after 30 minutes of aggregation, only 25.2% of their initial number of particles, whereas control siRNA-treated cells showed 13.6%. Error bars indicate the error of the mean.
