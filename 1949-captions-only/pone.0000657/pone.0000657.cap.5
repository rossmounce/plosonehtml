                Figure 5.  Localization of cadherin-9-positive cells in comparison to other cadherin expressing epithelial tubular cells.The micrographs show double immunofluorescence staining of a normal human kidney with the cadherin-9 antiserum and monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin (A), Ksp-cadherin (B) and cadherin-6 (C), respectively. E-cadherin and Ksp-cadherin are marker molecules for distal tubules, whereas cadherin-6 is specifically expressed in proximal tubules. However, no preferential distribution of cadherin-9 expressing cells was detected with either proximal or distal tubular epithelial cells, nor any co-localization with the potential interaction partner cadherin-6 was observed. Bars: (A,C) 50 µm; (B) 100 µm.
