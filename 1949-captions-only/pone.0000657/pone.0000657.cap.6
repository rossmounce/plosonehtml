In the Western blot analysis, the signal detected in the TK 188 cell lysate served as a positive control. (C, D) The signals for cadherin-9 expression detected by RT-PCR or Western blot analyses in renal tumor tissue were constantly much weaker compared to the normal kidney tissue adjacent to the tumor which appeared normal in histology. (E) The immunohistochemical staining of RCC sections showed that cadherin-9 marked exclusively the tumor stroma. Bars, 100 Âµm. Pictures of the immunoblots (B,D) were gamma-corrected.</p>
