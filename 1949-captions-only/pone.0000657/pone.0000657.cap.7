                Figure 7.  Expression of cadherin-9 in renal fibrosis.Immunohistochemical staining of kidney sections of three fibrosis patients labeled with the cadherin-9 antiserum are shown. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Cadherin-9-positive cells as well as the total cell number in selected view fields were counted by three independent individuals. Compared to normal kidney sections, a much higher number of cadherin-9 expressing cells could be detected in the fibrotic kidneys. Whereas in normal kidneys only 8.4%±1.8 were positive for cadherin-9 expression, the number of cadherin-9-positive cells in fibrotic kidneys was in the range of 25.7%±7.8 and 42.5%±1.1.
