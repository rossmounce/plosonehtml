Staining of FSP1, however, could be also observed in the cadherin-9 negative glomerulum and in some tubular cells. The inserts in the left panel are enlarged in the right panel. (B) Cadherin-9 is not expressed by endothelial cells, as demonstrated by double immunofluorescence staining with the endothelial cell marker CD31. But cadherin-9 expression partially overlaps with CD45 as well as with α-smooth muscle actin. Cells which express only α-smooth muscle actin or CD45 are marked with an arrowhead, whereas cells which express only cadherin-9 with an arrow. Co-localization of α-smooth muscle actin or CD45 with cadherin-9 are indicated by double arrows. The different magnifications in (A) and (B) are shown by different bars.</p>
