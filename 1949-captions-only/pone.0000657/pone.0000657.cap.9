EMT could be observed by phase contrast microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that without CsA no signals for cadherin-9 and only weak signal for vimentin could be observed. Induction of EMT by CsA led to a strong up-regulation of both vimentin and cadherin-9 expression. In contrast, incubation of TK 163 cells with 3 nM TGF-ß for two days does not lead to an induction of cadherin-9 expression. Bar, 50 µm.</p>
