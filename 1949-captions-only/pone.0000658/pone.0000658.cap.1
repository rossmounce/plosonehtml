                Figure 1.  Expression of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells.mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression of NMMIIA, NMMIIB and NMMIIC was analyzed in different intestinal epithelial cell lines using isoform-specific primers and polyclonal antibodies. NMMIIA and NMMIIC are expresses in all studied epithelial cells lines, whereas protein expression of NMMIIB is abundant in SK-CO15 and Caco-2 cells but is undetectable by Western blotting in T84 colonic epithelial cells.
