                Figure 10.  siRNA-mediated knock-down of NMMIIA inhibits cell contractility triggered by calcium-depletion.Control, NMMIIA, NMMIIB, and NMMIIC-deficient SK-CO15 monolayers were subjected to 1 h calcium depletion, and their overall cell shape was analyzed by F-actin labeling. Calcium depletion causes rapid rounding of control, NMMIIB, and NMMIIC-deficient cells (arrows). In contrast, cell rounding was significantly attenuated in cells monolayers subjected to NMMIIA knock-down. Bar, 20 Âµm.
