All three NMMII isoforms colocalize with occludin at the mature AJC (arrows). Bar, 10 Âµm. (B). NMMIIA, NMMIIB, and NMMIIC were immunoprecipitated from SK-CO15 cell lysates using isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies. Little or no cross-precipitation of the different NMMII isoforms is observed. (C) Detergent solubility of different NMMII isoforms was analyzed using TX-100 fractionation of SK-CO15 cell monolayers. The majority of NMMIIA is Triton-soluble, especially in the presence of 1 mM ATP, whereas significant Triton-insoluble fraction is characteristics to NMMIIB and NMMIIC.</p>
