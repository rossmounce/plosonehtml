                Figure 3.  Downregulation of the NMMIIA expression alters epithelial cell shape and attenuates development of the paracellular barrier.(A) Western blots of SK-CO15 cell lysates prepared 3 days after transfection show selective downregulation of protein expression of NMMIIA. NMMIIB, and NMMIIC by two different siRNA duplexes, each specific for the NMMII isoform. (B) siRNA-mediated knock-down of NMMIIA but not NMMIIB or NMMIIC causes dramatic changes from an orthogonal epithelial to a protrusive fibroblast-like shape in low-density colonies of SK-CO15 cells. (C) siRNA -mediated knock-down of NMMIIA but not NMMIIB or NMMIIC significantly attenuates the increase in TEER in confluent SK-CO15 cell monolayers when compared to the control (cyclophilin) siRNA-transfected cells (*p&lt;0.05; n = 4).
