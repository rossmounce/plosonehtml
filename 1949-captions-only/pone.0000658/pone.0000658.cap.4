                Figure 4.  Downregulation of the NMMIIA expression impedes reformation of initial adherens-like junctions.SK-CO15 cells were transfected with either control (cyclophilin) or NMMII isoform specific siRNAs and on day 3 post-transfection were subjected to overnight calcium depletion in order to disrupt cell-cell adhesion. Reformation of initial adherens-like junctions was triggered by transferring cells for 1 h into the HCM. Control cells show rapid accumulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin (red) in areas of cell-cell contacts (arrows). In contrast, the majority of E-cadherin remains in the cytosol and β-catenin localizes in the nuclei in NMMIIA-depleted cells (arrowheads). Bar, 10 µm.
