Reformation of initial adherens-like junctions was triggered by transferring cells for 1 h into the HCM. Control cells show rapid accumulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin (red) in areas of cell-cell contacts (arrows). In contrast, the majority of E-cadherin remains in the cytosol and β-catenin localizes in the nuclei in NMMIIA-depleted cells (arrowheads). Bar, 10 µm.</p>
