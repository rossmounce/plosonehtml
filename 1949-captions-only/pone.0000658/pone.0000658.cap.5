                Figure 5.  siRNA-mediated knock-down of either NMMIIB or NMMIIC has no effect on reformation of initial adherens-like junctions.Control, NMMIIB or NMMIIC siRNA-transfected SK-CO15 monolayers were subjected to overnight calcium depletion to disrupt cell-cell adhesion. Reformation of the initial adherens-like junctions was triggered by transferring cells for 1 h into the HCM. Similarly to control cells, NMMIIB and NMMIIC knock-down rapidly translocate E-cadherin (red) to areas of cell-cell contacts (arrows). Bar, 10 Âµm.
