Reassembly of TJs in control and NMMIIA-deficient cells was investigated after 5 h of calcium repletion by monitoring the formation of characteristic ‘chicken wire’ labeling pattern of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 (red). Control SK-CO15 cell monolayers show almost complete restoration of normal localization of occludin and ZO-1 at TJs (arrows). In contrast, occludin and ZO-1 labeling demonstrates abnormal discontinuous pattern at TJs in NMMIIA-deficient cells (arrowheads). Bar, 10 µm.</p>
