                Figure 7.  Downregulation of either NMMIIB or NMMIIC has no effect on reformation of epithelial TJs.Control, NMMIIB or NMMIIC siRNA-transfected SK-CO15 monolayers were subjected to overnight calcium depletion to disrupt cell-cell adhesion. Reformation of TJs was triggered by transferring cells for 5 h into the HCM. Similarly to control cells, NMMIIB and NMMIIC-deficient cell monolayers rapidly restore normal junctional labeling pattern for ZO-1 (arrows). Bar, 10 Âµm.
