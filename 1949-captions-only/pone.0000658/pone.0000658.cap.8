Organization of their actin filaments was visualized using fluorescently labeled phalloidin. At the early time of calcium repletion, prominent radial F-actin cables can be seen in lamellipodia of spreading/contacting control cells (A, arrows). At a later time, control cells show circumferential apical F-actin bundles (B, arrowheads). Neither structure is formed in NMMIIA-deficient cells which show diffuse (A) or abnormally aggregated (B, stars) F-actin. Bar, 10 Âµm.</p>
