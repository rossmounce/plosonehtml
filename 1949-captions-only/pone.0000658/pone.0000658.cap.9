                Figure 9.  siRNA-mediated knock-down of NMMIIA selectively attenuates disassembly of the AJC in calcium-depleted cells.Control, NMMIIA, NMMIIB, and NMMIIC-deficient SK-CO15 monolayers were incubated for 1 h in the LCM-EGTA, and the integrity of their AJC was analyzed by immunolabeling for occludin (red). Calcium depletion causes rapid disruption of the AJC and accumulation of occludin in cytosolic ring-like structures in control, NMMIIB and NMMIIC-deficient cells (arrows). In contrast, the majority of occludin-labeled TJs remained intact in cells monolayers subjected to NMMIIA knock-down (arrowheads). Bar, 20 Âµm.
