Calcium depletion causes rapid disruption of the AJC and accumulation of occludin in cytosolic ring-like structures in control, NMMIIB and NMMIIC-deficient cells (arrows). In contrast, the majority of occludin-labeled TJs remained intact in cells monolayers subjected to NMMIIA knock-down (arrowheads). Bar, 20 Âµm.</p>
