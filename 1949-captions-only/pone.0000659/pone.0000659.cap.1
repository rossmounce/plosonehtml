                Figure 1.  Map of the FNP ATCC 10953 genome.The inner circle (orange) shows the percent GC calculated using a sliding window of 5 kb. The triangles in the next circle show the location and directionality of tRNAs (red) and ncRNAs (blue). The next tract shows the coordinate scale; this is surrounded by the ORFs, on both strands. ORFs are colored by category, as follows: tan, cell processes; purple, cell structure; red; DNA replication and recombination; blue, general metabolism; green, regulation; yellow, transcription; orange, translation, cyan, transport; fuchsia, virulence; and black, unknown. The IStrons are indicated by the fuchsia arrowheads on the outside circle; the intact IStron is indicated with the star. Plasmid (green) and phage locations (cyan) also appear on the outside circle.
