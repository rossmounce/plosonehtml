                Figure 2.  Plasmid pFN3.a) Map of plasmid pFN3. Replication and recombination ORFs are shown in blue and hypotheticals are colored green. b) Alignments of fusobacterial relaxase protein domains to mobilization class consensus motifs [66]. Consensus sequence abbreviations: uppercase letters, conserved; lowercase letters, present in 50% of sites; U or u, bulky hydrophobic residues (I, L, V, M, F, Y and W); -, no consensus at this site; Y, putative active site tyrosine residue. Asterisks (*) above residues indicate identity with consensus sequence. Alignments were performed using Clustal W [102] and then adjusted to best fit the consensus.
