Replication and recombination ORFs are shown in blue and hypotheticals are colored green. b) Alignments of fusobacterial relaxase protein domains to mobilization class consensus motifs <a href="#pone.0000659-Ilyina1">[66]</a>. Consensus sequence abbreviations: uppercase letters, conserved; lowercase letters, present in 50% of sites; U or u, bulky hydrophobic residues (I, L, V, M, F, Y and W); -, no consensus at this site; <span class="underline">Y</span>, putative active site tyrosine residue. Asterisks (*) above residues indicate identity with consensus sequence. Alignments were performed using Clustal W <a href="#pone.0000659-Thompson1">[102]</a> and then adjusted to best fit the consensus.</p>
