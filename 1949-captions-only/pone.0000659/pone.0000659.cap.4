                Figure 4.  Whole genome display of FNP illustrating clustering of genes without hits in FNN or FNV.Yellow boxes represent FNP genes with either FNN or FNV as top BLASTN hits (1835/2462 or 75%) and blue boxes represent genes whose top BLASTN hits are to genes from other organisms (627/2462 or 25%).
