(B) Immuno-fluorescence confocal staining for SMAR1 in NGE, FAB, IDC G I, II and III breast tumor sample using rabbit polyclonal α-SMAR1 probed with FITC conjugated α-rabbit secondary antibody shown as green, counterstained with propidium iodide to stain nucleus as red. (C) SMAR1 and Cyclin D1 expression using rabbit α-SMAR1 and rabbit α-Cyclin D1 probed with FITC conjugated α-rabbit secondary antibody shown as green, counterstained with propidium iodide to stain nucleus as red in Lactating Fibro-adenoma benign sample. (D) Expression analysis of SMAR1, Cyclin D1 and p53 in FAB and IDC G-III breast cancer sample by triple immuno-staining using rabbit α-SMAR1, mouse α-Cyclin D1 and goat α-p53 probed with donkey α-rabbit FITC, donkey α-mouse Cy3 and donkey α-goat Cy5 (Sky blue) respectively. Nucleus was counterstained by DAPI. (E) Representative Western blot showing the relative expression of SMAR1, Cyclin D1 and p53 in total protein lysate from fibro-adenoma (FAB) and IDC grade III tumor tissue sample. (F) Mean fluorescence intensity of SMAR1 staining in thirty FAB, ten IDC G-I, ten IDC-G II and ten IDC-GIII breast cancer samples were measured. Five different fields were taken for each sample and ±SD is indicated.</p>
