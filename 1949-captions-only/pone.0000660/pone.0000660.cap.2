(B) SMAR1 promoter luciferase assay in 293 cells showing promoter activity of 1.5 kb or 0.95 kb sense promoter constructs (lanes 2 and 3) respectively compared to the pGL3 vector control (lane 1). In addition 1.5 and 0.95 kb antisense SMAR1 promoter constructs were used as negative control (lanes 4 and 5). (C) SMAR1 promoter luciferase assay in 293 (lane 2), MCF7 (lane 3), H1299 (lane 4), Hct116 (lane 5), MDA-MB-231 (lane 6) and MDA-MB-468 (lane 7) compared to pGL3 basic vector control (lane 1). Error bars indicate standard deviation. Results shown are representative of at least five independent experiments.</p>
