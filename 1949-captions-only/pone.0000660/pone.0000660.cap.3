                Figure 3.  SMAR1 promoter activity is induced by Doxorubicin.(A and B) SMAR1 promoter luciferase activity upon 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 µM Doxorubicin (lane 3–6) compared to untreated cells (lane 2) and pGL3 basic vector control (lane 1) in 293 and MCF7 cell lines respectively. Relative Luciferase units are represented and error bars indicate standard deviation. Data is representative of three independent, simultaneously performed experiments. (C) Real time PCR analysis for SMAR1 in 0.5 µM Doxorubicin treated 293 and MCF7 cells respectively. Relative expression of SMAR1 transcript is shown and error bars indicate standard deviation. Data is representative of at least five independent experiments. (D and E) Immuno-fluorescence confocal analysis and Western blot analysis for SMAR1 in 0.5 µM Doxorubicin treated 293 and MCF7 cells. Scale bar represents 10 µm.
