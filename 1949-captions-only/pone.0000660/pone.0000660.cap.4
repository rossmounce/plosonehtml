Relative Luciferase units are represented along with error bars indicating standard deviation. Data is representative of three independent, simultaneously performed experiments. (C) Schematic representation of p53 binding site on SMAR1 promoter, sequence of WT p53 oligo (Probe III), deletion mutant oligo (Probe IV) and alignment of Probe III with p53 consensus binding site. Mismatches are given as bold. (D) EMSA using H1299 and 293 nuclear lysate showing p53 dependent complex-I only with probe I and not with Probe II (<em>first and second panel</em>). EMSA using 2.5, 5.0 and 10 µg of nuclear lysate from of 293 cells with probe-III and Probe IV (<em>third and fourth panel</em>). Complex-II came as non-specific signal. (E and F) Western blot analysis for total, phospho-serine-15 p53 and acetylated p53 K373/382 upon 0.5 µM Doxorubicin treatment from 0–24 hr in 293 cells. (G) Western blot analysis for acetylated p53 K373/382 upon increasing amount of pBK-CMV-SMAR1 transfection as compared to vector control in 293 cells. Relative fold change in expression is calculated by densitometric analysis normalized to the β-actin and are mentioned below respective panel. (H) Recruitment of p53 on the 200 bp region (Probe I) of SMAR1 promoter. Sonicated DNA fragments were pulled with α-p53 antibody and PCR for the 200 bp region was performed in the pulled DNA fragments. Lane 1 is the input PCR, lane 2 is the isotype (IgG) control and lane 3 is α-p53 pulled chromatin sample. (I) Recruitment of acetylated p53 and acetylated Histone-3 to the 200 bp region (Probe I) of SMAR1 promoter in the respective panels with and without Doxorubicin treatment. Input represent total sonicated genomic DNA, Isotype represents IgG control and Immune represents the pulled chromatin fraction by α-acetylated p53 and α-acetylated Histone-3 antibodies respectively.</p>
