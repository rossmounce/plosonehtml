                Figure 6.  SMAR1 inhibits migration and invasion.(A and B) Two chamber migration and Matrigel invasion assay in MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells respectively. C refers to control cells and S refers to SMAR1 transfected cells. (C) Two-chamber invasion assay using SMAR1 stable and control B16F1 cells. Total number of cells were counted in five different fields and given as per 100 µm2 area. Error bars represent standard deviation and data is representative of three independent assays. (D) Time-Lapse image at the end of 10 hr in a wound-healing assay in control B16F1 cells. Few representative tracks are superimposed above the cells to show their movement during wound healing. The left panel of the image shows a selection of tracks of cell movement corresponding to the distance moved by the cells between 4th hr and 10th hr of time-lapse imaging. Bar 50 µΜ. (E and F) represent time-lapse images and the selection of the tracks for B16F1 cells stably transfected with SMAR1 and siRNA to SMAR1 respectively, during a wound-healing assay. The description of the image and the time points are similar to that of the control cells in (E). (G) Rate of migration of cells during the wound healing analyzed from the time-lapse microscopy of B16F1 control indicated as C, SMAR1 stable indicated as S and siRNA treated cells indicated as Si. Migration rate of at least 45 cells for each samples from five different fields were calculated. Error bars represent standard deviation and data is representative of three independent experiments.
