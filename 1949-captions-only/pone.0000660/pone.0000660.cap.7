                Figure 7.  SMAR1 inhibits metastases in-vivo.(A) Quantification of the hepatic and splenic colonization obtained with SMAR1 stable indicated as S and B16F1 control cells indicated as C, 24 days post tail vein injection into nu/nu mice. Six nu/nu mice per sample were used for tail vein injection. Average number of colonies per animal as observed in serial H&amp;E sections of liver and spleen at a distance of 150 µM from each other are represented along with ±SD of triplicate determinants. The assays were performed in triplicates. (B) Representative H&amp;E staining showing hepatic and splenic colonization of control and SMAR1 stable B16F1. The arrows in (B) indicate the colonies of control B16F1 cells in liver and spleen. Images were taken at 20X magnification.
