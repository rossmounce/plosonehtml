(B) Western blot analysis for SMAR1, TGFβ-R1, phospho-smad2, Smad 4, Smad7 and CUTL1 in siRNA treated and SMAR1 transfected MCF7 cells compared to control cells. (C) Real time PCR for SMAR1 in MCF7 cells transfected with SMAR1 and in siRNA treated cells compared to control cells. Fold change are represented with ±SD of three independent experiments. (D) Immuno-flourescence confocal analysis for Vinculin and JAM2 in SMAR1 stable clone in B16F1 and control cells. (E) Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin staining in MCF7 cells treated with Doxorubicin (0.5 µM) and siRNA for SMAR1 (100 nM) for 48 hr. (F) Real time PCR analysis for SMAR1 in MCF7 treated with human recombinant TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) for 0–12 hr. Relative expression of SMAR1 is shown with ±SD of three independent experiments. (G) Immuno-fluorescence confocal analysis for secreted TGFβ1 in human benign and malignant breast cancer tissue sample.</p>
