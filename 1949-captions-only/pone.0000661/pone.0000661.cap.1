                Figure 1.  Levels of the principal cuticular hydrocarbons in flies of various genotypes.Data shown represent the mean (Â±sem) for absolute amount of the principal hydrocarbons detected on the cuticle of 5-day-old flies. 7-T = Z-7-tricosene; 7-P = Z-7-pentacosene; 7-11 HD = Z-Z-7,11-heptacosadiene; 7-11 ND = Z-Z-7,11-nonacosadiene. The genotypes shown correspond to the target flies tested either with a WT male or with a Gr66a-Gal4/WT male (see Fig. 2A). WT = Canton-S strain.
