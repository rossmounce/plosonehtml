Tests always involved a pair of 5-day-old flies: an intact tester male and a decapitated target fly. (A) CIs toward decapitated target flies of four genotypes: WT females and males, Tai and <em>desat1</em> males. The relatively high homosexual CI shown by WT males toward sibling males can be imputed to the elimination of inhibitory visual and acoustic signals that are emitted by intact males under white light <a href="#pone.0000661-Ferveur3">[16]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000661-Boll1">[17]</a>. The principal cuticular hydrocarbons of these flies are shown on <a href="#pone-0000661-g001">Fig. 1</a>. (B) All tester males courted target <em>desat1</em> mutant males covered with different doses of synthetic 7-T. The doses shown—0.5 µg, 1.5 µg and 2 µg—respectively correspond to 4, 12 and 16 mM 7-T. “0” corresponds to the solvent (pentane) used to dissolve 7-T. A similar amount of solvent was used for all tests (0.8 µl). All data were Arcsin transformed and tested using two-factors ANOVA and PLSD Fisher test. For each data set, differences were tested between subjects, between objects and for the interaction between factors: for A, <em>p</em> = 0.004; 0.001; 0.863, respectively; for B, <em>p</em> = 0.002; 0.001; 0.098, respectively. Significant difference (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) for each set of data are indicated by letters above each bar (same letters = no difference); n = 25–30.</p>
