The stimulus was contained in a glass microelectrode capping the tip of the sensillum; caffeine and 7-T were dissolved in mineral oil, sucrose and salts were dissolved in water. Recordings were obtained from three types of labellar sensilla (l-, i- and s-type) determined according to both their location and shape <a href="#pone.0000661-Shanbhag1">[21]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000661-Hiroi1">[23]</a> in wild-type Canton-S males. So far, we were unable to use this method to record from sensilla on the fore-tarsus, because of the relative hardness of the leg cuticle and the slender form of this appendage. (B) In i-type sensilla, one cell responded to 10<sup>−8</sup>M 7-T, whereas the second cell responded to 0.2 M NaCl. The shaded bar represents the duration of the stimulation (2 sec). Elicited spikes were separated according to spike height (amplitude of “class 0” and “class 1” were 0.3–0.5 mV and 0.1–0.2 mV, respectively); see left side of panel; n = 20 flies. (C) Conversely, l-type sensilla responded normally to NaCl, sucrose, KCl but not to 10<sup>−8</sup>M 7-T. Recording were made in similar conditions as described for i-type sensilla; n = 32 flies. (D) 7-T responsive sensilla were mapped on the labial palp with tungsten electrode recordings. Both i- and s-types-but no l-type—sensilla responded to stimulation with 7-T (a sensillum was considered as responsive if it showed at least one response to 7-T among 2-5 trials). Anterior is up, dorsal is right. GRN = gustatory receptor neuron; MR = mechanoreceptor neuron. (E) In a s-type sensillum (S2), the L2 cell showed a dose-dependent increased activity to 7-T (between 10<sup>−12</sup> and 10<sup>−8</sup>M) while the L1 cells were not activated. Vertical axis: total number of spikes during 2 sec stimulation. Significantly increased activity of the L2 cell is indicated (a–b: <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, a–c: <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; n = 4–10).</p>
