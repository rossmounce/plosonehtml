Below: in the same sensillum, caffeine excited the L2 cell, while 10<sup>−8</sup>M 7-T elicited a single class of spikes with an amplitude equivalent to those from the L2 cell (black spikes shown on the left = 0.1–0.2 mV). Bottom: a mixture of caffeine and 7-T (with similar concentrations as above) elicits high levels of activity in a single class of spikes. This indicates that 7-T activates the L2 cell but not the L1 cell. Recordings are shown for 4 sec and the stimulus application lasted for 2 sec. n = 10 (obtained with 5 male flies). (B) Caffeine and 7-T show cross-adaptation. Neuronal responses to caffeine were reduced following pre-stimulation with 7-T, supporting the hypothesis that 7-T and caffeine are detected by the same taste neuron. This effect was highly significant two minutes after pre-stimulation with 7-T (**: <em>p</em> = 0.0016; two tailed paired t-test). In contrast, the response to sucrose remained unaffected by pre-stimulation with 7-T. The response ratio was calculated from the number of spikes induced by a given substance, before and after prestimulation. The filled bar represents the response of the L2 cell to caffeine; the empty bar represents the response of the L1 cell to sucrose. The numbers represent the number of stimulated sensilla (each recording was made with a different fly).</p>
