                Figure 5.  7-T and of bitter molecules dose-dependently inhibit male courtship.The intensity of courtship (CI) was measured in tester WT males (empty circles) and in Gr66a-Gal4/WT males (filled circles) paired with decapitated desat1 target males covered either with pure 7-T or with one of the three bitter molecules—caffeine, quinine or berberine—as indicated below the curves. Each chemical to be tested was diluted in the appropriate solvent at a concentration adjusted to standardize the volume of solvent deposited on each object fly (see Material and methods). The solvents used here had no effect on male CI. The frequency of inhibition corresponds to the number of males with CI&lt;44.1 (observed in the control situation between two WT males). For example, 50% inhibition indicates that 50% of the tester males showed a CI&lt;44.1. n = 20–30.
