Each chemical to be tested was diluted in the appropriate solvent at a concentration adjusted to standardize the volume of solvent deposited on each object fly (see <a href="#s4">Material and methods</a>). The solvents used here had no effect on male CI. The frequency of inhibition corresponds to the number of males with CI&lt;44.1 (observed in the control situation between two WT males). For example, 50% inhibition indicates that 50% of the tester males showed a CI&lt;44.1. n = 20–30.</p>
