The test solution either consisted of 10<sup>−8</sup>M 7-T, or 0.1M caffeine (both dissolved in mineral oil), or mineral oil (tested only in males). Significant differences in PER between the two stimulation conditions were estimated for each treatment and sex by Chi2 with Yates' correction (*** : <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 ; * : <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). Each data set was obtained from 6–7 series of experiments with 70–90 flies except for caffeine (n = 22–30).</p>
