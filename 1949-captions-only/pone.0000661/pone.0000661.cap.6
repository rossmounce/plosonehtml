                Figure 6.  7-T and caffeine both inhibit the proboscis extension reflex (PER) of male and female flies.Data indicate the PER frequency in male and female flies either unilaterally stimulated with 0.1M sucrose (empty bars), or bilaterally stimulated with 0.1M sucrose on one side and a test solution on the other side (filled bars). The test solution either consisted of 10−8M 7-T, or 0.1M caffeine (both dissolved in mineral oil), or mineral oil (tested only in males). Significant differences in PER between the two stimulation conditions were estimated for each treatment and sex by Chi2 with Yates' correction (*** : p&lt;0.001 ; * : p&lt;0.05). Each data set was obtained from 6–7 series of experiments with 70–90 flies except for caffeine (n = 22–30).
