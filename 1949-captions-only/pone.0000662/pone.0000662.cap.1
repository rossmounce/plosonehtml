                Figure 1.  Colitis severity and inflammatory responses in TLR2-/-, TLR4-/-, and TLR2/4-/- mice, as compared to wt controls.(A) Severity of colitis in DSS-treated animals. Clinical outcome of colitis was recorded in wt mice (WT, n = 10) and in mice lacking TLR2 (TLR2-/-, n = 10), TLR4 (TLR4-/-, n = 12), or both (TLR2/4-/-, n = 11). Clinical parameters of colitis were monitored daily (see methods). The data sets from two independent experiments were pooled. Total colitis scores were analyzed at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days.
(B) IFN-gamma concentrations in supernatants of colonic MLN cultures from wt and TLR-deficient animals. Supernatants from MLN cultures of wt mice (WT, black bars, n = 3), and animals lacking TLR2 (TLR2-/-, n = 4), TLR4 (TLR4-/-, n = 5), or both (TLR2/4-/-, n = 4) with colitis were analyzed at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days.
(A/B) Mean values, standard deviations and significance levels (as compared to the wt animals) determined by Student's t-test are indicated (***, P&lt;0.001).
