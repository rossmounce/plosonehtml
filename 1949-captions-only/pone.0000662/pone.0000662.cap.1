Clinical outcome of colitis was recorded in wt mice (WT, n = 10) and in mice lacking TLR2 (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>, n = 10), TLR4 (TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, n = 12), or both (TLR2/4<sup>-/-</sup>, n = 11). Clinical parameters of colitis were monitored daily (see methods). The data sets from two independent experiments were pooled. Total colitis scores were analyzed at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days.</p>
