<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p2"></a><p>(<strong>A</strong>) Results from gene library analysis. Complete 16S rRNA genes were amplified from total luminal colon content DNA isolated from wt mice (WT, n = 3), and from mice (n = 3 each group) lacking TLR2 (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>), TLR4 (TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>), or both (TLR2/4<sup>-/-</sup>). The amplicons were cloned and sequenced as described in the Methods section. Bars represent percentage amounts of gut bacterial groups indicated on the Y-axis.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p3"></a><p>(<strong>B</strong>) Results from DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified total bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments. Each lane shows DGGE profiles of the bacterial flora from the colon of healthy wt mice, and animals lacking TLR2 (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>), TLR4 (TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>), or both (TLR2/4<sup>-/-</sup>). Mice of identical age (three months) originated from two different animal facilities (as indicated above the lanes). DNA bands, which were absent or weak in DGGE profiles from TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> and TLR2/4<sup>-/-</sup> animals are marked by grey arrows. Bacterial species identified by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments in the corresponding bands are indicated on the left. Total numbers of DGGE bands in the profile from wt animals were counted and set to 100% in the reference pattern (RP). Presence and absence of bands in profiles from the respective TLR-deficient animals was recorded and similarity values were calculated and expressed as % similarity to the wt RP. The DGGE profiles are representative for at least three mice per group and experiment. Results were reproduced in two independent experiments.</p>
