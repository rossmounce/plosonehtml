Results are shown for C57BL/10 wt mice without DSS-treatment or at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days (as indicated above the lanes). Bacterial species were identified by comparative sequence analyses of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from DNA eluted from respective DNA bands. The DGGE profiles are representative for at least three mice per group and experiment.</p>

DGGE profiles of luminal intestinal bacteria from wt and TLR2/4<sup>-/-</sup> mice were generated by PCR-based analysis of total DNA from colon contents of mice with or without colitis at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days (as indicated). Bacterial species were identified by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from DNA eluted from respective DNA bands. The DGGE profiles are representative for at least three mice per group and experiment.</p>
