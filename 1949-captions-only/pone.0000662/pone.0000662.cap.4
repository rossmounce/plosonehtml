                Figure 4.  Molecular analysis of predominant bacterial communities in the colon of healthy and diseased mice.(A) DGGE profiles of the colon flora in healthy and diseased wt mice. Results are shown for C57BL/10 wt mice without DSS-treatment or at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days (as indicated above the lanes). Bacterial species were identified by comparative sequence analyses of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from DNA eluted from respective DNA bands. The DGGE profiles are representative for at least three mice per group and experiment.
(B) DGGE profiles of the colon flora in healthy and diseased TLR2/4-/- mice. DGGE profiles of luminal intestinal bacteria from wt and TLR2/4-/- mice were generated by PCR-based analysis of total DNA from colon contents of mice with or without colitis at day eight after DSS-treatment for seven days (as indicated). Bacterial species were identified by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from DNA eluted from respective DNA bands. The DGGE profiles are representative for at least three mice per group and experiment.
(A/B) Primers GC968F and R1378 (Heimesaat et al., 2006) were used for amplification. Results were reproduced in at least two independent experiments.
