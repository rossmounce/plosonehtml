                Figure 2.  Viability of printed E. coli.A timed progression of phase contrast microscopy images shows cells printed in a single droplet growing over 3 hours at 30Â°C. The corresponding fluorescence images show that all the cells in this droplet are viable. The overall viability was greater than 98.5% (see text).
