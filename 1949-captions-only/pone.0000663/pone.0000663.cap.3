                Figure 3.  Poisson distribution of cell number per droplet and drop volume determination.(A) The distribution of cells in the individual droplets are depicted for four different densities. Red curves are theoretical Poisson distributions matched to the mean number of cells per droplet. The measured means were used to determine the drop volume (see text). (B) The average number of cells per droplet N, versus optical density, OD600. The curve fit is a linear least squares fit to the equation in the box. R2 is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient which is a measure of linearity of the data. The calibration with flow cytometry was done at OD600 = 0.71 (black arrow).
