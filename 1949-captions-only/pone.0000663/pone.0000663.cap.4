                Figure 4.  Positional distribution of cells within printed droplets.Insets (B), (C), &amp; (D): Fluorescent images of droplets containing fluorescein and fluorescent bacteria, printed onto glass. (D) A typical droplet and with it a nearby satellite droplet (arrow). The satellite droplets give rise to a secondary peak in the radial distribution (A). The long photo exposure in (B) is used to clearly determine the outline of the droplet relative to the position of cells as seen at a short exposure (C).
