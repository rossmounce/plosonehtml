                Figure 3.  Molecular modeling of IQ-tag binding to benzindolium fluorochrome.A. Binding of IQSPHFF phage to BSA-conjugated fluorochromes via ELISA. B. Ï€-stacking between the phenylalanines of the peptide and the benzidolium subunit of GH680 C. SPH amino acids extend over the linker of GH680 to the opposite face of the fluorochrome D. Interaction of the hydrophobic isoleucine residue and the polymethine linker of the fluorochrome.
