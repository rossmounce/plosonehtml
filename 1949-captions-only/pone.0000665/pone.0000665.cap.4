Representative sigmoidal dose response curve of IQ-tag binding to the benzindolium fluorochrome (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.53±0.12 <em>SD</em>). <em>Bars, SEM</em>. B. Immunodetection of GH680 on a glass slide via IQ-tag phage and anti-M13. Integrated pixel density of TMB substrate deposition via anti-M13-HRP reactions on spot dilutions of GH680. C. beads conjugated to GH680 or D beads conjugated to BSA were incubated with IQ-tag displaying FITC labeled phage and imaged via fluorescence microscopy (20x objective, equal exposure, FITC channel). Insets: Pixel topography renditions of the images from C and D. Average fold FITC intensity comparing dye-conjugated and unconjugated beads is 6.1 (p&lt;10<sup>−36</sup>, <em>t</em>-test).</p>
