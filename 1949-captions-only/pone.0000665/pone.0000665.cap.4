                Figure 4.  IQ-tag binds with high affinity to GH680 and permits imaging via fluorescence microscopy and FACs.A. Representative sigmoidal dose response curve of IQ-tag binding to the benzindolium fluorochrome (KD = 0.53±0.12 SD). Bars, SEM. B. Immunodetection of GH680 on a glass slide via IQ-tag phage and anti-M13. Integrated pixel density of TMB substrate deposition via anti-M13-HRP reactions on spot dilutions of GH680. C. beads conjugated to GH680 or D beads conjugated to BSA were incubated with IQ-tag displaying FITC labeled phage and imaged via fluorescence microscopy (20x objective, equal exposure, FITC channel). Insets: Pixel topography renditions of the images from C and D. Average fold FITC intensity comparing dye-conjugated and unconjugated beads is 6.1 (p&lt;10−36, t-test).
