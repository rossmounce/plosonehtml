IQ-tag-Biotin peptide was incubated with NIR fluorochrome-conjugated Bang's beads (red histogram) or BSA conjugated Bang's beads (black histogram), then incubated with streptavidin-FITC and analyzed via flow cytometry. B. BiaCore experiments. IQ-tag-biotin was immobilized on a streptavidin chip then decreasing concentrations of GH680 were flowed over the surface (640 nM to 40 nM, bottom line buffer only control). C and D. Photochemical properties of GH680 (green trace) and GH680+IQ-tag (red trace). GH-680 binding to IQ-tag blue shifts the absorption by 14 nm.</p>
