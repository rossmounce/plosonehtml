Vehicle treated and IQ-tag modified HT1080 cells were incubated with GH680. The presence of the (benz)indolium fluorochrome was detected via a fluorescence plate reader. B. HEK-293T cells with the expression of dsRed and IQ-tag peptide fused to PDGFR were imaged via fluorescence microscopy for their ability to bind GH680. C. Confocal microscopy showing membrane localization of GH680. Scale bars: 10 Âµm D. Non-IQ-tag animals were injected tail vein with GH680 and organs removed at indicated time points post injection to quantify fluorochrome concentrations. E. Mice implanted with HEK-293T cells expressing IQ-tag peptide fused to PDGFR (right flank) or without expression (left flank) were injected with GH680 then imaged via FMT.</p>
