                Figure 2.  Micrographs of strain PV-1.A–D, Light micrographs showing cells attached at the end of the filaments; the cells have been stained with Syto and composite epifluoresence and phase contrast images produced to show the cells stained green. The bar = 5 µm. E TEM image of the cells, note the Gram-negative type cell wall and the fibers of Fe-oxides in the lower left corner. The bar = 0.5 µm. F. A HRTEM image of the Fe-oxide filament showing its composition as a bundle of conjoined fibers of Fe-oxide. The bar = 0.63 µm.
