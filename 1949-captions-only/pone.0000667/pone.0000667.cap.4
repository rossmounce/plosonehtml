                Figure 4.  Two maximum likelihood trees showing the phylogenetic relationship of Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1 to other Proteobacteria based on conserved protein sequences.Figures A and B show trees inferred from the amino acid sequences of the widely conserved RecA and GyrB proteins, respectively. The shaded clusters represent the recognized classes of Proteobacteria. The number of sequences representing each class is shown inside the cluster. The numbers at the nodes represent the per cent support for that group. The scale bar represents the estimated number of substitutions along the branches.
