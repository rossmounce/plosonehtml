Triangles indicate T-RFs associated with <em>Mariprofundus ferrooxydans</em> from restriction digests with Hinf I and Msp I (176 bp and 449 bp, respectively). T-RF scales range from 50 to 500 base pairs. Numbers at the nodes indicate the cophenetic correlation value of the cluster. Dendrogram scale bar units are r value Ã—100.</p>
