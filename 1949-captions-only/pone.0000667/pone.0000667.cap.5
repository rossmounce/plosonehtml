                Figure 5.  UPGMA/Pearson product-moment cluster analysis of T-RFLP bacterial community fingerprints using eight restriction digest treatments from iron-dominated mats from Loihi Seamount including the isolate Mariprofundus ferrooxydans.Two groups of communities have been identified and designated Loihi Group 1 (from lower temperature vents with enhanced ferrous iron) and Loihi Group 2 (from higher temperature vents with enhanced sulphide; ([37]). Triangles indicate T-RFs associated with Mariprofundus ferrooxydans from restriction digests with Hinf I and Msp I (176 bp and 449 bp, respectively). T-RF scales range from 50 to 500 base pairs. Numbers at the nodes indicate the cophenetic correlation value of the cluster. Dendrogram scale bar units are r value Ã—100.
