                Figure 2.  Cell-surface expression levels of wild-type and mutant MC4R were measured in transiently transfected HEK293 cells by ELISA.The prolactin signal sequence was added to the N-terminal domain of these receptors to ensure maximal membrane expression. MC4R mutation C271Y from TM6/EL3 significantly reduced membrane expression (p&lt;0.05) and was used as a control. Empty vector (pcDNA3.1) was transfected as a negative control to detect background.
