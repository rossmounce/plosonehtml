                Figure 3.  Wild-type (WT) and mutant MC4Rs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, which were stimulated with increasing concentrations of α-MSH (A) or of THIQ (B), and cAMP was measured to generate dose-response curves.Data shown are mean±s.e.m. of quadruplicate determinations. The dose-response curves are representative of at least three independent experiments. The amino acid sequence of α-MSH and the chemical structure THIQ are shown below panels A and B, respectively.
