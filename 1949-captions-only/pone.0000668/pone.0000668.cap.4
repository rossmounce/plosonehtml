                Figure 4.  A, Basal activity of wild-type MC4R, Rm1 (L106P), Rm2 (D122A), and mock-transfected cells were measured by detecting basal cAMP release and cAMP release in response to AGRP. B, Ratios of cAMP accumulation to cell-surface expression for wild-type MC4R, Rm1, and Rm2 were determined in the same batch of transiently transfected cells.Values are meansÂ±s.e.m. of three independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.
