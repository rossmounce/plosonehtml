                Figure 5.  Wild-type MC4R, Rm1, and Rm2 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, which were stimulated with increasing concentrations of β-MSH (A) or of γ-MSH (B), and cAMP was measured to generate dose-response curves.Data shown are mean±s.e.m. of quadruplicate determinations. The dose-response curves are representative of two independent experiments.
