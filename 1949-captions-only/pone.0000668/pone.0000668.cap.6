Receptor sequestration was calculated as the loss of receptor expression from the cell surface. Wild-type MC4R was internalized significantly more (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) in response to α-MSH than THIQ at doses of 10<sup>−7</sup> M and higher. Data represent the mean±s.e.m. of two independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.</p>
