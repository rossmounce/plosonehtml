Receptor internalization was calculated as the loss of receptor expression from the cell surface. After 60 min, significantly more wild-type MC4R was internalized (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) in response to α-MSH than THIQ. Data represent the mean±s.e.m. of two independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.</p>
