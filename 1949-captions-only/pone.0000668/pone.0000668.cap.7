                Figure 7.  HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type MC4R (A), Rm1 (B), and Rm2 (C) were exposed to 1 µM α-MSH or THIQ for the times indicated.Cell-surface FLAG-tagged receptors were measured by ELISA. Receptor internalization was calculated as the loss of receptor expression from the cell surface. After 60 min, significantly more wild-type MC4R was internalized (p&lt;0.05) in response to α-MSH than THIQ. Data represent the mean±s.e.m. of two independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.
