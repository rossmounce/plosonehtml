                Figure 1.  Proteolysis of NCp15 by PR.(A) Sequential and ordered proteolysis of the HIV-1 NC domain. Digestion of the Gag polyprotein by PR leads to the mature NCp7 via the NCp15 and NCp9 intermediate forms [1]. (B) Proteolysis of NCp15 (1 µM) at 30°C and pH 6.6 for 2 h. The products shown were generated using three concentrations of recombinant PR (50, 100 and 200 nM) and incubated in the presence of a circular ssDNA (3,352 nt, 1.25 nM), a G4-DNA (250 nM), a 415-mer RNA fragment corresponding to the HIV-1 leader region (20 nM) or a 3,352 dsDNA plasmid (1 nM). Controls: p6, NCp9 and NCp7 are shown in the three far left lanes, whereas products of NCp15 incubation with two concentrations of PR (50 and 200 nM) in the absence of nucleic acid are shown to their right.
