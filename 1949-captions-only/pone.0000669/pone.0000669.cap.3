                Figure 3.  Comparison of DNA synthesis by RT in the absence and presence of NCp7.(A) The progression of DNA synthesis is shown with or without NCp7 for a reaction time of 30 min. as a function of RT concentration. (B) The reaction is shown as a function of time with or without NCp7 for a fixed concentration of RT. The DNA products (B) have been sedimented before electrophoresis. Lower (L) and upper (U) half-volumes collected after sedimentation are indicated underneath. Concentrations of ssDNA and NCp were, respectively, 5 nM, 3.4 µM (A and B) and RT was 50 nM (B). DNA and NCp7 were premixed for 4 min. at 37°C, following incubation with RT for 2 min. before addition of dNTPs (100 µM each) to start the reaction.
