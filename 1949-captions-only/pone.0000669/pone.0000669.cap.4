                Figure 4.  Extrusion of dsDNA produced by RT from ssDNA-NCp7 co-aggregates.Progression of DNA synthesis analyzed by TEM after 2 min. (A), 10 min. (B) and 40 min. (C) from reactions with ssDNA (5 nM), RT (50 nM) and NCp7 (3.4 µM). Disaggregation after 10 min. (B) appeared both at the periphery and within the aggregates. A few individual molecules were visible close to the aggregate after 40 min. (C). (D) A typical DNA product visualized by TEM after 40 min. of DNA synthesis with subsequent incubation for 15 min. at 70°C in the presence of 0.4 M NaCl. (E) Band shift analysis of DNA flap synthesis within the dsDNA produced by RT after 40 min. at 37°C with 50 nM RT, with or without 3.4 µM NCp7. An excess of DraI and AlwnI enzymes that digest this dsDNA into two fragments (1800 and 1500 bp) was added. The DraI-AlwnI digestion products of the plasmid DNA are shown as a control on the left. When the HIV-1 central DNA flap is fully synthesized (i. e. with NCp7), the 1800 bp fragment is shifted to a slower migrating band. Magnification is identical for panels A,B,C. The scale bars correspond to 250 nm.
