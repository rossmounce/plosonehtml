This model was inspired from L. Henderson's (NCI-Frederick) illustration, taking into account the ratios of Gag, Gag-pol, NCp, PR, RT, IN and Vpr. (B) Gag cleavage between p2 and NCp15 by PR resulting in RNA-bound NCp15 removal from the capsid domains. (C) and (D) digestion of RNA-bound NCp15 yielding NCp9 (C), followed by NCp7 (D) which yields to an overall aggregation/condensation of the nucleocapsid that leads to (E).</p>
