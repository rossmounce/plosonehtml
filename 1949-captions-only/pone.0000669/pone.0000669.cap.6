                Figure 6.  Hypothetical model for HIV-1 nucleocapsid dismantling controlled by RT directed dsDNA synthesis.(A) translocation of RT on a minus DNA template coated with NCp7. RT displaces NCp7 during this translocation reaction while converting ssDNA into dsDNA, which does not allow NCp7 to re-associate in an aggregative mode. The dismantling force is driven by dNTP hydrolysis that allows continuous RT translocation. Magnesium is critical as it weakens dsDNA-binding by NCp7. (B) macroscopic consequence of the NCp7 dismantling activity of RT. A reverse transcription complex is depicted from a perspective of the nucleocapsid architecture used in figure 5. Once reverse transcription is finished, resulting in dsDNA, the aggregative nucleic acid binding mode of NCp7 is drastically reduced, facilitating the binding of Vpr and IN (as well as other available cellular partners) and thus generating a PIC (represented here in a simplified way according to Nermut et al.[27]).
