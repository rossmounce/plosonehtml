Intra (top) and extracellular (bottom) recordings illustrating cellular and network activity repectively in the three conditions depicted in B and C. The recordings correspond to the same neuron and location in the slice. On the left, the slice is silent and it is immersed in the so-called <em>classical</em> ACSF (for composition of ACSF see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>). In the middle traces the slices are in <em>in vivo-like</em> ACSF but spontaneous rhythmic activity has not developed yet, although occasional bursts of activity can be observed. The traces on the right show organized up and down states observable in both the recordings, in the case of the intracellular (top) the neuron being kept subthreshold. B. Raw traces of 16 PSPs recorded from a layer 2/3 neuron in the visual cortex induced by repetitive electrical stimulation (20 Hz) of layer 4. The first 6 and the last 2 PSPs of the 16 are shown. The same neuron was recorded while in three different funcional states of the cortical network: 1) top trace, PSPs recorded from an active, oscillatory slice, 2) middle trace, PSPs recorded from silent slices in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF, and 3) bottom trace, PSPs recorded from silent slices in ‘classical’ ACSF. C. Averaged and normalized PSPs amplitudes for the same three experimental conditions described in A: active, oscillatory slice in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF (○), silent slice in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF (▴) and silent slice in ‘classical’ ACSF (□). Each point corresponds to the average of several cells (between n = 5 and 17) and the error bar represents±s.e.m. The plotted values correspond to the normalized ones with respect to the amplitude of the first PSP (at 0 sec). The connecting curve between points is a B-spline. All the recordings included in this graph were from slices that have been kept at least 20 min in the aforementioned solutions.</p>
