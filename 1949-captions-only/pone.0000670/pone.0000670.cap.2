                Figure 2.  Paired pulse facilitation in active versus silent slices.A. Raw traces of a paired pulse protocol in a layer 2/3 neuron. Pairs of PSPs were evoked with different intervals (10–400 ms) by electrical stimulation of layer 4 in a silent slice in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF. B. Relative amplitude of the second PSP with respect to the first one (PSP2/PSP1) represented for different intervals (10–400 ms) in three different functional states of the slices: active, oscillatory slice in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF (n = 10; ○), silent slice in ‘in vivo-like’ ACSF (n = 11; ▴) and silent slice in ‘classical’ ACSF (n = 12; □). The error bar represents±s.e.m.
