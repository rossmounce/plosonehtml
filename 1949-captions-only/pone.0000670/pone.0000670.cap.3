Six up states interspersed with down, silent states recorded from a layer 2/3 neuron in primary visual cortex of the ferret <em>in vitro</em>. B. Four up states (top trace) and the corresponding multiunit activity recorded in the vicinity of the neuron (bottom trace). The intracellular recordings were kept subthreshold by means of current injection. C. Expanded up state illustrating the time segments that will be used to sort out the time of occurrence of the PSPs: <em>Down</em> (down state periods excluding the 200 ms following an up state), <em>In</em> (up states) and <em>End</em> (200 ms following the occurrence of the up state). D. Raw traces of a pair of PSPs occurring during the <em>Down</em>, <em>In</em> and <em>End</em> periods (top trace). Averaged paired PSPs for the same neuron during the 3 periods with respect to the occurrence of the up states: <em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em> (bottom trace) (n = 8 PSPs have been averaged for each segment). E. Bar diagram illustrating the amplitude of the first and second PSP of the pair during the 3 time segments (<em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em>) for intracortical synapses recorded <em>in vitro</em>. All the PSPs have been normalized with respect to the first PSP of the pair in the down states (n = 9 neurons).</p>
