Raw traces of pairs of intracortical PSPs occurring during <em>Down</em> (down states), <em>In</em> (up states) and <em>End</em> (200 ms following up states) periods during an intracellular recording <em>in vivo</em> in the cat primary visual cortex. B. Averaged amplitudes of the first and second intracortical PSPs in the pair occurring in the three situations (<em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em>) shown in A. C. Bar diagram illustrating the relative amplitudes of first and second intracortical PSPs in the three periods (<em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em>) all of them normalized with respect to the amplitude of the first PSP in the down state, which is therefore represented as amplitude 1 (n = 9 neurons). D. Two different examples of thalamocortical PSPs occurring during the up states (<em>In</em> period; top traces): one triggering the initiation of a down state (left), and both PSPs occurring during the up state (right). The bottom traces display the PSPs occurring during the down state (<em>Down</em> period; left) and right after the end of an up state (<em>End</em> period; right). All the traces in D correspond to a recording from the same neuron. E. Averaged amplitudes of the first and second thalamocortical PSPs in the pair occurring in the three situations (<em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em>) shown in D. F. Bar diagram illustrating the relative amplitudes of first and second thalamocortical PSPs in the three conditions (<em>Down, In</em> and <em>End</em>) all of them normalized with respect to the amplitude of the first PSP in the down state (n = 9 neurons).</p>
