                Figure 4.  Paired pulse facilitation in up versus down states in the cortex in vivo.A. Raw traces of pairs of intracortical PSPs occurring during Down (down states), In (up states) and End (200 ms following up states) periods during an intracellular recording in vivo in the cat primary visual cortex. B. Averaged amplitudes of the first and second intracortical PSPs in the pair occurring in the three situations (Down, In and End) shown in A. C. Bar diagram illustrating the relative amplitudes of first and second intracortical PSPs in the three periods (Down, In and End) all of them normalized with respect to the amplitude of the first PSP in the down state, which is therefore represented as amplitude 1 (n = 9 neurons). D. Two different examples of thalamocortical PSPs occurring during the up states (In period; top traces): one triggering the initiation of a down state (left), and both PSPs occurring during the up state (right). The bottom traces display the PSPs occurring during the down state (Down period; left) and right after the end of an up state (End period; right). All the traces in D correspond to a recording from the same neuron. E. Averaged amplitudes of the first and second thalamocortical PSPs in the pair occurring in the three situations (Down, In and End) shown in D. F. Bar diagram illustrating the relative amplitudes of first and second thalamocortical PSPs in the three conditions (Down, In and End) all of them normalized with respect to the amplitude of the first PSP in the down state (n = 9 neurons).
