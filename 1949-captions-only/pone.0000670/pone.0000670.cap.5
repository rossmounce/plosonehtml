Raw trace of a synaptic response (highlighted with a grey box) to a visual stimulus (discontinous line) during a down state. There are up states before and after the visual response. B. Raw trace of the synaptic response activated by the same visual stimulus but now during an up state. C. Average of the visual synaptic responses induced by the same stimulus during up (solid line) and down states (discontinous line). The averages are for 8 visual responses each, and they correspond to the recordings from a unique neuron. D. Relative amplitudes of the visually induced synaptic responses normalized for each neuron with respect to the ones during down states (n = 9 neurons).</p>
