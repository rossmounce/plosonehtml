                Figure 6.  Whisker evoked synaptic potentials in up versus down states in the cortex in vivo.A. Top trace. Extracellular, unfiltered, recording in the vicinity of the intracellularly recorded neuron in the barrel cortex of the rat. Middle trace. Filtered trace (15â€“80 Hz) to better illustrate the ocurrence of up states. Bottom trace, intracellular recording of a neuron during slow rhythmic activity. B. Whisker stimulation evoked response. Top, extracellular recording. Bottom, simultaneous intracellular recording. Each response is the average of 20 stimuli. C. Raw traces showing the PSP evoked by a puff of air in three different periods with respect to the occurrence to the up state: during down states (traces to the left), when PSP triggered an up state (middle traces) and when the PSP is evoked during an up state (traces to the right). D. In the same cell, the result of averaging 20 PSPs in each of the three cases shown in B. E. The same averages as in D but overlapped. The discontinous line illustrates where the amplitude measurements were taken, which is at the peak of the PSPs occurring during up and down states. F. Top, bar diagram of the normalized PSP values averaged for 13 neurons. Bottom, normalized values for each of the 12 neurons (an outlier was not represented).
