                Figure 8.  Voltage and amplitude dependence of sensory-evoked synaptic potentials.A. Variation of visually-activated PSPs' amplitude at different membrane potentials corresponding to up and down states in a cat visual cortex neurons. Each point represents the average of 20 sensory responses. A linear fit to those values between −72 and −58 mV (R2 0.95;p&lt;0.0001) illustrates the voltage dependence of the sensory response. B. Variation of whisker-activated PSPs' amplitude at different membrane potentials corresponding to up and down states in a barrel cortex neurons. Each point represents the average of 20 sensory responses. Linear fit (R2 0.92;p&lt;0.0001) as in A. C. Dependence of the normalized air puff induced PSP amplitude in the up with respect to the down state represented against the absolute amplitude of the sensory-evoked potential during the down states. Note that larger PSPs show less increase during up states (R2 0.8, t = 4.216 on 10 degrees of freedom, 2-tailed significance level is 0.0017). One outlier was removed.
