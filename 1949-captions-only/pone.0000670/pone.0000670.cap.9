Intracortical synaptic potentials activated by a 20 Hz train of electrical stimulation <em>in vivo</em>. The first 8 PSPs occurred during the down state and the following ones coincided with an up state. Note that the ones during the down state display synaptic facilitation, but their amplitude increased even further when occurring during the up state. B. Averaged PSPs amplitudes occurring during up (<em>In</em>) and down (<em>Down</em>) states for the same neuron as in A. Each point represents an average of 8â€“16 PSPs. Error bars are s.e.m. C. Repetitive electrical activation of intracortical synaptic potentials <em>in vivo</em> during down states (left) and during an up state (right). D. Distributions of the membrane potential values measured in a time window of 60 s and with a sampling rate of 10 KHz in a neuron during high spontaneous activity (left panel; s.d. 6.28) and another neuron with less spontaneous activity (middle panel; s.d. 1.62). Correlation between the standard deviation of the membrane distribution and the amplitude increase of the first PSP in the pair (n = 9 neurons; right panel).</p>
