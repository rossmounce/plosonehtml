<h4>Intragenomic comparisons</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Every contig was compared to every other contig using BLASTN. One single pass read (BpA0008) was completely identical to another (BpA0417) except for a 351 base insertion. BpA0417 contains a complete ORF identified as ribosomal protein L11; BpA0008 has strong similarity to L11 by BLASTN, except for the 351 base insertion, which has no significant matches in BLAST or Pfam databases and does not contain an ORF of significant length. A genewise comparison of BpA0008 to the L11 protein of <em>Danio rerio</em> predicts an intron involving the insertion but not with exactly the same coordinates. The insertion begins with a GpT but does not end in an ApG and may represent an incorrectly spliced gene product. The only other contigs with significant similarity to each other were examined to confirm that they were assembled correctly; comparison of BLASTN hits showed these to be transcripts of different genes belonging to known gene families such as alpha- and beta- tubulins and low molecular weight heat shock proteins.</p>


<h4>Untranslated regions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The distribution of untranslated region (UTR) length and %AT is shown in <a href="#pone-0000671-g003">Figure 3</a>. The average length of the putative 5′ and 3′ UTRs was 52 bases (SD 35) and 94 bases (SD 74.5), respectively. The length of the putative 5′ UTR was not negatively correlated with overall transcript length, suggesting that the estimate of 5′ UTR length was not biased by incomplete first strand synthesis of the cDNA library (not shown). The 5′ UTR was examined for the presence of <em>trans</em>-spliced leader (TSL) exons <a href="#pone.0000671-Hastings1">[34]</a> by cluster analysis, multiple sequence alignment, and all-to-all BLASTN comparisons. No sequence conservation indicative of a TSL exon was found.</p>
