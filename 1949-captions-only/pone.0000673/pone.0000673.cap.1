The biosensor (BS, in green) and the blocker (bl, in red) are juxtaposed. (B) Schematic representation of separated blocker and biosensor domains modulating the activity of a ribozyme in a substrate-dependent manner. (C) Autoradiogram of cleavage assays performed with various HDV ribozymes. Their structures, with both the biosensor (green) and the blocker (red), are illustrated above the lanes of the gel. The control (-) was performed in the absence of ribozyme (lane 1), while lane 2 was performed in the presence of the original version. Lane 3 is the version extended by the blocker sequence only. Lanes 4 and 5 are the versions extended by a biosensor domain either complementary, or not, to the substrate, respectively. Finally, lanes 6 and 7 are the <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> versions including separated blocker and biosensor domains, respectively. BPB and XC indicate the positions of the bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of each of the engineered ribozyme are shown in the <a href="#pone.0000673.s001">Figure S1</a>. (D) Verification of the gain in substrate specificity of the <em>trans</em>-acting HDV ribozymes. The upper portion shows a schematic representation of the substrates in which the P1 binding domain is identical (grey), but the sequences of the biosensors vary (different colors). The lower portion shows the autoradiogram of a cleavage assay performed on a pool of substrates either by a specific HDV <em>on</em> ribozyme (a to e correspond to the cleavage produced by specific ribozymes, lanes 2 to 6, respectively), or by the original ribozyme (lane 7). Lane 1 is the negative control performed in the absence of ribozyme. The nucleotide sequences of each of ribozyme are shown in the <a href="#pone.0000673.s002">Figure S2</a>.</p>
