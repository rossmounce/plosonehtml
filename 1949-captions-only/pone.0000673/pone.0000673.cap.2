In each case the structures of the nucleic acid enzyme with the blocker (red) and biosensor (green) are illustrated above the appropriate lanes of the gels, and the control (-) was performed in the absence of any nucleic acid enzyme (lane 1), and, lane 2, in the presence of the unmodified version of the ribozyme. Lane 3 is the version extended by the blocker sequence. Lanes 4 and 5 are the versions extended by a biosensor that is either complementary, or not, to the substrate. Finally, lanes 6 and 7 are the <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> versions, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of each nucleic acid enzyme are depicted in the <a href="#pone.0000673.s003">Figures S3</a><a href="#pone.0000673.s004">pone.0000673.s004</a> to <a href="#pone.0000673.s005">S5</a>.</p>
