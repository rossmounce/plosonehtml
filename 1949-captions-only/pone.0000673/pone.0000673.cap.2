                Figure 2.  Autoradiograms of cleavage assays performed with controlled cleaving nucleic acid enzymes.(A) (B) and (C) are the reactions performed with the hammerhead ribozyme, the 10-23 deoxyribozyme and the hairpin ribozyme, respectively. In each case the structures of the nucleic acid enzyme with the blocker (red) and biosensor (green) are illustrated above the appropriate lanes of the gels, and the control (-) was performed in the absence of any nucleic acid enzyme (lane 1), and, lane 2, in the presence of the unmodified version of the ribozyme. Lane 3 is the version extended by the blocker sequence. Lanes 4 and 5 are the versions extended by a biosensor that is either complementary, or not, to the substrate. Finally, lanes 6 and 7 are the on and off versions, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of each nucleic acid enzyme are depicted in the Figures S3pone.0000673.s004 to S5.
