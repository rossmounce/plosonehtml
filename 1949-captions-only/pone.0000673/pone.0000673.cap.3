                Figure 3.  Catalytic activity of the engineered dependent ligating and capping ribozymes.(A) and (C) are the nucleotide sequences and secondary structures of the ribozyme-substrate complexes of the ligating hairpin and capping ribozymes, respectively. (B) and (D) are autoradiograms of the PAGE gels used to analyse the ligation and capping reactions, respectively. The schematic structures of the nucleic acid enzymes with both the blocker (red) and biosensor (green) are illustrated above the appropriate lanes of the gels. The controls (-) was performed in the absence of ribozyme (lane 1), and, lane 2, in the presence of the unmodified versions. Lane 3 is the ribozyme extended by the blocker sequence. Lanes 4 and 5 are the versions extended by a biosensor that is either complementary, or not, to the substrate, respectively. Finally, lanes 6 and 7 are the on and off ribozymes, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of each engineered nucleic acid enzyme are depicted in Figures S6 and S7.
