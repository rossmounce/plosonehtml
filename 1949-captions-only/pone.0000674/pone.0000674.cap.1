<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The patients admitted at the hospital within 32 hours (range 6h–96h) after the onset of symptoms. The dominant clinical symptoms upon admission were fever (98%), headache (94%), and vomiting (67%). Neck stiffness was noted in 60% of the patients, lethargy or irritation in 46%, and seizures in 2.3%. Other manifestations were anorexia (40%), rash (9%), symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (4%), and diarrhea (1.6%). The mean duration of fever was 2.8 days (median, 1 day; range, 0–8 days) and the mean duration of hospitalization was 4.1 days (median, 4 days; range, 1.9– 8.5 days). Out of the 506 hospitalized children, 136 (26.9%) received antimicrobial therapy for more than 2 days, 311(61.5%) less than 2 days, and 59 (11.7%) did not receive any.</p>

The WBC count was normal (&lt;10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) in 153 (30.2%) patients, slightly elevated (10–15,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) in 210 (41.5%) patients, and &gt;15.000/mm<sup>3</sup> in 143 (28.3%) patients. Notably, only 91 of 506 patients (18%) had lymphocytic predominance. CRP was normal in 47% of patients, mildly elevated (6–20 mg/dl) in 37,2%, and &gt;21 mg/dl in 15.8% of children. Results of CSF examination are also presented in <a href="#pone-0000674-t001">Table 1</a>. Nineteen (3.8%) children had 10–25 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 91 (18%) children had 26–100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 289 (57.1%) children had 101–500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 75 (14.8%) children had 501–1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and 32(6.3%) children had more than 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Lymphocytes predominance (&gt;50%) was observed in 41.7 % of cases. The laboratory findings among the different age groups are shown in <a href="#pone-0000674-t002">Table 2</a>. No differences were observed among the groups with the exception of children &lt;1 year old who had higher CSF protein and lower CSF glucose.</p>
