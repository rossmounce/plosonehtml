The detector is placed about 6 mm from the eye, while the emitter is about 20 mm away. The owl is held immobile in a stereotaxic apparatus, allowing us to position the owl, repeatedly, in the same orientation <em>vis-à-vis</em> the pupillometer as well as the external sound sources. (B) Sound sources are placed on an array of two aluminum arms at right angles to each other, curved such that the center of curvature is a spot between the two ears of the owl. Speakers separated along the horizon of the owl were used to assess discrimination in azimuth (red), and speakers separated along the midline of the owl were used to assess discrimination in elevation (blue). The array is positioned such that the intersection of the arms is directly in front of the bird (azimuth 0°; elevation 0°). Each degree of angular displacement is marked on the arms of the array, and speakers can be moved to change angular separation. The subject is monitored using the IR camera, indicated here, during the experimental run. As far as possible, wiring is located so that it is behind the speaker array.</p>
