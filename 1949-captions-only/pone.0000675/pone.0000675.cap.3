Colors represent the firing rate, increasing from blue through to red. Note that for three of the neurons, the SRF is elongated in elevation. The neuron in (d) is atypical, in that the receptive field is more elongated in azimuth than it is in elevation. Such neurons were always tuned to low elevations.</p>
