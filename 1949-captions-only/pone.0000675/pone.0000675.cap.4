                Figure 4.  Azimuthal and elevation tuning and discrimination functions for a single space-specific neuron.(a) The SRF of the cell is shown; lighter shades correspond to higher response rates. The red and blue lines represent the locations used to estimate the azimuthal and elevational response functions, respectively. (b) Response profiles in azimuth (red) and elevation (blue) show that tuning in azimuth is finer than tuning in elevation. (c) Discrimination functions for a 5Â° separation were computed using data shown in (b), as per Eqn. 1. Response profiles for both azimuth and elevation are shown for reference. Note that maximal discrimination, especially as seen for azimuth, was achieved where rate of change of firing rate was maximal.
