                Figure 5.  Azimuthal and elevation tuning in space specific neurons.The width at half the maximal firing response for each neuron in azimuth is plotted against its tuning in elevation. Neurons better tuned in elevation also tend to be better tuned in azimuth. The slope of the best fit line (dotted line) is 2.08, confirming that the width of elevation tuning is about twice that in azimuth.
