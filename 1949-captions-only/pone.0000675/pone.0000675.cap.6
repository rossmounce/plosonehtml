Note that at lower spatial separations, azimuthal discrimination exceeds elevation, but maximal discrimination values are higher in elevation, albeit they occur at much larger separations. (b) Discrimination values plotted against angular separation. Elevation data are slightly offset to the right for clarity. Lines represent the mean discrimination computed from all neuronal pairs, such as those represented by symbols in (a). Note that azimuthal discrimination is roughly double that for elevation. (c) Comparison between behavioral data from individual birds (black) and neuronal discrimination. Data for azimuthal neuronal discrimination for separations &lt;5° are drawn from a previous study <a href="#pone.0000675-Bala2">[18]</a>. Neuronal data shown by dots in (b) is shown as fine lines, in red for azimuth and in blue for elevation. Heavy line is the mean discrimination across all neurons. (Data for azimuthal neuronal discrimination for separations &lt;5° are drawn from a previous study <a href="#pone.0000675-Bala2">[18]</a>.) Note that neuronal discrimination falls somewhere close to the average neuronal discrimination. Neuronal data are pooled from our entire neuronal population.</p>
