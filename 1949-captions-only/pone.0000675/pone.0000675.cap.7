Space map neurons (colored circles) are represented by a series of tuning functions (a) centered over each cell (b). The space map neurons, which do not habituate, are assumed to project topographically to a layer of habituating neurons (c). The summed output of the habituating layer is assumed to be proportional to the pupillary response (not shown). The sound is initially presented from location <em>x</em> and repeated until each cell of the habituating layer habituates to the number of spikes received from its input space-map neuron. Thus an input firing rate that is identical to that transmitted earlier results in no output from the habituating layer, and the PDR is inactive. However, if the stimulus is presented from another location, <em>x</em>+Δ<em>x</em>, the focus of activity on the map moves, i.e., the firing rate of the space map neurons changes in neurons which encode the two locations. This change recovers the habituated neurons, and the pupil dilates. The degree to which each cell in the habituating layer recovers is proportional to the absolute value of difference between the input evoked at the new location (<em>x</em>+Δ<em>x</em>) and that evoked from the habituating location (<em>x</em>).</p>
