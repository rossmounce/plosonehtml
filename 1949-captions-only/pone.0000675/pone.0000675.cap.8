                Figure 8.  Comparison between neuronal and behavioral discrimination.The slope of the azimuthal discrimination function is about twice that of the elevation function in behavior (solid lines), as well as in the output of the habituation model (dashed lines). Note here that behavioral discrimination, shown by solid lines, is closely matched by the output of this computational model.
