                Figure 2.  FARO map of the Arabidopsis mpk4 mutant.The 241 experimental factors (spheres/nodes) in the compendium of responses are divided into 8 categories indicated by different colors. Only edges (lines connecting factors) and names for experimental factors with strong associations to the mpk4 mutant are shown. Thicker edges and bold factor fonts indicate increasing association strength. Edge arrows or hammerheads, respectively, indicate highly significant congruent or dissimilar (opposite) response direction of the overlapping genes. Significant factors are positioned inside the circle of non-significant factors solely for typographical reasons. NASCArray accession numbers are in parentheses.
