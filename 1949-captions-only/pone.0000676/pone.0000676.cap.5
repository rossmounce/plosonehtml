Color bar values correspond to log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes of gene expression values for stress versus controls. The clustering shown is based on congruence between the stress responses. Vertical lines indicate main groups borders. B) Agriculturally important stress combinations (adapted from <a href="#pone.0000676-Mittler1">[33]</a>. Different combinations of abiotic stresses are presented in a matrix to demonstrate potential interactions with agronomic implications. Different interactions are color-coded to indicate potential negative (green, enhanced damage or lethality due to the stress combination) or potential positive (blue, cross-protection due to stress combination) effects. Black borders surround stress types with congruent response (main groups from 5A). Red border surrounds the only inconsistency between the grouping and known interaction (UV vs. Oxidative stress). C) Box plot of the expression profile of the 222 genes that are differentially expressed under all nine tissue-specific stress conditions and in the <em>mpk4</em> mutant. Notches indicate 95% confidence interval for the median and whiskers two standard deviations.</p>
