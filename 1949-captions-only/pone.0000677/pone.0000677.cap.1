                Figure 1.  Expression of CCL25/TECK mRNA in segments collected at 5â€“95% (pyloric sphincter = 5%; ileo-cecal junction = 95%) of SI length in gnotobiotic and conventional pigs derived by caesarean section and reared in isolators until 13 days of age.cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng of RNA and subjected to qPCR using primer/probe sets for CCL25/TECK. Levels of expression are expressed in copy number. Copy numbers and median from four animals are shown in each group (GF: germ free; LF: Lactobacillus fermentum; EC: Escherichia coli; CV: conventionalized with fresh adult porcine fecal material). *, P&lt;0.05, **, P&lt;0.01 (Student's t test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Exact)).
