                Figure 6.  Comparison of the expression of CCL28/MEC and CCR10 mRNA in Escherichia coli (EC) gnotobiotic and conventional (CV) pigs in segments collected at 5â€“95% (pyloric sphincter = 5%; ileo-cecal junction = 95%) of SI length.cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng of RNA and subjected to qPCR using primer/probe sets for CCL28/MEC and CCR10. Levels of expression are expressed in copy number. Copy numbers and median from four animals are shown in each. *, P&lt;0.05, **, P&lt;0.01 (Student's t test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Exact)).
