                Figure 7.  Comparison of the expression of Foxp3 mRNA in segments collected at 5–95% (pyloric sphincter = 5%; ileo-cecal junction = 95%) of SI length in gnotobiotic and conventional pigs derived by caesarean section and reared in isolators until 13 days of age.cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng of RNA and subjected to qPCR using primer/probe sets for Foxp3 and GAPDH. Delta CT was calculated as follows: Foxp3 CT – GAPDH CT. Foxp3 quantities and median are shown for four animals in each group (GF: germ free; LF: Lactobacillus fermentum; EC: Escherichia coli; CV: conventionalized with fresh adult porcine fecal material), with samples expressing the highest levels of Foxp3 mRNA demonstrating the lowest delta CT value. *, P&lt;0.05, **, P&lt;0.01 (Student's t test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Exact)).
