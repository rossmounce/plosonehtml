Delta CT was calculated as follows: Foxp3 CT – GAPDH CT. Foxp3 quantities and median are shown for four animals in each group (GF: germ free; LF: <em>Lactobacillus fermentum</em>; EC: <em>Escherichia coli</em>; CV: conventionalized with fresh adult porcine fecal material), with samples expressing the highest levels of Foxp3 mRNA demonstrating the lowest delta CT value. *, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05, **, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01 (Student's <em>t</em> test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Exact)).</p>
