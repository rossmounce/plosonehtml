                Figure 8.  Expression of Cdx-2 and GAPDH mRNA by conventional PCR amplifications.cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng of RNA extracted from small intestine (SI), IPI-2I, and SJPL cells. After 30 cycles of amplification, the PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Three DNA molecular weight markers were used (MW1 from Amersham and MW2, MW3 from Fermentas). The PCR product sizes are presented in Table 1.
