Identities of known major <em>trans</em>-acting QTL are listed above. Lower panels show the synonymous site substitution rate for the two chromosomal regions indicated by boxes. Breaks in the curves are due to the absence of synonymous sites in intergenic regions. As previously described, regions with low neutral substitution rates contain fewer <em>cis</em>-acting QTL <a href="#pone.0000678-Ronald1">[23]</a>.</p>
