                Figure 1.  Genomic distribution of regulatory QTL between BY and RM.Location of the gene whose expression level is under inspection (vertical axis) versus marker location (horizontal axis) for 2368 trait marker pairs (points) with significant linkage at an experiment-wide permutation based FDRâ‰¤0.05. Identities of known major trans-acting QTL are listed above. Lower panels show the synonymous site substitution rate for the two chromosomal regions indicated by boxes. Breaks in the curves are due to the absence of synonymous sites in intergenic regions. As previously described, regions with low neutral substitution rates contain fewer cis-acting QTL [23].
