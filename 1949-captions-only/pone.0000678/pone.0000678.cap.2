                Figure 2.  Likelihood surface for δ and n.Black contours show the 63%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for the joint value of δ and n (based on the χ22 distribution with Δ loge likelihood = 1, 3, and 5, respectively). Gray contours correspond to Δ loge likelihood = 10, 15, 20, …, 100.
