The rate of <em>cis</em>-acting QTL in each bin (points, 95% CIs shown in vertical lines) was estimated based on the observed number of genes with linkage and the estimated power and false positive rate of linkage analysis. The least squares fit of the purifying selection model to the points (solid line) results in estimates of δ and <em>n</em> of 0.31 and 181 which are somewhat larger but not significantly different from the estimates obtained under the likelihood based approach. The dashed line shows the least squares fit of the neutral model, yielding <em>n</em> = 71.</p>
