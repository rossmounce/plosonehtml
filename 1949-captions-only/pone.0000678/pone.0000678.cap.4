                Figure 4.  Illustration of common and rare derived alleles between BY and RM.The three possible rooted tree topologies for the S. cerevisiae strains are shown with branch lengths approximately to scale. Hypothetical genotypes for a polymorphism between BY and RM are given below. Orange and blue points represent mutations between BY and RM that result in common and rare derived alleles, respectively. Note that repeat mutation leads to apparently common derived alleles as illustrated for the right most topology.
