Hypothetical genotypes for a polymorphism between BY and RM are given below. Orange and blue points represent mutations between BY and RM that result in common and rare derived alleles, respectively. Note that repeat mutation leads to apparently common derived alleles as illustrated for the right most topology.</p>
