                Figure 5.  Ancestral selection graph simulation scheme.The left panel shows a percolation diagram illustrating the underlying Moran model with neutral births realized by all individuals (Î´ arrows) and extra births realized only by fitter individuals (2, 3, and 4 arrows) (see [38], [39] for detailed discussion). The right panel shows a realization of the reverse time simulation process for four sampled individuals representing the three S. cerevisiae strains and S. paradoxus. After mutations have been placed on the graph, branching events are resolved depending on the fitness of the two potential ancestors. Resolution of branching events produces a typical coalescent tree but introduces a bias towards advantageous alleles.
