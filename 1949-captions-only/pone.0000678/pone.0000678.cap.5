The right panel shows a realization of the reverse time simulation process for four sampled individuals representing the three <em>S. cerevisiae</em> strains and <em>S. paradoxus</em>. After mutations have been placed on the graph, branching events are resolved depending on the fitness of the two potential ancestors. Resolution of branching events produces a typical coalescent tree but introduces a bias towards advantageous alleles.</p>
