Ninety-five percent CIs for the expected proportion of rare derived alleles at selected sites (dark gray shading) and linked neutral sites (black shading) are shown as a function of the scaled fitness difference between selective classes (horizontal axis). The dashed line indicates the scaled purifying selection coefficient (2.1) that is most likely to have produced the observed allele frequency skew based on linear interpolation between 2<em>N<sub>e</sub>s</em> = 2.0 and 2.2. The rate of substitution at the selected site relative to the linked neutral site, denoted by ζ, is indicated along with the 95% CI.</p>
