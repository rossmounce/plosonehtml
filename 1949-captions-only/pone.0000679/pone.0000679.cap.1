                Figure 1.  Phylogram representation of DUBs.Indicated with arrows are DUB homologs that were cloned and expressed by in vitro transcription/translation (IVT). Red arrows depict DUBs that bound to neither probe (UbVME, ISG15VS, or SUMO1VS), whereas black arrows indicate DUBs that formed covalent adducts with the indicated probes. Our screen represents the first biochemical proof for protease activity of USP13 and the Otubain-homolog CGI-77 (DUB homologs without publication record regarding biochemical function are marked with an asterisk). Otubain1 (OTU1) is an exception in that it binds to alkylhalide- or aldehyde-based probes, but not to the Michael acceptors employed in this study (data not shown).
