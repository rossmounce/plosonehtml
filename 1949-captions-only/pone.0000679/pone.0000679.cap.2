After incubation with the probes, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, as shown for USP18 (A), USP14 (B), USP5 (C), USP13 (D), USP2 (E), and CGI-77 (F). Binding was inhibited by preincubation of the proteases with NEM. The SUMO protease SENP2 interacts specifically with SUMO1VME (G). Molecular weight in kDa is indicated on the left.</p>
