                Figure 4.  Reactivity of USP14 toward ISG15VS is augmented by proteasomal association.USP14 and USP5 were generated by IVT. Their activity toward ISG15VS and UbVME was analyzed in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified human 26S proteasomes. (A) Activity of USP14 toward UbVME and ISG15VS increases as a function of the concentration of added purified 26S proteasomes (in mg/ml). (B) The activity of USP5 remains unaffected. (C) Quantification of the radioactive signal of covalently modified USP5 and USP14. Binding affinity is depicted on the y-axis as percent in labeling intensity, determined by the ratio of labeled versus unlabeled USP5 or USP14. The ratio in the absence of exogenous proteasomes is defined as 100%.
