                Figure 5.  Proteasome-associated USP14 has ISG15-specific isopeptidase activity.(A) Scheme depicting the UbL-peptide conjugate used to assay isopeptidase activity. The biotinylated peptide heptamer is attached to either ISG15 or SUMO1 in isopeptide-linkage. Upon hydrolysis of the isopeptide bond by a specific DUB, the heptamer is released and the biotin signal lost. (B) Incubation of proteasome-enriched fraction (“5 hr pellet”) with UbL-peptide conjugate. After overnight incubation, the ISG15-peptide conjugate is completely cleaved, resulting in loss of the biotin-signal (significant proteolysis occurs already after one hour, data not shown). This activity is sensitive to NEM. Hydrolysis is not observed for the SUMO1-peptide conjugate. (C) Anti-HA immunoblot of HA-ISG15VS treated subcellular fractions. Based on previous identification [28] and on electrophoretic mobility, USP5 is the dominant ISG15-reactive DUB in the five-hour supernatant, which is enriched for uncomplexed proteins of light and moderate size (red asterisk). The five-hour pellet represents heavy cytosolic complexes, in particular the 26S proteasome, and contains USP14 as the only ISG15-reactive DUB (blue asterisk).
