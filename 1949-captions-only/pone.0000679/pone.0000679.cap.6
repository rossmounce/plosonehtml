(B) <em>In vivo</em> binding of ubiquitin and ISG15 probes. Lysates obtained from 293T cells transfected with USP14<sub>EYFP</sub> or USP14<sub>C114S-EYFP</sub> were reacted with UbVME or ISG15VS and compared to untreated aliquots in an anti-YFP immunoblot. USP14<sub>EYFP</sub> but not USP14<sub>C114S-EYFP</sub> reacts with the probes. (C) Subcellular localization of DUBs analyzed via the distribution of C-terminal EYFP fusions. 24 hours post-transfection, 293T cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. USP5<sub>EYFP</sub> can be found throughout the cell (upper left). USP13<sub>EYFP</sub> is expressed mainly within the nucleus, in a speckled pattern (upper right panel). USP14<sub>EYFP</sub> is detected predominantly in the cytoplasm, with lower levels in the nucleus (lower left panel). USP3<sub>EYFP</sub> and USP36<sub>EYFP</sub> (lower right panel) are detected in the nucleus and nucleolus, respectively.</p>
