                Figure 6.  In vivo probe-binding studies and analysis of subcellular DUB localization.(A) Schemes of the EYFP fusion proteins: UCH-like Zinc Finger Motif (red), proteolytic UCH domain (blue, with the putative active-site cysteine depicted in yellow), ubiquitin-binding UBA-domain (light blue), ubiquitin-like domain (green), putative nuclear localization sequence (pink), EYFP fusion protein (yellow box). (B) In vivo binding of ubiquitin and ISG15 probes. Lysates obtained from 293T cells transfected with USP14EYFP or USP14C114S-EYFP were reacted with UbVME or ISG15VS and compared to untreated aliquots in an anti-YFP immunoblot. USP14EYFP but not USP14C114S-EYFP reacts with the probes. (C) Subcellular localization of DUBs analyzed via the distribution of C-terminal EYFP fusions. 24 hours post-transfection, 293T cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. USP5EYFP can be found throughout the cell (upper left). USP13EYFP is expressed mainly within the nucleus, in a speckled pattern (upper right panel). USP14EYFP is detected predominantly in the cytoplasm, with lower levels in the nucleus (lower left panel). USP3EYFP and USP36EYFP (lower right panel) are detected in the nucleus and nucleolus, respectively.
