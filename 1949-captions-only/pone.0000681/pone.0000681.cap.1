Sites with heteroplasmic mutations (R for A and G; Y for C and T) were scored relative to the Cambridge Reference Sequence <a href="#pone.0000681-Anderson1">[3]</a>. (C) Occurrence of contamination events in the wells of the 96-well plate in analyzing 7094 single cells. The numbers in the wells indicated the number of contamination instances observed in the respective well. Wells with no contamination were left empty.</p>
