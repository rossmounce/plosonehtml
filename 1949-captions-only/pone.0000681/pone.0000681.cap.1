                Figure 1.  Recognition of mtDNA sequence anomalies in single cell analysis.Sections of representative sequence electropherograms showing external DNA contamination in a single cell from samples A-2 (A) and donor 7 (B), together with an uncontaminated cell from the respective sample. Sites with heteroplasmic mutations (R for A and G; Y for C and T) were scored relative to the Cambridge Reference Sequence [3]. (C) Occurrence of contamination events in the wells of the 96-well plate in analyzing 7094 single cells. The numbers in the wells indicated the number of contamination instances observed in the respective well. Wells with no contamination were left empty.
