                Figure 2.  A. 3D representation of the human (red) and mouse (blue) odorant spaces.Shown in dark green is a mouse-specific cluster (consisting of MOR232-2, MOR232-5, MOR233-1, MOR233-7, MOR235-1). B. A phylogenetic tree based on the full protein sequence that includes all five genes (dark green) in the mouse specific cluster shown in A. The five genes do not form a monophyletic clade, but instead are interspersed among human (red) and other mouse (blue) genes.
