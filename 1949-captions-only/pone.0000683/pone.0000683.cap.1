                Figure 1.  Young C57Bl6 ctsk −/− mice display reduced body weight.Growth curves from 10 to 120 days for male (A) and female (B) mice (n=12 for males and n=9 for females for each genotype. Statistical details for Bonferroni post‐tests: males df=22, t=2.15 for day 32, t=3.54 for day 42, t=2.08 for day 56; females df=16, t=2.63 for day 21, t=2.81 for day 32, t=2.14 for day 39, t=3.22 for day 56. * P&lt;0.05 . (C) Scattergram showing the positive and significant correlation (Spearman regression analysis) (P&lt;0.05) between MRI data, expressed as (fat volume)/(total body volume), and the ratio fat pad/body weight of 10 animals.
