Food intake was monitored weekly in the two groups studied (see text for further explanations) and no significant differences between genotypes were observed. <strong>(B)</strong> Graphs showing the increase in body weight with time for the sv129/C57Bl6 females and for the C57Bl6 males (n=10 for both groups). The increases in body weight were calculated based on the initial body weight at day 0 of HFD feeding. <strong>(C)</strong> Weights of epididymal WAT, perirenal WAT and BAT, taken from 5 month C67Bl6 old male mice (n=9 for ctsk−/− and for WT) after 12 weeks of HFD. Results are mean ± SEM * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001. <strong>(D)</strong> Representative histological sections of epididymal WAT from C57Bl6 ctsk+/+ (left panel) and ctsk−/− (right panel) mice maintained on a high fat diet for 12 weeks.</p>
