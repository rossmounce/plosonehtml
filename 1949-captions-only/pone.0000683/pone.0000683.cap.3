Results are the mean ± SEM for 4 WT and 3 male ctsk−/− mice (40 days‐old) p&lt;0.03 compared to WT mice. (<strong>B</strong>) Glycerol release was measured in adipocytes isolated from the visceral adipose tissue of C57Bl6 WT and ctsk−/− mice maintained in basal medium (ctr), or stimulated for 1 h with 1 µM isoproterenol (iso). Top and bottom panels show respectively the results obtained with young male animals (44 days‐old) and with male animals maintained on HFD for 12 weeks. Results are the mean ± SEM for 4 independent experiments. * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.</p>
