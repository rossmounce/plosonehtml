Mouse embryo fibroblasts were prepared 12 days post-coitum and were induced to differentiate in adipocytes. At 10 days after the addition of adipocyte differentiation media we performed oil red O staining (10 X magnification). (B) Quantification of aP2, leptin and LPL mRNA expression after real time PCR in WT (black bars) and ctsk−/− (white bars) MEF. Results are the mean ± SEM for 4 independent experiments. Statistical details for aP2, leptin and LPL are respectively: t = 9.15, t = 2.96 and t = 4.26, df = 5 in all cases. * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 versus WT.</p>
