                Figure 5.  Hypothetical scheme representing how ctsk ablation in mice may result in partial resistance to increase adipose mass in conditions requiring rapid accumulation of fat stores.In wt mice (intact genome, left side of the panel) ctsk participates to WAT extra-cellular matrix remodelling, thus facilitating the enlargement of the adipose mass, which implies adipocyte size increase and de novo differentiation of pre-adipocytes. Mechanisms involving an intracellular action of ctsk are also hypothesized. In ctsk deficient animals (right side of the panel) stimuli directed to increase the adipose mass are partially blunted and the extra caloric intake is partly utilized in a futile cycle, consisting of increased synthesis of triglycerides, increased triglycerides hydrolysis and increased Î²-oxidation of FFA.
