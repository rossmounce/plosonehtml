Mechanisms involving an intracellular action of ctsk are also hypothesized. In ctsk deficient animals (right side of the panel) stimuli directed to increase the adipose mass are partially blunted and the extra caloric intake is partly utilized in a futile cycle, consisting of increased synthesis of triglycerides, increased triglycerides hydrolysis and increased Î²-oxidation of FFA.</p>
