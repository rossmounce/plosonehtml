                Figure 2.  Induced spectral changes within the gamma-band range represented by time-frequency (TF) plots for each condition (familiar and unfamiliar).TF plots A and B are based on autoregressive modeling (AR), C and D on Morlet wavelet analysis. The two vertical black lines indicate the time interval of the induced gamma-band peak (150â€“400 ms post-stimulus onset) as used for further analyses. All TF plots were baseline corrected, averaged across subjects and twenty-two parieto-occipital electrodes (cf. Figure 3).
