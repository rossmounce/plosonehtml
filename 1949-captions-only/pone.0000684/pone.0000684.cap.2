The two vertical black lines indicate the time interval of the induced gamma-band peak (150â€“400 ms post-stimulus onset) as used for further analyses. All TF plots were baseline corrected, averaged across subjects and twenty-two parieto-occipital electrodes (<em>cf</em>. <a href="#pone-0000684-g003">Figure 3</a>).</p>
