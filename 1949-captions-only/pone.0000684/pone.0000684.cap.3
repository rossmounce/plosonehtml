                Figure 3.  Grand mean spherical-spline interpolated topographies of the condition effect (familiar minus unfamiliar) as revealed by AR (autoregressive) modeling (A) and wavelet analyses (B).Both maps are based on the induced gamma-band peak from 150 to 400 ms after stimulus onset. Electrodes as used for TF plots and statistical analyses are hemmed by black lines.
