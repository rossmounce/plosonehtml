                Figure 4.  Tomographies and coupling patterns of the induced gamma-band peak elicited by familiar and unfamiliar stimuli (150â€“400 ms after stimulus onset).In the SPMs significant differences (familiar versus unfamiliar) are indicated in red. The following Regions of Interest (ROIs; cf. Table 1) were defined: ITG (inferior-temporal gyrus, left), SPL (superior-parietal lobe, bilateral), MFG (middle frontal gyrus, right). The arrows in A and B represent the direction of information transfer between the ROIs and were only drawn if the PDC values were significant (p&lt;0.001). The lines in C and D display significant increases of phase-locking values (p&lt;0.001) calculated between all ROIs.
