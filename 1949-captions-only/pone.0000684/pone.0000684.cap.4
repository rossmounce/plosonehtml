The following Regions of Interest (ROIs; <em>cf</em>. <a href="#pone-0000684-t001">Table 1</a>) were defined: ITG (inferior-temporal gyrus, left), SPL (superior-parietal lobe, bilateral), MFG (middle frontal gyrus, right). The arrows in A and B represent the direction of information transfer between the ROIs and were only drawn if the PDC values were significant (p&lt;0.001). The lines in C and D display significant increases of phase-locking values (p&lt;0.001) calculated between all ROIs.</p>
