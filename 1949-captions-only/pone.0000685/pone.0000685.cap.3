                Figure 3.  Multipoint linkage analysis using Simwalk for Family F105 (ped 1 in the figure) and F115 (ped 115 in the figure), across the linked chromosomal interval.In this analysis individual 1443 of family 105 was set as phenotype unaffected; the maxLOD increased slightly to 9.5 when 1443 was set to phenotype unknown. A maxLOD = 6.6 was obtained using an affecteds-only model.
