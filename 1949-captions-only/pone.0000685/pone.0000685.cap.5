Familial mutations plus the control variant detected in this study are highlighted in yellow above each consensus plot. The sequence logo was generated with the multiple sequence alignment of distant orthologs selected from Eukaryota, Bacteria, and Archaea. The pairwise alignment of human UBIAD1 and <em>E.coli</em> UbiA peptide sequences aligned by ClustalW was used to annotate the regions of putative active sites.</p>
