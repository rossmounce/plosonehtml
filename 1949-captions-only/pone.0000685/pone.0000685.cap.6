                Figure 6.  Predicted UBIA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein 1 structure from ModBase mapped with evolutionary conservation scores calculated by ConSurf.Five familial mutations plus one control variant detected in this study are indicated. The color scale ranging from blue to red represents the conservation score of residue varies from 9 (most conserved) to 1 (most variable). a, Front view; b, Rear view.
