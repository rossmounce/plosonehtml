                Figure 2.  Cumulative distribution of diclofenac concentrations in liver samples.The stepped line shows the observed cumulative distribution of concentrations for 1,848 liver samples. Also shown is the fitted cumulative log-normal distribution in which the mean of loge-transformed values is −1.1522 and standard deviation is 1.7670 (thick curve). The thin curve is the fitted third order complementary log-log model in which the cumulative probability is 0.8765+0.1235 (1–exp(-exp(0.3184+0.5415 loge(dliver)+0.05110 (loge (dliver))2+0.005058 (loge(dliver))3)).
