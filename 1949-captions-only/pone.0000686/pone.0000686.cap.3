                Figure 3.  Relationship of diclofenac concentration in selected tissues to that in liver from the same ungulate.Log-log plots are shown of the concentration of diclofenac in intestine, fat, kidney and muscle against that in the liver. Symbols denote ungulate species and data source: open diamonds-Bos indicus, Experiment 1 [9]; circles-Bos indicus, Indian carcass dumps; squares-Bos taurus, Experiment 2; triangles-Bos taurus, Experiment 3; grey diamondâ€“Bubalus bubalis, [5]. Lines show results from the fitted Model E, in which the geometric mean concentration in the selected tissue is assumed to be a fixed proportion of the concentration in liver (k = 1, see text).
