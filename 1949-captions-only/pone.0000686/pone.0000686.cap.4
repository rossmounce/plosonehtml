                Figure 4.  Relationship between the proportion of oriental white-backed vultures treated experimentally with diclofenac that died and the dose of diclofenac administered per unit vulture body weight.Plotted points are proportions killed for each of five bins of dose, with 95% exact binomial confidence limits (vertical lines). Bins include 6, 4, 2, 10, and 2 birds respectively (ranked from lowest to highest dose). The thick curve is the fitted probit model relating mortality rate to log dose. Thin curves show the envelope enclosing the central 9,500 of 10,000 Monte Carlo replicate values. The upper panel shows results of analysis of all data. The lower panel excludes the datum for an outlier (vulture Gb11) from the lowest dose bin, which died even though it apparently received an extremely low dose of diclofenac. Data are from Table 2 of Oaks et al. [5].
