                Figure 1.  Certain lectins strongly stain the surface of live BS-C-1 cells and SSM cells.Living BS-C-1 cells are strongly stained with fluorescently labeled WGA (a) and ConA (b), but not with UEA (c) and SBA (d). SSM cells are stained with WGA (e), ConA (f) and, most intensely, with UEA (g) but not with SBA (h). Bars = 20 Âµm.
