                Figure 3.  Mixtures.A) Male/Male Admixed DNA sample. Full UHD profile of major and minor components obtained with minor component comprising 1/6th of input DNA. Donor haplotypes provided in parentheses below each locus. Minor component alleles are underlined. B) Male/Female Mixture - Male/Female Admixed DNA sample. Full UHD profile obtained at a male/female DNA ratio of 1/5000. Male donor alleles indicated in parentheses below each locus.
