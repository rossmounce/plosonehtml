                Figure 1.  Modification of human neural progenitor cells to release GDNF by lentiviral infection.(A) Schematic illustration of GDNF expressing hNPC preparation. Naïve neural progenitor cells (hNPCWT) were infected with lentivirus to produce GDNF (hNPCGDNF). (B) Schematic illustration of lentivirus construct. LTR, long terminal repeat; PGK, mouse phosphoglycerate kinase 1 promotor; WPRE, post transcriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus; cPPT, central polypurine tract; SIN, self-inactivating. Photomicrographs of hNPCWT (C) and hNPCGDNF (D) show robust expression of GDNF protein (E). Approximately 87% of cells were shown to express GDNF. (F) hGDNF protein was detected by ELISA in the culture medium after lentivirus infection. (G) GDNF expressing hNPC did not down-regulate the transgene after differentiation, but rather accumulated it in the media over time. Scale bar: 20 µm.
