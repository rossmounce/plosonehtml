Naïve neural progenitor cells (hNPC<sup>WT</sup>) were infected with lentivirus to produce GDNF (hNPC<sup>GDNF</sup>). (B) Schematic illustration of lentivirus construct. LTR, long terminal repeat; PGK, mouse phosphoglycerate kinase 1 promotor; WPRE, post transcriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus; cPPT, central polypurine tract; SIN, self-inactivating. Photomicrographs of hNPC<sup>WT</sup> (C) and hNPC<sup>GDNF</sup> (D) show robust expression of GDNF protein (E). Approximately 87% of cells were shown to express GDNF. (F) hGDNF protein was detected by ELISA in the culture medium after lentivirus infection. (G) GDNF expressing hNPC did not down-regulate the transgene after differentiation, but rather accumulated it in the media over time. Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
