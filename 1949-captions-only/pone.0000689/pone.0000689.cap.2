                Figure 2.  Survival and GDNF expression of transplanted hNPCGDNF in the spinal cord of the SOD1G93A rats.(A) Rats were transplanted with hNPC at day 70 and sacrificed at either 2 or 6 weeks post transplantation. (B) Staining with the human specific marker (hNUC) showed unilateral survival of cells in the ventral grey and white matter. (C) Surviving cells release GDNF. (D) Some endogenous rat motor neurons were decorated with GDNF. (E) ChAT and (F) Nissl staining showed increased motor neuron number around the transplant site. (G) There was widespread distribution of hNPC in the lumbar region of the spinal cords 6 weeks after transplantation. (H) GDNF expression was detected only in the area of the cell transplant. Scale bars: 1 mm in F; 100 Âµm in D.
