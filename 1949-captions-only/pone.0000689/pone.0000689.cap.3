Cell number reduced by 70% at 6 weeks post grafting in sham treated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> rats (E). There was almost complete protection of motor neuron loss within chimeric (transplant) regions of the spinal cord. Outside of these transplant (non-chimeric) regions motor neuron numbers dropped to less than 70%. The broken line indicates the number of motor neurons in wild-type rats. (F) The ratio of motor neuron numbers compared to the contralateral side. *: P&lt;0.05 vs. 2 wks and 6 wks outside groups. Scale bar: 100 Âµm in D.</p>
