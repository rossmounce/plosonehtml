                Figure 3.  Motor neurons are protected by GDNF secreting hNPC transplants in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A rats.The number of motor neurons was higher in hNPC-transplanted (chimeric) side (B, D) compared to the contralateral non-grafted (non-chimeric) hemisphere (A, C). Cell number reduced by 70% at 6 weeks post grafting in sham treated SOD1G93A rats (E). There was almost complete protection of motor neuron loss within chimeric (transplant) regions of the spinal cord. Outside of these transplant (non-chimeric) regions motor neuron numbers dropped to less than 70%. The broken line indicates the number of motor neurons in wild-type rats. (F) The ratio of motor neuron numbers compared to the contralateral side. *: P&lt;0.05 vs. 2 wks and 6 wks outside groups. Scale bar: 100 Âµm in D.
