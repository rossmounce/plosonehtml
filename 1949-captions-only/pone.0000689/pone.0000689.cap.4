                Figure 4.  Migrating hNPCGDNF express nestin but not GFAP.Confocal stacked images through sections show hNPC were GFAP positive within the core of the transplant (A, C, G). However, away from the site of the transplant GFAP expression was lost (B, G). Continual nestin expression was observed in both the transplant core and the region of migrating cells (D, E, F, H). Scale bars: 20 µm in A–E; 5 µm in F.
