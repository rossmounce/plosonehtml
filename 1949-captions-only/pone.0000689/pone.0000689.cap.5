                Figure 5.  Glial cell activation is not changed following hNPCGDNF transplantation in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A rats.Photomicrographs of the non-transplanted (A) and the hNPC-transplanted (B) indicate no change in number of GFAP positive reactive astrocytes in the ventral root of the spinal cord (C). Similarly, there was no difference in the level of microglia activation within regions of motor neuron protection (D–F). However, a detailed analysis using higher magnification (G) revealed microglia activation in the transplant core (the left side of a broken line indicating the border between the transplanted core). Scale bars: 50 µm in A, B, D, E; 20 µm in G.
