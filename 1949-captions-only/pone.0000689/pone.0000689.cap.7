                Figure 7.  GDNF released from the hNPC is critical for motor neuron survival in this model.(A) Even though a number of animals in the hNPCGDNF group reached end stage, the number of motor neurons was higher in hNPC-transplanted side compared to the contralateral non-grafted hemisphere. Surviving hNPC were found in the adjacent section of the transplanted side, but not in the contralateral side. We also double labeled sections throughout chimeric regions of each animal for both ChAT (red) and ubiquitin (UB; green), While the non transplanted side contained many ChAT+/ubiquitin+ (early degenerating motor neuron; indicated by arrows) and ChAT−/ubiquitin+ (late degenerating motor neuron; a star), most of the surviving ChAT+ motor neurons within chimieric regions of the transplanted spinal cord did not express ubiqutin (designated by arrow heads). (B) Motor neuron counts showed that there was a significant increase in motor neuron survival at both early and late time points within chimeric spinal cord regions rich in GDNF (n = 9 for total, 4 for mid stage and 5 for end stage). (C) While wild type hNPC not releasing GDNF did not affect motor neuron cell death in this model, there was approximately 2.5 fold increase compared to the non-grafted side in motor neuron survival in the hNPCGDNF group. *: P&lt;0.05 vs. hNPCWT. (D) Cell counting using sections double labeled for both ChAT and ubiquitin revealed that secreted GDNF from the hNPC was able to maintain healthy cholinergic motor neurons up until disease end point in this model of familial ALS. *: P&lt;0.05 vs. cell (-). Scale bar: 50 µm.
