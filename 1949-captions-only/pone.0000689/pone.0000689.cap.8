                Figure 8.  Neuromuscular junction innervation following hNPC transplantation.Axons were identified with synaptophysin and neurofilament (SYN+NF), motor endplates were identified with α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX). (A, D, G) In pre-symptomatic animals (80 days old), most endplates were innervated (yellow). (B, E, H) The number of denervated (an arrow head) endplates increased at the mid-stage (110 days old), although a few were still innervated (a white arrow). (C, F, I) All endplates were denervated at end-stage. (J) In the pre-symptomatic animals (40, 60, and 80 days old), over 80% of endplates were innervated. The number of denervated endplates was gradually increased by the mid-stage (100 days old), and most of endplates were denervated at end-stage. (K) Detailed endplate counts showed that there was no significant effect of hNPCGDNF on the innervation of neuromuscular junctions in the hindlimb muscle of animals showing increased numbers of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Scale bar: 20 µm.
