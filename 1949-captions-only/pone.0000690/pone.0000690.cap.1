                Figure 1.  Metabolite analyses in Pseudomonas fluorescens and in HepG2 cells.Panel A: 13C-NMR analyses of CFE from Pseudomonas fluorescens grown in a defined medium with citrate as the sole carbon source.
I) Ga-13C2-2,4-citrate and NAD as substrates
II)13C2-2,4-citrate and NAD as substrates
Panel B: Analysis of α-ketoglutarate (open bars) and succinate (crossed bars) in the cytosol and mitochondria of HepG2 cells exposed to control (A), Al-citrate (B), Al-treated cells exposed to 5 mM KG (C), and control cells exposed to Al-citrate (D). Samples were treated treated with perchloric acid and injected into the HPLC. The peaks were manually quantified using EMPOWER software. 100% corresponds to the absorbance value for KG and succinate peaks in the control cytosol and mitochondria (cytosol: 100% for KG and succinate is equivalent to an absorbance value of 0.0015 and 0.0012. Mitochondria: 100% for KG and succinate is equivalent to an absorbance value of 0.002 and 0.003). n = 3, mean±S.D., p≤0.05. Panel C: Representative chromatographs showing the consumption of citrate in HepG2 mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated following a 24 h exposure to I) citrate and II) Al-citrate. Mitochondria were incubated for 1h at 37°C in a phosphate reaction buffer consisting of 1 mM citrate and 0.1 mM NAD. Top right corner: the purity of the mitochondrial fraction was assessed by the immunodetection of VDAC, F-actin, and H2A (note: for all NMR and HPLC experiments the purity of the fractions was assessed prior to the experiment). Panel D: Proton-decoupled 13C-NMR spectra obtained from the incubation of whole HepG2 cells with 10 mM 13C2-2,4-citrate for 24 h. HepG2 cells were exposed to I) citrate and II) Al-citrate for 24h and isolated for the 13C-NMR analysis.
