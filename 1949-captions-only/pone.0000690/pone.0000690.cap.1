<a id="article1.body1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p4"></a><p><strong>Panel B</strong>: Analysis of α-ketoglutarate (open bars) and succinate (crossed bars) in the cytosol and mitochondria of HepG2 cells exposed to control (<strong>A</strong>), Al-citrate (<strong>B</strong>), Al-treated cells exposed to 5 mM KG (<strong>C</strong>), and control cells exposed to Al-citrate (<strong>D</strong>). Samples were treated treated with perchloric acid and injected into the HPLC. The peaks were manually quantified using EMPOWER software. 100% corresponds to the absorbance value for KG and succinate peaks in the control cytosol and mitochondria (cytosol: 100% for KG and succinate is equivalent to an absorbance value of 0.0015 and 0.0012. Mitochondria: 100% for KG and succinate is equivalent to an absorbance value of 0.002 and 0.003). n = 3, mean±S.D., p≤0.05. <strong>Panel C</strong>: Representative chromatographs showing the consumption of citrate in HepG2 mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated following a 24 h exposure to <strong>I)</strong> citrate and <strong>II)</strong> Al-citrate. Mitochondria were incubated for 1h at 37°C in a phosphate reaction buffer consisting of 1 mM citrate and 0.1 mM NAD. Top right corner: the purity of the mitochondrial fraction was assessed by the immunodetection of VDAC, F-actin, and H2A (note: for all NMR and HPLC experiments the purity of the fractions was assessed prior to the experiment). <strong>Panel D</strong>: Proton-decoupled <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra obtained from the incubation of whole HepG2 cells with 10 mM <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-2,4-citrate for 24 h. HepG2 cells were exposed to <strong>I)</strong> citrate and <strong>II)</strong> Al-citrate for 24h and isolated for the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis.</p>
