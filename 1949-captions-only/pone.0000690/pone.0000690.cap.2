                Figure 2.  Analysis of the KG mediated detoxification of H2O2.1 mg/ml equivalent of membraneous protein from control and Al-stressed P. fluorescens was reacted for 15min in the following conditions: I) control protein+5 mM KG+5 mM H2O2, II) Al-stressed protein+5 mM KG+5 mM H2O2, III) Al-stressed protein+5 mM KG+5 mM H2O2+10units of catalase, and IV) control protein+5 mM KG+5 mM H2O2+50 µM malonate+50 µM NaN3. The reaction mixtures were then treated accordingly for HPLC. Time zero measurements and reactions in the absence of protein were performed to assure the peak specificity.
