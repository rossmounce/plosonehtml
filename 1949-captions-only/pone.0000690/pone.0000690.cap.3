                Figure 3.  Activities of KGDH, NADP-ICDH, and NAD-ICDH in P. fluorescens grown in various media.KGDH activity was determined by incubating the membrane CFE (0.2 mg/mL protein equivalents) with 0.3 mM KG, 0.5 mM Coenzyme A and 0.5 mM NAD. Dinitrophenylhydrazone was monitored [38]. NADP-ICDH activity was determined by incubating soluble CFE (0.2 mg/mL protein equivalents) with 2 mM isocitrate, 4 mM malonate and 0.5 mM NADP. Formation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm (ε = 6220 M-1 cm-1). For NAD-ICDH activity, the membrane CFE was utilized and NAD was the cofactor. In some instances, activities of these enzymes were also obtained by quantifying activity bands using Scion Imaging Software for Windows (SCION corperation, Frederick, MD). All activities are expressed as a percent of the control (100% corresponds to corresponds to 40 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 for KGDH, 55 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 for NAD-ICDH, and 55 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 for NADP-ICDH). Crossed bar: KGDH, open bar: NADP-ICDH, and solid bar: NAD-ICDH. Values are mean±SD, n = 3, p≤0.05.
