                Figure 4.  In-gel activity staining of KGDH.Panel A: Membrane CFE from P. fluorescens grown in various conditions (1–9) were analyzed. Lane 1: citrate medium, Lane 2: Ga-stressed medium, Lane 3: Al-stressed medium, Lane 4: malate medium; Lane 5: Al-malate medium; Lane 6: H2O2-stressed medium, Lane 7: O2−-stressed medium, Lane 8: glucose medium, Lane 9: glucose/H2O2-stressed medium. Panel B: 2D BN-PAGE activity staining of KGDH. Lane 1: membrane CFE from P. fluorescens grown in citrate medium. Lane 2: in Ga-citrate medium. Panel C: The bands from lanes 1 and 2 in Panel A were excised and analyzed by 2D immunoblot. Lane 1: citrate medium. Lane 2: Ga-citrate. Panel D: Modulation of KGDH activity in membrane CFE isolated from P. fluorescens grown in different media. Lane 1: P. fluorescens grown in citrate medium. Lane 2: Ga-citrate medium, Lane 3: Al-stressed cells introduced into citrate medium, Lane 4: citrate cells introduced into Al-citrate medium. Panel E: In-gel detection of mitochondrial KGDH in HepG2 cells. Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: citrate and H2O2. Panel F: Immunoblot analysis of KGDH expression in HepG2 mitochondria. Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: citrate and H2O2.
