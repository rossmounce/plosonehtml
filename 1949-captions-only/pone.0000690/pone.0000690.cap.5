                Figure 5.  Activity and expression of NAD-ICDH in P. fluorescens membrane CFE and HepG2 mitochondria.Panel A: I) 2D PAGE activity stain for NAD-ICDH in P. fluorescens membrane CFE from Lane 1: citrate medium and Lane 2: Al-citrate medium. II) Activity bands were excised and detected by silver staining. Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2: Al-citrate. Panel B: In-gel NAD-ICDH activity in membrane CFE isolated from P. fluorescens grown in different media. Lane 1: citrate medium, Lane 2: Fe-citrate medium, Lanes 3-7: citrate media containing 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 mM Al, respectively. Panel C: NAD-ICDH activity in the mitochondrial extract from HepG2 cells grown in Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: H2O2 and citrate conditions.
