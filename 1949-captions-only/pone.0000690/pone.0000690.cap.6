I and II correspond to two bands with ICDH activities. Panel B: The membrane CFE isolated <em>P. fluorescens</em> grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate, <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate, and <em>Lane 3</em>: Ga-citrate media were tested for membrane NADP-ICDH and NAD-ICDH activity. Following the visualization of the NAD-ICDH activity band, the gel was treated with 2 mM isocitrate and 0.1 mM NADP. Panel C: HepG2 cells grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate, <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate, <em>Lane 3</em>: Zn-citrate, and <em>Lane 4</em>: citrate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were analyzed for the presence of a mitochondrial NADP-ICDH. Following the detection of NAD-ICDH, NADP-ICDH bands were detected as in Panel A. Panel D: The NADP-ICDH activity bands from Panel C were excised and subject to 2D SDS-PAGE. <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate, <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate, <em>Lane 3</em>: Zn-citrate, and <em>Lane 4</em>: citrate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Panel E: 2D immunodetection of NADP-ICDH in HepG2 mitochondria isolated from HepG2 cells grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate, <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate, <em>Lane 3</em>: Zn-citrate, and <em>Lane 4</em>: citrate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>
