                Figure 6.  The detection of NADP-ICDH/NAD-ICDH in the soluble and the membrane CFE from P. fluorescens and the mitochondria from HepG2 cells.Panel A: BN-PAGE analysis of NADP-ICDH activity in soluble CFE isolated from P. fluorescens grown in various media. Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: cells grown in Ga-citrate, Lane 3: control cells transferred into Ga-citrate media for 6 h, Lane 4: control cells transferred to medium with 1 mM menadione for 6h, and Lane 5: control cells transferred to medium with H2O2 (15 mM). I and II correspond to two bands with ICDH activities. Panel B: The membrane CFE isolated P. fluorescens grown in Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, and Lane 3: Ga-citrate media were tested for membrane NADP-ICDH and NAD-ICDH activity. Following the visualization of the NAD-ICDH activity band, the gel was treated with 2 mM isocitrate and 0.1 mM NADP. Panel C: HepG2 cells grown in Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: citrate and H2O2 were analyzed for the presence of a mitochondrial NADP-ICDH. Following the detection of NAD-ICDH, NADP-ICDH bands were detected as in Panel A. Panel D: The NADP-ICDH activity bands from Panel C were excised and subject to 2D SDS-PAGE. Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: citrate and H2O2. Panel E: 2D immunodetection of NADP-ICDH in HepG2 mitochondria isolated from HepG2 cells grown in Lane 1: citrate, Lane 2: Al-citrate, Lane 3: Zn-citrate, and Lane 4: citrate and H2O2 conditions.
