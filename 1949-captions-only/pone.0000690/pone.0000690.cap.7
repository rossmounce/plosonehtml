                Figure 7.  Immunofluorescent studies of mitochondrial NADP-ICDH in HepG2 cells subjected to oxidative stress.HepG2 cells were grown to a minimal density on coverslips and exposed to I) citrate and II) 0.5 mM Al-citrate for 24 h. The fluorescein isothiocyanate tagged secondary antibody (green) was used to visualize NADP-ICDH. The yellow fluorescence indicates the presence of NADP-ICDH in the mitochondria. Scale bar: 10 Âµm.
