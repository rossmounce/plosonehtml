Panel B: 2D immunodetection of SDH in <em>P. fluorescens</em> grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate and <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate. Lanes 1 and 6 from panel A were excised and analyzed. Panel C: In-gel detection of SDH activity in mitochondria of HepG2 grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate and <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate conditions. Panel D: Immunodetection of SDH in the mitochondria of HepG2 cells grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate and <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate conditions. Panel E: In-gel detection of MDH activity in the mitochondria of HepG2 cells grown in <em>Lane 1</em>: citrate and <em>Lane 2</em>: Al-citrate conditions (I = activity stain, II = 2D electrophoresis).</p>
