                Figure 8.  Determination of the activity and expression of SDH and MDH in P. fluorescens and the mitochondria of HepG2 cells.Panel A: In-gel detection of SDH activity and expression in P. fluorescens grown in Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2-6: citrate media containing 0.1, 0.5, 5, 10, and 15 mM Al. Panel B: 2D immunodetection of SDH in P. fluorescens grown in Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2: Al-citrate. Lanes 1 and 6 from panel A were excised and analyzed. Panel C: In-gel detection of SDH activity in mitochondria of HepG2 grown in Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2: Al-citrate conditions. Panel D: Immunodetection of SDH in the mitochondria of HepG2 cells grown in Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2: Al-citrate conditions. Panel E: In-gel detection of MDH activity in the mitochondria of HepG2 cells grown in Lane 1: citrate and Lane 2: Al-citrate conditions (I = activity stain, II = 2D electrophoresis).
