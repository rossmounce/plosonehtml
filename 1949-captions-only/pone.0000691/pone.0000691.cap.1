The red line shows the significance threshold (i.e. p = 0.05). Results for SNP rs1793004 are highlighted in pink. The main replication signal localizes to the 5′ region of the <em>NELL1</em> gene. (B) Plot of the recombination rate (in cM/Mb), showing that the peak replication signal is delineated by two regions of increased recombination. (C, D) Linkage-disequilibrium (LD) plots from HapMap, using metrics D′ (section C) and r<sup>2</sup> (section D). Genotypes of trios with Northern- and Western-European ancestry were retrieved from HapMap for 1261 SNPs (CR≥90%, MAF≥1%, p<sub>HWE</sub>≥0.01, Mendel errors≤3). Positions are from NCBI build 35.</p>
