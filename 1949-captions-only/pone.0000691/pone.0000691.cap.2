Parallel amplification of β-actin (<em>ACTB</em>) is shown. Expression and localization of the NELL1 protein in healthy colonic tissue is demonstrated in sections B (20×) and C (40×; bar = 10 µm) by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity is confined to mononuclear/lymphocytic cells in the lamina propria (brown DAB reaction product, arrows). A control without the primary antibody is shown in section D. No major expression differences between colonic specimen from normal controls (N) and Crohn disease (CD) were detected in the Western blot (section E) with the same antibody as applied in sections B and C. The single detected band (90 kDa) corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of the isoform encoded by GenBank AK127805 (UniProt accession number Q92832).</p>
