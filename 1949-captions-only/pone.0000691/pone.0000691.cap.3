                Figure 3.   In silico protein analysis.Domain architectures of NELL1/NELL2 and TSP1. The positions of variant amino acids are annotated. Abbreviations are as follows: SP: signal peptide; TSPN: thrombospondin N-terminal domain; CC: coiled-coil region; VWC: von Willebrand factor, type C domain; EGF: EGF domain; TSP-3: thrombospondin-3 repeat; TSP_C: thrombospondin C-terminal domain.
