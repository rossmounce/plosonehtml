                Figure 4.   In silico protein analysis.Computationally derived 3D structure model of the N-terminal domain of the NELL1 protein. The model was created using the TSPN (PDB code 1z78, chain A) as a structure template for NELL1. The locations of variant amino acids as well as of two cysteines forming a disulfide bridge are annotated.
