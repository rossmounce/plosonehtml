                Figure 1.  Patients with schizophrenia show lower proliferative responses to stimulation with anti-CD3.(A) Medicated schizophrenia patients were found to have significantly lower proliferative responses to in vitro stimulation compared to healthy controls at all concentrations of stimulation with anti-CD3. (B) T cell proliferation was also measured in minimally medicated and unmedicated patients to rule out the possibility of drug effect. These also showed significantly lower proliferative responses to stimulation.
