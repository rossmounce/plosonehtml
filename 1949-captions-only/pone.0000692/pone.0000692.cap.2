                Figure 2.  Proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are similar in schizophrenia patients compared to controls.Expression of CD4 and CD8 was measured on CD3+ T cells from minimally medicated and unmedicated patients and controls. There was no significant difference in proportions of CD4 and CD8 T cells between patients and controls either before of after stimulation, suggesting that there is not preferential expansion of either of these populations following stimulation.
