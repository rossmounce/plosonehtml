                Figure 3.  Patient and control T cells show similar levels of CD3 and TCRαβ expression before and after stimulation.(A) CD3 Expression was measured by flow cytometry on patient and control T cells before and after stimulation with anti-CD3. There was no significant difference in the level of expression between patients and controls. (B) Expression of TCR αβ chains on the surface of T cells was also comparable between patients and controls before and after stimulation.
