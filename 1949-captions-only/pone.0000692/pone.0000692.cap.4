There was no significant difference in production of IL-2 between patients and controls at each concentration of OKT3. (B) The percentage of CD25+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was similar between patients and controls before and after stimulation and there was no significant difference in level of expression of CD25 before or after stimulation (C).</p>
