(A) The percentage of CD45RA+ cells was significantly higher in patients compared to controls before stimulation and the level of expression of CD45RA was also higher on patient CD4+ and CD8+ cells before and after stimulation (B). (C) CD45RB expression was significantly higher on CD4+ and CD8+ patient T cells before stimulation. (D) There was no significant difference in the expression of CD45RO on either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from patient or control cells.</p>
