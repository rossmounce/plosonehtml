                Figure 1.  ART induces apoptosis in malignant T cells.Jurkat, Hut-78, Molt-4 and CEM leukemic T cells were incubated with different doses of ART for 24 or 48 h as indicated. The apoptotic cell death was determined either by FSC/SSC index for changes in cell size and granularity (A) or by DNA fragmentation (B). Results are representative of three independent experiments determined in triplicates.
