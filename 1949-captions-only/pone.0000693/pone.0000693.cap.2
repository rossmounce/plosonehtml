Jurkat cells deficient in FADD (FADD<sup>−/−</sup>), caspas-8 (casp-8<sup>−/−</sup>), or over-expressing Bcl-2 and parental (A3) Jurkat cells were treated with different does of ART. Apoptotic cell death was determined by FSC/SSC in triplicates. (B) ART-induced apoptosis involves caspases. Jurkat cells were treated with ART (4 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of 50 µM of pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk for 48 h. Apoptotic cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation in triplicates. (C) ART induces cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-2, 3 and 9. CEM leukemia cells were treated with 1 µg/ml ART for different times as indicated. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against cytochrome c, caspase-2, 3, 8, 9, PARP, and control antibodies against tubulin. Data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
