                Figure 3.  ROS mediate ART-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.(A) Jurkat cells were treated with 4 µg/ml of ART for different times as indicated and the redox status was monitored by the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent dyes for H2O2. (B) CEM cells were treated with 0.5 µg/ml doses ART. After 30 min, the redox status was measured as in (A). (C) and (D) ART-induced apoptosis was blocked by the antioxidant NAC. Jurkat (C) and CEM (D) cells were treated with ART in the presence (15 mM) or absence of NAC for 24 h. Apoptotic cell death was analyzed by FSC/SSC in triplicates. Results are representative of four independent experiments.
