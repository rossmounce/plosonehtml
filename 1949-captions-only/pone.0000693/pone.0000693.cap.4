Doxorubicin-resistant (CEM-Dox<sub>R</sub>) and parental (CEM-parental) CEM cells were treated with either 1 µg/ml of ART or 0.5 µg/ml of Doxorubicin for 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by FSC/SSC (left panel) and DNA fragmentation (right panel). Results are representative of two independent experiments. (B) NAC inhibits ART-induced apoptosis in Doxorubicin-resistant leukemic cells. CEM-Dox<sub>R</sub> cells were treated with different doses of ART in the presence or absence of NAC (15 mM). Apoptotic cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation in triplicates. (C) and (D) NAC does not inhibit Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. CEM-parental (C) and Jurkat (D) cells were treated either with ART or Doxorubicin in the presence or absence of NAC. Apoptotic cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation. Results are representative of four independent experiments. The p value was determined by the statistic program of Microsoft Excel. (E) ART induces ROS generation in CEM-Dox<sub>R</sub> cells. CEM-Dox<sub>R</sub> cells were treated with 4 µg/ml of ART in the presence or absence of NAC (15 mM) for 30 min. The redox status was measured as in <a href="#pone-0000693-g003">figure 3</a>. (F) Doxorubicin does not induce ROS in leukemic T cells. CEM-Dox<sub>R</sub>, CEM-parental and Jurkat cells were treated with 0.5 µg/ml of Doxorubicin in the presence or absence of NAC for 30 min. The redox status was measured as in (E). Results are representative of three independent experiments. (G) Doxorubicin does not interfere with the redox assay. CEM cells were treated with Doxorubicin (2 µg/ml) or ART (4 µg/ml) alone or in combination for 30 min. The redox status was measured as in F.</p>
