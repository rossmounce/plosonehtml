                Figure 5.  ART sensitizes malignant T cells to Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.Jurkat (A) and CEM (B) cells were treated with combinations of different doses of ART and Doxorubicin for 24 h as indicated. The drugs were added at the same time. Apoptotic cell death was quantified by DNA fragmentation in triplicates. Results are representative of three independent experiments. The p value was determined by a two-way ANOVA test with factors Dox-, ART-, and their interaction. For Jurkat cells, the p values are p&lt;0.0001 for Dox- and ART-treatment and p = 0.0006 for the combination treatment. For CEM cells, the p values are p&lt;0.0001 for Dox-, ART- as well as the combination treatment.
