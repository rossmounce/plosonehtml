                Figure 1.  Observed phenotypic changes in knock down experiments of Hox-like genes in the hydrozoan Eleutheria dichotoma.Four of the five Hox-like genes produced phenotypically abnormal medusae (PAMs) in gene knock down studies. The main features of bauplan change relate to additional tentacle bifurcation (Cnox-1; see arrows), multiple oral poles or heads (Cnox-2), head duplication (Cnox-3; see arrows), and oral-aboral body axis deformation (Cnox-5). The two upper panels show life pictures of medusae transfected with double stranded RNA (B1,2, C1,2, D1,2, E1,2), and the lower panel medusae transfected with morpholino oligos (B3,4, C3,4, D3,4, E3,4). A1,2 and A3,4 are controls, scale bar is 100 Âµm. While we here unambiguously show that Hox-like genes can be silenced we think it would be premature to derive final conclusions on their functions yet.
