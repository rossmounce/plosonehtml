Shown is the time course of increasing numbers of PAMs as a result of inhibition by double stranded RNA and inhibition by morpholino-antisense oligonucleotides. In each case control 1 is untreated animals cultured in normal seawater, and control 2 is a sense morpholino oligonucleotide or dsRNA targeted to the <em>Trox</em>-2 gene from the placozoan <em>Trichoplax adhaerens</em> respectively. Independent controls were run for each single experiment.</p>
