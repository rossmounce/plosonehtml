                Figure 2.  Time course for the development of phenotypic effects resulting from Cnox-5 gene knock down.Both morpholino oligo and RNAi experiments result in an increase of phenotypically abnormal medusae (PAMs) over time. Shown is the time course of increasing numbers of PAMs as a result of inhibition by double stranded RNA and inhibition by morpholino-antisense oligonucleotides. In each case control 1 is untreated animals cultured in normal seawater, and control 2 is a sense morpholino oligonucleotide or dsRNA targeted to the Trox-2 gene from the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens respectively. Independent controls were run for each single experiment.
