                Figure 13.  Distribution of c929-GAL4 driven expression of synaptic markers.A) Dorsal view of the VNC of a c929-GAL4xUAS-GFP larva, voltex projection. B) Lateral view of a8–9 of a c929GAL4xUAS-GFP larva, voltex projection. C) Dorsal view of a8–9 of a c929GAL4xUAS-GFP larva, voltex projection. Note the reduced morphology of the neuropil in a9 ( = the terminal plexus), immunolabeled against the synaptic marker protein synapsin (arrow) in A–C). D) Dorsal view of a c929GAL4xUAS-RDL.HA larva, maximum projection. RDL.HA immunostaining labels the cell bodies, descending neurites (asterisks) and the terminal plexus (arrow). Scale bars: 100 µm in A), 20 µm in B–C), 50 µm in D). HA-immunostaining or GFP expression is shown in green, synapsin-IR in magenta.
