                Figure 1.  Dynamics of ring contraction.(A) Time lapse images of GFP tagged non-muscle myosin 2 during the first division using end-on imaging of a dividing C. elegans embryo at 21°C, which show the contracting ring structure. (B) Ring radius as a function of time. Stars indicate the average of eight experimentally observed ring radius traces as shown in (A). Bars mark one standard deviation. The colored lines represent solutions to Eqs. (1)–(4). For sufficiently large rate of filament turnover , , and using , the calculated dynamics corresponds well to the observed one (red line). Reducing the polymerization rate to , which implies a reduced initial filament concentration of  leads to slower ring contraction (green line). Using  and decreasing the generated contractile stress using  also leads to slower ring contraction (blue line). Using instead  causes the ring to stop at a finite radius R≈5 µm (yellow line). In the absence of filament turnover,  and with , the contraction speed increases with time (black line). (C) Filament density c as a function of time shown for the same calculations as in (B). Parameter values are: initial ring radius R0 = 14.5 µm, initial filament density c0 = 25 µm−1, Nb = 40, K = 10 nN µm-1, .
