                Figure 2.  Illustration of key quantities used in the theoretical analysis.(A) Schematic representation of a cylindrical cell with a contractile ring of initial radius R0 (left) and contracted state with radius R&lt;R0 (right). The position along the ring is denoted by x. (B) Schematic representation of the elastic energy E(R) as a function of ring radius (black). The dashed red line represents the approximation to E(R) given by Eq. (1), which we used in our calculations.
