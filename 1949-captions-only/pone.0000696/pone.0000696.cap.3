During sliding, stresses result from the balance of motor forces, which are applied at the position where the motor is bound and friction forces that are distributed along the filaments. The combined stress profiles of both filaments Ïƒ(x) are displayed as a function of position <em>x</em>. When the centers of mass of the filaments slide towards each other (i.e. the pair contracts) the stress is positive (contractile) on average. When the filaments move apart, the stress is negative. Averaging over many filament pairs and motor position in the bundle, the net stress generated by this process is zero. (B) Filaments of equal orientation tend to align their plus ends if motors stay temporarily attached to the plus end. In this case, a positive (contractile) average stress is generated. Considering the combined effects of many filament pairs in a bundle, this process contributes to contractile bundle stress. (C) Snapshot of a stochastic simulation of a bundle consisting of many filaments that interact via the processes illustrated in (A) and (B). Displayed is a typical configuration in the steady state. Filaments oriented with their plus ends to the right and left are indicated by red and blue rods, respectively. This state has on average constant density as a function of position <em>x</em> and generates a net contractile stress along the bundle.</p>
