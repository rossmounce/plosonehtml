The arrows at the filament ends indicate that monomers are added at the plus ends and removed from the minus ends. As a consequence of treadmilling, in the absence of cross-linkers, the centers of mass of the filaments move relative to each other. At the same time, fixed subunits along the filaments do not move. Stresses can be generated if filaments are linked by passive cross-linkers, which have the ability to bind to filaments and also stay attached to depolymerizing filament ends (end-tracking cross-linkers). No stress is generated if monomers are cross-linked along filaments since these monomers do not move (left). As soon as one depolymerizing filament end is linked to the second filament by a cross-linker (middle), both filaments are physically moved relative to each other by depolymerization forces. This leads to a stress profile along the filament pair with positive (contractile) stress (middle and right). This process therefore contributes to contractile average bundle stress if many filament pairs are interacting in a filament bundle. Note that this is different from stress generation by motors, where anti-parallel filaments do not contribute to stress. (B) Stress profiles for a pair of treadmiling filaments that are arranged in parallel. Again, if a depolymerizing end of one filament is linked to the second filament, relative sliding occurs which is driven by filament depolymerization. The resulting stress is positive (contractile).</p>
