                Figure 1.  Expression of keratin genes in the stratified epithelium of the epidermis.As keratinocytes become post-mitotic and migrate through the epidermis from the basal into the spinous layer, KRT1 and KRT10 expression is up-regulated, replacing the expression of KRT5 and KRT14 [28], [29]. These expression changes are controlled at the transcriptional level [30], [31]. During terminal differentiation the keratinocytes migrate into the granular layer, and KRT1 and KRT10 are replaced by K2e [29]. During re-epithelialization in the wounded epidermis, cells preparing to migrate down-regulate KRT1 and KRT10 in favour of KRT6, KRT16, and KRT17 [2], [3]. The repression of KRT1 is thought to be necessary for normal terminal differentiation and migration [28], [29]. The figure is adapted from Porter and Lane [29].
