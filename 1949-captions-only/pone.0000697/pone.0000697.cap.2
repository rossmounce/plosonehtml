Western blot analysis using anti-KRT1 antibody, with the left and right lanes containing proteins isolated from cells homozygous for the <em>KRT1</em> haplotype patterns H1 (sample 8 in <a href="#pone-0000697-t003">Table 3</a>) and H2 (sample 9 in <a href="#pone-0000697-t003">Table 3</a>) respectively. Replicate gels stained with Coomassie blue demonstrate equal levels of proteins loaded for the HEK samples. All six HEK samples examined contained similar levels of KRT1 protein. b. Immunohistochemistry showing distribution of KRT1 protein in two of the three confluent HEK samples examined. A subset of the anti-KRT1 cells displays strong membrane staining, while the remaining cells display low to moderate level membrane staining. Staining of the nucleus is present at the same level in the anti-KRT1 and negative control cells. All three HEK samples examined display similar KRT1 expression patterns.</p>
