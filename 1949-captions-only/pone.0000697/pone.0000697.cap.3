                Figure 3.  Wound assay.a. HEK cells were stained with BrdU five hours after wounding. The number of BrdU-positive cells observed at the wound area was roughly equal to the number observed within the monolayer (98±6), indicating that the two areas had approximately the same amount of cell proliferation. b. Migration of HEK cells in response to wounding. Digital photographs taken at the same positions at the time-points indicated show the migration of HEK cells into the cell-free areas of the artificial wound sites. Examples from cell-lines homozygous for KRT1 haplotype patterns H1 and H2 are shown. The cell-free areas are given as a fraction of the 638 µm×956 µm area shown (the visible grid-lines are 175 µm apart). The cell-free areas from eight replicates are used to calculate the migration rate of each sample (see Methods).
