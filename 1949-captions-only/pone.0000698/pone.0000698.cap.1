Each choice session was constituted of 12 discrete trials, spaced by 10 min, and divided into two successive phases, sampling (4 trials) followed by choice (8 trials). S, saccharin-associated lever; C, cocaine-associated lever. b, Choice between levers C and S (mean±SEM) across reward conditions and as a function of time (open circle: S-/C+ condition; closed triangle: S+/C- condition; closed circle: S+/C+ condition). The horizontal gray line at 0 indicates the indifference level. Values above 0 indicate a preference for lever S while values below 0 indicate a preference for lever C. *, different from the indifference level (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05, <em>t</em>-test). c, Sampling (mean±SEM of the last 3 days) of lever S (black bars) and lever C (white bars) across reward conditions. *, different from lever S (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05, Fisher's LSD test after a two-way analysis of variance).</p>
