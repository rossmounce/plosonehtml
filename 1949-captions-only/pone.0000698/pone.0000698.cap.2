Each reward type (N, W, Sac and Suc) was tested at least 5 times in a row until stabilization of behavior. Bars represent the means (Â±SEM) of the last 3 stable days. The first 3 reward conditions (N, W and Sac in this order) were tested in the same group of animals (<em>N</em> = 10) while the sucrose condition was tested in a separate group (<em>N</em> = 10).</p>
