Pump light is collimated and focused by lenses L1–4 to a 51 µm × 85 µm waist in air; pump beam is tilted relative to the lasing beam to keep reflections from reentering the pump diode and destabilizing it. Beamsplitter (BS) has high transmissivity at 981 nm and high reflectivity at &gt;1010 nm. Lasing medium is a d = 1.2 mm Brewster-cut 10%-at. Yb:KYW crystal. M1,M4 = −200 mm, M2,M3 = −100 mm are cavity mirrors with standard λ/4 dielectric coating. SF14 – uncoated isosceles prisms. OC – output coupler. b) Low pump beam quality makes the laser prone to multimode operation, which is easily observed by a photodiode as the circulation of pulse energy between lobes of higher-order modes on subsequent passes. c) Restricting the cavity to single-mode operation results in even pulsing at 113 MHz with 300 mW of average power. d) Output spectrum is 3.7 nm wide and centered near 1033 nm, indicating sech<sup>2</sup> transform-limited pulse width of 310 fs. e) Spectrum of the transmitted pump light. The narrow Yb:KYW absorption peak near 981 nm is readily visible; the pump wavelength must be temperature-tuned to overlap it for maximum output power and stability. f) Output power variability. With the off-axis pumping arrangement the laser is capable of very quiet operation.</p>
