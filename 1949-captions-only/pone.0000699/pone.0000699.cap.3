Video-rate acquisition permits patch-clamping without the use of a separate camera. b) Fluorescence image of a cortical L2/3 pyramidal cell filled with the fluorescent dye FM 4–64. Inset: zoom onto the 10×10 µm area outlined in the image showing dendritic spines. c,d) <em>x</em>–<em>y</em> and <em>z</em>–<em>y</em> projections of a 100 µm deep stack of one quadrant of the basal dendritic tree of a cortical L2/3 pyramidal cell filled with the voltage-sensitive dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Thin processes at 100 µm depth can be observed easily. The axial resolution is worse than the objective's limit because we deliberately underilluminate the back aperture. All images were acquired with a 60×0.9NA water-immersion objective and have 100×100 µm field of view.</p>
