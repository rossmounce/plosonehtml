The nominal aperture of the deflector we use is approximately the size of the entire trace in a,b). c) A frequency sweep makes an acousto-optic deflector act&nbsp;as a lens, so the output beam can be made to converge or diverge depending on the direction of the sweep. d) The lensing induced in this manner translates into axial displacement of the focus from the nominal focal plane of the objective. e) Large volumes can be scanned rapidly through the use of bidirectional line sweeps. By underilluminating the back-aperture of an objective the axial point-spread function (PSF) can be extended to match the excursion from the nominal focal plane caused by the frequency sweep, so a sweep in one direction can be made to excite a large number of sparsely labeled neurons in a thick slab of tissue to either side of the nominal focal plane. The images show two focal planes, displaced by 40 Âµm in <em>z</em>, of EYFP-labeled neurons in mouse olfactory bulb taken simultaneously without moving the objective.</p>
