With 25 MS of sample memory and 250 MS/s sampling rate (arrow), photons can be counted for 100 ms per episode with 80% detection probability. b) Electrical and unfiltered optical (10 kHz) traces of an action potential in a rat cortical pyramidal neuron loaded with the potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. The traces are averages of four recordings.</p>
