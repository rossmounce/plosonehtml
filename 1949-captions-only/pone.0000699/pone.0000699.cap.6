                Figure 6.  Fluorescence lifetime imaging.a) The high temporal resolution of oscilloscope data acquisition enables the measurement of temporal delay between an exciting laser pulse and a fluorescence photon. A histogram b) of relative arrival times measured in this manner can be fit to measure the fluorescence lifetime of fluorophores at the scanned location. By performing this measurement at every pixel (or voxel) a fluorescence lifetime image is constructed. c) Mouse hippocampal tissue loaded extracellularly with the dye FM 4â€“64. d) Fluorescence lifetime image clearly reveals Thy1.2-EYFP neurons (orange) within the background staining (green). Video-rate imaging of transmitted light or of fluorescence intensity can be used for guided patching of neurons that are first identified by their fluorescence lifetime.
