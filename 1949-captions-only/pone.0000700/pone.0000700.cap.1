                Figure 1.  Hyperexcitability in the CA1 region of the hippocampus after in vivo activity-blockade.Forty-eight hours after implantation of the control or TTX-containing Elvax polymer, extracellular field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region in acute hippocampal slices in response to low-frequency electrical stimulation of the stratum radiatum. The figure shows summary data of the population spike amplitudes from TTX-treated and control rats (for number of slices and animals, see text), with example traces in the inserts.
