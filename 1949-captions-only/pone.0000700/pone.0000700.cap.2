                Figure 2.  Unchanged amplitude, but increased frequency of mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells from adult animals after in vivo TTX-application.(A) Summary data (from all cells) of the mEPSC amplitudes in TTX-treated and control adult rats are shown in the form of cumulative probability plots (for numbers of events and animals, see main text); the bar graph shows the same data in the form of averagesÂ±SEM, and the insert displays representative averages of mEPSCs from single cells. (B) Summary data of the inter-event intervals of mEPSCs, with example traces.
