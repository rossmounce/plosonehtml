(A) mEPSCs from juveniles (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.27(Cont)−2.14; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). (B) mIPSCs from adults (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.22(Cont)+2.65; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95). (C) mIPSCs from juveniles (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.33(Cont)−6.77; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97). The scaled-back post-TTX event amplitudes (for details, see main text) remained significantly different from the control amplitudes, indicating lack of multiplicative scaling.</p>
