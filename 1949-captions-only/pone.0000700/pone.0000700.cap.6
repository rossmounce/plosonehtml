                Figure 6.  Lack of multiplicative scaling after in vivo TTX-treatment.(A–C) Plots of miniature events, ranked by amplitude, from TTX-treated versus control cells are shown; inserts: cumulative distribution plots of control amplitudes and scaled TTX events (for scaling details see text; scaling factors: juvenile mEPSCs = 1.27; adult mIPSCs = 1.22; juvenile mIPSCs = 1.33). (A) mEPSCs from juveniles (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.27(Cont)−2.14; R2 = 0.99). (B) mIPSCs from adults (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.22(Cont)+2.65; R2 = 0.95). (C) mIPSCs from juveniles (linear fit equation; TTX = 1.33(Cont)−6.77; R2 = 0.97). The scaled-back post-TTX event amplitudes (for details, see main text) remained significantly different from the control amplitudes, indicating lack of multiplicative scaling.
