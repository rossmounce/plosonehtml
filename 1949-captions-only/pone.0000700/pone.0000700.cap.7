                Figure 7.  Increased intrinsic excitability in CA1 cells from adult and juvenile rats after in vivo TTX-application.(A,B) Summary plots of action potential numbers as a function of current injection (from âˆ’60 mV; duration: 500ms; for number of cells and animals, see main text) from adult (A) and juvenile (B) rats, with representative traces from single cells. Asterisks indicate significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between the control and TTX groups.
