The parameter space consists of three regions. If <em>l</em><sub>CI</sub>&lt;<em>f</em> then <em>Wolbachia</em> is lost in both populations. If <em>l</em><sub>CI</sub>â‰¥<em>f</em> then <em>Wolbachia</em> persists on the mainland and can spread on the island only if migration is above the critical migration rate but cannot if migration is below this threshold. The critical migration rate separates the latter region from the other two and increases with increasing selection coefficient <em>s</em>.</p>
