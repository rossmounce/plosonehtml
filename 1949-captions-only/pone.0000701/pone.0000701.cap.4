                Figure 4.  Equilibrium frequencies of P2 after introduction on the island with the low frequency of 0.1%.Black squares indicate simulation results, gray circles values determined by formula (16). The figure illustrates the finding that P2 spreads on the island if the CI level is above a threshold but goes to extinction if the CI level is below. Parameters are a2 = 10, f = 0.1, s = 0.1, m = 0.003.
