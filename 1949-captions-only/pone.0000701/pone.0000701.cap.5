                Figure 5.  Thresholds for the spread of the mating preference mutant.Graph (a): The parameter plane spanned by the preference strength and the CI level consists of two areas. For low levels of CI, P2 cannot spread no matter how strong the mating preference is. For CI levels above a certain threshold, however, P2 spreads on the island. Black squares indicate simulation results, gray circles values determined by formula (17). Graph (b): The parameter space spanned by the CI level and the migration rate consists of four areas. First, if lCI&lt;f then mainland and island are uninfected and P2 cannot spread. Second, if m&gt;mc then both mainland and island are infected and P2 cannot spread. Third and fourth, if lCI&gt;f and m&lt;mc then P2 can spread if the CI level is above a threshold but cannot if the CI level is below. Parameters are f = 0.1 in both graphs, m = 0.001, s = 0.1 in (a), and a2 = 10, s = 1 in (b).
