For reference, the position of <em>Agrp</em> exonic sequence is shown on either axis, with coding sequence in red and non-coding sequence in grey. Sequence similarity between forward and reverse strands is plotted in black and red, respectively. (B) Shows the genomic locus containing <em>Agrp</em> and neighboring genes, <em>MKIAA1930</em> and <em>Atp6v0d1</em>. The blue boxes indicate areas of mouse/human sequence conservation located within a functionally defined <em>Agrp</em> regulatory region <a href="#pone.0000702-Kaelin2">[16]</a>. The relative position of the conserved IREs (in yellow) and the STAT binding sites (in red) upstream of <em>Agrp</em> are illustrated below. Sequence similarity and the symmetrical structure of the elements reveal an ancient duplication within the <em>Agrp</em> region, the axis of which is indicated by a vertical, dashed line.</p>
