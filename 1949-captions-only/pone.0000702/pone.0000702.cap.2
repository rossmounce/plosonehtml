The RS scores associated with significantly constrained regions (shown as blue boxes) are reported in <a href="#pone-0000702-t001">Table 1</a>. Coordinates refer to the position in mouse genomic sequence relative to the first position of the <em>Agrp</em> translational start site. While GERP analysis is independent of sequence annotation, constrained sequences overlap with the IREs (yellow), putative STAT and FoxO1 binding elements (red and green, respectively), and <em>Agrp</em> coding regions (red). (B) Sequence alignments indicating the relative conservation of putative FoxO1 and STAT binding sites, with consensus sites shown below the alignments.</p>
