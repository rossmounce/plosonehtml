                Figure 2.  GERP constraint plot for the Agrp genomic locus.(A) A plot illustrating evolutionary constraint variation, measured by GERP, within a 1.8 kbp alignment of 10 mammalian species across the Agrp locus. The RS scores associated with significantly constrained regions (shown as blue boxes) are reported in Table 1. Coordinates refer to the position in mouse genomic sequence relative to the first position of the Agrp translational start site. While GERP analysis is independent of sequence annotation, constrained sequences overlap with the IREs (yellow), putative STAT and FoxO1 binding elements (red and green, respectively), and Agrp coding regions (red). (B) Sequence alignments indicating the relative conservation of putative FoxO1 and STAT binding sites, with consensus sites shown below the alignments.
