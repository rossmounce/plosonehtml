To demonstrate their sequence homology, distal IRE and proximal IRE are shown in a forward and reverse orientation, respectively. Both IREs contain multiple conserved sequence motifs, including palindromic (PI-PIII) and direct (DRI) repeat sequences (shaded in grey), which likely function as transcription factor binding modules. Putative homeodomain transcription factor binding motifs are outlined in red.</p>
