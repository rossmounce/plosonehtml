The transcriptional start position has only been mapped for human <em>Agrp</em>, as indicated. The orientation of the IREs with respect to each other is indicated with black arrows. Notably, the position of the regulatory region(s) relative to the transcription unit varies in different species. (B) A sequence alignment of the STAT site and IRE, in chicken (ch), platypus (pl), opossum (op), and human (hu), which comprises the region represented by the proximal IRE, “B”, shown in (A). Sequences conserved between chicken and mammalian species are shaded in grey and include the STAT binding element and two putative homeodomain binding motifs (HD). Also, an 18 bp sequence within the IRE is perfectly conserved between chicken and platypus (outlined in blue).</p>
