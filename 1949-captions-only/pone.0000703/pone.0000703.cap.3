                Figure 3.  Schematic diagram of 10 possible combinations for rho and epsilon expression and their relative percentages.rho(−/−)epsilon(−/−) is not counted. rho(+/−)epsilon(+/−) data includes both scenarios. The statistics on ++/−− and +−/−+ in the text includes data from this and additional analysis focusing only on rho(+/−)epsilon(+/−) nuclei.
