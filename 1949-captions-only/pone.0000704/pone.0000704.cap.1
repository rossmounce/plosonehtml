                Figure 1.  Generation of Xenopus with transgene expression of p24α3 or p24δ2 specifically in the melanotrope cells.(A and B) Schematic representation of the linear injection fragments pPOMC-p24α3-GFP (A) and pPOMC-p24δ2-GFP (B) containing a Xenopus POMC gene promoter fragment (pPOMC) and the protein-coding sequence of p24α3-GFP (transgenic lines #605, #55 and #602) or p24δ2-GFP (lines #125, #115, #124 and #224); pPOMC drives transgene expression specifically to the melanotrope cells. (C) Pituitary-specific GFP-fluorescence (arrows) in living tadpoles transgenic for p24α3 (line #55) or p24δ2 (line #224); G, gut; E, eye; N, nose. (D) Fluorescence in the intermediate lobe (IL) and not in the anterior lobe (AL) of the pituitary of adult frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224).
