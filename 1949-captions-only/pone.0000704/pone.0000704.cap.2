                Figure 2.  Analysis of p24α3 or p24δ2 fusion protein expression in transgenic Xenopus intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells.(A and B) Western blot analysis of neurointermediate lobe lysates from wild-type frogs (wt) and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224) with anti-p24 antibodies (A) or an anti-GFP antibody (B). Tubulin was used as a control for equal loading. (C and D) Immuno-electron microscopy analysis of intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells from frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55; C) or p24δ2 (#224; D1 and D2) using an anti-GFP antibody. The p24α3-transgene product was mainly present in ER-localized electron-dense structures (EDS; C), whereas the p24δ2-transgene product was found on the ER (D1) and on the Golgi (D2). G, Golgi; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. Bars equal 200 nm.
