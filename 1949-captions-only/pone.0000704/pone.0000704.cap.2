Tubulin was used as a control for equal loading. (C and D) Immuno-electron microscopy analysis of intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells from frogs transgenic for p24α<sub>3</sub> (#55; C) or p24δ<sub>2</sub> (#224; D1 and D2) using an anti-GFP antibody. The p24α<sub>3</sub>-transgene product was mainly present in ER-localized electron-dense structures (EDS; C), whereas the p24δ<sub>2</sub>-transgene product was found on the ER (D1) and on the Golgi (D2). G, Golgi; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. Bars equal 200 nm.</p>
