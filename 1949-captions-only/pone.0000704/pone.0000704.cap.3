                Figure 3.  Steady-state levels of secretory cargo proteins in wild-type and transgenic Xenopus intermediate pituitary cells.Western blot analysis of neurointermediate lobe (NIL) lysates from wild-type frogs (wt) and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224) using antibodies directed against the soluble cargo proteins proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), and the transmembrane cargo amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). Tubulin was used as a control for equal loading.
