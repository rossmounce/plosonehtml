                Figure 4.  The effect of p24α3- or p24δ2-transgene expression on POMC biosynthesis and processing in Xenopus melanotropes.(A–C) Neurointermediate lobes (NILs) from wild-type frogs (wt) and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224) were pulse labeled with [35S]-Met/Cys for 30 min and subsequently chased for 3 hrs. Newly synthesized proteins extracted from the NILs (Cells; 5% of extract) and secreted into the incubation medium (Media; 20%) were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. (A) The analysis was performed in six independent experiments and a representative autoradiogram is shown. (B) The amount of newly synthesized 37K POMC in wild-type (n = 16) and the p24α3-transgenic (n = 10) and p24δ2-transgenic (n = 6) cells was quantified and is shown relative to the wild-type cells. (C) The amounts of newly synthesized 18K and 18K* POMC in wild-type (n = 12) and the p24α3-transgenic (n = 5) and p24δ2-transgenic (n = 6) cells were quantified and are shown relative to wild-type 18K POMC. Indicated are the 18K/18K* ratios and their statistical evaluations. Data are shown as means +/− SEM. n.s., not significant; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001.
