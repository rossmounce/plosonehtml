                Figure 5.  Newly synthesized 18K and 18K* POMC differ in N-glycosylation.Neurointermediate lobes (NILs) from wild-type frogs (wt) and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224) were pulse labeled with [35S]-Met/Cys for 30 min and subsequently chased for 3 hrs. Newly synthesized proteins extracted from the NILs were deglycosylated with PNGaseF (F) or control-treated (C), resolved by 20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography; the #55 lanes were exposed three times longer than the other lanes.
