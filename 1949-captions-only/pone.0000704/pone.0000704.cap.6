Newly synthesized proteins extracted from the NILs were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and the amount of [<sup>35</sup>S]SO<sub>4</sub> and <sup>3</sup>H-lysine incorporated into newly-synthesized 37K POMC was determined. Shown are the amounts of newly synthesized sulfated 37K POMC produced in the transgenic relative to wt NILs. Data are shown as means +/− SEM (wt, n = 7; transgenics, n = 5). *, p&lt;0.05; n.s., not significant.</p>
