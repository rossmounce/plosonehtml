                Figure 6.  Sulfation of newly synthesized POMC in wild-type and transgenic Xenopus intermediate pituitary cells.Neurointermediate lobes (NILs) from wild-type frogs (wt) and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55) or p24δ2 (#224) were pulse labeled with 35S-sulfate and 3H-lysine for 15 min. Newly synthesized proteins extracted from the NILs were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and the amount of [35S]SO4 and 3H-lysine incorporated into newly-synthesized 37K POMC was determined. Shown are the amounts of newly synthesized sulfated 37K POMC produced in the transgenic relative to wt NILs. Data are shown as means +/− SEM (wt, n = 7; transgenics, n = 5). *, p&lt;0.05; n.s., not significant.
