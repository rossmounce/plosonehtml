                Figure 7.  Electron microscopy analysis of wild-type and transgenic melanotrope cells.(A–C) Wild-type (wt; A1 and A2) intermediate pituitary cells showed a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and extensive Golgi-ribbons. The p24α3-transgenic cells (#55; B1 and B2) contained Golgi mini-stacks and large electron-dense structures (EDS). The p24δ2-transgenic cells (#224; C1 and C2) showed an ultrastructure similar to that of wild-type cells. The dotted lines highlight the outline of the Golgi. (D–F) Immuno-electron microscopy analysis of intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells from wt frogs (D), and frogs transgenic for p24α3 (#55; E) or p24δ2 (#224; F) using an anti-POMC antiserum. Immunoreactivity was found in dense-core secretory granules (filled arrowheads) in wt and p24α3- and p24δ2-transgenic cells and occasionally in newly forming secretion granules still attached to the trans-Golgi network (open arrowheads). In addition, in the p24α3-transgenic cells a strong POMC-immunolabeling was observed in the EDS, which were localized to the ER lumen (arrow) and occasionally in EDS newly forming within the ER lumen (open arrow). G, Golgi; L, lysosome; M, mitochondrion; N, nucleus; RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; sg, immature secretory granules. Bars equal 1 µm (A–C); 500 nm (D–F).
