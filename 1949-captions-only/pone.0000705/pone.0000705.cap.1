Hybridomas were derived from the pooled spleens of 3 BALB/c mice 5 months after intranasal MHV-68 infection. Each mAb that recognized unfixed, MHV-68-infected BHK-21 cells was typed for its glycoprotein target as outlined in <a href="#pone-0000705-t001">Table 1</a>. None remained unaccounted for. The data shown are from 1 fusion experiment that generated 128 glycoprotein-specific mAbs. 5 further experiments all gave similar results. B. BHK-21 cells were either uninfected (UI, solid lines) or infected with wild-type MHV-68 (2 PFU/cell, 18h: vir, dashed lines) and stained with mAbs specific for gp70 or gp150. Histograms for 3 mAbs, all used in saturating amounts, are overlaid in each graph. Gp70-specific staining was consistently stronger than that of other viral glycoproteins, including gp150. C. BHK-21 cells were either uninfected (UI, solid lines) or infected (2 PFU/cell, 18h) with wild-type (WT, dashed lines), gp150-deficient (gp150 KO, dotted lines) or gp70-deficient (gp70 KO, dotted lines) viruses. The cells were then stained with sera from mice infected with wild-type, gp150-deficient or gp70-deficient viruses, or from age-matched naive mice.</p>
