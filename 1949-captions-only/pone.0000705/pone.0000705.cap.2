Gp150 comprises an N-terminal signal sequence, a small N-terminal domain, a long stalk rich in anionic residues, proline residues and potential O-glycosylation sites (A/D/E/P/T/S-rich domain), a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. Our analysis focussed on the membrane-distal half of the protein. B. GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained. Longer regions of the stalk domain were less well expressed than shorter forms and were subject to more degradation. C. MAb recognition was mapped by ELISA with GST fusion proteins covering the gp150 extracellular domain. Examples of fusion protein recognition are shown (mAbs T1A1, T4G2 and 150-41, with their deduced recognition sites given below). Despite the limited amino acid diversity of gp150, little mAb cross-reactivity was evident between the expressed protein segments. The gH/gL-specific mAb T4C5 provided a negative control. D. Recognition patterns were confirmed by flow cytometric staining of 293T cells transfected with either full-length gp150 or the N-terminal 151 residues of gp150 with a GPI membrane anchor. Examples of staining are shown. Control = secondary antibody only. E. More detailed analysis of the N21-C151 region, which accounted for most gp150-specific mAbs, using N-terminal gp150 truncations. Virus = wells coated with 0.01% Triton X-100-disrupted MHV-68 virions, GST = GST alone. Examples of recognition patterns are shown. The gp70-specific mAb 6H10 provided a negative control for gp150 recognition. F. Summary of GST fusion protein recognition by 81 gp150-specific mAbs. G. MAb specificities within the 108-151 region were mapped with overlapping 15-mer biotinylated peptides bound to avidin-coated plates. The amino acid residues covered by each peptide are indicated. Examples of recognition patterns are shown with the total number of mAbs showing that pattern.</p>
