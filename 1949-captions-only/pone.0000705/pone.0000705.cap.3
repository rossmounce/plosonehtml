                Figure 3.  Effect of gp150-specific mAbs on MHV-68 virion infectivity.A. EGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated with hybridoma supernatants (1 h, 37°C) and then added to RAW264.7 macrophages (3 PFU/cell). 18h later, the number of infected cells was determined by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression. The mAbs are grouped by the region of gp150 recognized. The bars indicate the %eGFP+ RAW264.7 cells in each culture. B. EGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated (1 h, 37°C) with dilutions of the gp150-specific mAb T4G2 and then added to either BHK-21 fibroblasts or RAW264.7 macrophages. 18h later, the number of infected cells was determined by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression. The data shown are representative of 3 equivalent experiments C. EGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated with gp150-specific mAbs (T7F5, T1A1), with immune serum, or with no antibody and then added to normal, GAG+ CHO cells or to the GAG-deficient CHO cell mutant pgs-745 (GAG−). Infection was quantitated 18h later by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression.
