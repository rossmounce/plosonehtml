Wild-type MHV-68 virions (1000 PFU/sample) were incubated with sera pooled from 5 mice 2 months after infection with gp150<sup>+</sup> (WT, REV) or gp150<sup>−</sup> (M7<sup>-</sup>FRT, M7<sup>-</sup>STOP) viruses and then used to infect BHK-21 cells. Control samples were BHK-21 cells infected with virus and no antibody. B. Sera from C57BL/6 mice 3 months after infection with wild-type (WT) or M7<sup>-</sup>STOP (gp150<sup>−</sup>) MHV-68 was used to inhibit wild-type MHV-68 infection of BHK-21 cells. Despite variation between individual mice, plaque titers were significantly lower with the 2% and 6% sera from gp150 knockout-infected mice (p&lt;0.01 by Student's t test).</p>
