                Figure 5.  The antibody response to gp150 tends to reduce rather than enhance MHV-68 neutralization.A. Wild-type MHV-68 virions (1000 PFU/sample) were incubated with sera pooled from 5 mice 2 months after infection with gp150+ (WT, REV) or gp150− (M7-FRT, M7-STOP) viruses and then used to infect BHK-21 cells. Control samples were BHK-21 cells infected with virus and no antibody. B. Sera from C57BL/6 mice 3 months after infection with wild-type (WT) or M7-STOP (gp150−) MHV-68 was used to inhibit wild-type MHV-68 infection of BHK-21 cells. Despite variation between individual mice, plaque titers were significantly lower with the 2% and 6% sera from gp150 knockout-infected mice (p&lt;0.01 by Student's t test).
