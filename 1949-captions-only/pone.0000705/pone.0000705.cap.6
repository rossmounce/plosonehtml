                Figure 6.  gp150-specific immunity in carrier mice increases FcR-dependent infection and has no effect on neutralization.A. BHK-21 cells were left uninfected (solid lines) or infected (2PFU/cell 18h) with MHV-68 (dashed lines) or VAC-150 (dotted lines), then assayed for cell surface gp150 expression by flow cytometry. MAb T4G2 recognizes an epitope in gp150 amino acid residues 108–151. MAb T1A1 recognizes an epitope in amino acid residues 152–269. VAC-150 expresses residues 1–151 with a GPI anchor. B. BALB/c (BC) or C57BL/6J (B6) mice were either left uninfected or infected with VAC-gp150. At the times post-infection indicated, sera were incubated with eGFP-expressing MHV-68. The serum/virus mixtures were then used to infect RAW264.7 macrophages. Infection was quantitated 18h later by flow cytometric assay of viral eGFP expression. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. C. C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with MHV-68. 3 months later they were boosted with VAC-150 (+VAC-150) or a control vaccinia virus expressing the Herpes simplex virus gE (+VAC-gE) or left unboosted (MHV-68). Naive = age-matched, uninfected mice. Immune sera were pooled from groups of 3 mice. A and B are separate pools for each treatment arm. The sera were assayed by ELISA for reactivity against N-terminal (residues 21–151) or C-terminal (residues 269–461) fragments of gp150. Only the N-terminal part is expressed by VAC-150. D. The same sera as in C were added to eGFP+ MHV-68 virions and the mixtures added to RAW264.7 cells. 18h later, eGFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. E. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were either left uninfected (naive), infected with MHV-68 or VAC-gp150, or infected with MHV-68 and then boosted with VAC-gp150. Pooled sera from these mice (5 per group) were then tested for MHV-68 neutralization by plaque assay. Infection with VAC-gp150 made no detectable difference to neutralization titers. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.
