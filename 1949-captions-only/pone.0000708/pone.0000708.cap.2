                Figure 2.  Evolutionary changes of the number of OR genes in mammals.(A) The numbers in rectangular boxes are those of functional OR genes for the extant or ancestral species. The Euarchontoglires tree topology is used. We used a 70% bootstrap condensed tree of OR genes, but the results were essentially the same when 50%, 60%, 80%, and 90% bootstrap condensed trees were used (see Table S1 and Figure S4A). (B) Schematic representation of the results of (A). A plus sign and a minus sign for a branch represent 150 gene gains and losses, respectively. The evolutionary timescale is shown at the bottom in million years (MY). The divergence times were obtained from Murphy et al. [43] except for the time of the human-macaque divergence, which was taken from Glazko and Nei [44]. (C) Results obtained by using the mouse-outside tree and a 70% bootstrap condensed tree. The results for 50%, 60%, 80%, and 90% bootstrap condensed trees were given in Table S2 and Figure S4B.
