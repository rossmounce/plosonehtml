The Euarchontoglires tree topology is used. We used a 70% bootstrap condensed tree of OR genes, but the results were essentially the same when 50%, 60%, 80%, and 90% bootstrap condensed trees were used (see <a href="#pone.0000708.s002">Table S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0000708.s004">Figure S4A</a>). (B) Schematic representation of the results of (A). A plus sign and a minus sign for a branch represent 150 gene gains and losses, respectively. The evolutionary timescale is shown at the bottom in million years (MY). The divergence times were obtained from Murphy et al. <a href="#pone.0000708-Murphy2">[43]</a> except for the time of the human-macaque divergence, which was taken from Glazko and Nei <a href="#pone.0000708-Glazko1">[44]</a>. (C) Results obtained by using the mouse-outside tree and a 70% bootstrap condensed tree. The results for 50%, 60%, 80%, and 90% bootstrap condensed trees were given in <a href="#pone.0000708.s003">Table S2</a> and <a href="#pone.0000708.s007">Figure S4B</a>.</p>
