                Figure 2.  Immunocytochemical localization of mGluR5/DGL-α (A, B) and CB1R/ DGL-α (C, D) in mouse prPFC cortical layers V/VI.Double preembedding immunogold and immunoperoxidase methods for electron microscopy. (A, B) mGluR5 metal particles (arrows) and DGL-α immunodeposits colocalized in postsynaptic dendrites (den) and dendritic spines (s). mGluR5 labeling was in perisynaptic and extrasynaptic membranes. No mGluR5/DGL-α immunoreactivity was observed in presynaptic terminals (T). (C, D) CB1R immunoparticles were on presynaptic terminals membranes (T) away from synaptic specializations made on postsynaptic DGL-α-immunoreactive dendritic spines (s). Observe that DGL-α-positive spines also received CB1R-immunonegative synaptic terminals, and that a CB1R-labeled presynaptic terminal (thick arrow) probably of inhibitory nature (IT in D) made a synapse with a postsynaptic DGL-α-negative dendritic branchlet. Scale bars: 0.5 µm.
