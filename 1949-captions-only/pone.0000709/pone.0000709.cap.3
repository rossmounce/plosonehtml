                Figure 3.  Pharmacological characterization of presynaptic CB1R at layer V-VI synapses of the PrPFC.Layer V-VI pyramidal cells were voltage-clamped and held at -70mV. (A) CB1R-mediated inhibition of evoked transmission. The cannabimimetic CP55,940 (10 µM) reduced evoked EPSCs on average to 48±5 % (n = 6) of basal value. Traces represent the average of 10 consecutive EPSCs taken at the times indicated on the time-course graph. (B) The inhibitory effects of CP55,940 on evoked EPSCs were blocked by pre-treatment with the selective CB1R antagonist SR141716A (10 µM, t-test p = 0.0386) in agreement with the involvement of CB1R. (C) Dose response curve measured 20 min after beginning CP55,940 application. Each point is expressed as the percentage of inhibition of its basal value. The EC50 was 195±0.3 nM. (D) The coefficient of variation, expressed as 1/CV2 was reduced following the CP55,940 (p = 0.0107 paired t-test). 1/CV2 was calculated with 60 sweeps i.e. 10 min before and 20 min after CP55,940.
