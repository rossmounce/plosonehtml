                Figure 4.  Presynaptic CB1R-mediated LTD in the PrPFC.(A) Left: A 10 min 10 Hz stimulation of layer II-III fibers (arrow) induced a profound long-term depression of evoked EPSCs recorded in patch-clamped layer V-VI pyramidal neurons. The induction of LTD was completely prevented when slices were preincubated and tetanized in the presence of the CB1R antagonist AM251 (4 µM). Traces represent the average of 12 consecutive EPSCs before and 25 minutes after LTD induction in the absence (upper left) or presence (upper right) of AM251. Right: The coefficient of variation, 1/CV2, was significantly reduced after induction of eCB-LTD (p = 0.0025 paired t-test). Calibration bars: x: 50 ms, y: 100 pA. (B) Representative continuous 3 seconds sweeps showing the spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) recorded before (left) and after eCB-LTD induction (right). The distribution of sEPSCs inter-event intervals (left panel) but not of their amplitude (right panel) was modified following induction of LTD suggesting a presynaptic modulation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: inter event interval p&lt;0.005, amplitude p = 0.507). Calibration bars: x: 100 ms, y: 10 pA. (C) Responses to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing somatic current pulses of a typical pyramidal neuron in the PFC before and after induction of eCB-LTD. Similar I–V curves were obtained suggesting that eCB-LTD induction did not change post-synaptic pyramidal neurons properties. Calibration bars: x: 100 ms, y: 25 mV.
