(B) The mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (10 µM) completely blocked eCB-LTD (C) Bar graph summarizing experiments showing that the non subtype selective group 1mGluR antagonist LY341495 (50 µM) and the Phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 both prevented eCB-LTD induction. 45 min after the end of the tetanus, the fEPSPs was 76.6±2.64% (n = 62) of baseline in control and 95.8±4.85% (n = 12, p = 0.004 t-test) and 96.33±6.4% (n = 11, p = 0.0009 t-test) in LY341495, respectively. (D) eCB-LTD requires postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise. Time course of all the experiments performed where the recording pipette was filled with BAPTA (20 mM, n = 11) and where eCB-LTD was completely blocked.</p>
