                Figure 6.  Role of 2-AG in eCB-LTD LTD in the PrPFC.(A) Typical experiment showing that a 5 min stimulation at 10 Hz is sub threshold to induce LTD, even when applied two consecutives times. Calibration bars: x: 10 ms, y: 0.2 mV. (B) Representative experiment showing that 5 min at 10 Hz can induce LTD when applied after bath perfusion with URB 602 (100 µM). Traces were taken at the time indicated on corresponding graph. Calibration bars: x: 10 ms, y: 0.2 mV. (C) Summary bar histogram of all the experiments performed where the first tetanus was given in saline and the second tetanus was given after bath perfusion of URB602. LTD was induced only when URB was present (t-test, p = 0.0271). (D) Averaged time courses of the experiments in which the 5min at 10Hz protocol was given in control ACSF (open circles) of after pre-treatment with URB597 (2 µM, black triangles) or URB602 (black circles).
