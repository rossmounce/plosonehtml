Major axis slopes and 95% confidence intervals: male 0.7847 (0.74–0.83), female 0.6988 (0.65–0. 75). The FHT value for specimen KNM-ER 406 is a conservative estimate as the subnasal region is slightly damaged <a href="#pone.0000710-Wood3">[28]</a>. However, a small increase in FHT would align this cranium even more closely to the male ontogenetic trajectory.</p>
