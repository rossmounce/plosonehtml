                Figure 1.  Male and female H. sapiens ontogenetic trajectories plotted with fossil hominin crania.The relationship between bizygomatic width (BZW) and upper facial height (FHT) shows a departure from ontogenetic scaling. Major axis slopes and 95% confidence intervals: male 0.7847 (0.74–0.83), female 0.6988 (0.65–0. 75). The FHT value for specimen KNM-ER 406 is a conservative estimate as the subnasal region is slightly damaged [28]. However, a small increase in FHT would align this cranium even more closely to the male ontogenetic trajectory.
