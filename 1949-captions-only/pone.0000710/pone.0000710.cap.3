                Figure 3.  A comparison of male and female skeletal traits versus dental category (age class) for Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla.For the chimpanzee, sexual size dimorphism is shown to be statistically significant in BZW in age classes 6 and 7 (A) and no significant sexual size dimorphism is evident in FHT for any age class (B). For the gorilla, sexual size dimorphism is evident in BZW (C) and FHT (D) for age classes 4, 5, and 7; BZW and FHT are sexually dimorphic in size as adults (age class 7). Age classes 1â€“7 plotted on the x axis; each class with females (F) plotted first and then males (M). Trait size on y axis (cm). The box plots indicate the median in white and the quantiles in colour. The dotted lines indicate the data range with outliers shown as isolated bars (for sample analysed see electronic Appendix in [17]).
