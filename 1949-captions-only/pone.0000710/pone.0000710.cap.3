For the gorilla, sexual size dimorphism is evident in BZW (C) and FHT (D) for age classes 4, 5, and 7; BZW and FHT are sexually dimorphic in size as adults (age class 7). Age classes 1â€“7 plotted on the <em>x</em> axis; each class with females (F) plotted first and then males (M). Trait size on <em>y</em> axis (cm). The box plots indicate the median in white and the quantiles in colour. The dotted lines indicate the data range with outliers shown as isolated bars (for sample analysed see electronic Appendix in <a href="#pone.0000710-Weston1">[17]</a>).</p>
