<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>This study provides the first regional scale and long-term analysis of coral cover in the Indo-Pacific. Our results indicate that the loss of coral cover began earlier than assumed and that coral cover is currently very similar across the Indo-Pacific, suggesting that coral decline is a general global phenomenon.</p>

<h4>Data sources</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Our analyses were based on quantitative surveys that measured the percentage of the bottom covered by living scleractinian corals on subtidal coral reefs (1–15 m depth, mean survey depth was 6.2 m) within ten subregions of the Indo-Pacific (<a href="#pone-0000711-g001">Fig. 1</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711.s005">Table S1</a>). We included data from several sources including the published results of academic, governmental, and non-governmental organization (NGO) scientists and, for one source (Reef Check), volunteers trained and supervised by professional scientists (<a href="#pone.0000711.s006">Table S2</a>). We used a number of online literature search tools (e.g., ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar) to find published peer review and gray literature sources of coral cover data (<a href="#pone.0000711.s002">Text S2</a>) using search terms including “coral” and “cover”, “reef” and “health”. We also browsed all available issues of several relevant journals including Atoll Research Bulletin, Coral Reefs, Marine Pollution Bulletin, and the Proceedings of the International Coral Reef Symposium and similar regional symposia on reef ecology and conservation. All of the data collected before 1984 are from such published sources or ReefBase.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>Coral cover data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science's (AIMS) Long Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) <a href="#pone.0000711-Sweatman1">[28]</a> were available for 1986–2004 and NGOs only began intensive reef monitoring a decade ago (<a href="#pone.0000711.s006">Table S2</a>). Therefore, there is a shift in the dominant data sources over time as well as a standardization of survey techniques. All reef monitoring databases that we obtained coral cover data from are publicly accessible. Portions of the coral cover data from these sources including AIMS, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Hawaii Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP), and Reef Check (<a href="#pone.0000711.s006">Table S2</a>) have been published independently <a href="#pone.0000711-Hodgson1">[29]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Ninio1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Sweatman1">[28]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Jokiel1">[30]</a>. However, they have not previously been analyzed collectively or combined with other data sources or published as a comprehensive evaluation of regional coral cover change and status.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3"></a><p>Most surveys were based on the line transect technique or some variant to estimate coral cover. A transect (typically 10–30 m in length and usually a tape measure or chain) is placed on the reef, oriented either along a depth contour or down the reef slope. Coral cover is then estimated either <em>in situ</em> by recording the number of points along each transect (at either set intervals or random locations) that overlay a living hard coral (the point intercept technique) or by taking digital or film images of the bottom at these points within quadrats (usually 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> or 1.0 m<sup>2</sup>). In most surveys, multiple transects or quadrats were used to estimate cover at a given reef, producing more than one cover value. We always pooled such replicate cover measurements from one depth/zone into a single mean estimate.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4"></a><p>We also included data from manta tow surveys of coral cover <a href="#pone.0000711-Miller1">[31]</a> performed by the AIMS LTMP (1231 surveys performed at 136 reefs between 1986 and 2003). AIMS uses extensive training <a href="#pone.0000711-Miller2">[32]</a> and quality control procedures <a href="#pone.0000711-Miller1">[31]</a> to verify the validity of their manta tow surveys, which are unbiased and highly comparable to surveys based on video transects <a href="#pone.0000711-Miller3">[33]</a>. The manta tow technique is frequently used to perform broadscale reef surveys [e.g., 34]. Because we were not able to verify the validity and reproducibility of manta tow surveys performed by other organizations, we only included AIMS manta tow data in our analyses.</p>


<h4>Reef monitoring data</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Most of the reefs in the database were surveyed only once, but a subset of 651 reefs were surveyed two or more times (<a href="#pone.0000711.s007">Table S3</a>). In most cases, transects or manta tow paths on these monitoring sites were permanently marked or recorded using GPS so that the exact same location on each reef could be resurveyed in subsequent years. There are more monitoring sites on the GBR than within other subregions, especially from 1984 to 1996. However, 67% of the monitoring sites were within the other nine subregions, and some other subregions including the Philippines and mainland Asia also had a relatively large number of monitoring sites (<a href="#pone.0000711.s007">Table S3</a>).</p>


<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Linear repeated measures regression analysis was used to test the null hypothesis that there was no relationship between coral cover and time from 1968 to 2004. We were unable to perform a formal meta-analysis because several critical components (e.g., variance estimates, sample size, repeated sampling of each reef, etc.) were not available for all data sets. We used Stata (version 9.1, STATA Corp.) and performed two sets of analyses: (1) on the annual subregional means based on all 6001 surveys, and (2) on the data from the 651 monitoring sites. In both analyses, time (year) and coral cover were treated as continuous variables. Because locations were repeatedly sampled over time, coral cover estimates of a given subregion or reef in different years were not independent. This longitudinal structure was incorporated into the statistical model by using repeated measures of subregions or reefs. Thus, statistical estimates of the absolute net decline in coral cover were based on the individual trajectories of subregions or reefs and were not derived by pooling all the data for each year. For these and all other analyses, data were transformed when necessary to meet basic statistical assumptions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>In the subregion analysis, we used the mean cover in each subregion for each year as the dependent variable, rather than the individual reef means, in part because the sample size varied greatly among years, periods, and subregions. Performing this analysis on yearly subregional averages equalizes the influence of each subregion and prevents the results from being driven primarily by especially well-sampled subregions like the GBR and the Philippines (<a href="#pone.0000711.s007">Table S3</a>). However, this procedure did not remove the influence of either intentionally or unintentionally biased sampling within subregions that could have caused the estimated coral cover means to differ from the true subregional population means.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3"></a><p>For the analysis of the reef monitoring data, we performed four repeated measures regression analyses to test the null hypothesis and estimate the slope of significant linear functions during the entire 36 year range and for each of the three periods: 1970–1983, 1984–1996, and 1997–2004. The period delineations were based on the timing of major disturbance events and expected and observed trends in coral cover in the Indo-Pacific. For example, the beginning of the third period (1997–2004) coincides with a major global mass-bleaching event in 1998 and 1999 <a href="#pone.0000711-Bruno2">[18]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Berkelmans1">[35]</a>, fairly rapid declines in coral cover in several subregions between 1996 and 1998 (<a href="#pone.0000711.s009">Fig. S1</a>), and the beginning of an eight year decline of mean regional coral cover. We also repeated the analysis of the last two time periods without the GBR monitoring sites to assess their influence.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4"></a><p>Estimates of the rate of coral loss could be influenced by year-to-year and period-to-period changes in the location of reef surveys. For example, if surveys initially focused on high cover reefs or subregions and then shifted focus to low cover reefs, the estimated rate of regional or subregional coral loss could be exaggerated. Alternatively, an initial overrepresentation of low cover reefs or subregions could underestimate the true rate of net coral loss. This problem is diminished in the monitoring sites analysis because individual reefs are monitored through time and reef identity is far less variable. Nevertheless, the identity of monitored reefs did change over time (e.g., when new reefs and subregions were added), so this potential source of bias was not entirely eliminated. A second potential bias in the analyses is the overrepresentation of the best-sampled subregions, mainly the Philippines and the GBR. Therefore, the regression results are not necessarily representative of all ten subregions, especially those that were not well monitored.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5"></a><p>Because the effects of a variety of disturbances on coral cover are depth-dependent <a href="#pone.0000711-Endean1">[36]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000711-Connell2">[38]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Bruno2">[18]</a>, spatial and temporal variability of the depth of reef surveys could complicate our analyses. Therefore we conducted an extensive analysis of the potential confounding effects of depth on our subregional comparisons and rate estimations (<a href="#pone.0000711.s003">Text S3</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711.s008">Table S4</a>).</p>

The region-wide average was only 22.1% in 2003 (95% CI: 20.7, 23.4, n = 390 reefs) and did not vary significantly among subregions (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.19, ANOVA p = 0.40, Power = 0.91 when δ = 3)(<a href="#pone-0000711-g002">Fig. 2A</a>). A number of factors thought to influence coral reef resilience including management resources and enforcement, coral diversity, and human population density and social structure, vary substantially among the ten subregions <a href="#pone.0000711-Burke1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000711-Roberts1">[14]</a>. Therefore, the observed uniformity of the average coral cover in 2003 across the entire region is one of the most surprising results of our analysis.</p>
