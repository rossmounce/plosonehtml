                Figure 1.  Connexin hemichannels open under oxidative stress independent of calcium gating mechanism.(A). In the normal Ca++ containing extracellular medium, no significant LY uptake was observed for MC (A,E) and L2 (I,M) cells. In Ca++ free medium, both cell types show LY uptake (B,F; J,N) consistent with hemichannel behavior. In the presence of normal Ca++ medium, both cell lines allow LY uptake under oxidative stress induced by 10% CSE (C,G; K,O) and 1 mM H2O2 (D,H; L,P). Hemichannel mediated dye uptake was not observed in Cx-deficient N2A cells from Ca++ free medium (R,V) as well as under oxidative stress conditions (S,W; T,X). Scale bar: 20 µm. (B). Histogram representation of the LY uptake studies in the cell lines examined under different treatment conditions. Comparison of different treatment groups made against the control (*p&lt;0.0001), values expressed as mean ± SE.
