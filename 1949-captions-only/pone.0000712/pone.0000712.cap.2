Plasma membrane depolarization induced by oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/CSE) was detected by voltage sensitive dye (DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3)). The histogram summarizes the results of change in the fluorescence intensity (indicative of membrane depolarization) as percentage of their basal fluorescence value (*p&lt;0.0001). Error bar indicates SE of the mean. Both, Cx-expressing (MC) and Cx-deficient (N2A) cells show increase in their basal fluorescence (~20–25%) after 3 min treatment with 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 10% CSE with and without βGA pretreatment, while there was none-to-little increase in fluorescence (&lt;3%) in DTT pretreated cells. (B). Quantitative estimation of the level of membrane depolarization required to open hemichannels. Membrane depolarization and hemichannel opening were assayed simultaneously using voltage sensitive dye (green) and hemichannel permeable TR. Hemichannels opened at 30 mM external K<sup>+</sup> (E–H) and above (I–L). No dye uptake was observed at or below 25 mM K<sup>+</sup> (A–D). Hemichannel opening at 30 mM K<sup>+</sup> concentration corresponds to −38 mV of membrane voltage as calculated using the Nernst equation. Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
