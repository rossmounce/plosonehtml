                Figure 3.  Electrophysiological measurement of the membrane potential and dye uptake in MC.(A). The membrane potential trace was measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique from a cultured MC. Changing of [K+]o to various values is indicated by the bars under the trace. The pseudo-steady-state membrane potential values were −61, −42, −21 and −12 mV at [K+]o of 5, 30, 60 and 120 mM, respectively. The intracellular K+ concentration was ~140 mM. (B). Uptake of LY dye in the extracellular solution of 30 mM KCl (C,D). The cells were incubated for 10 min before being washed with a LY dye-free buffer solution containing 5 mM KCl solution for 4–5 min. For comparison, dye uptake at 5 mM KCl is included (A,B). Scale bars: 25 µm in A,B and 10 µm in C,D.
