                Figure 4.  CSE cause cell death and intracellular oxidative stress.(A). Live/dead cell assay to estimate hemichannel mediated cell death under oxidative stress. Early cell death was observed in CSE treated cells (red fluorescent cells; EtBr homodimer dye) at the end of 10 hrs (F) compared to control (E), βGA pretreated cells (G) and MFA pretreated cells (H), where more live cells (green fluorescent cells; Calcein AM dye) are seen. Cell death in F was predominantly apoptotic as evident from the morphology of the dying cells viz., cell shrinkage, fragmentation into membrane bound apoptotic bodies etc., (inset in panel F). The histogram shows the % of live cells at the end of 10 hrs in all four categories. Error bar indicates SE of the mean (*p&lt;0.012). Scale bar: 20 µm. (B). Oxidative stress molecules enter into the cells through open hemichannels as detected by ROS sensitive dye (Carboxy-H2DCFDA). Cx-expressing cells (MC and L2), showed increase in fluorescence after 10 min treatment with CSE (B,G) and H2O2 (C, H) compared against their corresponding controls (A,F). Similarly, βGA pretreatment decreased such change with CSE (D,I) as well as with H2O2 (E,J). Cx-deficient N2A cells showed no significant change from their control (K) under same treatment conditions (L,M). Scale bar: 20 µm. Histogram summarizes the mean fluorescence intensities of different treatment conditions of all three cell lines subjected to oxidative stress. Error bar indicates SE of the mean (*p&lt;0.0007, **p&lt;0.0015).
