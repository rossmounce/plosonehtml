                Figure 6.  Schematic of putative mechanisms involved in oxidative stress induced hemichannel opening and cell death.Oxidative stress induced by CSE/H2O2 depolarizes the cell membrane, which opens hemichannels. Open hemichannels disturb ionic homeostasis (primarily Ca++, K+ and Na+ ions) (pathway shown in purple) [15]. Increase in free intracellular calcium would activate its dependent kinases as well as load mitochondria with Ca++ resulting in activation of intrinsic pathways of cell death. Open hemichannels permits transfer of apoptosis signaling molecules and metabolites including ATP [36], NAD [38], [52], etc., thus accelerating cell death (pathway shown in green). As shown in the present study, open hemichannels allow direct entry of ROS leading to cell death probably through apoptosis (pathway shown in maroon).
