                Figure 1.  Glycan reaction network and its symbolic representation.A: Schematic of the formation of the terminally processed N-glycans; dashed lines denote multiple reaction steps. B: The corresponding network representing the various pathways connecting the glycans shown in A; least, early, late, and terminally processed glycans denoted on the network, as plotted by GlycoVis. C: The starting glycan and the most fully processed N-glycan considered in the model, with sugar linkages labeled for reference.
