                Figure 11.  Comparison of N-glycan fluxes between 4PFR and 4CSTR models.A: Terminal glycan fluxes with a 40 min residence time. B: Terminal glycan fluxes with a 20 min residence time. C: Nonterminal glycan fluxes with a 40 min residence time; least, early, and late processed glycans as shown in Figure 1B. D: Nonterminal glycan fluxes with a 20 min residence time; least, early, and late processed glycans as shown in Figure 1B.
