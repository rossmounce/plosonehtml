R is the reaction rate vector dependent on both kinetic constant values, and the concentration of glycan and nucleotide-sugar substrates. The last four terms on the right hand side of Eq. 1 describes the anterrograde and retrograde transport of glycans between compartments n, n-1, and n+1. In the CSTR model all glycoprotein molecules are transported at a constant rate f. The balance of these transport terms keeps the volume of each compartment constant.</p>

<h4>Enzyme Kinetics</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Among the ten enzymes considered, two (Man I and Man II) exoglycosidase enzymes use glycans as their sole substrate, while the other eight (GnT I-V, FucT, GalT, SiaT) glycosyltransferases use both N-glycans and the corresponding nucleotide-sugar as substrates. The one substrate enzymes were considered to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics with substrate competition. The two substrate enzymes were assumed to follow a rapid equilibrium, random, bi-bi mechanism. Each of the glycosyltransferases can add a monosaccharide to multiple glycans through the formation of a specific glycosidic bond. Those glycans are treated as competing substrates. For the one substrate enzymes, the equation for the p<sup>th</sup> reaction catalyzed by enzyme e<sub>m</sub> in compartment n is expressed as:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000713.e011&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(Eq.4)</span></span><br>Similarly, for the two substrate enzymes:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000713.e012&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(Eq.5)</span></span><br>In both equations, g<sub>i</sub> is any glycan which can be a substrate of e<sub>m</sub>, and in the case of the latter, s<sub>j </sub>refers to the corresponding nucleotide-sugar (see <a href="#pone.0000713.s002">Text S1</a> in the Supporting Information). The two summation terms in the denominator of Eq. 5 take into consideration the competitive inhibition of N-glycan substrates towards the enzymes, which reduce the individual reaction rates. The enzymes that react upon the N-glycans towards the terminal stages of processing (GalT, SiaT) have the largest number of potential substrates (<a href="#pone-0000713-t002">Table 2</a>). As a result, the denominator term is quite large for these enzymes.</p>
