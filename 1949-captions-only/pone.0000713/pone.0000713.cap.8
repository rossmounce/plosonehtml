                Figure 8.  The effect of GalT amplification on N-glycan fluxes.A: Terminal glycan fluxes with basecase GalT concentration. B: Terminal glycan fluxes with 10X higher GalT concentration. C: Controlling branch point in N-glycan biosynthesis. D: Comparison of fluxes at branch point shown in C, at different GalT concentrations, and normalized distances. E: Ratio of fluxes at the branch point, at different GalT concentrations. F: Fluxes of all GalT catalyzed reactions, at different GalT concentrations and normalized distances.
