The anterior of the embryo is to the left, posterior to the right. A maximum intensity projection of all slices along the <em>z</em>-axis is shown in the <em>xy</em>-plane view for each stage. Cross-sectional slices in the <em>xz</em> and <em>yz</em>-planes are shown above and to the left of the <em>xy</em>-axis view, respectively, and the positions of the slices are represented in the insets. Time stamps are shown in each panel. Scale bars represent 40 Âµm.</p>
