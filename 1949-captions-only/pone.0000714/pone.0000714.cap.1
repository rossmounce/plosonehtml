                Figure 1.  3D time-lapse series of muscle development in a Ciona intestinalis embryo visualized by electroporation with the sna&gt;Venus plasmid.(A) gastrula, (B) neural plate, (C) neurula, (D) early tailbud, (E) mid tailbud, and (F) late tailbud stages from a single embryo are shown. The anterior of the embryo is to the left, posterior to the right. A maximum intensity projection of all slices along the z-axis is shown in the xy-plane view for each stage. Cross-sectional slices in the xz and yz-planes are shown above and to the left of the xy-axis view, respectively, and the positions of the slices are represented in the insets. Time stamps are shown in each panel. Scale bars represent 40 Âµm.
