Only one side of the embryo is labeled. Tail muscle precursors are labeled in orange, neural tissue in light blue, trunk mesenchyme in light purple and trunk ventral cells (heart progenitors) in dark purple. Blastomeres that give rise to more than one tissue are stippled with the colors corresponding to their fates. (B–I) Time series of embryos co-electroporated with <em>sna</em>&gt;<em>GPI</em>-<em>GFP</em> and <em>sna</em>&gt;<em>H2B</em>-<em>RFP</em>. (B,F) neurula, (C,G) early tailbud, (D,H) mid tailbud, and (E,I) late tailbud stages are shown. (B–E) A single slice in the <em>z</em>-axis is shown in the <em>xy</em>-plane of view. Cross-sectional slices in the <em>xz</em> and <em>yz</em>-planes are shown above and to the left of the <em>xy</em>-axis view, respectively, and the positions of the slices are represented in the insets. (F–I) A maximum intensity projection of all slices along the <em>z</em>-axis is shown in the <em>xy</em>-plane of view. Scale bars, 40 µm.</p>
