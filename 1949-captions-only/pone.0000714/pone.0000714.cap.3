                Figure 3.  Tracking the position of muscle nuclei during tail extension in wild type and perturbed embryos.In each case, the same embryo is shown at the early tailbud (left) and late tailbud (right) stages. Nuclei followed for tracking are highlighted with false colors and numbered. The anterior tip of the embryos (origin) and the notch at the intersection of the trunk and the tail, used to correct for movement in the frame, are highlighted in yellow and pink, respectively. Time stamps are shown in each panel. (A) A wild type embryo electroporated with sna&gt;H2B-RFP, and (D) a perturbed embryo co-electroporated with sna&gt;Bix and Tbx6b&gt;H2B-GFP. (B, E) Paths of movement of selected muscle cell nuclei (mn), relative to the position of the anterior tip, in wild type (B) and sna&gt;Bix (E) embryos. (C, F) Change in internuclear distance between nearest neighbor muscle cells during tail extension in unperturbed (C) and sna&gt;Bix (F) embryos. Tail lengths for the sna&gt;Bix (F) embryo were measured in parallel from a stage-matched wild type embryo. Because sna&gt;Bix affects tail extension, staging of sna&gt;Bix embryos was based upon measurements of wild type embryos cultured in parallel from the same batch. Wild type embryos were monitored on a wide-field inverted microscope located directly adjacent to the laser scanning confocal microscope, to ensure that the two samples were maintained in similar environmental conditions. Scale bars, 40 Âµm.
