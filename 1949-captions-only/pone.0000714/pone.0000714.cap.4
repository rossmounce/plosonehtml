                Figure 4.  Changes in muscle cell geometry during tail extension.(A) Muscle cell boundaries highlighted by GPI-GFP in an embryo co-electroporated with sna&gt;GPI-GFP and sna&gt;H2B-RFP, shown at early tailbud and late tailbud stages. (B) Average muscle cell shape (ratio of length to height; n = 5) from the sna&gt;GPI-GFP + sna&gt;H2B-RFP embryo plotted against tail length, with standard deviation shown for each data point. (C) Embryo co-electroporated with sna&gt;Bix to perturb muscle development and Tbx6b&gt;GPI-GFP to mark muscle membranes. (D) Graph of average muscle cell shape (ratio of length to height; n = 5) from the sna&gt;Bix + Tbx6b&gt;GPI-GFP embryo plotted against tail length of a wild type embryo monitored in parallel, with standard deviation shown for each data point. (E) Schematic of muscle cell shape changes in wild type and sna&gt;Bix embryos during tail extension. Time stamps are shown in each image panel. Scale bars, 40 Âµm.
