(B) Cross-sectional slices of the same muscle and notochord cells at the late tailbud stage. (C) Graph of cell volumes for three muscle cells during tail extension. (D) Graph of changes in anteroposterior length, dorsoventral height and mediolateral width during tail extension in “muscle cell 1” from the previous panel. Scale bars, 10 µm.</p>
