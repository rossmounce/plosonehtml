                Figure 6.  Differential protrusive activity at the plasma membrane of muscle cells during tail extension.(A) Neurula, (B) early tailbud, (C) mid tailbud and (D) late tailbud stage embryos electroporated with sna&gt;GPI-GFP and imaged by high-speed spinning disk confocal microscopy. Brightfield images of stage matched embryos are shown in the bottom left corner of each panel. High magnification views of the muscle cells membranes outlined by dashed lines are shown in panels A and B. (E–H) Actin-based cell surface projections imaged by electroporation of Tbx6b&gt;PH-YFP. (I–L) Polar plots of muscle cell protrusion length and orientation in neurula, early tailbud, mid tailbud, and late tailbud embryos. Protrusion length and angle are shown as the distance from the center of the plot and the angle from the x-axis respectively. (M–P) Cell surface projections in perturbed embryos. Embryos were co-electroporated with sna&gt;Bix and Tbx6b&gt;PH-YFP. (Q–T) Polar plots of muscle cell protrusion length and orientation in perturbed embryos co-electroporated with sna&gt;Bix and Tbx6b&gt;PH-YFP. Distance in µm is shown along the x-axis. Scale bars, 20 µm.
