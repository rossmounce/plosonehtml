                Figure 7.  Impairment of muscle cell activity by cytochalasin D.(A) Brightfield image of a wild type neurula stage embryo, with dashed lines outlining the region shown in high magnification in panels B–D. (B–D) High-speed confocal images of a wild type embryo electroporated with sna&gt;GPI-GFP. Yellow arrowheads highlight dynamic projections, which had a duration of less than two minutes. (E) Brightfield image of a neurula stage embryo incubated in 500 nM cytochalasin D, with dashed lines outlining the region shown in high magnification in panels F–H. (F–H) High speed confocal images of an embryo electroporated with sna&gt;GPI-GFP and treated with cytochalasin D. Blue arrowheads highlight projections, which were static throughout the 5 minute imaging period. Scale bars, 10 µm.
