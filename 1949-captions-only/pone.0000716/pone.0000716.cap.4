<div id="section4" class="section"><a id="s4" name="s4" toc="s4" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1"></a><p>This study demonstrated that the impact of insecticides on vector populations is much more complex than just toxicity. In fact, our studies showed that, while the toxic effect of a chemical like dieldrin can have a dramatic effect on the immediate population density, it carries with it the chance for rapid build up of resistance. For this reason we feel that while toxicity has an immediate impact, the long term implications make it the least important of the chemical actions. This study clearly showed that the primary indicators of chemical actions in huts were proportions repelled (spatial repellency), proportions stimulated to prematurely exit (contact irritancy), and proportions that died (toxicity). Estimates of proportions repelled were taken from hut entry data. For DDT, alphacypermethrin and dieldrin the proportions repelled were 59%, 0% and 0% respectively. Contact irritant actions were measured by numbers escaping into exit traps during the first 7 hours of observations. The proportions exiting were 31% (DDT), 55% (alphacypermethrin) and 0% (dieldrin). Toxicity was estimated from two parameters; number dead on the floor and number in exit traps that died after 24 hours. The two parameters for DDT were 5% dead on the floor, and 11% of those that escaped subsequently died. The same values for alphacypermethrin were 15% and 19%, respectively. These two parameters for dieldrin were much more dramatic at 75% dead on the floor, and 69% of those that escaped subsequently died. Numbers in exit traps that subsequently die must be separated from numbers that were irritated and exited prematurely. With no correction the mosquitoes in exit traps that died would be included in two different parameters. We address this by adding the number in exit traps that subsequently died from intoxication to the number dying from toxic actions inside the hut. Thus, toxicity included numbers that died after escaping the hut and numbers dead on the floor. To avoid inflating estimates by including mosquitoes in more than one measure, our estimate for contact irritant action included the number caught in exit traps minus the number that subsequently died.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2"></a><p>We defined composite impact of the two chemicals by assuming that a hundred mosquitoes would enter a house, bite while indoors, and escape and survive if the house were not sprayed. We can use our proportions, described above, to evaluate how spraying with one or the other chemical will impact the 100 mosquitoes.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3"></a><p>In huts sprayed with DDT, 59 of the 100 mosquitoes would not enter. Of the 41 that enter, 2 would die and fall to the floor. Of the 39 survivors, 12 would exit prematurely. One of the 12 mosquitoes that escaped would die within the next 24 hours. This leaves 27 mosquitoes that theoretically could bite and survive. However, it is important to understand that chemical is present in houses 24 hours each day, these statistics cover only 7 hours, not 24. These statistics suggest that DDT reduced risk from 100 mosquitoes by 73% within the first 7 hours.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4"></a><p>In huts sprayed with alphacypermethrin, all 100 mosquitoes would enter the house. Of the 100 that entered, 15 would die. Of the remaining 85, 46 would exit prematurely and 9 of those would die. This leaves 39 mosquitoes that theoretically could bite and survive. The spatial repellent, contact irritant, and toxic actions of alphacypermethrin sum to 61% protection.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p5" name="article1.body1.sec4.p5"></a><p>In huts sprayed with dieldrin, all 100 mosquitoes would enter the house. Of the 100 that enter, 75 would die before exiting. Of the 25 that exit, 17 would escape and subsequently die. This would leave 8 mosquitoes that could take a blood meal and survive for a summed 92% protection. While this may have an immediate impact on the population densities, it carries with it the potential for a quick build up of insecticide resistance thus rendering the chemical ineffective over time. While the failure to feed that occurs through repellency may also provide enough selection pressure to engender resistance, this phenomenon has never been documented and must be examined further.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p6" name="article1.body1.sec4.p6"></a><p>The data presented here are based on laboratory and field tests with populations of <em>Ae. aegypti</em>. However, our earlier research showed similar but even stronger chemical actions on malaria vector mosquitoes <a href="#pone.0000716-Roberts1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000716-Chareonviriyaphap1">[14]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000716-Grieco2">[15]</a>. Our research results were consistent with historical studies by other investigators showing that DDT exerted powerful actions on mosquito behavior <a href="#pone.0000716-Roberts1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000716-Grieco2">[15]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000716-Smith1">[17]</a>. Those historical studies were partially reviewed in a probability model of how DDT functions in malaria control programs <a href="#pone.0000716-Roberts2">[18]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p7" name="article1.body1.sec4.p7"></a><p>There has been no failure in understanding that DDT is by far the most cost-effective chemical yet discovered for sustained use in malaria control programs. However, there has been an enormous failure to accurately account for how DDT actually functions in control of malaria. As stated before, this failure has impeded the search for DDT alternatives. In a more general way, this encompasses both a failure to properly characterize and quantify the separate actions of chemicals and a failure to characterize and quantify the separate responses of vector mosquitoes to those chemical actions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p8" name="article1.body1.sec4.p8"></a><p>The new classification scheme that we are proposing will characterize chemicals on the basis of spatial repellent, contact irritant and toxic actions. The first criterion for evaluating a chemical is the concentration at which the chemical exceeds a threshold for vector response. If mosquitoes are intoxicated at concentrations lower than that required for a behavioral response then toxicity supersedes other actions since the insect might be overcome before being stimulated through mechanisms of contact irritancy or spatial repellency. Likewise, if an irritant response occurs at a lower concentration of chemical than required for toxicity, then the irritant response precludes toxicity since the insect or some proportion of insects may move away from the chemical before acquiring a lethal dose. These relationships are even more pronounced for a spatial repellent action. If a spatial repellent response is stimulated by a lower or equal concentration of chemical than required for either contact irritancy or toxicity, then the insect or some proportion of insects will be repelled without making contact with the chemical. Thus the three chemical actions (spatial repellent, contact irritant, toxicant) can be quantified according to proportional dose-response relationships and the relative rank order of actions can be defined.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p9" name="article1.body1.sec4.p9"></a><p>As described, the first criterion for rank ordering of chemical actions is the relative concentration of chemical required for a given response. If a significant level of toxicity, as found with dieldrin, is produced at lower concentrations than required for contact irritant or spatial repellent actions, then toxicity is the first order action. According to this definition, a first order action occurs at lowest concentration, second order action occurs at second lowest concentration, and third order occurs at third lowest concentration. That is to say, concentration for 1st order is&lt;concentration for 2nd order, and concentration for 2nd order is&lt;concentration for 3rd order action.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p10" name="article1.body1.sec4.p10"></a><p>The second criterion for evaluating a chemical is the time of contact or exposure time. Even if concentrations were equal for stimulating toxic, contact irritant, and spatial repellent responses, order could still be defined by exposure time for eliciting a given response. For example, if a contact irritant response occurred more quickly than a toxic response, the contact irritant mechanism could function to preclude toxicity by causing insects to move away from the chemical prior to acquiring a lethal dose yet may not be intense enough to prevent feeding.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p11" name="article1.body1.sec4.p11"></a><p>The third criterion for evaluating a chemical is the combined effect of the first and second criterion (i.e. the percentage that do not enter combined with the percentage that leave prematurely). The most comprehensive ordering of chemicals would be to use both sets of parameters, chemical concentration and exposure time for a given response.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p12" name="article1.body1.sec4.p12"></a><p>Conventional wisdom in the control of malaria vector mosquitoes is that a repellent action will neutralize the toxic effect of a compound and thus reduce the effectiveness of the chemical. This assessment is true only if we accept the notion that chemicals function to prevent malaria transmission solely by killing mosquitoes. We assert with the present study that disease transmission is prevented through breaking the man-vector contact where it occurs, inside the home. This can be done, as has occurred through the successful use of DDT, by creating a spatial repellent barrier that precludes a large proportion of the mosquitoes from entering the house as well as serves as a contact irritant for those that do enter, causing them to potentially leave without taking a blood meal.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p13" name="article1.body1.sec4.p13"></a><p>Considerable effort has been expended to define levels of toxicity based on standard exposure times. The focus has been to work with varying concentrations for a fixed exposure to define concentrations for mortality. Little effort has been devoted to the question of exposure time as a variable for a standard concentration. From the very beginning of DDT use, there was recognition that mosquitoes must be in physical contact with the chemical for 20 minutes or more for acceptable levels of mortality (50% and higher) <a href="#pone.0000716-Tarzwell1">[19]</a>. This requirement was recognized as a problem because both field and laboratory data showed that mosquitoes were quickly repelled by the chemical. Our laboratory behavioral assays were conducted for only 10 minutes, and yet we still were able to quantify a spatial repellent response. We have no detailed exposure time analyses for the set of data presented here. However, our past studies showed behavioral responses to occur immediately and Kennedy's classic study published in 1947 suggested that some behavioral responses occurred almost instantaneously with chemical exposure. This subject warrants a great deal more research, and exposure time could be an important component of any comprehensive rank ordering of chemical actions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p14" name="article1.body1.sec4.p14"></a><p>The field studies showed that the new assay system precisely discriminates between spatial repellent, contact irritant and contact toxic actions of test compounds. The findings from both laboratory and field studies showed that spatial repellency is the first order action of DDT. Furthermore, tests showed that contact irritancy is the second order action and that toxicity is only a third order action. As a killing agent, DDT is inferior to modern insecticides which kill mosquitoes more quickly and at much lower concentrations. Even Mueller in his original discovery recognized that DDT was a very slow-acting insecticide <a href="#pone.0000716-Mueller1">[20]</a>. This rank ordering of DDT actions is entirely consistent with decades of published laboratory and field studies on DDT actions. Alternatively, our data showed alphacypermethrin to function primarily as a contact irritant and secondarily as a toxicant, but it does not elicit a significant spatial repellent response with <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitoes. Prior hut studies against malaria vectors confirmed these findings with alphacypermethrin as general characteristics of pyrethroid insecticides <a href="#pone.0000716-Grieco2">[15]</a>. Dieldrin functioned primarily as a toxicant but shows no behavior modifying actions, which seems to increase its killing potential.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p15" name="article1.body1.sec4.p15"></a><p>As stated above, the historical record of malaria control operations show that DDT is the most cost-effective chemical for malaria control. Even now DDT is still considered to be the cheapest and most effective chemical for use in house spray operations. Its long residual action when sprayed on inner walls further enhances its cost-effectiveness. These facts illustrate a remarkable paradox. The paradox is that DDT is widely considered to be the most effective chemical for malaria control and, unfortunately, is widely considered to have no important function other than killing mosquitoes. Yet, DDT does not provide quick knockdown or high mortality to mosquitoes. Observations reported here provide a new and clearer explanation of how DDT actually functions to control malaria transmission inside houses. The data obtained from both laboratory and field studies on the chemical actions of DDT confirm the probability model of Roberts <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0000716-Roberts2">[18]</a> which explains the roles of repellency and contact irritancy in disrupting malaria transmission. Success through the mechanism of spatial repellency means that DDT basically functions as a form of chemical screening, which stops mosquitoes from entering houses and transmitting malaria.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p16" name="article1.body1.sec4.p16"></a><p>Alphacypermethrin, on the other hand, is primarily a contact irritant and a toxicant as exhibited by the pronounced exiting response and high knockdown in laboratory assays and inside the huts. However, this compound did not elicit a repellent response from the mosquitoes under controlled laboratory conditions or repel mosquitoes from entering the hut in the field. The mosquitoes could still enter and bite unprotected inhabitants, thereby transmitting disease. Furthermore, most mosquitoes that did enter were able to leave the hut without picking up a lethal dose of the compound. While this is documented as a premature exiting behavior, the mosquitoes were still present in the hut for a short time and could have potentially acquired a blood meal if one had been accessible.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p17" name="article1.body1.sec4.p17"></a><p>Dieldrin is primarily a toxicant but does not irritate or repel <em>Ae. aegypti</em>. It is important for use to take a closer look at how this combination of actions effect the impact dieldrin has on vector populations. This compound fits all of the characteristics of an ideal insecticide, i.e. it is a strong toxicant that does not modify insect behavior. Our data indicate that the mosquitoes will sit on the treated surface without becoming irritated, thereby picking up a lethal dose resulting in a rapid reduction in the adult female populations. While this may have an immediate impact on the population densities, it carries with it the potential for a quick build up of insecticide resistance. If we look to the history of dieldrin use, we find that this is precisely what happened when this chemical was applied. Ascher in 1955 <a href="#pone.0000716-Ascher1">[21]</a> cited examples of the extremely rapid development of dieldrin-resistance in insects not previously resistant. Brown in 1958 <a href="#pone.0000716-Brown1">[22]</a> observed the rapid development of resistance in <em>An. gambiae</em> as soon as dieldrin was used. While the immediate toxic action is beneficial, the long term impact is the rapid build up of resistance thus rendering the chemical ineffective.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p18" name="article1.body1.sec4.p18"></a><p>Existing criteria for dealing with insecticide resistance have resulted in countries abandoning DDT when vectors became resistant to the insecticide's toxic actions. The criteria include no allowance for the possibility that mosquitoes might become resistant to toxic actions and still be susceptible to a chemical's spatial repellent or contact irritant actions. Given that spatial repellent action is the first order action of DDT residues, resistance to a toxic action may not signify that DDT will no longer exert control over malaria transmission. The populations of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> used in our studies were DDT resistant. Yet, the spatial repellent responses that we documented were very similar to those Kennedy reported for <em>Ae. aegypti</em> in 1947 <a href="#pone.0000716-Kennedy1">[1]</a>. Resistance to a toxic action seems to have no influence on the behavioral responses of mosquitoes to spatial repellent or contact irritant actions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p19" name="article1.body1.sec4.p19"></a><p>To date, a truly efficacious DDT replacement has not been found and one may never be found because of the true nature in which DDT functions. Success through the mechanism of spatial repellency means that DDT functions as a form of chemical screening, which stops mosquitoes from entering houses and thus breaks the man/vector contact at its most critical point: when people are sleeping in their homes. DDT's secondary action stimulates those mosquitoes that do enter to prematurely exit, potentially without biting and transmitting disease. Toxicity is only a third order action of DDT and it is considered to be a very poor killing agent. We propose that a search for a DDT replacement should focus on a new set of selection criteria of spatial repellency, contact irritancy and toxicity. We must move from selecting vector control chemicals solely on the basis of toxicity and accept a new paradigm of selection criteria focused on multiple chemical actions for the control of disease transmission by breaking man-vector contact.</p>
