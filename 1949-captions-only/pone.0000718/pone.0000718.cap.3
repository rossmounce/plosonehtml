                Figure 3.  Relative and Compare Modes of the Arabidopsis eFP Browser.A. Expression of RGL2, At3g03450, in Relative Expression mode, showing stronger expression relative to its median expression level in imbibed seeds and flower parts, as described in the literature. B. Expression of the ethylene receptors ERS1, At2g40940 versus ETR1, At1g66340 as visualized in the Compare Mode, showing stronger expression (yellow-green) of ERS1 in earlier stages of seed development and stronger expression (red) of ETR1 in later stages of seed development.
