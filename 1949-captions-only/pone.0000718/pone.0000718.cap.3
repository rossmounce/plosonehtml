Expression of <em>RGL2</em>, At3g03450, in Relative Expression mode, showing stronger expression relative to its median expression level in imbibed seeds and flower parts, as described in the literature. B. Expression of the ethylene receptors <em>ERS1</em>, At2g40940 versus <em>ETR1</em>, At1g66340 as visualized in the Compare Mode, showing stronger expression (yellow-green) of <em>ERS1</em> in earlier stages of seed development and stronger expression (red) of <em>ETR1</em> in later stages of seed development.</p>
