                Figure 5.  Tissue-specific expression patterns for At5g43350, AtPT1/Pht1;1.This gene encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter known to be strongly expressed in the roots. Tissues where values from replicate samples exhibit a high standard deviation are coloured grey â€“ the standard deviation filtering feature of the Arabidopsis eFP Browser was activated during output generation.
