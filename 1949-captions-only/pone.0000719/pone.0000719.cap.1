<h4>Interventions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>We purchased the study products from a manufacturer with Good Manufacturing Practice. This custom-made Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) was encapsulated with granules from concentrated decoction made by water extraction in 1:13 ratio from single batched roots of the four plants in equal proportions: prepared Radix <em>Rehmanniae praeparata</em> (Soe Dee Huang), Radix <em>Paeoniae alba</em> (Bai Sau), Radix <em>Angelicae sinensis</em> (Dang Guay), and Rhizoma <em>Ligustici chuanxiong</em> (Tsuan Chyong), as prepared according to the original pharmacopoeia. The plant origins in China were known to the buyer of the pharmaceutical company. According to the habitual usage of this formula and the comparisons of the decoction made from raw materials with the commercially available granules of concentrated decoction, the concentrations of two quality control indicators-paeoniflorin and ferulic acid<strong>-</strong>within the ranges requested by the Principal Investigator were met. Provided by the pharmaceutical company, the final product was free of <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> and the levels of heavy metals were 0.45 ppm for lead, 0.14 ppm for arsenic, 0.01 ppm for cadmium, and 0.02 ppm for mercury, all within regulated limits (20, 5, 0.5, and 0.5 ppm, respectively). Every capsule was sealed and secured with a band at the interface by a capsule supply company to ensure concealment of the aroma from the materials (<a href="#pone.0000719.s001">Figure S1</a>). The identical looking placebo capsules were filled with a powder mixture of cornstarch and caramel. Each capsule weighed approximately 500 mg.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>Regimens of five capsules were packaged in aluminum packets for easier handling and to prevent Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) from moisture exposure. Clinic visit number and case number were marked on each packet in both text and bar code. The bar code with the number of unused capsules from used packets was scanned into the database after each treatment cycle.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>We determined the dosage of 15 capsules daily for five days from the onset of bleeding or pain after taking considerations: (a) habitual usages provided from the three surveys, (b) literature reports, (c) a comparison of the concentrations of two indices, paeoniflorin and ferulic acid, in a one-day dose of a commercially available powder with the decoction made from raw materials, (d) information from the study's traditional Chinese medicine physicians, and (e) input from the study's leading gynaecologist. For easier intake, we instructed the women to take the capsules with warm water three times. A treatment cycle entailed a total of 75 capsules. The exact number of capsules taken each day was recorded in the online diary, and any unfinished capsules were brought back to the study nurse at the next clinic visit.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>Participants' mean menstrual cycle length at baseline was 27 and ranged from 21 to 43 days. However, some women's cycles had shortened after participating in the trial. We initially set the treatment duration for three menstrual cycles <a href="#pone.0000719-Coco1">[12]</a>. In order to have the post-treatment examination by the same six study physicians, the treatment duration was imperatively extended to four menstrual cycles for women having shortened cycles and for those out of town for month-long winter break. We received informed consent for additional treatment cycle from these women. All women then were followed for three cycles after completing treatment.</p>


<h4>Objectives</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>We hypothesized that Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) had a beneficial effect to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. Using a scientific, not market-driven approach applying Good Clinical Practice guidelines established by the Department of Health, Taiwan (Publication No. 85067127), the objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary data on compliance, feasibility, safety, and effectiveness to power a similar future trial.</p>


<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<h5>(1) Primary outcome: visual analogue pain scale (VAS).</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>We collected the primary outcome data during the first five days of each menstrual cycle using a horizontal unmarked visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0–10 cm (0 cm representing no pain; 10 cm, severe pain) <a href="#pone.0000719-Huskison1">[17]</a> with a sliding bar on the scale posted on our Web site for participants to gauge their pain feeling. The online scale matched 1000 scales in our database in order to capture the maximal pain and detect small differences. The participants recorded the pain intensity they experienced right before taking ibuprofen (400 mg), which was provided by the Study Centre for unbearable menstrual pain after holding it off.</p>

<h5>(2) Other pain measures.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec2.p1"></a><p>In order to compare with the results from other studies assessing the pain by verbal scale, we also collected data on a 4-point pain scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, and severe pain) from the online questionnaire at each cycle. Dichotomous responses (no pain or pain) were then grouped from this scale.</p>

<h5>(3) Confounders.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec3.p1"></a><p>Data regarding the type and frequency of the intake of all drugs and the use of other remedies, as possible confounders, were collected along with the VAS pain intensity in the electronic diary.</p>

<h5>(4) Adverse reactions or events.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec4.p1"></a><p>At the time of the pre-treatment ultrasound screening and the post-treatment (end of treatment) examination, a total of 20 ml of venous blood was obtained for safety evaluation. Creatinine, BUN (urea nitrogen), and uric acid were assessed for renal function; AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), for liver function; iron, TIBC (total iron binding capacity), hemoglobin, and hematocrit, for anemic condition; and mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper, for heavy metal toxicity.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.sec4.p2"></a><p>Possible adverse reactions noted by traditional Chinese medicine physicians were collected: inner heat reaction, (referring to fire energy or Huo Chi in Pinyin, a symptom used in traditional Chinese medicine, which corresponds to inflammation in Western conventional medicine), such as blisters and pimples, and disturbed menstruation, such as amenorrhea and menorrhagia. Participants evaluated the latter symptom using a balance and pads of three sizes supplied by the Study Centre and reported the weight of soiled pads by size in the electronic diary. In addition, any other discomforts or illnesses and the number of days missing work or school were collected.</p>



<h4>Sample size</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>We positioned this trial as a pilot study. Very few studies of non-conventional treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea contain data that can be referred for sample size calculation. We found 40 participants in one comparable study <a href="#pone.0000719-Kotani1">[18]</a>, and 100 participants in another <a href="#pone.0000719-Ziaei1">[19]</a>. Clinical trials on conventional analgesics were thus referred, in which the average pain reduction rate was 70% in the treatment group and 30% in the placebo group. With 90% power and 5% type I error (two-sided), we required 28 participants for each arm of this trial. Therefore, 100 participants were to be enrolled to allow for a 25% dropout rate.</p>


<h4>Randomization—Sequence generation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>The 78 dysmenorrheic women were first stratified by their past experience or belief in the effectiveness of Four-Agents-Decoction as reported in the recruitment questionnaire <a href="#pone.0000719-Hrbjartsson1">[20]</a>. In each stratum random codes with a permuted block randomization scheme were generated by computer.</p>


<h4>Randomization—Allocation concealment</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>The participants were not given their group assignment code. The study physicians did not share their own examination results, did not know the identity of the participants, did not handle the study products, and did not know the assigned treatment. Two sets of 78 sealed opaque envelopes containing each individual's treatment assignment were prepared; one set was for the leading gynaecologist to keep for emergency care and the other was kept with Principal Investigator. The two envelopes remained sealed until data analysis.</p>


<h4>Randomization—Implementation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>All clinic visits for the 78 participants were arranged at the Study Centre; the participants were randomized into Four-Agents-Decoction or placebo groups based on the order of their chosen date and the arrival time for their post-screening clinic. A total of 39 women were allocated to each treatment and placebo group, according to the computer generated allocation sequence by study statistician.</p>


<h4>Blinding</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>The appearances of the study product and placebo capsules were identical and no aroma was detected from either. Achievement of blindness was validated before the trial in a group of 39 volunteers (unpublished data). At the completion of treatment, we conducted a simple survey asking the participants to guess whether they were in the study product or placebo group in order to evaluate the extent of study blindness.</p>


<h4>Statistical methods</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1"></a><p>All data were stratified by treatment group and examined separately. Study outcome was visual analog pain intensity given as mean score (cm) and 95% confidence interval. Peak-pain was the maximal single-day pain intensity and overall-pain was the average pain intensity among days in pain. Data of the cycle adjacent to the first treatment cycle was set as baseline. As menstrual pain on the most intense day is considered unbearable for many dysmenorrheic women, we focused our analysis on the peak-pain.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p2"></a><p>Our outcome data were repeated measurements and correlated across successive cycle points over the entire trial. The model fit by generalized estimating equations (GEE) <a href="#pone.0000719-Liang1">[21]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000719-Diggle1">[22]</a> is able to account for longitudinal and correlated response data <a href="#pone.0000719-Hanley1">[23]</a>. We tested the nonlinear relationship and possible interaction effects between treatments and cycles from baseline to the end of treatment with the data based on individual trajectories of peak-pain measurements. The GENMOD procedure in SAS (version 8.2 SAS institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, U.S.A.) was used for the modeling. The values for the variable “<em>cycle</em>” were set from 0 to 4 cycles according to the order of treatment cycle from baseline, respectively, and the indicator variable “<em>treatment</em>” was used to distinguish the two groups, with the placebo group as the reference. The explanatory variables in the models consisted of the indicator variables “<em>treatment</em>”, “<em>cycle</em>”, and the quadratic term “<em>cycle<sup>2</sup></em>” for nonlinear trends, as well as their interaction terms “<em>cycle</em>×<em>treatment</em>” and “<em>cycle<sup>2</sup></em>×<em>treatment</em>”. The treatment effect was characterized using the two interaction terms.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p3"></a><p>We compared the peak-pain intensity by t-test for at each treatment and follow-up cycle between the two treatment groups and for those with three or four treatment cycles. Statistical significance was determined at <em>p</em>≤.05. Over-all pain intensity distribution throughout the trial was presented and the same comparisons were performed between the two treatment groups.</p>
