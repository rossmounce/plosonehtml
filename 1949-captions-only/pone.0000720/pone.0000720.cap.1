<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>Given the importance of the length of the female reproductive tract it is critical to understand both its natural variation and the forces that shape its underlying phenotypic distribution – including extrinsic factors such as endosymbionts. One endosymbiont that infects many arthropods is the α-proteobacteria <em>Wolbachia</em> <a href="#pone.0000720-Jeyaprakash1">[26]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000720-Weeks1">[27]</a>. The interest in this dynamic bacterium stems not only from its prevalence and breadth of eukaryotic hosts, but from the wide range of phenotypes that it imposes on its hosts; phenotypes that range from cytoplasmic incompatibility to sex-ratio distortion <a href="#pone.0000720-Weeks1">[27]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000720-Stouthamer1">[29]</a>. Although <em>Wolbachia</em> infections are concentrated in reproductive tissues <a href="#pone.0000720-Dobson1">[e.g.]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000720-McGraw1">[30, 31]</a>, no one, to my knowledge, has investigated whether or not such infections can modify host reproductive morphology.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a><p>Here, I use the <em>Allonemobius-Wolbachia</em> host-endosymbiont system <a href="#pone.0000720-Marshall1">[7]</a> to evaluate natural variation in spermathecal duct length. Specifically, I evaluated how this duct varies among populations of two species in the <em>A. socius</em> complex (<em>A. socius</em> and <em>A. sp. nov</em>. Tex) to determine if this particular fertilization trait is evolving rapidly and is associated with species boundaries. Lastly, I assessed the consequences, if any, of <em>Wolbachia</em> infection on natural variation in this duct using morphological and molecular techniques and curing experiments.</p>

<h4>Field Sampling</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Adults of <em>A. socius</em> and <em>A. sp. nov.</em> Tex <a href="#pone.0000720-Marshall1">[7]</a> were collected in the field during 2002 and 2003 (<a href="#pone-0000720-t001">Table 1</a>), with all individuals from one location being collected at the same time. Upon returning to laboratory, all individuals (n≈15 per sex) from each population were placed in a population-specific plastic box (20×30×20 cm) with ample saturated cotton. Food (Purina Cat Chow™) was given <em>ad libitum</em> and replaced once a week. Cotton was watered to saturation three times a week. These populations were maintained on a 14:10 light cycle at 27C. A 1:1 mix of sand and humus soil was provided for females to oviposit and all adults were removed after two weeks. The resulting non-diapause F1's were then raised to adulthood in sex-specific cages (as above) and used for the analyses below.</p>
