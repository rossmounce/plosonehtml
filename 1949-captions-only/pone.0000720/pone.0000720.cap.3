                Figure 3.  Wolbachia effects on spermathecal duct length.(A) The relationship between body size and spermathecal duct length for Wolbachia infected (black), cured (open square), and naturally uninfected (open circle) females. Infected females are significantly different from cured and naturally uninfected females (see text). (B) Representative spermathecal ducts from an uninfected and infected female with nearly identical body sizes (10.63 and 10.42 mm, respectively). The small arrows show the common chamber where sperm enter the spermathecal duct during copulation and where the sperm leave upon fertilization. The large double-headed arrows identify convolutions (or lack thereof) and the balloon-shaped spermatheca (where sperm are stored until fertilization).
