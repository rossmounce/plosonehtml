                Figure 1.  Raster plot of the study design for a representative individual (2478).The study protocol is double plotted such that consecutive days are next to and beneath the other. Scheduled sleep episodes in complete darkness (horizontal black lines), exposure to moderately bright light (parallelogram boxes with sun; part of wake episodes Days 6–19, 38–51), and CP procedures (open horizontal boxes; on Days 4–5, 20–21, 36–37, 52–53, 68–69) are indicated. Except for the scheduled wake episodes during the baseline (Day 1–3) and recovery days (Day 70–73; ~90 lux [~0.23 W/m2]) and exposure to moderately bright light (~450 lux [~1.18 W/m2]), lights were dim throughout the study (~1.8 lux [~0.0048 W/m2]). DLMOn25% (green upward-triangles) and DLMOff25% (red downward-triangles) are shown during dim light conditions. The intrinsic circadian period of the melatonin, cortisol, and temperature cycles during the FD protocols (Days 22–35, 54–67) were computed by a nonorthogonal spectral analysis technique. The fitted phase of the minimum of core body temperature (gray dotted line) and of the maximum of plasma cortisol (black dashed line) during the FD protocols are indicated. The observed circadian periods during the exposure to the 24.65-h day and to the 23.5-h day and the composite estimate of the intrinsic circadian period as computed by averaging the intrinsic period estimate from plasma melatonin, plasma cortisol, and core body temperature data (τcomposite) [13] for both FD protocols are indicated to the right of the figure.
