                Figure 1.  Characterization of the DNA-content increase in HU-treated cells.DNA content profiles by FACS analysis in HU-challenged wild type (A), rad3Δ (B), and cds1Δ (C) cells. 1C and 2C indicate cells containing 1 and 2 copies of genome, respectively. Minus and plus times indicate cells before and after HU-release, respectively. Regression analysis of DNA content increase in wild type (E) and cds1Δ (F) cells. X- and Y-axis indicate the time after HU-removal and the percent of DNA content (i.e., median) increase, respectively.
