Minus and plus times indicate cells before and after HU-release, respectively. Regression analysis of DNA content increase in wild type (E) and <em>cds1Δ</em> (F) cells. <em>X</em>- and <em>Y</em>-axis indicate the time after HU-removal and the percent of DNA content (<em>i.e.</em>, median) increase, respectively.</p>
