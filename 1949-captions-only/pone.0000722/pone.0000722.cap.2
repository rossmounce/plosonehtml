                Figure 2.  Schematic modeling of the near-sigmoid regression for profiling of DNA replication timing and efficiency.(A) Modeling of the near-sigmoid regression for the increase in DNA copy number at indicated individual loci (a–e). (B) Profile assembly of the copy number changes at individual loci of the subchromosomal region. (C) Simplified form of replication profiles displaying average replication timing T50 and duplication time ΔT. (D) Conversion between duplication time ΔT and replication efficiency η. (E) Potential distribution of the T50 versus η at individual loci of the genome.
