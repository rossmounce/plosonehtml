Average replication timing <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> profiles are in think black lines. Efficiency is indicated by <em>T<sub>0</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>100</sub></em> profiles at individual loci in grey lines. Approximately 39 origins that have been validated by 2D-gel electrophoresis are marked with vertical lines. Predicted origins and AT-rich islands are indicated in blue and purple dots on the top of the profiles, respectively. Horizontal orange and green lines at the bottom of the profiles indicate efficient and inefficient subchromosomal regions, respectively. Solid red circles and triangles indicate centromeres and telomeres. No adjacent telomeres indicated in chromosome <em>III</em> due to the presence of multiple arrays of large rDNA sequences at the ends.</p>
