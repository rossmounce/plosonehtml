                Figure 4.  Characteristics of DNA replication timing T50 and efficiency η at various loci in wild type cells released after HU block.Box plot indicates the non-outliers minimum (left end of the line), the lower quartile (left end of the rectangle), median (centre of the rectangle), the upper quartile (right end of the rectangle), and the non-outlier maximum (right end of the line). (A) The box-plots of T50 distribution of individual loci of the genome and individual chromosomes as indicated. The T50-median of the loci of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of T50 distribution of efficient and inefficient loci. Efficient and inefficient loci are those whose η is greater and less than the η-median, respectively. The T50-median of efficient and inefficient loci is indicated in parentheses. (C) Numbers of loci in the binned ΔT series or η series. (D) Plot of efficiency η versus average replication timing T50 of individual loci. Only ~0.3% (16 out of 4733) loci of the genome exhibited their efficiency η of greater than 1 (or duplicating the DNA in less than 10 min). The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the T50. (E–G) The T50 distribution of loci and the number of loci in the binned η series in chromosome I (E), II (F), and III (G). It is displayed as described in (B) and (C). (H) The plot of T50 versus η or ΔT of efficient and inefficient regions. X- and Y-axis indicate T50 and η or ΔT, respectively. The efficient and inefficient regions are indicated by closed and open circles, respectively.
