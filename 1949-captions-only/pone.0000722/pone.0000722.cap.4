(A) The box-plots of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of individual loci of the genome and individual chromosomes as indicated. The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of the loci of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of efficient and inefficient loci. Efficient and inefficient loci are those whose <em>η</em> is greater and less than the <em>η<sub>-median</sub></em>, respectively. The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of efficient and inefficient loci is indicated in parentheses. (C) Numbers of loci in the binned <em>ΔT</em> series or <em>η</em> series. (D) Plot of efficiency <em>η</em> versus average replication timing <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> of individual loci. Only ~0.3% (16 out of 4733) loci of the genome exhibited their efficiency <em>η</em> of greater than 1 (or duplicating the DNA in less than 10 min). The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the <em>T<sub>50</sub></em>. (E–G) The <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of loci and the number of loci in the binned <em>η</em> series in chromosome <em>I</em> (E), <em>II</em> (F), and <em>III</em> (G). It is displayed as described in (B) and (C). (H) The plot of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> versus <em>η</em> or <em>ΔT</em> of efficient and inefficient regions. <em>X</em>- and <em>Y</em>-axis indicate <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> and <em>η</em> or <em>ΔT</em>, respectively. The efficient and inefficient regions are indicated by closed and open circles, respectively.</p>
