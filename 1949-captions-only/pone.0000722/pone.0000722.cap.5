                Figure 5.  Characteristics of average firing timing T50 and (maximum) firing efficiency η at various predicted origins in wild type cells released after HU block.(A) The box-plots of T50 distribution of predicted origins of the genome and individual chromosomes as indicated. The T50-median of the origins of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of T50 distribution of efficient and inefficient origins. Efficient and inefficient origins are those whose η is greater and less than the η-median, respectively. The T50-median of efficient and inefficient origins is indicated in parentheses. (C) Plot of firing efficiency η versus average firing timing T50 of individual origins. The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the T50. (D) The Venn diagram of predicted peaks and loci containing HU-induced ssDNA deposit. (E) The over-representation of ssDNA in predicated origins of chromosome III. Numbers of the predicated origins/peaks and those overlapped with the loci containing ssDNA deposit are indicated. The asterisk indicates the significant enrichment of ssDNA in chromosome III.
