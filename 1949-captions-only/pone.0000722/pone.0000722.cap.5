The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of the origins of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of efficient and inefficient origins. Efficient and inefficient origins are those whose <em>η</em> is greater and less than the <em>η<sub>-median</sub></em>, respectively. The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of efficient and inefficient origins is indicated in parentheses. (C) Plot of firing efficiency <em>η</em> versus average firing timing <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> of individual origins. The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the <em>T<sub>50</sub></em>. (D) The Venn diagram of predicted peaks and loci containing HU-induced ssDNA deposit. (E) The over-representation of ssDNA in predicated origins of chromosome <em>III</em>. Numbers of the predicated origins/peaks and those overlapped with the loci containing ssDNA deposit are indicated. The asterisk indicates the significant enrichment of ssDNA in chromosome <em>III</em>.</p>
