                Figure 7.  Characteristics of DNA replication timing T50 and efficiency η at various loci in cds1Δ cells released after HU block.(A) The box-plots of T50 distribution of individual loci of the genome and individual chromosomes in cds1Δ cells as indicated. The T50-median of the loci of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of T50 distribution of efficient and inefficient loci in cds1Δ cells. (C) Numbers of loci in the binned ΔT series or η series. (D) Plot of efficiency η versus average replication timing T50 of individual loci in cds1Δ cells. Less than ~0.1% (3 out of 4787) loci of the genome exhibited their efficiency η of greater than 1 (or duplicating the DNA in less than 40 min). The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the T50. (E) The plot of T50 versus η or ΔT of efficient and inefficient regions in cds1Δ cells. X- and Y-axis indicate T50 and η or ΔT, respectively. The efficient and inefficient regions are indicated by closed and open circles, respectively.
