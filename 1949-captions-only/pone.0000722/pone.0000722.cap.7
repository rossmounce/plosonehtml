The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of the loci of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of efficient and inefficient loci in <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. (C) Numbers of loci in the binned <em>ΔT</em> series or <em>η</em> series. (D) Plot of efficiency <em>η</em> versus average replication timing <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> of individual loci in <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. Less than ~0.1% (3 out of 4787) loci of the genome exhibited their efficiency <em>η</em> of greater than 1 (or duplicating the DNA in less than 40 min). The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the <em>T<sub>50</sub></em>. (E) The plot of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> versus <em>η</em> or <em>ΔT</em> of efficient and inefficient regions in <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. <em>X</em>- and <em>Y</em>-axis indicate <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> and <em>η</em> or <em>ΔT</em>, respectively. The efficient and inefficient regions are indicated by closed and open circles, respectively.</p>
