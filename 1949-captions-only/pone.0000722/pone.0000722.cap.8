                Figure 8.  Characteristics of average firing timing T50 and (maximum) firing efficiency η at various predicted origins in cds1Δ cells released after HU block.(A) The box-plots of T50 distribution of predicted origins of the genome and individual chromosomes cds1Δ cells as indicated. The T50-median of the origins of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of T50 distribution of efficient and inefficient origins cds1Δ cells. The T50-median of efficient and inefficient origins is indicated in parentheses. (C) Plot of firing efficiency η versus average firing timing T50 of individual origins cds1Δ cells. The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the T50. (D) Venn diagram of peaks predicted in wild type and cds1Δ cells. Overlapping peaks are those whose distance is less than 12 Kb. (E) The T50 distribution of the wild type-unique and overlapping origins in wild type cells. The asterisk indicates the significant increase in firing efficiency of the wild type-unique origins. (F) The T50 distribution of the cds1-unique and overlapping origins in cds1Δ cells.
