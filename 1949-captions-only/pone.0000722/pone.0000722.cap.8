The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of the origins of the genome or individual chromosomes is presented in parentheses. (B) The box-plots of <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of efficient and inefficient origins <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. The <em>T<sub>50-median</sub></em> of efficient and inefficient origins is indicated in parentheses. (C) Plot of firing efficiency <em>η</em> versus average firing timing <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> of individual origins <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. The arrow indicates the asymmetric distribution of the <em>T<sub>50</sub></em>. (D) Venn diagram of peaks predicted in wild type and <em>cds1Δ</em> cells. Overlapping peaks are those whose distance is less than 12 Kb. (E) The <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of the wild type-unique and overlapping origins in wild type cells. The asterisk indicates the significant increase in firing efficiency of the wild type-unique origins. (F) The <em>T<sub>50</sub></em> distribution of the cds1-unique and overlapping origins in <em>cds1Δ</em> cells.</p>
