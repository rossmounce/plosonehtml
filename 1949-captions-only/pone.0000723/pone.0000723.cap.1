                Figure 1.  Synfire chain and its spike activity.(A) Topology of synfire chain. In a synfire chain, neurons (gray ovals) are organized into successive groups (shown as rows). Each group makes convergent synaptic connections (black arrows) onto the next. Group numbers are shown beside each group. (B) Single trial spike raster of population labeled by group number (upper), and associated population firing rate (lower). Here a group consists of 10 neurons. Each neuron spikes only once, and neurons in a group spike in tight synchrony. The inset shows a detail of the spikes from 3 successive groups. The population firing rate holds steady until the end of the chain, where it drops off to spontaneous levels. (C) Raster plots for select individual neurons across 10 trials. The lowest panel shows a neuron in Group 1, the starting group of the network; it is induced to spike by external input. Successive panels show neurons in higher groups, which spike due to the intrinsic synfire connectivity. The vertical alignment of spikes across trials suggests a high degree of temporal accuracy. The inset shows the details of the spike activity of a neuron in Group 40, which spikes approximately 200 ms after Group 1. (D) A raster plot showing mean spike times (vertical dashs) and spike time jitters (horizontal error bars) for the first 200 neurons across 1000 trials. Insets show the details of groups 3 (lower) and 19 (upper).
