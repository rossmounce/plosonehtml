The formation process was then allowed to proceed as normal, with no further neuronal death. The network was able recover after 100000 trials (lower); it, however, ended up shorter and wider than normal. (B) Four different simulations using the same base network, but performing different levels of lesions at 10, 20, 30, and 40 percent. The plot shows the change in size of the chain, as defined by the number of neurons spiking reliably, from pre-lesion to post-lesion recovery. The chain does not recover to its normal size; it is shortened. (C) The size of the post-recovery network normalized by the number of neurons left intact directly after the lesion. The normalized size is close to 1 for lesions less than 40%, indicating that neurons are not added nor lost during the recovery. At forty percent however, the normalized size dips below 1, indicating that additional neurons are lost during the recovery period.</p>
