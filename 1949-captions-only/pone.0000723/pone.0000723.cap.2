The active connections (black solid arrows) are randomly set. Black ovals are training neurons (TN), which receive external excitation at the start of each trial, and gray ovals are pool neurons (PN), which spike spontaneously. Following the bent black arrow shows a small subnetwork that includes only the TN and their active synapses and postsynaptic PN. Since the active network is sparse and random, TN do not converge upon the same set of PN except for a random few. Without the ability to turn on silent synapses (follow the gray dashed arrow to the upper middle subnetwork), STDP can act only over the active synapses. Therefore, only the few neurons receiving convergent synaptic input from the TN can spike consistently after the TN. If, however, silent synapses can activate due to spike activity (follow black solid arrow to the lower middle subnetwork), then the TN can activate synapses onto the same set of PN. Since these neurons receive more excitation and hence are more likely to spike, the synapses from the TN to these neurons are more likely to potentiate. This is a positive feedback. These synapses will pass the supersynaptic threshold (follow black solid arrow to the lower right subnetwork), and the TN will coordinate to make convergent synaptic connections onto the same set of PN. The TN do not connect to other neurons due to axon remodeling, in which weak connections from a neuron are pruned once a finite number of super-connections from the same neuron are formed. Without axon remodeling (follow gray dashed arrow to the upper right subnetwork), the TN can continue to activate synapses onto <em>all</em> PN and hoard the entire network to themselves, meaning that all neurons in the network will be induced to spike after they do.</p>
