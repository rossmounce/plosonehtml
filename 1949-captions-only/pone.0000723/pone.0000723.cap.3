After 200000 trials, the neurons organize into a network that resembles a synfire chain (compare to <a href="#pone-0000723-g001">Figure 1A</a>). Only supersynaptic connections (arrows) and the neurons (circles) that receive them are shown. Light gray circles are saturated neurons; they have withdrawn their axons to all other neurons. Dark gray circles are unsaturated neurons; they have active subsuper synapses that are not shown. Green arrows are synapses that connect to neurons in the next group. Red arrows are synapses that connect to neurons in groups higher than the next. Blue arrows are synapses that connect to neurons in equal or lower groups. Neurons that are labeled in the same group are drawn horizontally in rows; these neurons fire near simultaneously. Successive groups are positioned vertically such that the relative spike time in the network flowing from top to bottom (see <a href="#pone.0000723.s001">Text S1</a> for details of the algorithm used to assign groups). Each neuron had space to support 10 supersynapses. There were 10 neurons in the training set. Synaptic plasticity parameters for the simulation were set as follows. The LTP constant was <em>G<sub>LTP</sub></em> = 0.3; the synaptic conductance threshold for activation/inactivation was Θ<em><sub>A</sub></em> = 0.2; the synaptic conductance threshold for supersynapses was Θ<em><sub>S</sub></em> = 0.4; the maximum synaptic conductance was <em>G</em><sub>max</sub> = 0.6 (the unit of all conductances is the leak conductance of a neuron). The rate of synaptic decay—the amount by which each synapse is scaled down after every trial—was <em>β</em> = 0.999996. See <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> for more details.</p>
