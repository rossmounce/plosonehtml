Spikes of neurons in the same group are shown in the same row. Spikes of all pool neurons are shown in the same row at the bottom. In trial 50000, there are 21 groups, and the chain activity lasts for approximately 100 ms, after which spontaneous activity of the pool neurons begins. By trial 100000, there are 39 groups, and chain activity lasts about 200 ms. The inset shows a detail of spikes from three successive groups; spikes of a group cluster together, but those of successive groups can overlap. The duration of the chain activity and its growth in time is also demonstrated with the population firing rate (lower). Spikes of all neurons were convolved using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 3 ms to compute the population firing rate. The firing rates for three different trials—50000, 100000, and 150000 (raster not shown)—are plotted versus time. The duration of chain activity increases linearly with the number of trials (data not shown). (B) Raster plots across trials for select neurons show how precise spike timings emerge. Each panel shows spike data across 300000 trials sampled every 10000<sup>th</sup> trial for that neuron; the group to which each neuron belongs is indicated in the panel. The neuron in Group 1 is a TN, and therefore is induced to spike at the beginning of each trial (lower panel). The other neurons (upper panels) are recruited into the synfire network at later trials; thus, early on, they only spike spontaneously. As neurons from the chain strengthen synaptic connections onto each neuron, it begins to spike with high accuracy. Inset shows a detail from a neuron in Group 15. (C) Raster plot of mean spike times (vertical dashes) and spike timing jitters (horizontal error bars) for the earliest 100 neurons in the chain. The network—formed over 350000 trials—was simulated for an additional 1000 trials, and the spike data for all neurons was recorded. The first spike time of each neuron was averaged across all 1000 trials, and the jitter (standard error) of the first spike time was calculated. Only those neurons that spiked in at least one-half of all trials are shown. Insets show details from two different time periods. Note that neurons with smaller latency have smaller spike timing jitter.</p>
