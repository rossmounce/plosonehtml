For each point, the simulation was run until there were no further changes in the supersynaptic structure. Next, the simulation was run for an additional 100 trials, spike data was collected, and the number of neurons that spike in at least 75 percent of all trials was counted; this number, called the network size, is coded by grayscale and written in each box. A higher value indicates a longer synfire chain network since more neurons are induced to spike regularly.</p>
