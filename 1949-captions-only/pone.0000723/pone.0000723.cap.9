                Figure 9.  Network formation with turnover.(A) A network formed while neurons died and renewed at an average rate of 1 per 1000 trials through a Poisson process. Even with the turnover, the neurons were able to form a synfire network. (B) Population activity in single trials during the formation process are similar to those without turnover (Figure 4A). The duration of chain activity increases with the number of training trials. (C) Spikes of individual neurons across trials show different behaviors than those without turnover (Figure 4B). A recruited neuron can be deleted (second panel from bottom). Upstream neurons (three upper panels) can shift their spiking times forward as they fill slots vacated by deleted neurons in earlier groups. (D) Spike timings across 100 trials shows that neurons in the chain spike with accuracy on the order of ms.
