Sec1p coding sequence in yellow, the floxed blasticidin cassette (BsR) in blue, the rest of the genome in red. (B) Transforming DNA used to measure homologous recombination at this site. (C) Layout of the gene after homologous recombination has occurred between the genome in A and the DNA in B. (D) Transforming the <em>Dictyostelium</em> line, shown in C, with Cre recombinase leads to the loss of the blasticidin cassette, yielding the <em>sec1A</em> strain SD5, having a single inserted 3â€² <em>loxP</em> site. (E) Singly loxed transforming DNA used to measure homologous recombination and carry out mutagenesis. (F) Layout of the <em>sec1A</em> gene after homologous recombination between strain SD5 and the DNA in E.</p>
