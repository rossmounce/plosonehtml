                Figure 1.  The sec1A locus of Dictyostelium and constructs.(A) Layout of genomic site of sec1A; in each figure the dots at each end of a DNA stretch indicate that that DNA is part of the genome. Sec1p coding sequence in yellow, the floxed blasticidin cassette (BsR) in blue, the rest of the genome in red. (B) Transforming DNA used to measure homologous recombination at this site. (C) Layout of the gene after homologous recombination has occurred between the genome in A and the DNA in B. (D) Transforming the Dictyostelium line, shown in C, with Cre recombinase leads to the loss of the blasticidin cassette, yielding the sec1A strain SD5, having a single inserted 3â€² loxP site. (E) Singly loxed transforming DNA used to measure homologous recombination and carry out mutagenesis. (F) Layout of the sec1A gene after homologous recombination between strain SD5 and the DNA in E.
