                Figure 2.  Locomotory behaviour of sec1A1. Cells were plated out in growth medium in a small optical chamber and allowed to attach to the glass underslip.The cells, examined using a microscope fitted with a heated stage, are shown at 22°C and after an interval of 10 mins: the temperature was then shifted to 27.5°C and the cells followed for a further 45 mins. sec1A1 cells move normally at 22°C, but progressively lose this ability at 27.5°C, so that after about 30 mins, most have a rounded appearance and cease translocating. They do, however, continue to put out small protrusions. Scale bar: 10μ.
