                Figure 3.  Locomotory behaviour of the parental line, Ax2. Cells were plated out as in Fig 2.The cells are shown at 22°C for 10 mins: the temperature was then shifted to 27.5°C and the cells followed for a further 45 mins. Ax2 cells move normally at 22°C and continue to do so at 27.5°C. Scale bar: 10μ.
