                Figure 1.  Composition of the LIPO-4 vaccine.The amino acid sequences correspond to the four antigenic segments of HIV proteins (red) covalently linked to the T-helper–stimulating epitope of tetanus toxin (TT, black) and linker residues (green). The lines under the HIV sequences represent 12 previously reported CD8+ T-cell–stimulating epitopes (peptide numbers in brown); the HLA class-I molecules (A or B in blue) restricting the T-cell responses are also indicated.
