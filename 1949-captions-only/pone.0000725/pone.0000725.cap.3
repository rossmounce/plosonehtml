                Figure 3.  CD8+ T-cell responses (ELISpot IFNγ) to HIV peptides as a function of vaccination route, expressed as individual response.Panel A, all responders (N = 68), and Panel B, responders given 3 injections (N = 44°. For each responder, the magnitude of the response against individual HIV peptides, expressed as the total spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (SFU/106 PBMC), evaluated at times 1–4 corresponding to weeks 2, 6, 14 and 24.
