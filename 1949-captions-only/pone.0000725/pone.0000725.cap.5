Subjects in each panel are ordered as follows: CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell nonresponders (ELISpot IFNγ), CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responders (proliferation) and, finally, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responders. Injections were given at weeks 0 and 4 to all 68 subjects and also at week 12 to 44 subjects ND, not done; NA, not applicable.</p>
