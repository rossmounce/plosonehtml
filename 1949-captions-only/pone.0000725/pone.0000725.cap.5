                Figure 5.  Summary of responses induced in vaccinated volunteers after 1, 2 or 3 intradermal (Panel A, N = 33) or intramuscular (Panel B, N = 35) injections.Responses were evaluated at weeks 2, 6, 14 and 24 as follows: CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV peptides, assessed with ELISpot IFNγ (total SFU/106 PBMC defined as total SFU of positive responses minus the background: nonresponder empty; &lt;100 crosshatched; 100–&lt;500 solid squares; 500+ dotted); CD4+ T-cell proliferation against TT peptide (stimulation index: &lt;3 empty; 3–&lt;5 crosshatched; 5–&lt;10 dotted; &gt;10 solid) and induration present 48–72 hours postinjection (diameter (mm): none open; &lt;5 crosshatched; 5–&lt;10 dotted; &gt;10 solid). Subjects in each panel are ordered as follows: CD8+ T-cell nonresponders (ELISpot IFNγ), CD4+ T-cell responders (proliferation) and, finally, CD4+ T-cell responders. Injections were given at weeks 0 and 4 to all 68 subjects and also at week 12 to 44 subjects ND, not done; NA, not applicable.
