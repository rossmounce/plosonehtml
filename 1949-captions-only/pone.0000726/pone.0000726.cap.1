                Figure 1.  SHIVSF162P4 loads in plasma (A), CD4+ T cell counts in peripheral blood (B), relative CCL3 (C), CCL4 (D) and CCL5 (E) gene expression levels in PBMCs at PID 0-180 with SHIVSF162P4.Each point on the graph represents the mean fold change in gene expression relative to pre-infection levelÂ±SE (n = 5).
