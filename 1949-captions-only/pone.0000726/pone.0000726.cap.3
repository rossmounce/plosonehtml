                Figure 3.  Triple-label confocal microscopy of CCL4+ cells in mesenteric lymph nodes obtained from control (PID 0) and SHIVSF162P4-inoculated macaques at PID 14.T lymphocytes (CD3+) are red, CCL4+ cells are green, SHIVSF162P4-infected cells (p28+) are blue. Overlap of red and green fluorescence is seen as yellow, overlap of red and blue as pink. Higher number of CD3+CCL4+ cells was seen at PID 0 than at PID 14 (Table 1) while CD3+p28+ cells could be seen at PID 14 but not at PID 0 indicating the successful spread of virus into GALTs following mucosal inoculation.
