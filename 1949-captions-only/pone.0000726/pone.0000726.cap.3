Overlap of red and green fluorescence is seen as yellow, overlap of red and blue as pink. Higher number of CD3+CCL4+ cells was seen at PID 0 than at PID 14 (<a href="#pone-0000726-t001">Table 1</a>) while CD3+p28+ cells could be seen at PID 14 but not at PID 0 indicating the successful spread of virus into GALTs following mucosal inoculation.</p>
