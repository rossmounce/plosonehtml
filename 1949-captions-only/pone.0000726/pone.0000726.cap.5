                Figure 5.  The proportions of peripheral blood CD3+CD4+CCL4+ and CD3+CD8+CCL4+ T lymphocytes were compared at PID 0 and PID 14 with SHIVSF162P4 by flow cytometry (A).Gating was performed via CD3+ lymphocyte population. Statistically significant differences between CD3+CD4+CCL4+ and CD3+CD8+CCL4+ cells over CD3+ lymphocytes at PID 0 vs. PID 14 (n = 5) are shown (B).
