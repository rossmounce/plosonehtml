(B) STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils are able to produce TNF-α. 1×10<sup>6</sup> peritoneal neutrophils from control or mutant mice were stimulated for 6 h with PMA (1 µg/ml), and TNF-α concentration in cell supernatants was then measured by ELISA. (C) STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils are phagocytic. CFSE-labeled <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> were incubated with peritoneal neutrophils at 37°C for 30 min (T0), and gentamycin was added for an additional 30 min (T30). Cells washed free of extracellular bacteria at T0 or T30 min were analyzed by FACS for engulfed bacteria. (D) STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils are bactericidal. Engulfed bacteria were released by lysing peritoneal neutrophils in 1 ml water. One hundred microliters of a 1:1,000 dilution of the bacterial suspension was plated and colonies were counted after a 24-h incubation at 37°C.</p>
