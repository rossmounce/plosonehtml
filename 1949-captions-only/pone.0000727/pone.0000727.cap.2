MACS-purified blood peripheral neutrophils from wild-type (WT) and STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> mice were cultured for 24 hr in the absence or presence of 0.5 or 25 ng/ml G-CSF or 25 ng/ml GM-CSF. Freshly purified (T0) and 24-hr cultured (T24) neutrophils were assayed for apoptosis using dual color annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analyses. *, significantly different from T0 values with P&lt;0.05. °, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05. (B) Bone marrow was harvested from both hind limbs of either WT or STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> mice, and cell counts were determined after red blood cell lysis. (C–F) Mature marrow neutrophils (CD11c<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>hi</sup> cells), GMPs (Lin<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>−</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>FcγR<sup>+</sup> cells), CMPs (Sca-1<sup>−</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>FcγR<sup>low</sup> cells), and HSCs (Lin<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>c-kit<sup>hi</sup>) from the bone marrow of control and mutant mice were counted by flow cytometry. Absolute values were generated by multiplying gated percentages by total cell numbers. (G) Freshly FACS-purified marrow neutrophils, GMPs, CMPs, and HSCs were assayed for apoptosis using trypan blue exclusion. (B–G) *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05.</p>
