                Figure 2.  Increased granulopoiesis in STAT5−/− mice.(A) Apoptosis of peripheral neutrophils. MACS-purified blood peripheral neutrophils from wild-type (WT) and STAT5−/− mice were cultured for 24 hr in the absence or presence of 0.5 or 25 ng/ml G-CSF or 25 ng/ml GM-CSF. Freshly purified (T0) and 24-hr cultured (T24) neutrophils were assayed for apoptosis using dual color annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analyses. *, significantly different from T0 values with P&lt;0.05. °, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05. (B) Bone marrow was harvested from both hind limbs of either WT or STAT5−/− mice, and cell counts were determined after red blood cell lysis. (C–F) Mature marrow neutrophils (CD11c+Gr-1hi cells), GMPs (Lin−Sca-1−IL-7Rα−c-kit+CD34+FcγR+ cells), CMPs (Sca-1−IL-7Rα−c-kit+CD34+FcγRlow cells), and HSCs (Lin−Sca-1hiIL-7Rα−c-kithi) from the bone marrow of control and mutant mice were counted by flow cytometry. Absolute values were generated by multiplying gated percentages by total cell numbers. (G) Freshly FACS-purified marrow neutrophils, GMPs, CMPs, and HSCs were assayed for apoptosis using trypan blue exclusion. (B–G) *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05.
