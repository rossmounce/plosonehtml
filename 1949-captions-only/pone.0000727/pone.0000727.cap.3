                Figure 3.  Association between increased granulopoiesis and elevated G-CSF production in STAT5−/− mice.(A) Elevated G-CSF serum levels in STAT5−/− mice. G-CSF and SCF concentrations in the serum of wild-type (WT) and STAT5−/− mice were determined by ELISA. *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05. (B) Proliferation of bone marrow cells from wild-type and mutant mice in response to G-CSF. 2×105 STAT5−/− or control bone marrow cells were cultured with G-CSF in various concentrations for 48 hr before cells were pulsed with 3[H]thymidine for 16 hr. Note that mutant cells stimulated with 5×10−1 ng/ml G-CSF displayed a 1.7-fold and a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation, respectively, compared with control cells and mutant cells stimulated with 2×10−2 ng/ml G-CSF. (A, B) *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05.
