G-CSF and SCF concentrations in the serum of wild-type (WT) and STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> mice were determined by ELISA. *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05. (B) Proliferation of bone marrow cells from wild-type and mutant mice in response to G-CSF. 2×10<sup>5</sup> STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> or control bone marrow cells were cultured with G-CSF in various concentrations for 48 hr before cells were pulsed with <sup>3</sup>[H]thymidine for 16 hr. Note that mutant cells stimulated with 5×10<sup>−1</sup> ng/ml G-CSF displayed a 1.7-fold and a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation, respectively, compared with control cells and mutant cells stimulated with 2×10<sup>−2</sup> ng/ml G-CSF. (A, B) *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05.</p>
