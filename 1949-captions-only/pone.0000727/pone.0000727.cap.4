Liver and heart from wild-type (WT) and STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assayed for G-CSF mRNA expression by real time quantitative RT-PCR. All values are normalized to β–actin mRNA. No G-CSF mRNA was detected in WT heart. (B) LECs are the source of G-CSF in STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Liver sections from WT and mutant mice were stained to detect G-CSF (brown). Both endothelial cells lining the central vein (open arrow) and sinusoidal endothelial cells (solid arrow) stained for G-CSF. Original magnification, 250×. (C) STAT5<sup>−/−</sup> LSECs autonomously produce high quantities of G-CSF. WT and STAT5<sup>−/−</sup>LSECs were isolated, seeded onto 6-well flat-bottom plates at a density of 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well, and cultured for 3 days after which the medium was refreshed. Supernatants were harvested 6 hr later and analyzed for G-CSF concentration by ELISA. *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05.</p>
