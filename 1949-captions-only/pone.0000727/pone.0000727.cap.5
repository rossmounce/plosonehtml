                Figure 5.  Degradation of cytoplasmic STAT5b in WT LECs following inflammatory stimulation, and subsequent enhancement of G-CSF production.(A) Wild-type mice were injected intravenously with PBS or with 2 µg recombinant murine TNF-α and 2 µg recombinant murine IL-1β. Livers were harvested 30 min later, and liver sections were analyzed for STAT5b expression and localization by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as described in the Experimental Procedures. (a) STAT5b was present in the cytoplasm (green), but not the nucleus (arrows), of LECs of PBS-treated mice. (d) STAT5b was no longer detectable in LECs of cytokine-treated mice. All cell nuclei in the fields are shown by hexidium iodide staining (red, b and e), and merges of frames (a) and (b), and (d) and (e), are given in (c) and (f), respectively. Bars = 10 µm. (B) Livers collected from cytokine-treated mice were assayed for G-CSF mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Livers were harvested before cytokine injection (T0), or either 1 (T1) or 4 (T4) hr postinjection. All values are normalized to β-actin mRNA. (C) Liver sections from untreated mice (left panel) and mice treated for 4 hr with TNF-α and IL-1β (right panel) were stained to visualize G-CSF (brown). Original magnification, 250×. (D) LSECs were isolated from wild-type mice and cultured for 3 days before experiments were performed. Cells were treated for 0 (T0), 1 (T1), 3 (T3) or 6 (T6) hr with 100 IU/ml TNF-α and 500 pg/ml IL-1β. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for STAT5b expression by immunoblot. Equal loading of proteins on the gel was confirmed by probing the blots for β-actin (cytoplasmic extracts) or Oct-1 (nuclear extracts). (E) Nuclear protein extracts were assessed for STAT5 DNA-binding activity by EMSAs. Binding of Oct-1 was used as an internal standard. Nuclear extracts from prolactin-stimulated bovine MAC-T cells were used as positive controls for STAT5 activation (control). (F) G-CSF concentrations in LSEC supernatants were measured by ELISAs. *, significantly different from T0 values with P&lt;0.05. (G) LSECs were isolated from wild-type mice and cultured for 3 days before experiments were conducted. Cells were treated with 20 µM MG132 for 30 min prior to stimulation with 100 IU/ml TNF-α and 500 pg/ml IL-1β. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 0 (T0), 1 (T1), 3 (T3), and 6 (T6) hr later and analyzed for STAT5b expression by immunoblot. Equal loading of proteins on the gel was confirmed by probing the blots for β-actin. (H) LSECs stimulated for 0 (T0), 1 (T1), 3 (T3), and 6 (T6) hr with 100 IU/ml TNF-α and 500 pg/ml IL-1β were assayed for STAT5b mRNA expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. All values were normalized to β-actin mRNA.
