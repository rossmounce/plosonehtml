                Figure 6.  STAT5−/− mice are unable to maintain neutrophil homeostasis during cytokine-induced inflammation.(A) Wild-type (WT) and mutant mice were injected intravenously with 2 µg recombinant murine TNF-α and 2 µg recombinant murine IL-1β. Serum G-CSF concentrations were measured by ELISA before (T0) and 6 (T6), 24 (T24), and 48 (T48) hr after cytokine injection. (B) Blood neutrophils were counted at the different time points. (C) Mature marrow neutrophils (CD11c+Gr-1hi cells) from control and mutant mice were counted by flow cytometry. Absolute values were generated by multiplying gated percentages by total cell numbers. (D) Blood neutrophils were isolated by MACS from wild-type and mutant mice 24 hr after cytokine injection. Freshly purified (T0) and 24-hr cultured (T24) neutrophils were assayed for apoptosis using dual color annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analyses. (A–D) *, significantly different from WT values with P&lt;0.05. °, significantly different from T0 values with P&lt;0.05.
