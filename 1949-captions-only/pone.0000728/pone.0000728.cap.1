                Figure 1.  18S rDNA Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree showing the assignment of Disko Island phylotypes to major eukaryote clades.The numbers a/b indicate the total number of GenBank sequences representing the clade/the number of phylotypes detected. Ancestral sequences to a specific clade were included in the clade itself. Only protistan and fungal sequences are shown in the tree. Detailed phylogenies (partial treeing analyses) can be found in Figures 2â€“10.
