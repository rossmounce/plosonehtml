                Figure 3.  Minimum evolution phylogenetic tree of 18S rDNA sequences showing the position of basal-branching Disko Island sequences.The tree was constructed under Maximum Likelihood criteria (ML) using a General Time Reversible (GTR) DNA substitution model with the variable-site gamma distribution shape parameter (G) at 1.3667, the proportion of invariable sites (I) at 0.0658, and base frequencies and a rate matrix for the substitution model as suggested by Modeltest (see Material and Methods), based on 553 unambiguously aligned and conserved positions. Because of their uncertain position in phylogenetic 18S rDNA sequence trees, the branching orders of the primitive jakobid flagellates and the Myrionecta/Mesodinium (Ciliophora) group are not supported. For a detailed explanation of the basal branching of the latter group see e.g. [31], [68]. Distance bootstrap values over 50% from an analysis of 1000 bootstrap replicates are given at the respective nodes; dots identify nodes with 100% bootstrap support. Clone names in red, blue, and green identify sequences reported in this study (DI) and from hydrothermal vent and temperate environments, respectively. The first two identifiers of the DI sequences (D1â€“D5) designate the different PCR primer sets used in this study (detailed information in Table 2).
