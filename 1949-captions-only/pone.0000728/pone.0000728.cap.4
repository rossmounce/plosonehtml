Distance bootstrap values over 50% from an analysis of 1000 bootstrap replicates are given at the respective nodes; dots identify nodes with 100% bootstrap support. Clone names in red, blue, and green identify sequences reported in this study (DI) and from hydrothermal vent and temperate environments, respectively. The first two identifiers of the DI sequences (D1â€“D5) designate the different PCR primer sets used in this study (detailed information in <a href="#pone-0000728-t002">Table 2</a>).</p>
