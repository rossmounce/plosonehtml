The molecular shape of the scramblase (center) is arbitrary, since the protein responsible for this activity is not known. One possibility, investigated here, is that the ABCA1 protein is actually the protein responsible for this activity; another possibility is that the ABCA1 protein transports PS from the inner to the outer leaflet, as depicted. An HDL particle (far right) is also drawn approximately to scale by extrapolation from the structure of other lipoprotein particles, with the apoA1 protein drawn as the belt-like helices enclosing the lipid core. The molecular shape of an unlipidated apoA1 protein is unknown.</p>
