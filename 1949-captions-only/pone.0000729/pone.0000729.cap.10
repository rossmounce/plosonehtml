                Figure 10.  Phagocytosis of apoptotic targets by wildtype or ABCA1−/− macrophages.A&amp;B, phagocytosis of non-apoptotic or apoptotic thymocytes from wildtype (black) or ABCA1−/− (gray) mice by peritoneal macrophages from wildtype (A) or ABCA1−/− (B) mice. C, phagocytosis of camptothecin-induced apoptotic EBV-transformed normal (black) or Tangier (gray) human B lymphocytes, either untreated or pre-treated with 10 µM Annexin V, then washed prior to presentation to mouse J774 macrophages. Error bars represent the standard error of 3 replicates.
