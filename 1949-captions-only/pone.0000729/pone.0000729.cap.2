                Figure 2.  Internalization (translocation) of NBD-labeled phospholipids by normal human fibroblasts and fibroblasts from Tangier individuals.The outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of normal (circles) or Tangier (squares) fibroblasts was labeled with NBD-PC (open symbols) or NBD-PS (filled symbols). At various times samples were removed into BSA to extract outer leaflet probe and remaining inner leaflet probe was measured by flow cytometry and expressed as percent transported. Measurements were made at room temperature. (A) Viable fibroblasts, (B) spontaneously apoptotic fibroblasts. Dashed and dotted lines in B have been redrawn from A for transport by normal fibroblasts.
