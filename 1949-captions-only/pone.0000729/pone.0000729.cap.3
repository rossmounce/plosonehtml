                Figure 3.  Endogenous PS externalization in normal and ABCA1-deficient cells measured by continuous annexin V binding assay.(A) Normal or Tangier human fibroblasts, (B) EBV-transformed normal or Tangier B lymphocytes, or (C and D) thymocytes from wildtype or ABCA1−/− mice were treated with Ca2+ and Ca2+ ionophore, and cellular fluorescence in the presence of fluorescent annexin V measured continuously over time at room temperature. Normal/wildtype, filled circles; ABCA1-deficient, open circles. A–C, median fluorescence of cells; D, fraction of cells stained by fluorescent annexin.
