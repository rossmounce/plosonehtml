                Figure 4.  Endogenous PS externalization in apoptotic EBV-transformed human B lymphocytes.EBV-transformed normal (A–D) or Tangier (E–H) B lymphocytes were untreated (A&amp;B, E&amp;F) or treated with camptothecin (C&amp;D, G&amp;H) to induce apoptosis, stained with fluorescent annexin V, and examined by flow cytometry. Left panel, forward (FS) vs side (SS) light scatter plots, with cells of normal size and shape in the R2 gate and shrunken cells in the R1 gate. Right panel, fluorescence profile of cells in the R2 gate.
