                Figure 5.  Basal (or Ca2+-activated) NBD-PS externalization in normal and ABCA1-deficient cells.(A) Normal human or Tangier fibroblasts, (B) EBV-transformed normal or Tangier B lymphocytes, (C) Control or ABCA1-GFP-transfected HeLa cells, (D) thymocytes from wildtype or ABCA1−/− mice, (E) normal human fibroblasts or (F) Tangier fibroblasts were allowed to internalize NBD-PS, dithionite added to reduce and render non-fluorescent externalized NBD-PS, and cellular fluorescence (unexternalized NBD-PS) measured continuously over time at room temperature. (A–D) normal/wildtype, filled symbols; ABCA1-deficient or replete (HeLa), open symbols. (D) untreated, circles; treated with Ca2+ and Ca2+ ionophore, squares. (E and F) presence (open triangles) or absence (closed triangles) of apoA1.
