A, forward (FS) vs side (SS) light scatter plot, with cells having typical macrophage light scatter characteristics in the M gate and Asmall@ cells in the S gate. B, median fluorescence intensity of cells in the M gate (black) or S gate (grey) following staining with mAb F4/80 or isotype control mAb. C&amp;D, annexin V staining, in the presence (thin line) or absence (thick line) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, of cells in the M gate from wildtype (C) or <em>ABCA1<sup>−/−</sup></em> (D) mice.</p>
