At various times samples were removed into dithionate to reduce outer leaflet probe and after 5 min remaining inner leaflet probe was measured by flow cytometry at room temperature and expressed as percent transported. Cells from wildtype (triangles) and <em>ABCA1<sup>−/−</sup></em> (circles) mice in the S gate in <a href="#pone-0000729-g006">Figure 6</a> are shown for comparison.</p>
