                Figure 7.  Internalization (translocation) of NBD-labeled phospholipids by peritoneal macrophages from wildtype and ABCA1−/− mice.The outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of macrophages from wildtype (diamonds) or ABCA1−/− (squares) mice was labeled with NBD-PC (open symbols) or NBD-PS (closed symbols). At various times samples were removed into dithionate to reduce outer leaflet probe and after 5 min remaining inner leaflet probe was measured by flow cytometry at room temperature and expressed as percent transported. Cells from wildtype (triangles) and ABCA1−/− (circles) mice in the S gate in Figure 6 are shown for comparison.
