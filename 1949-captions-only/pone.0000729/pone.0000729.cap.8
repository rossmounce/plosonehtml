                Figure 8.  Basal NBD-PS externalization in peritoneal macrophages from wildtype or ABCA1−/− mice.Macrophages (squares) or cells in the S gate in Figure 6 (circles) from wildtype (filled symbols) or ABCA1−/− (open symbols) mice were allowed to internalize NBD-PS, dithionite was added to reduce and render non-fluorescent externalized NBD-PS, and cellular fluorescence (unexternalized NBD-PS) was measured continuously over time (A). Rate constants derived by simple exponential fit to the data for macrophages (black) and gated S cells (grey) are compared in (B).
