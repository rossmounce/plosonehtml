The positions of the primers are shown by black arrows, where the corresponding pairs are depicted with the same line pattern (full line, dotted line, “dash-dot-dash” line). The three nucleotides missing in the genomic sequence of the database entry are framed with red rectangles. Based on the nucleotide numbering in cosmid F41G3, their positions are: C after 30028, A after 29776 and C after position 28351. The coding region of the gene is 4422 bp long with 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of 212 and 160 bp, respectively (dark gray boxes; EMBL/GeneBank Accession AM773423). The predicted protein sequence is 1473 amino acids long and the domain architecture is shown in different colors. A putative signal sequence (purple box) is followed by seven follistatin domains (blue), two epidermal growth factor domains of the laminin-type (light gray), a follistatin domain (blue), an EGF-like domain (orange) and two laminin G domains (yellow).</p>
