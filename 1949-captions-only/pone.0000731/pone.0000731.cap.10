                Figure 10.  Recombinant C. elegans agrin clusters endogenous dystroglycan in COS cells.COS cells were transfected with the recombinant fragment of C. elegans agrin and immunostained for agrin and endogenous β-DG. A–D, agrin staining; E–F, anti-β-DG staining; I–L, overlay including nuclear staining. A–C, In transfected cells, secreted agrin bound to the cell surface in a patchy pattern to cells producing large quantities of agrin (A) as well as to cells expressing little or no agrin themselves (B, C). The cells were co-immunostained for endogenous β-DG (E–H) which, in transfected cell cultures, colocalized with agrin on cell surfaces. In non-transfected cells (D–L), no agrin staining was present (D) and β-DG showed diffuse staining (H and L).
