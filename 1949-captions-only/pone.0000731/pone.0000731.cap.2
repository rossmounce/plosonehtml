Black arrows indicate the three locations where a nucleotide is missing in the database genomic sequence (exons 14, 15 and 20; cf. <a href="#pone-0000731-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Three mutations in the agrin gene were isolated. In the <em>eg1770</em> mutant strain (black arrowhead) <em>Mos1</em> transposon was inserted into the seventh exon which results in an out-of-frame transcript, therefore causing a putative strong loss of function mutation. The <em>eg153</em> strain (asterisk) was created by imprecise excision of the <em>Mos1</em> transposon leaving 5 bp at the insertion site and resulting in a +2 frameshift mutation. Mutant <em>tm2051</em> (dotted line) carries a deletion of 423 bp including exons 26 and 27 resulting in an in-frame loss of 42 amino acids.</p>
