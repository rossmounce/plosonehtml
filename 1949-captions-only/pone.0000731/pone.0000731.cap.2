                Figure 2.  Genomic organization of the agr-1 gene and mutant alleles.The assembled transcript consists of 29 exons which span over almost 14.5 kb on chromosome 2. Black arrows indicate the three locations where a nucleotide is missing in the database genomic sequence (exons 14, 15 and 20; cf. Fig. 1). Three mutations in the agrin gene were isolated. In the eg1770 mutant strain (black arrowhead) Mos1 transposon was inserted into the seventh exon which results in an out-of-frame transcript, therefore causing a putative strong loss of function mutation. The eg153 strain (asterisk) was created by imprecise excision of the Mos1 transposon leaving 5 bp at the insertion site and resulting in a +2 frameshift mutation. Mutant tm2051 (dotted line) carries a deletion of 423 bp including exons 26 and 27 resulting in an in-frame loss of 42 amino acids.
