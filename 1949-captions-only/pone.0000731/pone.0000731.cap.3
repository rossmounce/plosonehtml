                Figure 3.  Domain architecture of the C. elegans agrin protein in comparison to the vertebrate orthologues.C. elegans agrin starts with a signal sequence (SS; purple), followed by seven follistatin-like domains (F; blue), two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains of the laminin-type (LE; gray), one follistatin-like domain (F; blue), an EGF-like domain (EG; orange), and two laminin G domains at the C terminus (LamG; yellow). The color scheme follows the same pattern as presented in the Fig. 1. Predicted N-glycosylation sites are shown with blue circles. Vertebrate agrins have two alternative N-termini: a secreted form, with a signal sequence (SS; dark purple) and a laminin-binding N-terminal agrin domain (NtA; light purple). These are followed by follistatin domains, including one more than in C. elegans (F; blue), a sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin domain (SEA; light blue), two serine/threonine rich regions (S/T; light orange), and three laminin G domains (LamG; yellow). O-linked heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains are schematically shown as branches and several N-linked glycoslation sites as blue circles. Alternative splicing at the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin (A/y and B/z) gives rise to several agrin isoforms with different functions, but no alternative splicing was found in C. elegans agrin. Three separate segments of C. elegans agrin marked by dashed lines were used in a Blast search. The resulting degrees of identity/similarity to the corresponding parts of chicken agrin (Swissprot entry P31696-2) are indicated. Recombinant fragments 1 and 2 of C. elegans agrin indicated above the LamG domains were used as antigens for raising monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, respectively.
