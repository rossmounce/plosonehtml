The color scheme follows the same pattern as presented in the <a href="#pone-0000731-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Predicted N-glycosylation sites are shown with blue circles. Vertebrate agrins have two alternative N-termini: a secreted form, with a signal sequence (SS; dark purple) and a laminin-binding N-terminal agrin domain (NtA; light purple). These are followed by follistatin domains, including one more than in <em>C. elegans</em> (F; blue), a sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin domain (SEA; light blue), two serine/threonine rich regions (S/T; light orange), and three laminin G domains (LamG; yellow). O-linked heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains are schematically shown as branches and several N-linked glycoslation sites as blue circles. Alternative splicing at the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin (A/y and B/z) gives rise to several agrin isoforms with different functions, but no alternative splicing was found in <em>C. elegans</em> agrin. Three separate segments of <em>C. elegans</em> agrin marked by dashed lines were used in a Blast search. The resulting degrees of identity/similarity to the corresponding parts of chicken agrin (Swissprot entry P31696-2) are indicated. Recombinant fragments 1 and 2 of <em>C. elegans</em> agrin indicated above the LamG domains were used as antigens for raising monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, respectively.</p>
