After the analysis of an extensive alignment, the best hits were selected for this representation and include: the predicted agrin orthologue of <em>C. briggsae</em> (Agrin_LamG1_<em>C.briggsae</em>), the agrin LamG2 domains of the human, electric ray and chicken proteins, the LamG2 and LamG1 of human perlecan and the LamG4 of a laminin-like protein 2 (LAML2) identified in <em>C. elegans</em>. The similarities between each of the sequences compared to the <em>C. elegans</em> lamG1 are expressed as % identity/% similarity. B, The second LamG domain of the <em>C. elegans</em> protein (Agrin_LamG2_<em>C.elegans</em>) was used as a query for Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases. After the analysis of a more extensive alignment, the best hits were selected for this representation and include: the predicted agrin orthologue of <em>C. briggsae</em> (Agrin_LamG2_<em>C. briggsae</em>), the LamG4 of human lamininA4, the LamG3 of human perlecan and the agrin LamG3 domains of the human, electric ray and chicken proteins. The similarities between each of the sequences compared to the <em>C. elegans</em> lamG1 are expressed as % identity/% similarity. C, The <em>C. elegans</em> agrin sequence aligns best with the B<sub>0</sub>/z<sub>0</sub> isoforms of chick and rat agrin, respectively. The conserved alternatively spliced agrin exons, encoding 8 aa, 11 aa or 19 aa inserts at this site, do not exist in <em>C. elegans</em>.</p>
