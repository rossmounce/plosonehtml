                Figure 4.  Alignment of the C. elegans lamG domains to the corresponding domains of other proteins.A, The first LamG domain of the C. elegans protein (Agrin_LamG1_C.elegans) was used as a query for Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases. After the analysis of an extensive alignment, the best hits were selected for this representation and include: the predicted agrin orthologue of C. briggsae (Agrin_LamG1_C.briggsae), the agrin LamG2 domains of the human, electric ray and chicken proteins, the LamG2 and LamG1 of human perlecan and the LamG4 of a laminin-like protein 2 (LAML2) identified in C. elegans. The similarities between each of the sequences compared to the C. elegans lamG1 are expressed as % identity/% similarity. B, The second LamG domain of the C. elegans protein (Agrin_LamG2_C.elegans) was used as a query for Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases. After the analysis of a more extensive alignment, the best hits were selected for this representation and include: the predicted agrin orthologue of C. briggsae (Agrin_LamG2_C. briggsae), the LamG4 of human lamininA4, the LamG3 of human perlecan and the agrin LamG3 domains of the human, electric ray and chicken proteins. The similarities between each of the sequences compared to the C. elegans lamG1 are expressed as % identity/% similarity. C, The C. elegans agrin sequence aligns best with the B0/z0 isoforms of chick and rat agrin, respectively. The conserved alternatively spliced agrin exons, encoding 8 aa, 11 aa or 19 aa inserts at this site, do not exist in C. elegans.
