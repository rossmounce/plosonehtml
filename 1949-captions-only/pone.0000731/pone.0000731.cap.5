The lengths of the promoter or gene sequences and the names of the the <em>pagr-1</em>::<em>reporter</em> plasmids and DNA arrays are indicated. Since all of these constructs resulted in the same expression patterns, representative micrographs of the <em>kdIs66</em> transgenic worms are shown in B–J. B Expression starts in 2 cells in the anterior part of the embryo at around the 64 AB cell stage. C, Towards the end of gastrulation expression is seen in about 40 cells throughout the embryo including neuronal precursors, several ventral hypodermal cells and pharyngeal precursor cells (ventral view). D At the 1 1/2 to 2 fold stage expression is seen in IL1 neurons (identity determined postembryonically), embryonic motoneurons and a number of additional cells in the head, most likely arcade cells and epithelial buccal cells in the pharynx, and in few apoptotic cells (marked by +). E, In the 3fold stage embryos expression is seen in the IL1 neurons (6 neurons), most of the arcade cells (3 anterior arcade cells and the DL and DR posterior arcade cells) and the buccal epithelial cells in the pharynx. The 2 lateral IL1 neurons express GFP only weakly and only in early larval stages, wheras the remaining 4 IL1 neurons express GFP strongly throughout all larval stages. F (dorsal view) and I In L1 larvae expression is observed, in the buccal epithelial cells (dashed arrow), in 3 anterior arcade cells and the DL and DR posterior arcade cells (arrowheads), and in IL1v and IL1d neurons (arrows) and posterior gut cells (asterisk). In F, the worm was co-stained with DiI. G and H Head of a young adult worm; expression is visible in the buccal epithelial cells (dashed arrows) and in the IL1v and IL1d neurons (arrows); open arrowheads point at the IL1 processes in the nerve ring. J, L2 larva; expression in the migrating distal tip cells (arrows) and posterior gut (asterisk). Bars are 10μm.</p>
