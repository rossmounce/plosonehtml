In D–F, no costaining is observed between <em>agr-1::GFP</em> (D) and DiI+CaAcetate (E) in <em>kdIs66</em> transgenic animals. In G–I, costaining is observed in <em>eat-4::GFP</em> (G) and <em>agr-1::dsRED</em> (H) in <em>adIs1240; kdEx71</em> transgenic worms. Figures C, F, I show merged channels. In all panels dashed arrows point out dendrites; arrows point to neuronal cell bodies; arrowheads mark buccal epithelial cells and asterisks indicate the nerve ring.</p>
