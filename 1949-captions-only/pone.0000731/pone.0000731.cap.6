                Figure 6.   Agr-1 expression in IL1d and IL1v neurons.A–C, DiI staining in hdEx25 trangenic worms; no co-staining is observed between agr-1::YFP (A) and DiI (B). In D–F, no costaining is observed between agr-1::GFP (D) and DiI+CaAcetate (E) in kdIs66 transgenic animals. In G–I, costaining is observed in eat-4::GFP (G) and agr-1::dsRED (H) in adIs1240; kdEx71 transgenic worms. Figures C, F, I show merged channels. In all panels dashed arrows point out dendrites; arrows point to neuronal cell bodies; arrowheads mark buccal epithelial cells and asterisks indicate the nerve ring.
