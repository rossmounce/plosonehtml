                Figure 7.  Antibodies against C. elegans agrin.A, Schematic representation of the recombinant fragments used as antigen to raise monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. For eukaryotic expression the C-terminal lamG domains were fused to a short fragment of chicken tenascin C (Tn-C), including a secretion signal and the epitope of the anti-Tn60 antibody. The specificity of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies was tested by western blotting on conditioned medium of COS cells transfected with the construct encoding the two LamG domains with the Tn-C-tag (B). Lanes 1 and 2 were incubated with polyclonal antisera from two different rabbits, lane 3 with the monoclonal antibody pool raised against the bacterially expressed fragment, and lane 4 with pre-immune serum. All antibodies detected a band of about 80 kDa, which corresponds to the size of the recombinant protein. Additional smaller bands (asterisk) most likely correspond to degradation products which are not recognized by the monoclonal antibodies. C–J, Immunofluorescence staining of transfected COS cells was performed with the anti-agrin monoclonal antibody pool (C–F) and compared to the anti-Tn60 control (G–J). In transfected cells (C and D; G and H) the secreted agrin fragment was detected on cell surfaces of non-permeabilized cells (C and G) or in the endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi apparatus of permeabilized cells (D and H). Non-transfected cells were used as a negative control (E and F; I and J).
