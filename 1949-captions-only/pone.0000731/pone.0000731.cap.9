Binding of the respective agrins was detected by anti-chick agrin antibody (lanes 1 and 2) or with the Tn60 antibody recognizing the short tenascin C fragment which was fused to the <em>C. elegans</em> agrin fragment (lanes 3, 4 and 5). Binding of <em>C. elegans</em> agrin to α-DG was detected in lane 3, but not in the negative controls (lanes 4 and 5).</p>
