                Figure 9.   In vitro interaction between C. elegans agrin and vertebrate α-dystroglycan.Purified chicken α-DG (lanes 1–3 and 5) or crude COS cell extract (lane 4) was transferred to the membrane after separation by SDS-PAGE and membrane strips were incubated with different samples of agrin: lane 1, chicken muscle agrin isoform; lane 2, chicken neuronal isoform; lanes 3 and 4, C. elegans agrin in conditioned medium of transfected COS cells; lane 5, conditioned medium of non-transfected COS cells. Binding of the respective agrins was detected by anti-chick agrin antibody (lanes 1 and 2) or with the Tn60 antibody recognizing the short tenascin C fragment which was fused to the C. elegans agrin fragment (lanes 3, 4 and 5). Binding of C. elegans agrin to α-DG was detected in lane 3, but not in the negative controls (lanes 4 and 5).
