                Figure 2.  The 40 bp internal repeat is dispensable for lytic replication in the lung.C57BL/6 mice were i.n. infected with 5Ã—104 PFU. At the indicated time points after infection, lungs were harvested and the virus titers of lung homogenates were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Each symbol represents a single mouse. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection which is 50 PFU [31].
