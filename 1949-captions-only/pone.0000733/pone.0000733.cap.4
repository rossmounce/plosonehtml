Real time PCR was performed with 100 ng of total splenocyte DNA as described in <a href="#s2">materials and methods</a>. Data shown are mean values from 3 to 4 individual mice, each tested in duplicate, compiled from two independent experiments. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0.024; Student's t-test).</p>
