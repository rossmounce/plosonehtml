                Figure 4.  Viral genomic load in the spleen.Total DNA was extracted from spleens at days 17 and 42 after infection. Real time PCR was performed with 100 ng of total splenocyte DNA as described in materials and methods. Data shown are mean values from 3 to 4 individual mice, each tested in duplicate, compiled from two independent experiments. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0.024; Student's t-test).
