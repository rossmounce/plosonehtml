At day 17 after infection, spleens were harvested and the spleen weight was determined. Shown are means±SD of the number of mice indicated in brackets. The asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0001 for parental virus vs. Delta 40 bp mutant and p = 0.011 for parental virus vs. 40 bp low mutant; Student's t-test).</p>
