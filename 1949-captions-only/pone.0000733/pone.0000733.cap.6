Data shown are means±SD. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01; Student's t-test). B) <em>Ex vivo</em> reactivation. C57BL/6 mice or CD8<sup>−/−</sup> mice were i.n. infected with 5×10<sup>4</sup> PFU. The extent of <em>ex vivo</em> reactivation was determined 17 days after infection.
