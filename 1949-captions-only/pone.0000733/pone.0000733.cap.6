C57BL/6 or CD8<sup>−/−</sup> mice (5 mice per group) were i.n. infected with 5×10<sup>4</sup> PFU. At day 17 after infection, spleens were harvested and the number of spleen cells was determined. Data shown are means±SD. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01; Student's t-test). B) <em>Ex vivo</em> reactivation. C57BL/6 mice or CD8<sup>−/−</sup> mice were i.n. infected with 5×10<sup>4</sup> PFU. The extent of <em>ex vivo</em> reactivation was determined 17 days after infection. Splenocytes pooled from 5 mice per group were used.</p>
