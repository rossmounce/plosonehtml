                Figure 6.  The absence of CD8+ T cells partially reverses the phenotype of the Delta 40 bp mutant.A) Splenomegaly. C57BL/6 or CD8−/− mice (5 mice per group) were i.n. infected with 5×104 PFU. At day 17 after infection, spleens were harvested and the number of spleen cells was determined. Data shown are means±SD. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01; Student's t-test). B) Ex vivo reactivation. C57BL/6 mice or CD8−/− mice were i.n. infected with 5×104 PFU. The extent of ex vivo reactivation was determined 17 days after infection. Splenocytes pooled from 5 mice per group were used.
