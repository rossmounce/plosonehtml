                Figure 2.  Three-Dimensional Model of the Î²1 Domain of Cichlid MHC Class II.The tertiary structure prediction was based on Psemmil_m58_c exon 2 sequence (Accession number: EF540049) of 41% homology with mouse MHC sequence gi|13399459 in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do) using the 3D-jigsaw server v.2.0 (http://www.bmm.icnet.uk/~3djigsaw/). The graphical representation was created using the program Pymol v.0.99. Amino acid residues under significant positive selection in Pseudotropheus fainzilberi and P. emmiltos and corresponding to peptide binding sites in humans are highlighted in orange. Residues shown in red were under significant positive selection in P. fainzilberi and P. emmiltos but do not correspond with peptide binding sites in humans. Residues in yellow are human peptide binding sites that were not found to evolve under positive selection in cichlids. The 84 amplified exon 2 codons are numbered 1-84 on the graph. Those correspond to codons 6-89 of the mature protein.
