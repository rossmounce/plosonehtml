The graphical representation was created using the program Pymol v.0.99. Amino acid residues under significant positive selection in <em>Pseudotropheus fainzilberi</em> and <em>P. emmiltos</em> and corresponding to peptide binding sites in humans are highlighted in orange. Residues shown in red were under significant positive selection in <em>P. fainzilberi</em> and <em>P. emmiltos</em> but do not correspond with peptide binding sites in humans. Residues in yellow are human peptide binding sites that were not found to evolve under positive selection in cichlids. The 84 amplified exon 2 codons are numbered 1-84 on the graph. Those correspond to codons 6-89 of the mature protein.</p>
