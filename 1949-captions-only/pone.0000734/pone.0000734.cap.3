                Figure 3.  Comparison of Secondary Structure of Mouse and Cichlid MHC Class II Exon 2.Structure predictions were obtained from the PSIPRED server (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/psifo​rm.html) for a) mouse sequence gi:13399459 and b) cichlid sequence Psemmil_m58_c (Accession number: EF540049). Mammalian and fish secondary structures are similar except for an additional short alpha-helix at position 46–49 predicted for the mouse sequence, and an additional short strand at position 74 predicted for the cichlid sequence.
