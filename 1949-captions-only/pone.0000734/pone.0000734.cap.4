                Figure 4.  Comparison of Genetic Divergence Between Heterospecific Sympatric Populations and Conspecific Allopatric Populations.Fst values (HudSon et al. 1992) from pairwise comparisons of conspecific allopatric populations (Mpanga Rocks (Mpg), Luwino Reef (Lwo), and Chirwa Island (Chw)) and between heterospecific sympatric populations of P. fainzilberi (fainz.), and P. emmiltos (emm.). Neutral Fst estimates were obtained from intron 1 p-distances, modified Nei and Gojobori synonymous distances at exon 2, and from amino acid EX distance at exon 2 sites outside the putative ABS region (dN/dSâ‰¤1) and functional Fst were obtained from EX distance at putative exon 2 ABS (dN/dS&gt;1). Negative Fst estimates were forced to zero. Evidence of significant genetic divergence between pairs of allopatric populations was found only for neutral Fst estimates between P. emmiltos populations from Luwino Reef and Mpanga Rocks. Evidence of significant genetic divergence between pairs of P. fainzilberi and P. emmiltos sympatric populations was found only at putative ABS at Mpanga Rocks. *Significantly different from zero (p&lt;0.05; 200 permutations)
