Neutral Fst estimates were obtained from intron 1 p-distances, modified Nei and Gojobori synonymous distances at exon 2, and from amino acid EX distance at exon 2 sites outside the putative ABS region (dN/dSâ‰¤1) and functional Fst were obtained from EX distance at putative exon 2 ABS (dN/dS&gt;1). Negative Fst estimates were forced to zero. Evidence of significant genetic divergence between pairs of allopatric populations was found only for neutral Fst estimates between <em>P. emmiltos</em> populations from Luwino Reef and Mpanga Rocks. Evidence of significant genetic divergence between pairs of <em>P. fainzilberi</em> and <em>P. emmiltos</em> sympatric populations was found only at putative ABS at Mpanga Rocks. <sup>*</sup>Significantly different from zero (p&lt;0.05; 200 permutations)</p>
