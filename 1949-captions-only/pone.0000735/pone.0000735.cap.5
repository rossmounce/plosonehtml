                Figure 5.  CD27 expression on tuberculin-reactive CD4 T-cells reverts very slowly .A: CD27-expression on tuberculin-reactive CD4 T-cells was plotted against the length of the interval between the collection date of the analyzed blood sample and the collection date of the last positive sputum sample (all data from blinded study). Negative values indicate that sputum was already smear and culture negative when tuberculin-reactive CD4 T-cells were analyzed, positive values indicate that sputum samples were still positive and remained so for the indicated time. B: serial measurements in 7 individuals (data analysis blinded).
