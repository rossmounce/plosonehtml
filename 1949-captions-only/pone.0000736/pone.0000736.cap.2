                Figure 2.  STAT1−/− mice have increased bacterial burden in lung and spleen.Mice were infected with B.anthracis (108) and A. Lungs were harvested at 24 hrs and the fraction of germinated spores determined by the formula (CFU B.anthracis in lung-CFU B.anthracis lung after heat treatment{dormant spores})/CFU B.anthracis lung. B. Quantitative culture from spleen harvested at 24 hrs. Serial dilutions were made of whole splenic homogenate. * p&lt;0.05 compared to WT. N = 5/group
