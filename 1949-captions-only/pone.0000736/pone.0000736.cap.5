A. Lungs were harvested at 24 hrs and the fraction of germinated spores determined by the formula (CFU <em>B.anthracis</em> in lung-CFU <em>B.anthracis</em> lung after heat treatment{dormant spores})/CFU <em>B.anthracis</em> lung. B. Quantitative culture from spleen harvested at 24 hrs. Serial dilutions were made of whole splenic homogenate. * p&lt;0.05 compared to WT. N = 5/group.</p>
