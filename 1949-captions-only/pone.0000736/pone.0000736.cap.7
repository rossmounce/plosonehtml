                Figure 7.  Effect of IFN and B.athracis on MKK3 and STAT1 signaling.Mice were administered B.anthracis 108 spores/mouse+IFN-γ (1 µg/ml), IFN-α (104U/ml) or vehicle and BALF cells harvested at 24 hrs. For immunoblot. A. Immunoblot for MKK3. B. Immunoblot for phosphor-Tyr701 and Total STAT1. Data represent pooled BAL from 5 mice. All lanes were normalized for protein (50 µg/lane)
