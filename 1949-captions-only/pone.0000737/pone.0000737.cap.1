                Figure 1.  Effects of parallelization of the R code on the user wall time for several methods.Values shown are the mean of four replicates, obtained in an otherwise idle cluster with 30 nodes, each with two dual-core AMD Opteron 2.2 GHz CPUs and 6 GB RAM, running Debian GNU/Linux and a stock 2.6.8 kernel, with version 7.1.2 of LAM/MPI and version 2.1.4 (patched) of R. Numbers next to the lines (60, 30, 10) indicate the total number of Rslaves in the cluster (2 slaves per node, and a maximum of 30 nodes used).
