                Figure 2.  User wall time of the web-based application as a function of simultaneous users.To increase the realism of simultaneous accesses, there is delay of 5 seconds between simultaneous accesses, as might be expected, for example, from a classroom demonstration (i.e., when simulating 20 simultaneous users, the cluster is actually receiving new connections over a 20 * 5 second period, with one new connection every 5 seconds). Values shown are the mean of several runs: 5 for 1 user, 5 for 5 users, 10 for 10 users, and 20 for 20 users. Hardware and software the same as in Figure 1.
