                Figure 3.  Comparing parallelization schemes.User wall time of the R code using parallelization over arrays by chromosomes or over array (all methods shown, except ACE) or chromosome (ACE). “Slaves: 2” or “Slaves: 4” indicates the number of slaves per node. The two timings shown were obtained from an otherwise idle cluster, with hardware and software as in previous figures.
