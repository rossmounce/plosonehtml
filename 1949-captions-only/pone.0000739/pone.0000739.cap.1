                Figure 1.  Stimuli and Trial sequence.A. Stimuli. The stimuli used in experiments 1, 2&amp;3. Stimulus motion was varied so that speeds were equal yet opposite in both eyes to produce symmetry across the eyes. Grating orientation was also opposite in both eyes. In exp. 1, the dial position was fixed at the top of the stimulus, whereas in exp. 2, the mark was placed at different positions around the entire upper half of the stimulus. B. Trial sequence. Subjects initiated the trials by depressing the space bar and ended them by releasing the space bar. First, the lower contrast half-image (carrier grating) was shown for 500 ms. Then, the higher contrast half-image (mask grating) was projected into the other eye, causing immediate perceptual dominance of the high-contrast mask annulus due to its higher contrast and the sudden onset of presentation. After another 500 ms, a 300 ms trigger in the lower contrast carrier grating annulus was used to initiate a wave-like transition at the 6 o'clock position that propagated upward in both directions across the annular stimulus. This strict timing sequence allowed precise control over the order of subjects' perceptual state during a trial.
