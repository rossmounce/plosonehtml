Experiment 1: Rates of arrival directions at different stimulus speeds depend on stimulus motion direction. Scatter plot depicts the probability that the traveling wave reached the top of the annulus from the CCW direction. Each symbol type stands for data from one of five subjects. The ordinate represent CCW probability, sampled at a certain underlying stimulus speed (abcissa), positive speeds represent carrier grating motion in the CCW direction. The green dashed line is the best-fitting cumulative Gaussian distribution. The correlation between stimulus motion and CCW traveling wave probability is highly significant (Spearman's ρ 0.77, p&lt;&lt;0.001). B. Differences in arrival times between CW and CCW traveling waves. Arrival times from trials of experiment 1 were binned across stimulus speeds. Stimulus motion had a significant effect on the speeds at which CW and CCW traveling waves moved (p&lt;0.01). These data indicate that the traveling waves' tendency to arrive from a certain direction was due to a change in traveling wave speed, confirming the arrival ratio data. Data represent the mean of the difference in CW and CCW arrival time across five subjects, error bars are ±1 SEM.</p>
