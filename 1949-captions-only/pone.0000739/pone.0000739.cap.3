Stimulus speeds in angular degrees per second are denoted along the ordinate, dial position along the abcissa. Gray lines are 9% iso-probability lines, the 3D profile is shown in the top-right inset. The black dashed line represents the line of equal μ of the best-fitting cumulative Gaussian in three dimensions. At stimulus speeds greater than approximately 75°/s in either direction the responses are dominated by the stimulus motion. In these cases, almost no reports of the traveling wave arriving in the direction opposite to the carrier grating motion occurred, even for the most extreme dial position. This means that the traveling wave moved more than three times faster in the direction of the carrier grating motion than it did in the opposite direction. Data points are the mean of 4 subjects. Inset 3D plot of the same data. The red line depicts data from the range used in experiment 1. These data mirror the data shown in <a href="#pone-0000739-g002">figure 2A</a>, showing that in the range of stimulus motion used in experiment 1 the results of experiment 2 show identical trends.</p>
