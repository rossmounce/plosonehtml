(3) which incorporates spatially extended interocular inhibition and collinear facilitation, properties of the functional connectivity within striate cortex. A The model consists of two layers of cells, each of these layers receives input from one eye. Each cell interacts with neighboring cells in its own layer (collinear facilitation, +) and negatively interacts with retinotopically nearby cells in the opposing layer via inhibitory interneurons (−). B Illustration of the shape of excitatory (gray solid lines) and inhibitory (dashed lines) influences exerted by the layer that represents the Carrier -(<em>C</em>)- neurons. Stimulus motion causes an asymmetry in the inhibitory profile impinging on the Mask -(<em>M</em>)- neurons (green dashed curve), where a standstill stimulus causes a symmetric inhibition profile (red dashed curve). This direction-selective inhibition acts on the <em>M</em>-neurons, specifically those neurons that code for the opposite direction of motion. Thus, the increase of inhibition impinging on the <em>M</em>-neurons due to the rising activity of <em>C</em>-neurons is biased in the direction of the motion of the carrier grating. C The course of binocular rivalry traveling waves under the influence of stimulus motion, as predicted by the model. With greater stimulus speeds, the asymmetry of motion in the different directions increases and the traveling wave duration decreases. The top and bottom of the figures represent the bottom of the annular stimulus, and the sample positions used in experiment 2 are shown at the ordinate. Clearly, the point of arrival under conditions of the higher stimulus speeds lies farther than the 90° mark, meaning that the model accurately reproduces the psychophysical data. The bottom figure that represents a traveling wave under the influence of a high level of stimulus motion has a ratio between clockwise and counter-clockwise inhibition width of 4:1.</p>
