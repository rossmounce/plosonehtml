                Figure 5.  Experiment 3 and occlusion situation.A. Effect of stimulus grating collinearity on the influence of stimulus motion on the traveling wave. In our model a change in spiral angle, i.e. the collinearity of the pattern, is represented by a change in excitatory influence on neighboring neurons in the same layer, whereas this change in spiral orientation causes the effects of stimulus motion to diminish. Simulations showed that these different elements jointly act in such a way that the influence of stimulus motion is hampered. We tested this prediction directly by changing the spiral angle of both carrier and mask gratings while keeping the angular velocity of rotational motion equal at 23°/s. Data from three subjects clearly confirms the prediction of a negative effect of stimulus grating collinearity on the influence of stimulus motion. The black solid line represents the mean across subjects (colored lines), error bars are ±1 SEM. B. Diagram of the functional relevance of the implementation of asymmetric inhibition. The figures represent a top view of a binocular occlusion situation at two times, t&lt;t. A moving object may be occluded in one eye (R, t) and visible in the other (L, t). Direction-selective inhibition of the right-eye neurons in the path of the motion that is visible in the left eye allows direction-selective right-eye neurons to respond earlier to the appearance of the target moving leftward at t.
