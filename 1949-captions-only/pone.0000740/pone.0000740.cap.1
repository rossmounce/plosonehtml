The WS genotype produces a wrinkled colony morphology on KB agar plates in contrast to the smooth colonies of the wild-type <em>P. fluorescens</em> SBW25 strain (middle). After a long period of incubation, SM-like revertants appear at the edge of the WS colony (right). On KB plates containing Congo Red, the central WS-like portion of the colony binds the dye and has a strongly-coloured red rim whilst the SM-like outer ring is pale and does not bind significant amounts of dye.</p>
