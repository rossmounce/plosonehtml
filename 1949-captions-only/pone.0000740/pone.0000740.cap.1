                Figure 1.  The Wrinkly Spreader (WS) produces biofilms at the air-liquid interface and wrinkled colonies on agar plates.The ecological success of the WS in static 6ml liquid King's B (KB) microcosms is the ability to produce a substantial (3.8 cm2, 1â€“1.5 mm depth) biofilm at the air-liquid interface (left). The WS genotype produces a wrinkled colony morphology on KB agar plates in contrast to the smooth colonies of the wild-type P. fluorescens SBW25 strain (middle). After a long period of incubation, SM-like revertants appear at the edge of the WS colony (right). On KB plates containing Congo Red, the central WS-like portion of the colony binds the dye and has a strongly-coloured red rim whilst the SM-like outer ring is pale and does not bind significant amounts of dye.
