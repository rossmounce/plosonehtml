                Figure 2.  The degree of WS reversion on KB agar plates was higher when incubated at 28°C than at 10°C.The percentage of cells still showing the WS phenotype (WS Stability) recovered from colonies incubated for varying periods (left) and the total cell numbers (right) are indicated. Note that WS stability (the retention of the WS genotype) is the inverse of WS reversion to SM-LR (the loss of the WS genotype). Colonies were incubated on KB plates at 28°C for 3-days before sampling. Mean±SE indicated.
