                Figure 4.  The agar plate can be used as mega-colony or multiple-colony agar microcosms (MEGAM/MUCAM) in which bacterial adaptation and colony interactions can be observed.In the MEGAM microcosm, a single mixed colony is incubated in the centre of the plate. The colony is harvested and an appropriate dilution is used to inoculate a second plate, again as a single colony. In the MUCAM microcosm, the inoculation is spread across the surface of the plate to allow the development of multiple colonies with differing degrees of separation and overlap. The colonies are pooled together on harvest to produce the inoculation for the subsequent plate, which again is spread across the surface of the entire plate.
