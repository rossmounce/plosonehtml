The percentage of cells still showing the WS phenotype (WS Stability) after each 5-day period is indicated. Populations were transferred at three densities, high (H) (1,000–2,000 <em>cfu</em> per plate), medium (M) (100–200 <em>cfu</em> per plate), and low (L) (10–20 <em>cfu</em> per plate). Colonies were incubated on KB plates at 28°C before transfer to new plates. Mean±SE indicated.</p>
