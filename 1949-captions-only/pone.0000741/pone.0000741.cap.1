                Figure 1.  Ratio of the observed to the expected number of sequences across mismatch loads.X-axis: Mismatch load. A: DUESs. B: Control sequences. HDUESH and HDUESS refer to H. influenzae DUES in H. influenzae and S. pyogenes genomes, respectively. NDUESN and NDUESC refer to N. gonorrhoeae DUES in N. gonorrhoeae and C. tepidum genomes. CSH1, 2, and 3 and CSN1, 2, and 3 refer to the three control sequences in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae (see Material and methods).
