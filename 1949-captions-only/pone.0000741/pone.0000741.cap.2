                Figure 2.  Computer simulation of the accumulation of H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae DUESs.X-axis: Cycle (i.e., generation). Y-axis: Ratio of the number of sequences after each simulation cycle to the observed (i.e., real) number. A and D: Genomes of H. influenzae (A) and N. gonorrhoeae (D) evolving with 104.4 and 477.5 uptake bias towards their respective DUES. B and E: The same genomes evolving with an additional 1.02 and 5.284 uptake bias towards the singly-mismatched DUESs. C and F: The same genomes evolving with the uptake bias combinations (156.4; 2.016; 0.352; 0.295; 0.340; 0.395; 0.449; 0.505; 0.563; 0.623) and (499.2; 5.567; 0.857; 0.493; 0.306; 0.175; 0.056; 0; 0; 0.051; 0.184) towards sequences with 0 to 9 and 0 to 10 mismatches to the respective DUESâ€”semicolons separate uptake biases for different mismatch loads.
