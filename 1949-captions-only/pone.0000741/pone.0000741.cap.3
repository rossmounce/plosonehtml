                Figure 3.  DNA sequence logos showing the accumulation of H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae DUES nucleotides.The heights of the characters reflect the conservation of the nucleotides ([equation 3 in 66]) as well as the genomic representation of sequences at the mismatch load (equation 2). The number to the side of each logo is the mismatch load analyzed. The height of the logo should be multiplied by the number at the top, if applicable.
