                Figure 4.  Relative uptake efficiency of H. influenzae DUES and some of its mismatched forms.X-axis: Sequence tested. Best DUES: H. influenzae best DUES consensus. Worst Sequence: The 29 bp sequence of the least frequent nucleotides. PxN: Best DUES mutated at position x (Px) towards the least frequent nucleotide (N). Y-axis: Percentage of DNA taken up. SD: Standard deviation of the mean, SE: Standard error. Note that the critical part of the DUES largely coincides with the evolutionarily conserved positions of the two pasteurellacean DUESs currently known.
