Likewise, construction of a phylogenetic map is done by performing a multiple sequence alignment using the 16S rRNA sequence from each prokaryote. Each metric is then converted into a Pfam profile and 16S distance matrix, respectively (b). The Pfam profile matrix is further converted into a similarity matrix by applying Spearman's rank correlation (c). Each Prokaryote is then assigned an (x, y) coordinate by applying a combination of multi-dimensional scaling and force-directed placement to both similarity and distance matrices as shown in (d). Finally, a topographical map is generated using the computer program <em>VxInsight</em>.</p>
