This analysis was performed for prokaryotes on the niche map (circles) and the phylogenetic map (squares) as shown. In all cases, sequencing bias was taken into account by disregarding all pairs of prokaryotic species that had a Jaccard coefficient greater than 0.90 based on Pfam profile analysis (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). A control (average of 10 trials) was also performed by randomizing the nearest neighbors for each prokaryotic species (hashes). Error bars for all three analyses are too small to be displayed.</p>
