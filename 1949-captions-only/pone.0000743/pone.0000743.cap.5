                Figure 5.  Clustering of prokaryotic species on the niche map.Three groups of prokaryotic species are shown, including the marine Gammaproteobacteria in NM11 that cluster according to phylogeny (a); the obligate symbionts and pathogens in NM10 and NM16 that cluster according to function (b); and the prokaryotes existing at the soil, plant, and human interface in NM14 that cluster according to environment. A high resolution view of each mountain is shown, in addition to the complete niche map labeled with the corresponding mountain (blue circles). The genus of every prokaryote in each mountain is also shown.
