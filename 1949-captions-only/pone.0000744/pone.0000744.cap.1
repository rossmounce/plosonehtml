                Figure 1.  Simulations of results incorporating extra-pair paternities.Simulations either not assigned a random 15% of offspring (left panels, A–C) or directionally assigned them to a local male with a broader forehead patch (right panels, D–F). The frequency distributions of additive genetic variances in female LRS (A, D) and male LRS (B, E), and the intersexual genetic correlation in LRS (C, F) are based on 500 simulations. Correlations were left unconstrained and could therefore be lower than −1. The values based on the social pedigree (Table 2) are indicated with an arrow.
