This procedure was performed independently for (A) randomly generated, (B) nonfunctional, (C) regulatory, and (D) coding sequences. In each panel, the blue lines represent ± 2 Standard Deviations (SD) from the mean value in the population of shuffled sequences and the red line represents the observed count in the unshuffled <em>E. coli</em> sequence.</p>
