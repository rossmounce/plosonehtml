                Figure 1.  Comparison of observed and expected −10 motif frequencies in different genomic regions of E. coli.Distributions were obtained by counting and summing the occurrences of 185 −10 hexamers in sets of 1000 shuffled sequences. This procedure was performed independently for (A) randomly generated, (B) nonfunctional, (C) regulatory, and (D) coding sequences. In each panel, the blue lines represent ± 2 Standard Deviations (SD) from the mean value in the population of shuffled sequences and the red line represents the observed count in the unshuffled E. coli sequence.
