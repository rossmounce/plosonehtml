                Figure 2.  Phylogeny of the 42 bacterial species analyzed.Phylogeny based on a set of 51 genes present in single copy in most bacterial genomes. Concatenated multiple sequence alignments were used as input for the bayesian tree reconstruction program MrBayes [50]. The tree topology and branch lengths shown correspond to the most likely tree obtained in two independent runs of MrBayes spanning 250,000 generations each. All clades were recovered with 100% posterior probability. The tree is rooted on the branch leading to the hyperthermophiles Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga maritima.
