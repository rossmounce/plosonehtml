Concatenated multiple sequence alignments were used as input for the bayesian tree reconstruction program MrBayes <a href="#pone.0000745-Huelsenbeck1">[50]</a>. The tree topology and branch lengths shown correspond to the most likely tree obtained in two independent runs of MrBayes spanning 250,000 generations each. All clades were recovered with 100% posterior probability. The tree is rooted on the branch leading to the hyperthermophiles <em>Aquifex aeolicus</em> and <em>Thermotoga maritima</em>.</p>
