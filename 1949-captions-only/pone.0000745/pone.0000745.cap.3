                Figure 3.  Patterns of over- and under-representation of −10 motifs across species.For every species, observed and expected −10 motif frequencies in the three different genomic regions were compared as in Figure 1. Over- and under-representation were considered significant when the observed frequency was beyond ±2 SD from the mean value for shuffled sequences.
