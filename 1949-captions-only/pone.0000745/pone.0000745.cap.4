                Figure 4.  Deviations in the observed counts of −10 motifs in different genomic regions.NSD values measure the deviation in the observed counts of −10 motifs in numbers of standard deviations from the expected mean in the corresponding genome, and were obtained by comparing observed counts to distributions of motif frequencies in shuffled sequences. Species are ordered according to ascending NSD values for the nonfunctional regions. NSD values in the white band are not significantly different from expectation. The red line separates species with under-representation of −10 sites in nonfunctional regions (left) from those without (right).
