                Figure 5.  NSD of −10 motif counts in nonfunctional DNA correlate negatively with the number of tRNA genes in the genome.NSD values are defined as in the text and Figure 4. The red line represents −2 SD from the mean expected value of −10 motif counts in the nonfunctional DNA of the corresponding genome. The green line indicates the average number of tRNA genes in the genomes analyzed (55). The color-coding distinguishes species according to their maximal growth rate (see Table 1); no growth rate estimate was available for Corynebacterium glutamicum (not colored). Black dotted line: regression including all analyzed genomes (r = 0.38 and p&lt;0.02). Black solid line: regression for the subset of genomes with NSD&lt;−2 in nonfunctional DNA (r = 0.63 and p&lt;0.001).
