The red line represents −2 SD from the mean expected value of −10 motif counts in the nonfunctional DNA of the corresponding genome. The green line indicates the average number of tRNA genes in the genomes analyzed (55). The color-coding distinguishes species according to their maximal growth rate (see <a href="#pone-0000745-t001">Table 1</a>); no growth rate estimate was available for <em>Corynebacterium glutamicum</em> (not colored). Black dotted line: regression including all analyzed genomes (r = 0.38 and p&lt;0.02). Black solid line: regression for the subset of genomes with NSD&lt;−2 in nonfunctional DNA (r = 0.63 and p&lt;0.001).</p>
