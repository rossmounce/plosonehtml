Nucleotides are numbered relative to the translational start site. The 9-bp core sequences of the target sites TFLO11/F1, TFLO11/F2, TFLO11/R1 and TFLO11/R2 are shown with arrows indicating the direction of the sequence from 5′ to 3′. Sequences of Ste12 (<span class="underline">PRE</span>) , and Tec1 (<span class="underline">TCS</span>) binding sites are shown above. (B) DNA oligos used in the phage selection, including 2-bp flanking sequences on each side. The shaded areas represent the core bound sequences. Individual fingers bind triplet nucleotides, indicated by F1, F2, and F3, respectively. For direct selection of TFLO11/F1 from Lib12, the oligo CTGCGGTATCTTC is shown shaded light grey. Targets of TFLO11/F2, TFLO11/R1, and TFLO11/R2 were subjected to bipartite selection: targets were divided into two “half sites” that comprise a gcgg anchor (in lower case) and a 5-bp target (shaded grey or black). The targets were selected from two complementary libraries, Lib12 and Lib23, and recombined to bind a full 9 bp sequence, made from the two grey and black half-targets. The sequences flanking the core target sequences are underlined. (C) The apparent <em>K</em><sub>d</sub>s of the individual clones bound to the respective 12TFLO11/F2 and 23TFLO11/F2 “half sites”, as well as the individual clones of TFLO11/F1 or TFLO11/F2 “full sites”. (D) Corresponding amino acid residues of 3ZfFLO11/F1 and 3ZfFLO11/F2 and their proposed mode of contact with DNA targets. The amino acids are shown with circles numbered relative to their helical positions. Due to a cross-strand interaction of amino acid 2 of finger 1, each of the 3F domains potentially binds to an extra base, making a 10-bp DNA site. The linker peptide between the two 3F domains is Thr-Gly-Gly-GlyGly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Glu-A​rg-Pro.The amino acid residues with proposed contacts to DNA bases are shown with arrows. The shaded dotted arrows indicate that the contact is either stereochemically unfavorable (in black), favorable (in white), or neutral (in gray) according to “recognition-code” rules <a href="#pone.0000746-Luscombe1">[43]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000746-Seeman1">[44]</a>.</p>
