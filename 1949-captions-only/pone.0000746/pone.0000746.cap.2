The binding of Zif268 with its cognate site (left) was used as a reference to determine the relative binding affinity of rTFs and TFLO11/F2-F1. To estimate Kd values, it was assumed that protein expression in each TNT reaction, and each subsequent dilution, was the same. Triangles indicate the concentration of rTFs where half the amount of target DNA bound with rTFs.</p>
