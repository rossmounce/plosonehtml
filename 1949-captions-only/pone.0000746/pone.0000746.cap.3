                Figure 3.  Zinc finger rTFs activate the expression of the FLO11 gene in budding yeast.(A) DNAs capable of encoding rTFs were constructed into pCM185, a tetracycline-repressible yeast vector. Cells expressing rTFs, as indicated, were grown either in the presence or absence of 1 Âµg/ml tetracycline for 12 hrs, after which the cells were collected for Western blotting to detect the expression of rTFs. (B) The same cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline (inducing conditions) and collected at the times indicated, for Northern blotting to detect FLO11. The empty plasmid pCM185, designated as pCont., was used as a negative control. Cells with pCM185 growing in the absence of tetracycline and 0.05% glucose, indicated as LGlu, instead of 2% glucose were used to examine the expression of FLO11 under derepressed conditions (C) The northern blots were quantitated using ImageQuant v1.2 and the ratios of induced FLO11, relative to ACT1 control RNA, are plotted as a histogram.
