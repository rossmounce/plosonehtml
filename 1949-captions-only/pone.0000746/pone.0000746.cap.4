Cells capable of expressing rTFs, as indicated, were grown in the presence of 1 µg/ml tetracycline, after which the cells were spotted onto semi-solid YEPD agar plates, using 10 µl of cells at an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.01. Plates were grown in induced (−Tet) or a non-induced (+Tet) conditions for two days at 30°C to form colonies. Colonies were then rinsed off the surface of the agar with a gentle stream of sterile dH<sub>2</sub>O. Invasive growth was shown by cells that remained inside the agar and that were able to repopulate the plate. The empty plasmid pCM185 (pCont.) was used as a negative control. Cells with pCM185 were grown and spotted on to semi-solid YEP agar plates with either 2% glucose (Glu) or 0.05% glucose (LGlu) in the absence of tetracycline to examine invasiveness under derepressed conditions.</p>
