Cells expressing various rTFs are shown (in the absence of tetracycline; induced conditions). Cells carrying plasmid pCM185, grown with or without tetracycline, are designated as pCont.-0 and pCont., respectively. The fold-change in induction of adhesion was determined by dividing optical density at 570 nm of cells carrying rTFs with that of cells carrying pCM185 in the absence of tetracycline. Cells carrying pCM185, grown in YEP supplemented with 0.05% glucose, with or without tetracycline, subjected to adhesion assay are designated as LGlu pCont.-0 and LGlu pCont., respectively. Bars and error bars show means of three assays (each with three triplicates) and standard deviation. The Student t-test was use to determine the statistical significance between groups.</p>
