                Figure 5.  Adhesion assay to quantify the phenotypic effect of zinc finger rTFs targeting FLO11 5â€²UTR.Cells were assayed for the enhancement of biofilm formation by measuring the adhesion of budding yeast cells to polysterene plates; after washing to remove non-adhering cells, cells were stained with crystal violet, which was eluted and measured for OD at 570 nm. Cells expressing various rTFs are shown (in the absence of tetracycline; induced conditions). Cells carrying plasmid pCM185, grown with or without tetracycline, are designated as pCont.-0 and pCont., respectively. The fold-change in induction of adhesion was determined by dividing optical density at 570 nm of cells carrying rTFs with that of cells carrying pCM185 in the absence of tetracycline. Cells carrying pCM185, grown in YEP supplemented with 0.05% glucose, with or without tetracycline, subjected to adhesion assay are designated as LGlu pCont.-0 and LGlu pCont., respectively. Bars and error bars show means of three assays (each with three triplicates) and standard deviation. The Student t-test was use to determine the statistical significance between groups.
