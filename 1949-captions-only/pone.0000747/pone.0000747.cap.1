                Figure 1.  Effects of age/stage transmission on culling.a) Solid lines represent disease prevalence as function of the fraction of animals killed through culling scaled with respect to prevalence at equilibrium in the absence of culling; dotted lines refer to the number of infected individuals as functions of of the fraction of animals killed through culling scaled with respect to prevalence at equilibrium in the absence of culling; gray lines Δβ = 0 (βa = βj = 0.2856); black lines Δβ = βa−βj = 0.31 (βa = 0.32; βj = 0.01). In both cases R0 = 9.-b) Degree of depression of population abundance as a function of culling rate c under the same condition than above. Other parameter values have been set as follows: ν = 1.25 years−1, μj = 0.9 years−1, μa = 0.4 years−1, γ = 0.0067 (#individual−1 * 220 km2 * years−1), α = 25 years−1, ρ = 2 years−1, δ = 17.4 years−1.
