                Figure 2.  Value of the minimum culling rate Cmin required for disease prevalence to drop the value attained in absence of culling as a function of the basic reproduction number (R0) and the age-dependent heterogeneity in transmission (Δβ = βa−βj) renormalized by the maximum heterogeneities in transmission (Δβmax) allowed at each level of R0 (see Protocol S2).
