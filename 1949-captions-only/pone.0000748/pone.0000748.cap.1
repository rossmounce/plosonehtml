                Figure 1.  Chronological lifespan is related to the efficiency with which nutrient-depleted cells arrest in G1.A. Changes in DNA content during nutrient depletion of wild-type (DBY746) cells and cells harboring deletions of RIM15 and/or SCH9, which was previously shown to shorten (rim15Δ) or lengthen (sch9Δ) chronological lifespan [5]. Length of time cells were depleted of nutrients after establishing exponential cultures (“log”) is indicated to the left. B. Budding indices of cells in Panel A. C. Budding indices of wild-type cells and cells harboring the ras2Δ or RAS2val19 mutations. D. Changes in DNA content during nutrient depletion of wild-type cells and cells harboring the RAS2val19 mutation. E. Changes in DNA content of wild type and ras2Δ cells during nutrient depletion. F–H. Viability (F), budding index (G) and DNA content (H) of wild-type cells nutrient depleted in synthetic complete medium (“SC”) or rich medium (“YPD”). Data in this and subsequent figures are representative of the data from three or more independent experiments unless noted otherwise.
