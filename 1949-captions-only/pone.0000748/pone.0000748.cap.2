Viability (A and C), budding index (B and D) and DNA content (E and F) of DBY746 (A, B and E) and BY4741 (C, D and F) cells cultured in medium containing 2% compared to 0.5% glucose at beginning of experiment. Data in A–D are means and standard errors for three independent experiments. G. DAPI stained cells from log phase cultures cultured in medium containing 2% glucose (day 0) or after 3 days of depletion of medium containing 2% or 0.5% glucose. H. Southern blot analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA content in DBY746 cells cultured for three days in medium containing 2% or 0.5% glucose. I and J. Mean volume of BY4741 (I) and DBY746 (J) cells cultured in medium containing 2% or 0.5% glucose. K and L. Effects of increased osmotic stress during nutrient depletion (produced by adding 1M D-sorbitol to medium) on viability (K) and budding index (L) of BY4741 cells.</p>
