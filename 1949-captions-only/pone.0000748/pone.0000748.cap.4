                Figure 4.  Ectopic expression of RNR1 suppresses increased apoptotic DNA degradation and less efficient G1 arrest in mec1-21, but not rad53-21 cells during nutrient depletion.A. DNA content of wild-type (W303) and indicated checkpoint mutant strains transformed with an empty vector or a high copy plasmid expressing RNR1 (“pRNR1”) during nutrient depletion in SC medium. B–E. Budding index of these strains during nutrient depletion in SC medium. Error bars depict the standard error for measurements made in three or more independent experiments.
