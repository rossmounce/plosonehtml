                Figure 5.  Ectopic expression of CLN3 during nutrient depletion shortens lifespan and accelerates age-dependent genome instability and apoptosis.A–C. DNA content (A), budding index (B) and viability (C) during nutrient depletion of cells transformed with an empty vector or a plasmid expressing CLN3 using the CUP1 promoter (“pCLN3”). D. Mutation frequency during nutrient depletion measured by resistance to canavanine in cells transformed with an empty vector or with pCLN3. Error bars depict the standard error for measurements made in three independent experiments. An exception is canavanine resistance measurements in cells transformed with pCLN3 at day 5 (panel D), where it represents the range of values from two of three independent experiments (due to a technical problem at this timepoint in one experiment).
