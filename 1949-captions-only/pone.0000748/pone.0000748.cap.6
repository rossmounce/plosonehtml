                Figure 6.  Models for longevity regulation by growth signaling pathways in budding yeast (A) and deregulation of growth regulatory pathways leading to replication stress and aging in all eukaryotes (B).A. In budding yeast, nutrient signaling pathways that respond to glucose, nitrogen and phosphate converge upon Rim15, which is downregulated by signaling through these pathways when nutrients are plentiful. Activation of Rim15 when nutrient signaling is inhibited induces stress response factors (including Msn2 and Msn4) and stress responses mediated by Sod1, Sod2 and other proteins that mitigate oxidative damage and other effects of stresses. Reduced nutrient signaling also downregulates Cln3 and downstream Clns1 and 2, which are required for activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Inactivation of Cdc28 during nutrient depletion contributes to a G1 arrest that protects against replication stress. Osmotic stress (and perhaps other stresses) also contribute to G1 arrest during nutrient depletion. G1 arrest in response to nutrient depletion and other stresses may be mediated in part by induction of the transcriptional repressor Xbp1, which inhibits Cln transcription. Enhancement of G1 arrest by caloric restriction, osmotic stress or mutational inactivation of nutrient signaling pathways protects against replication stress and promotes longevity in combination with Rim15-dependent responses to oxidative-and other stresses. B. Replication stress associated with uncoordinated entry into or exit from S phase downstream of the activation of some, but not all, growth signaling pathways may be an important factor determining lifespan in all eukaryotes. In both panels, question marks indicate hypothetical or undefined effects.
