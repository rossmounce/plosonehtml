                Figure 1.  Preservation of O. tauri.(A) Projection image through a conventionally fixed, embedded, thin-sectioned cell. (B) Projection image through a high-pressure frozen, low-temperature embedded, thin-sectioned cell. (C) 28.8-nm thick slice through the 3-D electron cryotomographic reconstruction of an intact, frozen-hydrated cell. The letters identify nuclei (n), chloroplasts (c), mitochondria (m), Golgi bodies (g), the Endoplasmic Reticulum (er), and granules (gr). Scale bar = 200 nm.
