In column I, slices through the reconstructions are shown, with cisternae marked by arrowheads. In column II, 3-D segmentations of the Golgi bodies are shown <em>in situ</em> within their cellular contexts. Column III shows the isolated 3-D segmentations from a view perpendicular to the one in column II. The five “core” cisternae common to all Golgi bodies seen here are colored purple, red, gold, yellow, and green (<em>cis</em> to <em>trans</em>). Surrounding vesicles are colored either light or dark blue. Some vesicles in column III do not appear in column II because they are “below” the cellular slice shown. The blue-green vesicle in IIC was removed from IIIC to create an unobstructed view of the Golgi body. Scale bars 100 nm.</p>
