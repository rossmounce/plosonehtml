                Figure 11.  Golgi body.The Golgi bodies from three different cells are shown (rows A–C). In column I, slices through the reconstructions are shown, with cisternae marked by arrowheads. In column II, 3-D segmentations of the Golgi bodies are shown in situ within their cellular contexts. Column III shows the isolated 3-D segmentations from a view perpendicular to the one in column II. The five “core” cisternae common to all Golgi bodies seen here are colored purple, red, gold, yellow, and green (cis to trans). Surrounding vesicles are colored either light or dark blue. Some vesicles in column III do not appear in column II because they are “below” the cellular slice shown. The blue-green vesicle in IIC was removed from IIIC to create an unobstructed view of the Golgi body. Scale bars 100 nm.
