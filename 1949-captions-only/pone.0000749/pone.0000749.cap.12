                Figure 12.  Microtubule.(A) 9.6-nm slice through one particular microtubule (arrowheads) along most of its length, showing its uniform diameter and hollow nature. (B) 16.8-nm slice through a microtubule in its cellular context, showing its open, blunt ends (arrowheads) terminating between the NE (arrows) and plasma membrane. The insert shows a 2-fold enlarged, 38.4-nm thick slice through the microtubule perpendicular to its long axis, emphasizing its tubular shape (arrowheads). Scale bar 100 nm.
