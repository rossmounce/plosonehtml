There were fewer total positions ranked in cell “3D” because its cytoplasm was smaller. (B) 24-nm thick slice through a cell with the 500 (red) or 2000 (green) most ribosome-resembling objects in the cytoplasm circled, showing that these are reasonable under- and over-estimates of the total number. (C) 3-D positions of the 1250 most ribosome-resembling objects in the cytoplasm (light purple spheres), showing their close and even distribution. Scale bar 250 nm.</p>
