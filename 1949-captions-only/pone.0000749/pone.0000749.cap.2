Only the central portion of the cell in (F) is shown due to the limited ability to completely segment thicker cells. Here and below the letters and colors identify nuclei (n, red), nuclear envelope (ne), chloroplasts (c, green), mitochondria (m, dark purple), Golgi bodies (g, yellow), peroxisomes (p, orange), granules (gr, dark blue), inner membranes including ER (er, light blue), microtubules (light purple), and ribosome-like particles (r). Because the dividing cell shown in panels C and D was especially thick, only its middle region was segmentable. Scale bar 250 nm.</p>
