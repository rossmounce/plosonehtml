Here the chloroplast is separated from the plasma membrane by the mitochondrion and several granules. (B) 36-nm thick slice near the top of the reconstruction of the same cell. The NE (white arrows) stretches towards the Golgi body (black arrowheads) and microtubule (black arrows). (C) 24-nm slice through a different cell, showing an elongated mitochondrion near the center of the cell and duplicating chloroplast granules. Scale bar = 150 nm.</p>
