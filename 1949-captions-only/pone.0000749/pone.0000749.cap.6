                Figure 6.  Chloroplast.(A) 7.2-nm thick slice through a non-dividing cell. The starch granule (white arrow) has suffered damage from the electron beam. Besides it are two dark granules (white arrowhead). (B) Above: Enlarged view of the boxed area in panel A. The three thylakoid membranes (black arrowhead) can be seen forming a stack. Below: Schematic of above. Cell membrane (black), chloroplast membranes (green), outer thylakoid membrane (red), inner thylakoid membranes (blue). (C) 24-nm slice through an early predivisional cell, where the chloroplast is kidney-shaped rather than oval and the starch granule is elongated. (D) 36-nm thick slice through a late predivisional cell, where the chloroplast is deeply constricted and one dark and one starch granule is found in each side. Here the cytoplasmic granules (*) are arranged in a V-shape pointing to the division plane. Scale bar 250 nm.
