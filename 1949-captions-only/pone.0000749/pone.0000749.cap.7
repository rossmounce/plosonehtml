                Figure 7.  Nuclear envelope.(A) 41-nm thick slice through a cell harvested at the light-to-dark transition with a completely closed NE (black arrow). The cellâ€™s small size and non-dividing organelles suggest the cell could have recently divided. Two NPCs (black arrowheads) are present. Close ups of the NPCs are shown at Figure 8. (B) 31-nm thick slice through a cell harvested at the dark-to-light transition. The NE only covers about three-fourths of the nucleus in this section (black arrows mark the tips). Again two NPCs (black arrowheads) are present, and at the bottom of the nucleus the ER branches off the NE (white arrowheads). (C) 19.2-nm thick slice through a large, late predivisional cell harvested at the light-to-dark transition exhibiting an almost completely open nucleus with only small patches of NE (black arrows). Scale bar 100 nm.
