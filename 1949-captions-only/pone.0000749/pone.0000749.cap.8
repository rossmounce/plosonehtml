                Figure 8.  Nuclear pore complex.3.6-nm thick slices through the best-resolved NPC from the “side” (perpendicular to the NE, left) and “top” (in plane of NE, right). The approximate center, inner, and outer diameters are marked by the arrow, dashed, and solid lines, respectively. The region around the NPC in the right panel is low density (whiter) because it is inside the NE lumen; the dark crescent near the edge of the panel shows where the plane of the slice cuts through the NE. Scale bar = 100 nm.
