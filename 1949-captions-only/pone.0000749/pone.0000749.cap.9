                Figure 9.  Mitochondrion.(A) 3-D segmentation of the mitochondrion from the cell shown in Figure 1E–F. Here, the membranes are colored purple (outer membrane), red (inner membrane), and yellow (cristae). Dense granules within the mitochondrial matrix are shown in green. (B–D) 15-, 55-, and 29-nm thick slices though three different mitochondria, showing crista junctions (arrowheads) and a dense granule (white arrow). Panel B is a slice through the cell shown in panel A. Scale bar 50 nm (for panels B–D). (E) 4.8-nm thick slice through a junction or channel (black arrows) connecting the outer and inner membranes. Here c-cytoplasm, m-mitochondrion. Scale bar 50 nm.
