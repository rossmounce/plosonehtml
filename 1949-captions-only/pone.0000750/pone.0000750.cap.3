Shown is the impact of varying the cost per successfully referred woman from $18.50 to $370, on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for a strategy that includes (1) an increase in family planning from 59% to 74% in women age 20 and older, and from 18% to 33% in women younger than age 20, (2) access to safe abortion for <em>all</em> women who electively terminate a pregnancy; and (3) access to high-quality intrapartum care for all pregnant women and <em>enhanced access</em> to comprehensive emergency obstetric care for at least 90% of women (pink line), compared with a strategy only focusing on family planning and safe abortion. Also shown is the impact on the total lifetime savings for a cohort of 100,000 women that could be achieved using this strategy as compared to <em>current practice</em> in Mexico (blue line). Provided the incremental cost was below $120 per <em>successfully referred</em> woman, the most effective strategy would be associated with a lower average per-woman lifetime cost than that of current practice (green dashed line). Even at a cost of $185 per successfully referred woman (red solid line), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than the Mexico-specific GDP per capita, and would be considered very cost-effective.</p>
