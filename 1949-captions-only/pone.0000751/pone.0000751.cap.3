                Figure 3.  The proportion of the summer breeding population protected, through the conservation of habitat parcels in the wintering regions with an optimal strategy that ignores migratory connectivity and one that incorporates migratory connectivity.The Northwest population is reduced to less than 2%, well below the 30% threshold, when connectivity data are ignored as denoted by the arrow.
