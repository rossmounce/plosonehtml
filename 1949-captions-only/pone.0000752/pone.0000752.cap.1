                Figure 1.  An illustration of the basic model, defining the three dimensionless model parameters (T, z0 and p0).Two lineages compete for resources during the growth interval before catastrophe occurs at time T. The initial size of the focal lineage is x0, expressed as a proportion of the total carrying capacity. The initial size of the total population is z0 = x0+y0, where y0 is the initial size of the competitor lineage. The initial frequency of the focal lineage is p0 = x0/z0. Persister cells are represented by the shaded areas, and non-persister cells are unshaded. Upon the catastrophe occurring, all persister cells survive and all non-persister cells are destroyed.
