                Figure 2.  The evolution of persister function, assuming fixed time until catastrophe.Numerical solutions for the ESS persister allocation are given for a range of parameter values. The ESS allocation to persister function (π*) decreases as the growth time (T) before catastrophe increases, and the ESS increases with increasing resource competition (z0) and genetical relatedness (p0). Note that T→∞ does not imply infinite growth, but rather that the catastrophe occurs after resources are exhausted and growth has ceased. Also, some proportion of persisters is always favoured (i.e. π*&gt;0), but the quantity predicted may be vanishingly small and hence appear to be zero in the figure.
