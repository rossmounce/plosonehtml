The ESS allocation to persister function (π*) decreases as the growth time (<em>T</em>) before catastrophe increases, and the ESS increases with increasing resource competition (<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>) and genetical relatedness (<em>p</em><sub>0</sub>). Note that <em>T</em>→∞ does not imply infinite growth, but rather that the catastrophe occurs after resources are exhausted and growth has ceased. Also, some proportion of persisters is always favoured (i.e. π*&gt;0), but the quantity predicted may be vanishingly small and hence appear to be zero in the figure.</p>
