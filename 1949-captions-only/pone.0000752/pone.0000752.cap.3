                Figure 3.  The evolution of persister function, with random waiting time until catastrophe.Numerical results for the stochastic version of the model in which the probability of catastrophe occurring is at any time is constant through time, with average waiting time T̅. The ESS allocation to persister function (π*) decreases as the average growth time (T̅) before catastrophe increases, and the ESS increases with increasing resource competition (z0) and genetical relatedness (p0). Note that T̅→∞ does not imply infinite growth, but rather that the catastrophe (almost always) occurs after resources are exhausted and growth has ceased. Also, some proportion of persisters is always favoured (i.e. π*&gt;0), but the quantity predicted may be vanishingly small and hence appear to be zero in the figure.
