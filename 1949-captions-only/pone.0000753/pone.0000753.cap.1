<h4>Objectives and Outcomes</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>The primary objective of the follow up was to establish vaccine effectiveness against anti-HBc and HBsAg positivity. The primary objective of the nested RCT was to establish the short term (2 weeks) and medium term (1 year) anti-HBs response to a HBV boost in adolescence. Anti-HBs antibody levels two and 52 weeks after a booster dose enable an assessment of the duration of a response, as well as assessing the proportion of vaccines with and without an anamnestic response.</p>


<h4>Laboratory</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies were detected using a commercial EIA (ETI-AB-Corek Plus and ETI-AB-AUK respectively, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The level of detection of anti-HBs was 10 IU/l.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>Samples which were anti-HBc positive, were tested for HBsAg by Determine<sup>TM</sup> HBsAg (Abbott Laboratories), a visually read, qualitative immunochromatographic assay. All those who tested HBsAg positives were retested after 6 months to confirm carrier status. Samples which were HBsAg positive, were tested for HBeAg using an enzyme immunoassay [EIA] (Equipar Diagnostici, Saronno (Va), Italy).</p>


<h4>Definitions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>If one or two doses of HBV were recorded in the GHIS database the participant was considered partially vaccinated; if three or four doses were received this was defined as fully vaccinated.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>Infection was defined by the presence of anti-HBc with at least 30% inhibition, as stipulated by the manufacturer. If infection was found in a person vaccinated in infancy, this was considered a breakthrough infection. Chronic carriage was defined as testing HBsAg positive at both the initial and the 12 month follow-up survey.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>An early anamnestic response to the booster dose was defined as a four fold or greater rise in anti-HBs antibody within two weeks of the booster dose, or for children with no detectable antibody in the first sample, an anti-HBs antibody level ≥10 IU/l within two weeks of the booster dose, in line with recently published CDC methods <a href="#pone.0000753-Williams1">[11]</a>. A long-term anamnestic response was defined as at least a two fold rise in anti-HBs antibody one year after boosting, or if no detectable antibody response at baseline, an anti-HBs antibody level of ≥10 IU/l.</p>


<h4>Sample size</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Based on the vaccine efficacy data from previous follow-up of the GHIS after 9 years (83% against infection, 94% against carriage) <a href="#pone.0000753-Viviani1">[3]</a> and assuming that among the unvaccinated group the prevalence of infection had risen to 75% and the prevalence of carriage to 12%, and that in the vaccinated group anti-HBc prevalence had risen to 20% and persistent HBsAg positivity to 2%, we calculated that we needed to recruit 500 participants in each group (vaccinated and unvaccinated) to estimate a vaccine efficacy against infection of 73% (CI 68–78) and against carriage of 83% (CI 70–93). Increasing the sample size had only a minor effect on the width of the confidence intervals. Different assumptions result in different efficacy estimates, but do not significantly affect the width of the confidence intervals.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>As we assumed that loss to follow-up after one year might be larger in the vaccinated group randomised to a booster (due to the 2 week bleed among the boosted group), we calculated that with a distribution of 300 boosted and 200 not boosted, and assuming a 20% loss to follow-up, we would be able to measure antibody responses after 52 weeks in 200 boosted and 160 unboosted vaccines, which would give us over 90% power to detect a significant difference in a protective level of antibodies (defined as anti-HBs&gt;10 IU/ml) between the boosted and unboosted group.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3"></a><p>This sample size was adjusted based on assumptions of percentage which could be matched to the original database (50%), matched participants found on follow up (90%) and then consenting to be bled (90%; 80% for the bleed two weeks after the booster; 60% for the bleed one year later). Thus, a total of 3500 potentially eligible 15 year olds were estimated as necessary for initial recruitment. For each of the five catchment areas, a sample size proportional to size was calculated.</p>


<h4>Matching and data management</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>A questionnaire collected personal and demographic information from all potential recruits. Items included names for both participants and parents, date and place of birth, Infant Welfare Card (IWC) number, ethnic group and date of previous hepatitis vaccination if recorded on the IWC.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2"></a><p>Data were double entered and validated directly into a table in an Access database (Microsoft) also containing a data table with details of the original GHIS cohort. A sequence of queries was run to match recruits with GHIS participants. Data for non-matching recruits were imported to Reclinc2 (IARC) where further non-specific matching techniques were used involving soundex and cross matching of all family names.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3"></a><p>Matched recruits were defined as confirmed or probable matches. Confirmed matches by definition had the same combinations of IWC number and date of birth whilst names were generally similar with allowances for differences in spelling or abbreviations. For the purposes of the follow up only confirmed matches were included.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4"></a><p>Laboratory data were exported directly from the assay reader to Excel (MICROSOFT) and directly imported into the study database.</p>


<h4>Randomisation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>In each area from which participants were recruited, stratified by sex, a random 60% sample was identified, using computer generated lists. Laboratory staff responsible for the outcome measurements were blinded to the allocation.</p>


<h4>Statistical methods</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>Data were analysed using Stata 8.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, USA). Surface antibody levels were log-transformed and a Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) calculated where a response was measured (anti-HBs ≥10 IU/l). Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1-(prevalence in the vaccinated/prevalence in the unvaccinated). Statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed with a Pearson Chi-square test or by Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2"></a><p>Logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios for an anamnestic response after boosting by number of doses received in infancy and by core-positivity prior to the boost.</p>


<h4>Ethics</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>The study was approved by the Gambia Government/MRC Ethics Committee. All participants and their guardians gave signed informed consent. The incorporated trial assessing the effect of boosting or not among infant vaccinnees (ISRCTN71271385) was monitored to ensure it complied with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written feedback of results was provided to all participants.</p>

<h4>Participants</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Between February and July 2004, 3709 potentially eligible participants were identified in the selected areas. For 2147 (57.9%) a satisfactory match was found in the original database. An absolute match was confirmed for 1414, of which 1225 were of the correct age. Of these, 1000 (81.6%) were traced and consented to a blood sample being taken. Of these, 492 (49.2%) had been fully vaccinated (320, 65.0% of them with 4 doses, the remainder with 3 doses), 84 (8.4%) partially, and 424 (42.4%) were not vaccinated as infants.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>Of the fully vaccinated participants who consented to a blood sample being taken, 297 out of 492 were randomly allocated to receive a booster dose. Of these 255 out of 297 (85.6%) donated a sample after two weeks. After one year, a sample was received from 264 out of the 297 (88.9%) of those boosted and 182 out of 195 (93.3%) of the unboosted subjects (<a href="#pone-0000753-g001">figure 1</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3"></a><p>Adolescents not vaccinated in infancy were on average slightly older than the vaccinated infants. There was a balanced distribution within the boosted and unboosted participants (<a href="#pone-0000753-t001">table 1</a>).</p>
