Please note that each bar represents the combined results of five independent experiments employing two female age matched mice of each group per experiment, error bars show SEM. Asterisks indicate a significant difference of the mean (* p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.005; *** p&lt;0.0005) employing students t test.</p>
