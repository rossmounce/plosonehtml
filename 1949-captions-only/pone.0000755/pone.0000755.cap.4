Proliferation (4A) or IL-10 secretion (4B) were measured after 48h. 4C: Total mouse Ig in the supernatant (dilution 1:1024) was measured after seven days by ELISA. Each dot represents an individual experiment, employing B cells purified from two pooled spleens (mean of five replicates the SEM not shown, being below 10%). The bars indicate the median and the asterisks indicate a significant difference of the median (***p&lt;0.0005), employing students t test.</p>
