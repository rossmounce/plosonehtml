                Figure 6.  Reduced IL-10 secretion by CD83mu B cells.Untouched B cells were isolated from pooled spleens of two 8–10 week old sex matched C57BL/6 (open bars), CD83Tg (black bars) and CD83mu (dark grey bars) mice. 2×105 B cells were cultured in triplicates in the presence of titrated amounts of LPS as indicated on the x-axis. 6A: Total mouse Ig in the supernatant (dilution 1:1024) was measured after seven days by ELISA. 6B: IL-10 in the supernatant was measured after 48 h. Presented are the combined results of 3 independent experiments, error bars show SEM. Asterisks indicate a significant difference of the mean (* p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.005 *** p&lt;0.0005) employing students t test.
