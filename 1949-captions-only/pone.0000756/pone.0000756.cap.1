                Figure 1.  Metabonomic analysis of CSF samples from control subjects, patients suffering an IPS, and first onset, drug-naïve schizophrenic patients.(A) and (B) PLS-DA scores and variable loadings plots showing a clear separation of CSF samples derived from drug-naïve schizophrenia patients (red dots) compared to demographically matched controls (black dots) as determined by the 1H-NMR spectroscopy IPS patients are shown as green triangles. 33% (n = 8) of the IPS patients were found to cluster with the schizophrenia patients (showing similar metabolic alterations). The key changing metabolic signals are from lactate and glucose resonances as well as a shift in glutamine. The id's of the five IPS patients who showed the greatest metabolic disturbances are displayed on the plot. We found that the presence of metabolic disturbances was highly predictive of the presence of protein abnormalities (see Fig 2).
