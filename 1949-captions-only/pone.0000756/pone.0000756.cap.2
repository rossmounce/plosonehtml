                Figure 2.  Proteomic analyses of CSF samples from control subjects, patients suffering an IPS, and first onset, drug-naïve schizophrenic patients.(A) and (B) PLS-DA scores and loadings plot showing a differentiation of drug-naïve schizophrenia patients (red dots) from demographically matched controls (black dots) as determined by SELDI-MS spectra. IPS patients are shown in green triangles. 33% of the IPS patients were found to cluster with the schizophrenia patients (showing similar protein alterations). The key changing proteins are a VGF23-62 peptide (at m/z = 3,959, red inverted triangle) and transthyretin proteins (m/z = 13.7−14.0k; blue inverted triangle). The id's of the six IPS patients who showed the greatest protein disturbances are marked/numbered on the plot. We found that the presence of protein disturbances was highly predictive of the presence of metabolite abnormalities (see Fig 1).
