                Figure 3.  No clear association was found between clinical outcomes and metabolic/proteomic profiles of patients suffering an IPS. CSF metabolic and proteomic profiles of IPS patients were analyzed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and SELDI-MS, respectively.PLS models based on CSF profiles from controls and first onset schizophrenia patients were built to try to predict the transition of IPS patients to develop overt psychosis. IPS patients were followed up for up to 3 years. Those IPS patients who went on to develop overt psychosis are labelled in red. There is no clear association between clinical outcomes and their CSF metabolic (Figure 3A) and proteomic (Figure 3B) profiles at the prodromal phase of psychosis.
