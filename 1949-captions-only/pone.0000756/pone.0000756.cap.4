During the IPS, key biochemical alterations may vary possibly in accordance with “mental-state” fluctuations between mental well being and schizophrenia-like states. During the first episode of overt psychosis, these alterations become more persistent and significant. For some IPS patients, their conditions may not deteriorate and their CSF proteomic and metabolic profiles may return to normal.</p>
