The level of infectiousness is a function of the time since the person with active disease became infectious and is called the <em>infectiousness index</em>. The infectiousness index is low for a person who has only recently become infectious and increases as the person becomes more ill <a href="#pone.0000757-Toyota1">[6]</a>. This increase may be assumed to be approximated by an exponential growth curve as this is the manner in which the bacteria infecting a person probably multiply. The increase will eventually tend to a saturation value. So the infectiousness index can be approximated by a logistic function, <em>f</em>, as shown in <a href="#pone-0000757-g002">figure 2</a> (see <a href="#pone.0000757.s001">Appendix S1</a> for details). The risk of an infection event occurring will depend on the level of susceptibility of the individual exposed to an infectious person. By assuming a mean value for the degree of susceptibility, the infectiousness index will have values that are independent of the particular person being exposed to a potential infection event.</p>
