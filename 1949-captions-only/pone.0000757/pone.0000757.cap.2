<h4>The number of available susceptible contacts</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>A PCC becomes epidemiologically important when the primary member develops active TB disease. Such an individual most likely has a limited number of potential close contacts so the size of the PCC may be relatively small. In industrialized countries the median size is about six with reports of up to more than ten <a href="#pone.0000757-Reichler1">[10]</a>â€“<a href="#pone.0000757-Bailey1">[12]</a>. But the number may well be considerably larger, particularly where extensive and densely occupied areas are involved. Under such conditions, in an EPCC, as many as 40 or more direct infection events have been reported <a href="#pone.0000757-Phillips1">[13]</a>. However, such large numbers of direct infections occur under unusual circumstances and should not be regarded as typical.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>The infectious primary individual will, by definition of a PCC, encounter most of these contacts within the initial weeks after onset of disease. During these weeks while the infectiousness of the primary member is still low, the rate at which members of his PCC become infected is relatively slow. Initially therefore, the number of potential susceptible contacts decreases slowly. As time progresses, the primary member becomes increasingly infectious and the number of remaining uninfected contacts decreases more rapidly. Eventually, the remaining members of the PCC will typically be those uninfected people in the PCC that have less intense contact with the primary person. It will take longer for such people to experience sufficient contact with the primary person to enable infection. Moreover, the infectious person is likely to have become less mobile and to meet with fewer of the members of his PCC. Thus the rate of decrease in the number of uninfected susceptible people in the PCC eventually starts to diminish. The number of uninfected members of an EPCC therefore decreases over time according to a logistic curve, <em>g</em> (<a href="#pone-0000757-g002">figure 2</a>). Details of the derivation of this function are provided in <a href="#pone.0000757.s001">Appendix S1</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>A person who is not a member of an EPCC may be infected by the infectious primary member of that EPCC as the result of a pure chance encounter. This eventuality is referred to as infection by casual contact. By definition of the concept of a PCC, such an event would be exceptional as it would require intensive exposure by the prime member to persons that are not members of his or her PCC. Moreover, as the prime member becomes increasingly ill, he or she will become less mobile and casual contacts less likely.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>The focus here is on a setting typical of underdeveloped countries where high density living and work conditions prevail. In such conditions most people will have regular daily work and leisure routines and will encounter the same group of people each day. Travel far from home which would imply contact with strangers can be practically discounted. In these settings the incidence of infection events involving casual contacts can be regarded as insignificant. The functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> in <a href="#pone-0000757-g002">figures 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0000757-g003">3</a> govern the rate at which people are infected, at time <em>t</em>, by the primary member of an EPCC as discussed in the following section.</p>
