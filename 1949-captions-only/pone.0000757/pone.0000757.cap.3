<h4>The total number of infected individuals in the community</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>A person who becomes infected may progress to active disease within a short time (a matter of a few weeks) or at any time during the course of his or her life or even not at all. The risk of progression to disease varies also according to many factors, such as age at which infection occurs, current age of the individual, gender and immunocompetency. An average value for the rate at which infected individuals in the community become infectious can be used, as this approach is consistent with the way the functions <em>f</em> and <em>g,</em> described in the previous sections, are constructed. We denote this rate by <em>r</em>. Then, at a given time <em>t</em>, the rate σ at which infected individuals in the community as a whole convert to the infectious state is given by σ = <em>r</em>·<em>I</em>, where <em>I</em>, is the total number of infected individuals at that time. This means that the rate at which newly infectious individuals appear from within the community is σ, assuming, as discussed earlier, that there is no net migration of infectious persons into or from the community under study. If, as it is reasonable to suppose, this rate σ is approximately constant over a moderate period of time such as two or three months, the total number of new infectious individuals in the community is given by σ·τ where τ is the mean time from onset of infectiousness to diagnosis and effective treatment and σ is the mean value of the conversion rate in the community as a whole over the period τ. A unique EPPC is associated with each infectious individual and the current number of EPCC's is σ·τ.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>The functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> are defined in such a way that the rate at which susceptible people in an EPCC become infected may be expressed as <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>), the degree of infectiousness of the primary member, multiplied by the number of potential susceptible contacts, <em>g</em>(<em>t</em>), Here <em>t</em> denotes the time from when the primary member became infectious. The rate at which people in an EPCC are being infected is given by <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>). Since the number of EPCC's is σ·τ, it follows that in the community as a whole, the rate at which individuals become infected can be expressed as:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000757.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>The equation governing the rate of change of <em>I</em> is constructed by considering the rates of flow into and out of the cohort of infected persons. <a href="#pone-0000757-g004">Figure 4</a> is the flow diagram. It uses the terminology: S, <em>I</em> and D are the numbers of susceptible, infected and infectious diseased people, respectively in the community. <em>r</em> is the rate of progression from the infected state to the diseased and infectious state and µ is the weighted mortality rate for infected people. Note that this diagram only shows flows into and out of the compartment of infected people. These flows already encapsulate the flows into and out of the compartments for susceptible and diseased people and these flows are therefore not shown here. From <a href="#pone-0000757-g004">figure 4</a> it can be seen that this rate of change can be formulated as follows:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000757.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where μ is the weighted death rate of infected individuals and uninfected individuals in a PCC.</p>
