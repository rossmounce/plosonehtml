High incidence rates of TB have been endemic here for several decades. During most of this time the incidence of HIV has been negligible <a href="#pone.0000757-Verver1">[9]</a> so the complications involved in accounting for the effect of HIV on the TB epidemic do not apply to this study. The functions <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>) and <em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) and hence <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) were constructed using data from the same community (see <a href="#pone.0000757.s001">Appendix S1</a>). These functions and κ will vary from setting to setting and they will probably change slowly over time. The results presented in this section are provisional and are based on an analysis of unpublished clinical data specific for the community alluded to above. Further investigations are needed to determine definitive parameter values for the construction of these functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em>. Nevertheless, since the incidence of TB has been increasing in this community, a situation corresponding to scenario 1 as depicted in <a href="#pone-0000757-g005">Figure 5</a> must prevail. The precise extent by which the maximum value of <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) exceeds the value of κ is, however, not known at this stage. <a href="#pone-0000757-g005">Figure 5</a> shows the function <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) compared to the value of κ for two scenarios. The value of κ is 0.38 (see <a href="#pone.0000757.s001">Appendix S1</a>). Scenario 1 corresponds to the existing situation and scenario 2 represents a situation in which <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) has been reduced by 20%. In scenario 1 the ceiling κ is exceeded already by day 9 whereas in scenario 2 κ is exceeded only by day 18 so that the window of opportunity to achieve a diagnosis, that is, the threshold time Γ, has been doubled. A slight further reduction in the value of <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) to prevent the ceiling ever being exceeded would be sufficient to bring the epidemic under control no matter how long the prevailing mean delay time to diagnosis. Alternatively, the same results could follow if measures were put in place so that a larger value of κ emerged as this could allow for an increase in the threshold time Γ to a value exceeding the mean delay time to diagnosis.</p>

<div id="section4" class="section"><a id="s4" name="s4" toc="s4" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1"></a><p>Three pivotal parameters have been identified that have importance for the reduction in the incidence of TB: The mean time τ, from onset of active disease to diagnosis, a threshold time Γ and a ceiling time κ. Recall that κ denotes (1+μ/<em>r</em>)/τ where μ is the mortality rate and <em>r</em> is the rate of progression from infection to disease. Any attempt to control a TB epidemic has to address the issues associated with these parameters. Control measures should intervene in such a way that <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) remains less than κ for all values of <em>t</em> up to the mean time to diagnosis τ.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2"></a><p><a href="#pone-0000757-g005">Figure 5</a>, taken together with the definition of κ, shows that the mean time to diagnosis, τ, is critical. A reduction in τ has an unexpected and beneficial dual effect in that this leads not only to a situation where <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) does not exceed κ for <em>t</em> less than τ, but also the value of κ is simultaneously increased. This results from the presence of τ in the denominator of (1+μ/<em>r</em>)/τ and assists in achieving the goal of preventing <em>f</em> (<em>t</em>)·<em>g</em> (<em>t</em>) exceeding the ceiling.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3"></a><p>As explained later, the value of κ itself can be directly increased. If this achieved then a concomitant increase in Γ occurs, as can be seen in <a href="#pone-0000757-g006">figure 6</a>.</p>
