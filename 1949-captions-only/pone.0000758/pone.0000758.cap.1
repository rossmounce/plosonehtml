                Figure 1.  Concept of approach.As a starting point, consider a household of size 4. A, illustrates an infection being transmitted in this household, with the index case (i) being infected outside the house at time t0. They then infect exactly one person (ii) at time t1, and (ii) in turn infects person (iii) at time t2. Person (iv) escapes infection altogether. The infectiousness of each individual over time is also shown, with infection events highlighted. B, illustrates how these events can be reinterpreted by taking the unit of infection as the household, infected at time t0 and with total infectiousness of the household defined as the sum of the four individual curves shown in A. The aim of the method is then to average this process over all possible chains of infection in the household, and all household sizes, to obtain the characteristic infectiousness profile of a household, as shown in C, where the household is no longer decomposed into its constituent units at all.
