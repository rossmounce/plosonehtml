                Figure 2.  The infectiousness of households.The average infectiousness of a fully susceptible household infected with influenza (A) or measles (B). The infectiousness of individuals (denoted β (τ)) is shown, as is the infectiousness of the typical infected household (denoted β* (τ*)). This latter curve is obtained by simulating over 10,000 epidemics of transmission within households starting from one infected case. The two analytical approximations described in the text are also shown. “Approx 1” is the main approximation described, while “Approx 2” is the one obtained by assuming that all infections occur in the second generation of infection within the household. Parameters are as described in the main text, and the curves are arbitrarily scaled such that each individual infects on average one person outside of the household (i.e. RG = 1).
