                Figure 3.  Reproduction numbers for an exponentially growing epidemic.Estimates of the individual reproduction number R (r ) (the average number of people infected by each individual) and the household reproduction number R* (r ) (the average number of people infected by each household) are shown as a function of the epidemic growth rate r for influenza (A) and measles (B). The two analytical approximations which bracket the household reproduction number R* (denoted upper and lower) are shown along with numerically estimated values (‘+’ symbols). The approximation to the individual reproduction number given by equation (12) is shown (dashed line) along with numerical estimates (‘Δ’ symbols). The estimate for the quantity RG, the average number of people each person infects outside his or her home, is also shown.
