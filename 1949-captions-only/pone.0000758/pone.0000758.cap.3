The two analytical approximations which bracket the household reproduction number <em>R<sup>*</sup></em> (denoted upper and lower) are shown along with numerically estimated values (‘+’ symbols). The approximation to the individual reproduction number given by equation (12) is shown (dashed line) along with numerical estimates (‘Δ’ symbols). The estimate for the quantity <em>R<sub>G</sub></em>, the average number of people each person infects outside his or her home, is also shown.</p>
