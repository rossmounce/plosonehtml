I use parameters estimated for an epidemic growth rate <em>r</em> = 0.20 per day, and condition on non-extinction of the epidemic. In C and D, the natural logarithm of the incidence is compared to the fixed slope curve <em>r</em> = 0.20 predicted by the model (thick line). Linear regression through these data yields the estimate <em>rÌ‚</em> = 0.19 in both cases.</p>
