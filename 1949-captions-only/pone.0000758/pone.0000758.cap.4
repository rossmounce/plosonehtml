                Figure 4.  Simulated epidemics.To check the method for consistency, I simulate ten epidemics of influenza (A) and measles (B) within a fully susceptible community of 2,000 households. I use parameters estimated for an epidemic growth rate r = 0.20 per day, and condition on non-extinction of the epidemic. In C and D, the natural logarithm of the incidence is compared to the fixed slope curve r = 0.20 predicted by the model (thick line). Linear regression through these data yields the estimate rÌ‚ = 0.19 in both cases.
