                Figure 1.  Re-analysis of the detrended total fossil biodiversity data used by [1] with LS.Analysis used AutoSignal with significance levels computed assuming Gaussian fluctuations and lines denote 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 levels of significance. Frequencies are given in per Myr; there is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0162/Myr which is equivalent to 61.9Â±3.4 Myr; that peak is significant at the .01 level. All other significant peaks occur at less than 15 Myr and thus are near or below the Nyquist frequency.
