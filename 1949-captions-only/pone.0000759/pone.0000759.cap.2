Frequencies are given per Myr. <span class="underline">A</span>. Analysis of data detrended using the cubic. There is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0161/Myr which is equivalent to 62.1±3.1 Myr; this peak is significant at better than the .001 level. There is also a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0318/Myr which is equivalent to 31.4±0.9 Myr, although this peak is only significant at the .1 level. All other significant peaks occur at less than 15 Myr and thus are near or below the Nyquist frequency. <span class="underline">B</span>. Analysis of data divided by actual diversity in each interval. There is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0161/Myr which is equivalent to 62.1±3.3 Myr; this peak is significant at better than the .01 level. There is also a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0318/Myr which is equivalent to 31.4±0.9 Myr, although this peak is not significant at the .1 level. All other significant peaks occur at less than 15 Myr and thus are near or below the Nyquist frequency.</p>
