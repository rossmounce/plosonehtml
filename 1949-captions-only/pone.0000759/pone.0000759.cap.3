Analysis of detrended diversity of genera that lived more than 45 Myr. There are no significant peaks except at periods below 20 Myr which are thus near or below the Nyquist frequency. <span class="underline">B</span>. Analysis of detrended diversity of genera that lived less than 45 Myr. There is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0161/Myr, equivalent to 62Â±3 Myr, significant at better than the .001 level (all other significant peaks are at periods below 20 Myr).</p>
