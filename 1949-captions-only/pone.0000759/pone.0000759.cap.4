                Figure 4.  Analysis with LS using AutoSignal; significance levels computed by AutoSignal assuming Gaussian fluctuations and lines denote 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 levels of significance.Frequencies are given in per Myr. A. Analysis of fluctuations in detrended fractional diversity from 150–519 Ma. There is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0164/Myr, equivalent to 61.0±3.2 Myr, significant at the 0.001 level; there is also another peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0311/Myr, equivalent to 32.2±1.1 Myr, significant at the 0.05 level. B. Analysis of fluctuations in detrended fractional diversity from 0–150 Ma. There is no longer a significant peak at 62 Myr or any other interval.
