Analysis of fluctuations in detrended fractional diversity from 150–519 Ma. There is a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0164/Myr, equivalent to 61.0±3.2 Myr, significant at the 0.001 level; there is also another peak at a frequency of approximately 0.0311/Myr, equivalent to 32.2±1.1 Myr, significant at the 0.05 level. <span class="underline">B</span>. Analysis of fluctuations in detrended fractional diversity from 0–150 Ma. There is no longer a significant peak at 62 Myr or any other interval.</p>
