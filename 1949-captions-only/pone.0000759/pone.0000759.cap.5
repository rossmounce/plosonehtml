Analysis of fluctuations in fractional origination intensity. There are two peaks significant at the 0.01 level: one at a frequency of approximately 0.0166/Myr, equivalent to 60.1±3.1 Myr; and another at a frequency of approximately 0.0421/Myr, equivalent to 23.7±0.5 Myr. <span class="underline">B</span>. Analysis of fluctuations in fractional extinction intensity. There is a peak significant at the 0.02 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0370/Myr, equivalent to 27.0±0.7 Myr. The largest peak (not significant, however) at the frequency most equivalent to the 62 Myr peak is also shown. <span class="underline">C</span>. The power spectrum of stratigraphic interval lengths. There is a peak significant at 0.001at a frequency of approximately 0.0364/Myr, equivalent to 27.5±0.6 Myr. Notice there are no peaks significant at or near frequencies equivalent to 62 Myr. <span class="underline">D</span>. Analysis of fluctuations in cumulative origination. There is a peak significant at the 0.01 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0370/Myr equivalent to 27.0±0.5 Myr. <span class="underline">E</span>. Analysis of fluctuations in cumulative extinction. There is a peak significant at the 0.01 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0172/Myr equivalent to 62.2±3.0 Myr.</p>
