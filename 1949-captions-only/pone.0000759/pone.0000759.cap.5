                Figure 5.  Analysis with LS using AutoSignal; significance levels computed by AutoSignal assuming Gaussian fluctuations and lines denote 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 levels of significance.Frequencies are given in per Myr. A. Analysis of fluctuations in fractional origination intensity. There are two peaks significant at the 0.01 level: one at a frequency of approximately 0.0166/Myr, equivalent to 60.1±3.1 Myr; and another at a frequency of approximately 0.0421/Myr, equivalent to 23.7±0.5 Myr. B. Analysis of fluctuations in fractional extinction intensity. There is a peak significant at the 0.02 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0370/Myr, equivalent to 27.0±0.7 Myr. The largest peak (not significant, however) at the frequency most equivalent to the 62 Myr peak is also shown. C. The power spectrum of stratigraphic interval lengths. There is a peak significant at 0.001at a frequency of approximately 0.0364/Myr, equivalent to 27.5±0.6 Myr. Notice there are no peaks significant at or near frequencies equivalent to 62 Myr. D. Analysis of fluctuations in cumulative origination. There is a peak significant at the 0.01 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0370/Myr equivalent to 27.0±0.5 Myr. E. Analysis of fluctuations in cumulative extinction. There is a peak significant at the 0.01 level at a frequency of approximately 0.0172/Myr equivalent to 62.2±3.0 Myr.
