                Figure 1.  Haplotype network for the 3N1 mtDNA lineage, showing nesting levels.Clades correspond to those listed in Table 2. Small ovals without letter names are haplotypes not sampled but which are necessary to connect sampled haplotypes. Pie charts next to each haplotype indicate the proportion of individuals with that haplotype sampled from the various regions described in the analytical methods and Figure 7.
