                Figure 5.  Proposed origin and spread of 3N1 and 3N2 parthenogens.Also shown are timing estimates for expansions and hypothesized future expansions in 3N1 parthenogens. Phylogeographic events are overlaid on the predicted distribution for parthenogenetic Heteronotia binoei based on a statistical distribution model for present climatic conditions [24]. Times given here are point estimates; confidence intervals are given in Table 2. DRD = dispersal restricted by distance.
