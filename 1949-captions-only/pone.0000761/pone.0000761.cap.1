<h4>Design</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Inhibitor <strong>1</strong> was designed to coordinate the zinc divalent cation embedded in the active site of BoNTA endopeptidase for affinity and simultaneously to interact with serotype-specific residues in the active site for selectivity <a href="#pone.0000761-Park1">[7]</a>. This design was based on previous MMDSs using the CaDA approach. The MMDSs (20 simulations) of the endopeptidase in complex with <strong>1</strong> showed that (1) the hydroxamate group coordinated the active-site zinc ion; (2) the phenyl group substituted at the thiophene ring had a π-π interaction with Phe193 and a cation-π interaction with Arg362; (3) the indole ring was engaged in a cation-π interaction with Lys165; (4) the phenyl group attached to the indole ring had a van der Waals interaction with the side chain of Leu527 and a cation-π interaction with Lys165; (5) the ammonium group interacted with the carboxylates of Glu54 and Glu55 <a href="#pone.0000761-Park1">[7]</a>. The absolute free energy binding between <strong>1</strong> and the endopeptidase was estimated to be −7.5 kcal/mol according to a free energy perturbation calculation of the MMDS-derived model of the <strong>1</strong>-bound endopeptidase using a published method <a href="#pone.0000761-Pang4">[24]</a> with modifications described in <a href="#s4">MATERIALS AND METHODS</a>. These computational observations were consistent with the experimentally determined <em>K</em><sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup> of 7±2.4 µM (ΔG ranging from –6.9 to –7.3 kcal/mol) for <strong>1</strong> (see below). In this context, the MMDS-derived model of the <strong>1</strong>-bound endopeptidase was used for the following lead optimization.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>An analysis of the MMDS trajectories of the endopeptidase in complex with <strong>1</strong> identified a vacancy around the <em>meta</em> position of the phenyl group substituted on the thiophene of <strong>1</strong>. Synthetically, this void can be filled by a hydroxyl group substituted at the phenyl ring. This hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with active-side residues to improve the affinity for the endopeptidase and the introduction of this hydroxyl group can also increase the hydrophilicity of <strong>1</strong> because dimethyl sulfoxide is needed to dissolve <strong>1</strong> in water. These considerations led to the design of inhibitor <strong>2</strong> (<a href="#pone-0000761-g001">Figure 1</a>). MMDSs (20 simulations) of the endopeptidase in complex with <strong>2</strong> were carried out to confirm the anticipated hydrogen bonds. The result of these simulations suggested that <strong>2</strong> binds at the active site of BoNTA endopeptidase in a manner similar to that of <strong>1</strong> and that the hydroxyl group attached to the phenyl group of <strong>2</strong> indeed has hydrogen bonds with Arg362 and Asp369 of the endopeptidase (<a href="#pone-0000761-g002">Figure 2</a>). In the average structure of the endopeptidase complex obtained from 10,000 instantaneous structures at 1.0-ps intervals during the last 0.5-ns period of the 20 different simulations using an explicit water model <a href="#pone.0000761-Jorgensen1">[25]</a>, the hydrogen bond of <strong>2</strong> to Arg362 is bridged by a water molecule; the average distances from the phenolic oxygen atom to the carboxylate oxygen atom of Asp369 and the water oxygen atom are 2.9 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively; the average distance between the water oxygen atom and the closest guanidinium nitrogen atom of Arg362 is 3.3 Å.</p>
