A <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> value of 12±2.6 µM was previously obtained for <strong>1</strong> that was assumed to be a competitive inhibitor <a href="#pone.0000761-Park1">[7]</a>. A further investigation on inhibitor effectiveness in this study revealed nonlinear Dixon plots for both <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> with data obtained at the condition of [S]&lt;&lt;<em>K</em><sub>M</sub> (<a href="#pone-0000761-g005">Figure 5</a>). The curvature of these plots indicates a partially competitive inhibition mechanism for <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> <a href="#pone.0000761-Todhunter1">[38]</a>; it precludes determination of <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> values using standard kinetic methods and invalidates the previously reported <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> value for <strong>1</strong>. To compare the relative inhibitory potencies of the two inhibitors, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup> values of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> were therefore obtained from the slope of 1/ν versus [I] at the conditions of [S]&lt;&lt;<em>K</em><sub>M</sub> and inhibitor concentrations less than 15.0 µM and 5.4 µM, respectively, according to a literature procedure <a href="#pone.0000761-Todhunter1">[38]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000761-Shapiro2">[39]</a>. The Dixon plots for <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> are approximately linear at relatively low concentrations (<a href="#pone-0000761-g005">Figure 5</a>). Consequently, the kinetics assays showed that (1) at low inhibitor concentrations, <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> are competitive inhibitors of BoNTA endopeptidase with <em>K</em><sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup> values of 7±2.4 µM and 3.8±0.8 µM, respectively, in HEPES buffer at pH 7.3, consistent with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations independently determined for the inhibition of BoNTA endopeptidase by <strong>1</strong> (15±1.5 µM) and <strong>2 (</strong>7.9±0.8 µM); (2) the <em>K</em><sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup> values of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> were unaffected after the zinc concentration of the assay was increased from 25 µM to 50 µM while holding all other experimental variables constant; (3) <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> did not inhibit botulinum neurotoxin serotype B endopeptidase at concentrations up to 20 µM (data not shown). These results preclude the possibility that the inhibition of BoNTA endopeptidase by <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong> was due to nonspecific zinc chelation. All the observations demonstrate that <strong>2</strong> is a more potent BoNTA endopeptidase inhibitor than <strong>1</strong>.</p>
