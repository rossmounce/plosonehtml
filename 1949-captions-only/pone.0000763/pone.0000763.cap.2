                Figure 2.  Variation in histone H3 methylation in mouse epidermis and effects of Myc activation.Immunofluorescence staining for LRC (red) and (green) H3diK4 (A, G, J), H3diK9 (B, H, K) and H3triK9 (C, I, L) in whole mounts of wild type (A–C, G–I) and 4OHT treated K14MycER (J–L) epidermis. Position of hair follicle bulge is marked by line in A–C. Inserts in A–C show higher magnification views of bulge LRC. G–L show LRC in interfollicular epidermis. (D–F, M–O) Quantitation (±S.D.) of number of LRC per bulge (D–F) and interfollicular epidermis (M–O) that had high or low levels of staining (see Fig. S1) with antibodies to the H3 modifications indicated. Scale bars: 100 µm (A–C), 20 µm (G–L).
