Position of hair follicle bulge is marked by line in A–C. Inserts in A–C show higher magnification views of bulge LRC. G–L show LRC in interfollicular epidermis. (D–F, M–O) Quantitation (±S.D.) of number of LRC per bulge (D–F) and interfollicular epidermis (M–O) that had high or low levels of staining (see <a href="#pone.0000763.s001">Fig. S1</a>) with antibodies to the H3 modifications indicated. Scale bars: 100 µm (A–C), 20 µm (G–L).</p>
