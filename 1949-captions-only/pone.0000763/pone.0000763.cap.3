                Figure 3.  Variation in histone H4 acetylation and methylation in mouse epidermis and effects of Myc activation.(A–C, E–G, I–K) Immunofluorescence staining of whole mounts of wild-type (A–C, F, G, K) and 4OHT treated K14MycER transgenic (E,I, J) epidermis with antibodies to (green) H4Ac (A–C, E), H4monoK20 (F, G, I, J) and H4triK20 (K). Double labelling for LRC (red) is shown in C, G, I, K. I and inserts in C, G, K show high magnification views of LRC. IFE: interfollicular epidermis; sebaceous gland (SG), bulge (Bg), bulb (Bb) are marked with arrows in A, E. Hair follicles and sebaceous glands are marked with dashed lines in A, B, E, F, J; LRC are marked with dashed lines in C, G, I, K; position of bulge is marked with line in C, G, K. D, H, L show quantitation (±S.D.) of number of LRC per bulge with high or low levels of the H4 modifications indicated. M–R: immunofluorescence labelling (green) with DAPI counterstain (blue) of wild-type (M–O) and 4OHT treated K14MycER (P–R) dorsal interfollicular epidermis using antibodies to H4monoK20 (M, P), H4diK20 (N, Q) and keratin 10 (O, R). Dashed lines indicate position of basement membrane. Scale bar: 50 µm
