Hair follicles and sebaceous glands (SG) are outlined with dashed lines. Bg: bulge; Bb: bulb (A–D). (E–P) Double immunofluorescence labelling of cultured human keratinocytes transduced with empty vector (k-pBabe; E, F, I, J, M, N) or MycER (k-MycER; G, H, K, L, O, P) and treated for 24 h with 4OHT alone (E, I, M, G, K, O) or 4OHT+TSA (F, J, N, H, L, P). Cells were stained with antibodies to H4monoK20 (red) and H4diK20 (green) with DAPI counterstain (blue). E–H are merged images of the panels below. (Q,R) Quantitation (±S.D.) of % cells per colony with high levels of H4monoK20 (Q) or H4diK20 (R). Cells were stimulated with 4OHT alone (4OHT) or 4OHT and TSA (TSA). P values (t-test) are *0.0046, **0.0505 (Q) and *0.0545, **0.0211, ***0.0192 (R). Scale bar: 100 µm (A–D), 20 µm (E–P).</p>
