                Figure 5.  Expression of histone methyl transferases in response to Myc and TSA.(A) Western blots of keratinocytes infected with empty vector (K-pBabe) or MycER (K-MycER) and treated with 4OHT±TSA for the number of hours indicated. Blots were probed with antibodies to the proteins indicated. Tubulin (Tub) was used as a loading control. (B) Immunostaining for Ash-1 (red) with DAPI counterstain (blue). Scale bar: 10 µm.
