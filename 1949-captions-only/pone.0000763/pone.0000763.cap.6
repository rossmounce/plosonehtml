                Figure 6.  TSA treatment induces similar changes in epidermal proliferation and differentiation to activation of Myc, and exacerbates the effects of Myc.Wild-type (A, B, E, F, I, J, M, N, Q, R) and K14MycER transgenic (C, D, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T) mice were treated with 4OHT alone (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S) or in combination with TSA (B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T). 4OHT treatment of wild-type epidermis served as a negative control. A–P are sections of back skin; Q–T are whole mounts of tail skin. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (A–H), anti-BrdU (brown, I–L) or anti Ki67 (brown, M–P). Whole mounts were stained for keratin 14 (green) with DAPI counterstain (blue). Arrows in B, C, F, G, H show thickening of interfollicular epidermis. Arrow in D shows detachment of epidermis from dermis. Arrowhead in F shows enlarged sebaceous gland. Arrowheads in J–L, N–P show different numbers of proliferating cells. SG: sebaceous glands. Scale bars: 100 µm
