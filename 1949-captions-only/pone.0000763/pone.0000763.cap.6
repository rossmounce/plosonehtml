A–P are sections of back skin; Q–T are whole mounts of tail skin. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (A–H), anti-BrdU (brown, I–L) or anti Ki67 (brown, M–P). Whole mounts were stained for keratin 14 (green) with DAPI counterstain (blue). Arrows in B, C, F, G, H show thickening of interfollicular epidermis. Arrow in D shows detachment of epidermis from dermis. Arrowhead in F shows enlarged sebaceous gland. Arrowheads in J–L, N–P show different numbers of proliferating cells. SG: sebaceous glands. Scale bars: 100 µm</p>
