                Figure 7.  Model of histone modifications in different epidermal compartments and effect of Myc activation.Red arrows indicate events stimulated by Myc. Stem cells and terminally differentiated cells are shown as having high levels of histone tri-methylation and low levels of histone acetylation, mono- and di-methylation. Myc increases global H4 acetylation and transient mono-methylation of H4K20, which is replaced di-methylation of H4K20, H3K4 and H3K9 at the expense of tri-methylation. HAT: histone acetyl transferase; HDAC: histone deacetyl transferase complex.
