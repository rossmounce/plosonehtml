Stem cells and terminally differentiated cells are shown as having high levels of histone tri-methylation and low levels of histone acetylation, mono- and di-methylation. Myc increases global H4 acetylation and transient mono-methylation of H4K20, which is replaced di-methylation of H4K20, H3K4 and H3K9 at the expense of tri-methylation. HAT: histone acetyl transferase; HDAC: histone deacetyl transferase complex.</p>
