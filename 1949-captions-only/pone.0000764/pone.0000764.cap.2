                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic analyses and nucleotide sequence alignments of NP and VP35 sequences derived from bat tissues.A) Maximum likelihood analysis of the concatenated NP (464 nt) and VP35 (302 nt) sequence fragments obtained from each bat specimen and 18 MBG virus isolates. Bootstrap support values are indicated at the nodes. Abbreviations of historical isolates are Rav = Ravn, Ozo = Ozolin, Pop = Popp and Mus = Musoke. B-C) Nucleotide alignment of the sequences in (A) in which the lineages from the Angola 2005 outbreak are singly represented by Ang1379c.
