                Figure 2.  The reaction requires cellular factors.A–VLPs were purified on sucrose gradient from nuclear extracts harvested on day 3. M-molecular weight marker; VLPs–purified VLPs used in the packaging experiment (Table 1). B-Nuclear extracts were harvested from infected Sf9 cells at different time points after infection, as designated on top, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining. M-molecular weight marker; Mock-nuclear extract of Sf9 cells infected with wild type baculovirus; SV40-nuclear extract of CV1 cells infected with wild type SV40; BSA-1 µg BSA, a standard for band intensity. C-Activity of the nuclear extracts shown in part B. ○-Packaging activity measured as titer (left ordinate); □-VP1 level estimated from A (right ordinate).
