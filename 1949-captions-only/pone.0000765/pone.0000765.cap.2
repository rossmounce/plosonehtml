M-molecular weight marker; VLPs–purified VLPs used in the packaging experiment (<a href="#pone-0000765-t001">Table 1</a>). B-Nuclear extracts were harvested from infected Sf9 cells at different time points after infection, as designated on top, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining. M-molecular weight marker; Mock-nuclear extract of Sf9 cells infected with wild type baculovirus; SV40-nuclear extract of CV1 cells infected with wild type SV40; BSA-1 µg BSA, a standard for band intensity.
