A–DNA; B–VP1. The amounts used per reaction, as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>, is indicated. C-Fourteen different batches of nuclear extracts were assayed for packaging activity. Only 11 distinct data points are seen because of overlap of some of the data points. D-Calculation of Hill coefficient from the same set of data as in C. Y is the fraction of fully assembled VP1, measured as TU.</p>
