                Figure 4.  Equilibrium sedimentation in CsCl gradient.The reaction products, 2 ml, were fractionated on a CsCl density gradient in stabilization buffer at pH 5.2 (Materials and Methods). VP1 was analyzed by Coomassie and Bradford, DNA by real-time quantitative PCR and luc TU as described in Materials and Methods.
