                Figure 5.  OrthoMCL and Jaccard clustering results for the second largest RNA polymerase subunit families of S. cerevisiae.The second largest subunits of RNA polymerase I, II, and III in yeast are named RPA135, RPB2, and RET1, respectively. (A) Phylogenetic tree display of OrthoMCL results showing individual yeast subunit RPA135 and its predicted orthologs resolved into a distinct family. OrthoMCL results showing yeast RNA polymerase subunits RET1 (B) and RPB2 (C) resolved into separate families of orthologs. (D) Jaccard clustering results showing a “super family” of related RNA polymerase subfamilies. Arrows from each OrthoMCL family on the left point to the separate subfamilies in the Jaccard results. I to IV on the right of each tree indicates RNA polymerase subfamily. The second largest subunits for a fourth RNA polymerase, Pol IV, unique to plants were resolved into their own distinct two-member family by the OrthoMCL program (not shown), and were appropriately clustered with this superfamily by the Jaccard clustering method.
