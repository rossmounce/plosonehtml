(A) Phylogenetic tree display of OrthoMCL results showing individual yeast subunit <em>RPA135</em> and its predicted orthologs resolved into a distinct family. OrthoMCL results showing yeast RNA polymerase subunits <em>RET1</em> (B) and <em>RPB2</em> (C) resolved into separate families of orthologs. (D) Jaccard clustering results showing a “super family” of related RNA polymerase subfamilies. Arrows from each OrthoMCL family on the left point to the separate subfamilies in the Jaccard results. I to IV on the right of each tree indicates RNA polymerase subfamily. The second largest subunits for a fourth RNA polymerase, Pol IV, unique to plants were resolved into their own distinct two-member family by the OrthoMCL program (not shown), and were appropriately clustered with this superfamily by the Jaccard clustering method.
