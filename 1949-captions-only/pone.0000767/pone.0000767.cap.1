Organization of the inverted H1 promoters and sequence encoding a specific siRNA. The expression cassette contains essential promoter elements. The <em>Eco</em>RI and <em>Bgl</em>II sites flank the siRNA sequence and can be used to exchange siRNA cassettes. B. Generation of the Inv-H1-siRNA cassette by a ligase chain reaction (LCR). The numbers associated with the LCR-1 and LCR-2 products correspond to individual oligonucleotides that are ligated together. Digesting LCR-1 and LCR-2 with <em>Eco</em>RI allows for ligation and formation of the full-length product that can be cut with <em>Pst</em>I and <em>Hind</em>III and cloned into pSUPER. C. Gel electrophoresis of LCR-1 and LCR-2 products. Ten microliters of the LCR reaction were run in each lane of a 3% Metaphor agarose gel. The fragments corresponding to 106 bp (LCR-1) and 151 bp (LCR-2) were gel purified. D. Cloning scheme used to generate pInv-H1. The pSUPER construct and the LCR-derived product were digested with <em>Pst</em>I and <em>Hind</em>III and ligated together. The original full-length H1 promoter driving expression of the shRNA product in pSUPER has now been replaced with the inverted H1 promoter siRNA cassette.</p>
