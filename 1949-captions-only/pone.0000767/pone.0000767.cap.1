                Figure 1.  Construction of pInv-H1.A. Organization of the inverted H1 promoters and sequence encoding a specific siRNA. The expression cassette contains essential promoter elements. The EcoRI and BglII sites flank the siRNA sequence and can be used to exchange siRNA cassettes. B. Generation of the Inv-H1-siRNA cassette by a ligase chain reaction (LCR). The numbers associated with the LCR-1 and LCR-2 products correspond to individual oligonucleotides that are ligated together. Digesting LCR-1 and LCR-2 with EcoRI allows for ligation and formation of the full-length product that can be cut with PstI and HindIII and cloned into pSUPER. C. Gel electrophoresis of LCR-1 and LCR-2 products. Ten microliters of the LCR reaction were run in each lane of a 3% Metaphor agarose gel. The fragments corresponding to 106 bp (LCR-1) and 151 bp (LCR-2) were gel purified. D. Cloning scheme used to generate pInv-H1. The pSUPER construct and the LCR-derived product were digested with PstI and HindIII and ligated together. The original full-length H1 promoter driving expression of the shRNA product in pSUPER has now been replaced with the inverted H1 promoter siRNA cassette.
