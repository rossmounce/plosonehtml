Silencing of DC-SIGN. Total RNA was isolated from 293T cells co-transfected with pcDNA3-DC-SIGN-AU1 and pInv-H1-siDC-SIGN or pcDNA3-DC-SIGN-AU1 and pInv-H1-sip53 and 250 ng analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The data presented is from one out of three experiments comparing pInv-H1-siDC-SIGN to that of pSUPER-siDC-SIGN, with DC-SIGN inhibition ranging from 55â€“85%. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate and standard deviation is shown. B. Silencing of p53. Total RNA was isolated from 293T cells transfected with pInv-H1-sip53 or pInv-H1-siDC-SIGN and 250 ng analyzed by quantitative PCR. The data presented here is from one out of four experiments. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate and standard deviation is shown.</p>
