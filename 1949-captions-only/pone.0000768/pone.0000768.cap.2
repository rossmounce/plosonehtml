                Figure 2.  Annotation of differentially expressed genes.Genes that were differentially expressed by both ND13 and NA10 but not the mutant ND13(N51S) mutant were classified according to involvement in different biological processes. Some genes are classified in more than one category resulting in the total number of genes indicated in the figures being greater than the total number of differentially expressed genes.
