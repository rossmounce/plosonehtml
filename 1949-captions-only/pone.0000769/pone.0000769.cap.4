                Figure 4.  DNA copy number quantification of DCTN3 and IL11-RA genes in prostate cancer cell lines and 20 primary prostate carcinoma samples using quantitative real time PCR.IL-11RA showed a significant increase in gene copy number above normal in CWR22, CWR22-Rv1, DU145HOM and DU145-MN1 and in 15 out of the 20 (75%) prostate cancer samples. For DCTN3, no copy number gain was detected in any cell line and in only 2 out of the 20 (10%) prostate cancer samples. Values above cut off line being assigned as increased gene copy number compared to normal.
