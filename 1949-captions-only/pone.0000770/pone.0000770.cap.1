                Figure 1.  A whole-genome comparison between Y. pestis strains CO92 (top) and CA88 (bottom) using MAUVE.MAUVE found 15 LCBs shared between CO92 and CA88, six of which are inverted and one of which is rearranged. The seven large regions of difference are indicated. Some LCBs are too small to display on this figure and are shown by long diagonal lines connecting the genomes.
