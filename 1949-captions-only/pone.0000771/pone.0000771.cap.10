                Figure 10.  Granger causality analysis between IC-F and IC-RS for the crossmodal task.Post hoc (Tukey HSD) test shows that in the theta band the bottom-up connectivity in the period of 100~200 ms is significantly stronger than that in the baseline (âˆ’100~0 ms). Top-down: Granger causality from IC-F to IC-RS; Bottom-up: Granger causality from IC-RS to IC-F.
