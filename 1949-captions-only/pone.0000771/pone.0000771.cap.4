Dipoles indicating the source of the components are located in medial prefrontal areas (IC-F, upper-right) and somatosensory areas (IC-RS, lower-right) respectively. Image views of the brain for each component are (clockwise from the top-left): sagittal (Sag), coronal (Cor), horizontal (Hori), and three-dimensional (3D). A: anterior; P: posterior; L: left; R: right.</p>
