                Figure 6.  Grand averages of the original ERPs recorded at the electrodes (C4, CP4, and P4) contralateral to the tactile stimulus, and also at those (C3, CP3, and P3) ipsilateral to it.ERP component P45 is shown at those contralateral electrodes. Grand average back-projections of the IC-RS component to those electrodes are also shown, where the projections have the largest peaks. Note those ERP P45 peaks and IC-RS back-projections are similar in both latency and amplitude.
