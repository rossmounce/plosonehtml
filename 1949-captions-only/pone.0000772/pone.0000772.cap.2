Pairwise comparisons conducted in the older cohort of mice showed that differences between groups were greatest in lobes VI (*p = 0.001), IV/V (*p = 0.003), VIII (*p = 0.004), IX (*p = 0.011), and III (*p = 0.036). An ANOVA of the Purkinje cell count data that included both young and old cohorts of mice resulted in a significant main effect of Age (p&lt;0.001) and a significant Age by Genotype interaction (p = 0.003). Other important effects included significant Lobe by Genotype (p = 0.010), and Lobe by Age (p&lt;0.001) interactions. Additional comparisons showed that the older MPS IIIB mice had significantly fewer neurons across the cerebellar lobes compared to the younger MPS IIIB mice (p&lt;0.001, (p&lt;0.006, the Bonferroni corrected value)), while no differences were found between older and younger control mice.</p>
