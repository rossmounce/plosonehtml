                Figure 3.  Locomotor activity records of a representative wild-type and MPS IIIB mouse.Running wheel revolutions per minute (black bars) is plotted for 24 h on each line with subsequent days plotted on the line below. In a light:dark schedule (gray bars show when lights were on), the mutant mice adjusted rhythm to light similar to wild type mice. The mice experienced a series of light:dark, dark:dark, and skeleton photoperiod schedules from ages 70â€“275 days.
