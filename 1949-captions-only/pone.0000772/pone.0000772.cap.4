                Figure 4.  Daily activity in light phase (%) and time (hours) to onset of activity after light offset.MPS IIIB mice had a greater percentage of total activity performed during light phases than the WT mice. MPS IIIB mice also had a longer phase angle of entrainment with a delay in starting daily activity after lights were turned off of &gt;1 hour. Both alterations were present from ages 70 to 225 days.
