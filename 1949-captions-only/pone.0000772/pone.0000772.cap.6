Earliest differences by genotype appear at high frequencies (40 kHz). By 30 wks, high frequency hearing losses due to background deficits in C57BL/6 dominate. Threshold differences at lower test frequencies, apparent after 16 wks, probably reflect mixed cochlear and middle ear pathology. Differences by genotype were significant at all ages (p&lt;.001, 2-way ANOVA).</p>
