                Figure 7.  Middle ear pathology.A. Cross-section of stapes (St) with malleus (M) in WT mouse. B. Higher magnification of rectangular area in A shows thin mucosal lining and regular bone surfaces. C. Analogous view to A in an MPS IIIB mouse at age 30 weeks showing thickened mucosal layer on stapes and malleus (arrow). D. Enlarged view of rectangular area in C showing hyperplasia of mucosal cells (white arrows) and lysosomal storage in osteocytes (black arrowheads). Bone surface is pitted, indicating abnormal bone remodeling. E. Orthogonal view of stapes in a different MPS IIIB mouse showing otitis media with effusion. Note hyperplasia of mucosal cells (white arrow) and infiltrate with inflammatory cells (black arrow). F. Articulation point between incus and malleus in MPS IIIB mouse showing storage in chondrocytes (white arrowheads), hyperplasia and storage in mucosal cells (black arrow), and storage in inflammatory cells (white arrow). SA: Stapedial artery; F: Footplate of stapes; AL: Annular ligament at point of stapes insertion into cochlea; TM: Tympanic membrane.
