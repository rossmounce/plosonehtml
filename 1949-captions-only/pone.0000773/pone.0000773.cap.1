Significant differences were found across groups (Kruskal-Wallis on ranks, H<sub>(2,90)</sub> = 37.617, p&lt;0.001) where letters (A, B, C) denote significant differences using a post-hoc test (Tukey, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (B) Hyperthermic failure of evoked excitatory junction potential (EJP) failure (see inset) at the NMJ N&gt;5 for all genotype and treatment combinations. Decreased thermotolerance of evoked synaptic transmission correlated with genotype (<em>for<sup>s2</sup></em>&gt;<em>for<sup>s</sup></em>&gt;<em>for<sup>R</sup></em> for thermotolerance), where significant differences were found across treatment groups (Two Way ANOVA, F<sub>(5,118)</sub> = 175.20, p&lt;0.001). The involvement of PKG activity in thermotolerance was confirmed using pharmacological agents to activate PKG (40 µM 8-Bromo cGMP), inhibit PKG (1 µM KT5823) or inhibit a PKG phosphorylation target PP2A (1 µM Cantharidin). A combination of 8-Bromo cGMP and Cantharidin was also used, demonstrating that Cantharidin likely acts downstream of PKG activation. The three genotypes did not differ after being treated with a prior heat shock of 36°C for 1 hour and a 30 minute recovery. Letters in histogram bars represent statistical groupings using a post-hoc test, whereby bars with different letters are significantly different (Tukey, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). Error bars represent SEM.</p>
