                Figure 1.  Hyperthermic failure of both behavior and NMJ synaptic transmission in 3rd instar forR, fors and fors2 Drosophila melanogaster larvae.(A) Temperature at behavioral failure of mouth hook movement significantly differed between larvae with different for genotypes, forR failed at 37.2°C±0.3 (N = 30), fors failed at 39.2°C±10.4 (N = 30) and fors2 failed at 41.2°C±0.3 (N = 30). Significant differences were found across groups (Kruskal-Wallis on ranks, H(2,90) = 37.617, p&lt;0.001) where letters (A, B, C) denote significant differences using a post-hoc test (Tukey, p&lt;0.05). (B) Hyperthermic failure of evoked excitatory junction potential (EJP) failure (see inset) at the NMJ N&gt;5 for all genotype and treatment combinations. Decreased thermotolerance of evoked synaptic transmission correlated with genotype (fors2&gt;fors&gt;forR for thermotolerance), where significant differences were found across treatment groups (Two Way ANOVA, F(5,118) = 175.20, p&lt;0.001). The involvement of PKG activity in thermotolerance was confirmed using pharmacological agents to activate PKG (40 µM 8-Bromo cGMP), inhibit PKG (1 µM KT5823) or inhibit a PKG phosphorylation target PP2A (1 µM Cantharidin). A combination of 8-Bromo cGMP and Cantharidin was also used, demonstrating that Cantharidin likely acts downstream of PKG activation. The three genotypes did not differ after being treated with a prior heat shock of 36°C for 1 hour and a 30 minute recovery. Letters in histogram bars represent statistical groupings using a post-hoc test, whereby bars with different letters are significantly different (Tukey, p&lt;0.05). Error bars represent SEM.
