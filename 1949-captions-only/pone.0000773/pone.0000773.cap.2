Note the ventilatory arrhythmias prior to failure. At failure, temperature was allowed to return to room temperature and time to recovery was recorded. Note that the ventilatory motor pattern after recovery is at a lower frequency just prior to failure because the temperature is lower. (B) Three separate experiments were performed to examine the pharmacological effects of i) PKG and PKA inhibitors ii) PP2A inhibitor and iii) PKG activator and PKG activator coupled with the PP2A inhibitor. (B i) Reduction in PKG activity (1 µM KT5823) increased the thermotolerance of neural function as strongly as a prior heat shock treatment during hyperthermia, whereas PKA inhibition (1 µM Rp-cAMP) had no effect. Significant treatment effects were found (ANOVA F<sub>(4,31)</sub> = 18.71, p&lt;0.001; N&gt;4 for all treatments) where letters (A, B, C) denote significant differences using a post-hoc test (Tukey, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (B ii) Reduction of PP2A activity (1 µM Cantharidin) also increased the thermotolerance of neural function during hyperthermia where significant treatment effects were found (ANOVA F<sub>(3,31)</sub> = 4.60, p&lt;0.001; N&gt;6 for all treatments). (B iii) Activation of PKG using 40 µM 8-Bromo cGMP did not increase the thermotolerance of the circuit, but abolished the protective effects of heat shock preconditioning. Moreover, the PP2A inhibitor Cantharidin counteracted the effect of 8-Bromo cGMP in HS animals thereby inducing maximal thermotolerance. Significant treatment effects were found (ANOVA F<sub>(4,41)</sub> = 9.60, p&lt;0.001; N&gt;6 for all treatments). (C) Recovery time of the motor pattern upon return to room temperature showed corresponding differences in the same treatment groups (short recovery times associated with high failure temperatures in B). Here too significant differences were found across treatments: i) ANOVA F<sub>(4,31)</sub> = 7.62, p&lt;0.001, N&gt;4; ii) ANOVA F<sub>(3,32)</sub> = 19.65, p&lt;0.001, N&gt;6; iii) ANOVA F<sub>(4,41)</sub> = 4.78, p&lt;0.001, N&gt;6, Letters in histogram bars represent statistical groupings whereby bars with different letters are significantly different using a post-hoc test (Tukey, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). Error bars represent SEM.</p>
