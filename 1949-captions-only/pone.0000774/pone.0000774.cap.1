                Figure 1.  Vp16-Jazz and its DNA target sequence.A: Schematic representation of the Vp16-Jazz gene in the pMex-vector, used to generate transgenic mice. The 9 base pair long Vp16-Jazz DNA target sequence is indicated. B: The nucleotide sequence of the mouse utrophin promoter A. The Vp16-Jazz DNA target sequence is indicated in bold characters and underlined. The main transcription factor binding sites present in this promoter region are indicated.
