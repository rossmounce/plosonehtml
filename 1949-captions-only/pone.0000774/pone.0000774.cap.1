The 9 base pair long Vp16-Jazz DNA target sequence is indicated. B: The nucleotide sequence of the mouse utrophin promoter A. The Vp16-Jazz DNA target sequence is indicated in bold characters and underlined. The main transcription factor binding sites present in this promoter region are indicated.</p>
