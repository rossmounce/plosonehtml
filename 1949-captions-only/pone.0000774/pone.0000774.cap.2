                Figure 2.  Muscle specific expression of Vp16-Jazz in transgenic mice.A: Western Blot analysis of total proteins extracted from the skeletal muscle of wild type (wt) and transgenic mice derived from two different founders (tg9 and tg41). The expression of Vp16-Jazz transgene was monitored by the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 antibody. Detection of α−tubulin was used to normalize the amount of proteins. B: Western Blot analysis of total proteins extracted from the skeletal muscle, heart and brain of transgenic mice from families tg9 and tg41.
