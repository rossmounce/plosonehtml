The expression of Vp16-Jazz transgene was monitored by the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 antibody. Detection of α−tubulin was used to normalize the amount of proteins. B: Western Blot analysis of total proteins extracted from the skeletal muscle, heart and brain of transgenic mice from families tg9 and tg41.</p>
