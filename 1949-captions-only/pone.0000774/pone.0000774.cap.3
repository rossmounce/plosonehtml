Immunoprecipitates from each sample were analyzed for the presence of utrophin promoter by PCR. A sample representing linear amplification of the total input chromatin (input) was included (lane 1). As control, samples from transgenic mice were also tested for the presence of dystrophin promoter sequence. B: Real-time PCR analysis of the utrophin gene expression rate in Vp16-Jazz transgenic mice (tg9 and tg41) and control wt mice. The gene expression ratio between utrophin and β-glucoronidase (GUS) and β2-microglobulin (β2M) is shown as means±S.D. from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. C: Western blot of total protein extracts derived from skeletal muscle and heart from wt mice and Vp16-Jazz transgenic mice (tg9 and tg41) incubated with monoclonal antibody against utrophin. The same membrane was incubated with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody for loading normalization. D: Relative utrophin expression of wt and transgenic mice (tg9 and tg41) was determined by densitometric analysis. E: Total protein extracts from skeletal muscle of wt and transgenic mice (tg9 and tg41) were subjected to immunoblotting to detect the expression levels of the dystrophin and α-sarcoglycan proteins. The anti-α-tubulin and anti-myc antibodies were used to normalize the protein content and to test the Vp16-Jazz transgene expression respectively.</p>
