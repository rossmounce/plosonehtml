Nuclei are counterstained with Hoechst 33258. C: TA from wt and transgenic mice tg9 were co-stained with anti-utrophin antibody and the α-bungarotoxin-Alexa Fluor to visualize the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junctions. The anti-utrophin monoclonal antibody reveals an extra-synaptic distribution of utrophin only in transgenic mice. D: Relationship between contractile response (g) and stimulation frequency (Volts) in diaphragm and EDL muscle preparations obtained from wt, tg9 and tg41 mice. E: Scatter plots of the DEG with natural log transformed expression values averaged over the 4 replicates. The x–axis reports the mean of the replicates of transgenic mice, while the y-axis is the mean across the replicates of the control wt mice. Expression values are colour coded with red representing up-regulated genes in tg9/tg41 and green down-regulated genes compared to wild-type and lines on the graph set at 2-folds differential expression.</p>
