                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic relationships based on partitioned Bayesian inference of the maxgen alignment (164466 nt) and a GTR+4Î“+I model of sequence evolution.The partitioning are according to four evolutionary rate classes and codon positions. The model parameters are estimated separate for every partitioning.
