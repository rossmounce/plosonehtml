                Figure 1.  Identify time period required for preparation from specification to differentiation during midgut development.Left: the characteristic analysis at 29–40 pfh and 40–50 pfh. The characteristic equation (Table 1) shows when repressive effect of R and Otx together occurs; Right: 29–40 pfh(red bar) and 40–50 pfh (blue bar) are corresponding time periods in the control profile. Given that UI, R and Otx are activated at 29–40 pfh, only UI drives the state transition from 012 state: R and Otx are independent of the state transition. However, at 40–50 pfh (UI, R and Otx remain activated), the characteristic equation consists of the AND logic (ROtx)' which indicates that (ROtx)' is repressive: activation of R and Otx cooperatively prevent the state rises from 102 to 112 since (ROtx)' generates q0,t+1 = 0 when R = 1 and Otx = 1. Further analysis of Otx mutation (Table 3) shows R has no effect on any state transition suggesting that R is a silencer to Otx at 40–50 pfh (main text).
