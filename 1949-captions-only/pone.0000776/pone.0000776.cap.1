The characteristic equation (<a href="#pone-0000776-t001">Table 1</a>) shows when repressive effect of R and Otx together occurs; <em>Right</em>: 29–40 pfh(red bar) and 40–50 pfh (blue bar) are corresponding time periods in the control profile. Given that UI, R and Otx are activated at 29–40 pfh, only UI drives the state transition from 01<sub>2</sub> state: R and Otx are independent of the state transition. However, at 40–50 pfh (UI, R and Otx remain activated), the characteristic equation consists of the AND logic (<em>ROtx</em>)' which indicates that <em>(ROtx)'</em> is repressive: activation of <em>R</em> and <em>Otx</em> cooperatively prevent the state rises from 10<sub>2</sub> to 11<sub>2</sub> since (<em>ROtx</em>)' generates <em>q<sub>0,t+1</sub></em> = 0 when <em>R</em> = 1 and <em>Otx</em> = 1. Further analysis of Otx mutation (<a href="#pone-0000776-t003">Table 3</a>) shows R has no effect on any state transition suggesting that R is a silencer to Otx at 40–50 pfh (main text).</p>
