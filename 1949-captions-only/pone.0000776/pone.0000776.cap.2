                Figure 2.  Overviews of SLM and analyses.Step 1. Obtain temporal transcriptional activation and corresponding time-series expression data; Step 2. SLM Mapping: Dicretization and digitization into time-series bar chart; Step 3. Truth table construction: tabulate the digitized data into present states, input conditions and next states; Step 4. Mathematical mapping: Characteristic equation analysis and time simulation analysis; Step 5. Network motifs construction: integration of multiple SLMs to form gene network model.
