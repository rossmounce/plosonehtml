(B) <em>In silico</em> mutagenesis of R is achieved by providing input series with <em>R</em> is always set to 0. State transition to differentiation expression level occurred early at 40–50 pfh. The rest of the state transition beside 40–50 pfh is same as <a href="#pone-0000776-g003">Figure 3(A)</a>. (C) <em>In silico</em> mutagenesis with Otx as the only input condition; the state transitions are generated to show similar expression profile to that of A-Bp·CAT ((<a href="#pone.0000776.s003">Figure S1 (A)</a>)</p>
