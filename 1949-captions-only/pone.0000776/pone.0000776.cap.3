                Figure 3.  Forward mapping and in silico mutagenesis of endo16 SLM.(A) Discretized profile of BA-Bp·CAT at 0–50 and 61–72 pfh are reproduced by forward mapping. (B) In silico mutagenesis of R is achieved by providing input series with R is always set to 0. State transition to differentiation expression level occurred early at 40–50 pfh. The rest of the state transition beside 40–50 pfh is same as Figure 3(A). (C) In silico mutagenesis with Otx as the only input condition; the state transitions are generated to show similar expression profile to that of A-Bp·CAT ((Figure S1 (A))
