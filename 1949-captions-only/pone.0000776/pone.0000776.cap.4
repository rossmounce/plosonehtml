                Figure 4.  Synthetic model for activation of E and A inputs.(A) Only exhibits basal expression without binding of transcription factors. (B) Binding of transcriptional activator on activation site increase the expression level. (C) Binding of another activator on enhancer does not alter expression level. (D) Expression level is highly elevated in comparing to (B) when both activator site and enhancer are bound.
