                Figure 5.  Construction of sequential logic mapping between dynamic transactivity and a state transition.State (expression level) is represented by the two binary numbers, q1,t+1q0,t+1. (A) Activation of E and A inputs (E = 1, A = 1) generates the state transition from 012 to 102. The mapping between the activation of EA sites (Transcriptional activity) and the state transition (Gene expression)) is established by q1,t+1 = q1'q0EA and q1,t+1 = 0, where minterm (AND logic), q1'q0EA is 1 only if q1 = 0, q0 = 1, E = 1 and A = 1. (B) The mapping between input (E = 0, A = 1) and the state transition from 112 to 102 is established by q1,t+1 = q1q0E'A and q0,t+1 = 0, where minterm q1q0E'A is 1 only if q1 = 1, q0 = 1, E = 0 and A = 1.
