                Figure 6.  Identification of dynamic functional activities of transcriptional inputs for EA model (Eq. (3)). Function of identical transcription factor binding activity is not unique over time due to the dynamic nature. Left: characteristic equation analyses; Right: Colours (red and blue) indicate state transitions corresponding to the analyses. From Left, characteristic equation of the model at 012 present state indicates that while E and A sites are activated, E has no effect in the state transition from t3 to t4. The next state is generated by the characteristic equation q1,t+1 = A and q0,t+1 = 0, in which there is no E variable, i.e., E is independent of the state transition. The characteristic equation at 102 present state, q1,t+1 = E and q0,t+1 = EA shows that E is only functioning as enhancer at time t = t8 (see Right) when present state equals to 102 provided that A = 1. This example shows characteristic equation analysis can reveal when the enhancer function of E site occurs. (see conditional effect in Methods).
