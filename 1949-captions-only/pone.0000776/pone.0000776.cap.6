(3)). Function of identical transcription factor binding activity is not unique over time due to the dynamic nature. <em>Left</em>: characteristic equation analyses; <em>Right</em>: Colours (red and blue) indicate state transitions corresponding to the analyses. From Left, characteristic equation of the model at 01<sub>2</sub> present state indicates that while E and A sites are activated, E has no effect in the state transition from t<sub>3</sub> to t<sub>4</sub>. The next state is generated by the characteristic equation <em>q<sub>1,t+1</sub></em> = <em>A</em> and <em>q<sub>0,t+1</sub></em> = 0, in which there is no <em>E</em> variable, i.e., E is independent of the state transition. The characteristic equation at 10<sub>2</sub> present state, <em>q<sub>1,t+1</sub></em> = <em>E</em> and <em>q<sub>0,t+1</sub></em> = <em>EA</em> shows that E is only functioning as enhancer at time <em>t</em> = t<sub>8</sub> (see Right) when present state equals to 10<sub>2</sub> provided that <em>A</em> = 1. This example shows characteristic equation analysis can reveal <em>when</em> the enhancer function of E site occurs. (see conditional effect in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>).</p>
