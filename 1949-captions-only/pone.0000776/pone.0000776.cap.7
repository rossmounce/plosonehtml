                Figure 7.  In silico mutagenesis: comparison of wild type and mutant expression profiles with 3 models.(A) EA model shows E is an enhancer; (B) SEA model shows E is a synergistic enhancer and (C) CEA model reveals E is a synergistic enhancer as well as silencer. Figure 7 also shows when those effects of the E site occur. Wild type profiles: (A)–(C) are generated by Eq. (3), (4) and (5) with given input condition: EtAt = (102 002 012 112 102 002 012 112 112 012 002 002), where t = t0–t11. The corresponding mutant profiles are obtained by setting Et = 0 in input condition.
