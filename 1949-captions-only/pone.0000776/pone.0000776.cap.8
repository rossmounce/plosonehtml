                Figure 8.  Construction of state map representation and reverse mapping of EA model.(A) The state transition map (finite state machine), constructed using truth table (Table 5), consists of four states (purple circles), 10 state transitions (in arrow) and 16 input conditions (binary values associated to each arrow). (B) Using the state transition map in (a) the temporal binding activity corresponding digitized gene expression profile (002 012 102 102 112 112 112 112 002 002 002 002) is inferred (reverse mapping). There are 11 state transitions in 12 time steps. Following the 12 arrows in state transition map, there are 2 possible inputs (01, 11) for each of the first two transitions (002→012→102), 1 possible input for the next five transitions and 2 possible inputs for the final four transitions. In total, 64 possible combinations of input series are suggested where these input series are able to generate expression profile given by forward mapping.
