                Figure 9.  Construction of gene network via SLMs: Synthetic network motifs.(A)–(D) Four sets of SLMs that resemble four fundamental units are considered for construction of multiple gene network motifs (Table 9): EA/SEA models (positive regulation, set 1); Silencer-activator (SA)/Synergistic SA models (repressive regulation, set 2); By considering input condition of E site for set 1 as a function of its output state, an auto-regulative positive feedback is constructed; we denote this set as Simple positive feedback (set 3). Similarly, a silencer version of unit network motif for auto-regulative feedback, Simple negative feedback, is formed by considering input condition of S site for set 2 as a function of its output state (set 4). (E)–(I) To extend the single SLM approach to genes network, several combinations of two SLMs representing two genes, each regulated by two cis-acting sites are constructed based on the four set of fundamental units albeit with auto-regulative feedback replaced by inter-genetic feedback control (Table 9). In addition, all of these combinations are co-regulated networks with common activator site (A/A1). A co-regulated network is defined as set of genes that contained at least one common active cis-acting site. The simplest form of co-regulated network occurred when no direct connectivity found between two SLMs where Both Gene1 and Gene2 are linked by their common regulatory sites: E and A ((E)). Non-auto-regulative feedforward and feedback control can occur if Gene1 and Gene2 are connected by at least one of the gene product. Thus, in addition to intra-genetic-feedback control that happened in single SLM ((C)–(D)), network motifs constructed by multiple SLMs can exhibit inter-genetic-feedforward and feedback control. In inter-genetic-feedback control, the input condition of a SLM is now a function of output state from another SLM. Given that output signal from Gene2 is function as feedback signal onto Gene1, the input condition of Gene1, X1, is defined as a function of output state of Gene2: X1 = X1(q1,t+1,Gene2, q0,t+1, Gene2) where X1 can be either an enhancer or an silencer Gene1 ((H)–(I)). Inter-genetic-feedforward control is defined similarly to inter-feedback control where X2 = X2(q1,t+1,Gene1, q0,t+1, Gene1) since we consider output signal from Gene1 to be the feedforward signal onto Gene2 ((F)–(G)).
