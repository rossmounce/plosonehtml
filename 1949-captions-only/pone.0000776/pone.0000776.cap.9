Similarly, a silencer version of unit network motif for auto-regulative feedback, Simple negative feedback, is formed by considering input condition of S site for set 2 as a function of its output state (set 4). (E)–(I) To extend the single SLM approach to genes network, several combinations of two SLMs representing two genes, each regulated by two <em>cis</em>-acting sites are constructed based on the four set of fundamental units albeit with auto-regulative feedback replaced by inter-genetic feedback control (<a href="#pone-0000776-t009">Table 9</a>). In addition, all of these combinations are co-regulated networks with common activator site (A/A1). A co-regulated network is defined as set of genes that contained at least one common active <em>cis</em>-acting site. The simplest form of co-regulated network occurred when no direct connectivity found between two SLMs where Both <em>Gene1</em> and <em>Gene2</em> are linked by their common regulatory sites: E and A ((E)). Non-auto-regulative feedforward and feedback control can occur if <em>Gene1</em> and <em>Gene2</em> are connected by at least one of the gene product. Thus, in addition to intra-genetic-feedback control that happened in single SLM ((C)–(D)), network motifs constructed by multiple SLMs can exhibit inter-genetic-feedforward and feedback control. In inter-genetic-feedback control, the input condition of a SLM is now a function of output state from another SLM. Given that output signal from <em>Gene2</em> is function as feedback signal onto <em>Gene1</em>, the input condition of <em>Gene1</em>, <em>X</em>1, is defined as a function of output state of <em>Gene2</em>: <em>X</em>1 = <em>X</em>1(<em>q<sub>1,t+1,Gene2</sub></em>, <em>q<sub>0,t+1, Gene2</sub></em>) where <em>X1</em> can be either an enhancer or an silencer <em>Gene1</em> ((H)–(I)). Inter-genetic-feedforward control is defined similarly to inter-feedback control where <em>X</em>2 = <em>X</em>2(<em>q<sub>1,t+1,Gene1</sub></em>, <em>q<sub>0,t+1, Gene1</sub></em>) since we consider output signal from <em>Gene1</em> to be the feedforward signal onto <em>Gene2</em> ((F)–(G)).</p>
