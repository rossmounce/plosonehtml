                Figure 3.  Double staining images after spectral imaging.A: FOXP3 (green) and CD3 (red) in atherosclerotic intima. Nuclei are depicted in blue. Inset shows double stained cell. Note nuclear staining of transcription factor FOXP3 and cytoplasmatic CD3 positivity; B: GITR (green) and CD3 (red) in atherosclerotic intima. Inset shows one double and one single stained cell; C: GITR (green) and CD3 (red) in atherosclerotic adventitia. GITR positive cells do not co-express CD3. D: GITR (green) and CD20 (red). No double stained cells. E: GITR (green) and CD138 (red). Inset shows double stained cells. F: GITR (green) and CD68 (red). No double stained cells.
