                Figure 5.  Treg in atherosclerotic tissue compared to normal skin and inflammatory dermatoses.Frequency of FOXP3 (A) and GITR (B) positive T cells in atherosclerotic and dermal specimens. Values are expressed as percentage (Â±SD) of the total number of T lymphocytes. The frequency of Treg in atherosclerotic intima and adventitia are significantly lower compared to both normal skin as well as a panel of inflammatory dermatoses (psoriasis, spongiotic dermatitis and lichen planus). **: P&lt;0.005
