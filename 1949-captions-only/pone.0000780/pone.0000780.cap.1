                Figure 1.  P-31 NMR spectra of male and female gills.Two P-31 NMR spectra of primary lamellae of female gill (A) and male gill (B) inserted into 5 mm NMR tubes without deuterium oxide as a “lock” solvent. Signals near 0 ppm are orthophosphate and its esters. The male's UPC is clearly separated from orthophosphates because of its significant down-field chemical shift. Signals from phospholipid and phosphorus incorporated in large polymers are extremely broadened and thus not readily observable in whole tissue. Phosphorus signals from low molecular weight compounds dissolved in tissue fluids are free to move and thus are readily observable. Typically the UPC represents a high percentage of the observable P-31 signals in males.
