The remaining solid was then vigorously blended with water to extract the Low Molecular Weight Fraction (LOMWF). The remaining solid was digested with concentrated hydrochloric acid at 104 degrees C for 24 hours to hydrolyze any phosphorus incorporated into high molecular weight polymers. This hydrolysis yields small soluble phosphorus compounds observable by P-31 NMR. Any AEP incorporated into polymers would be released as free AEP. Free AEP is not effected by this drastic hydrolysis procedure.</p>
