                Figure 2.  Flow diagram of gill extraction procedure.Flow diagram of gill tissue fractionation using vigorous blending with the solvent (chloroform:methanol 2:1) to extract the Lipid Fraction (LF). The remaining solid was then vigorously blended with water to extract the Low Molecular Weight Fraction (LOMWF). The remaining solid was digested with concentrated hydrochloric acid at 104 degrees C for 24 hours to hydrolyze any phosphorus incorporated into high molecular weight polymers. This hydrolysis yields small soluble phosphorus compounds observable by P-31 NMR. Any AEP incorporated into polymers would be released as free AEP. Free AEP is not effected by this drastic hydrolysis procedure.
