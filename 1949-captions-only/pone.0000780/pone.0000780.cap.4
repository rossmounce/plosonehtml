It presents the P-31 NMR analyses of male and female intact gills with males represented by blue squares and females by red circles . The percentage of AEP for each blue crab was determined by dividing the integral of the AEP signal by the total integral from all observed P-31 signals from that crab. Only 2 of the 33 female crabs had any measurable AEP present. One of these female gills underwent a parallel fractionation with a male gill. See <a href="#pone-0000780-g005">Figure 5</a>.</p>
