Panels (A) and (D) present the lipid extract. Panels (B) and (E) present the low molecular weight aqueous extract. Panels (C) and (F) show small phosphorus compounds released by the acid hydrolysis of the high molecular weight aqueous fraction. The lipid extract (chloroform:methanol 2:1) from the female (A) and male (D) show the expected phospholipids. The low MW aqueous extraction from the female (B) has the expected orthophosphate and its esters (0 to 4 ppm) and also containing a small amount of AEP. This spectrum documents that there was nothing within intact female gill masking the appearance of AEP from P-31 NMR. The addition of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, a polyvalent metallic cation chelating agent, did not alter the relative amount of AEP observed. This demonstrated that AEP was not “hidden” as a precipitate by being bound to metallic polyvalent cations. The low MW aqueous extract from the male (E) contains an extremely high percentage of AEP. Both high MW hydrolyzates show that AEP is not “hidden” by being incorporated into a high molecular weight polymer in females (C) or in males (F). This fraction is composed of orthophosphate (1 ppm) and unhydrolyzed phosphate monoesters (−6 ppm). The vast percentage of male gill AEP is present in the low molecular weight aqueous extract.</p>
