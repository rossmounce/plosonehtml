                Figure 6.  P-31 NMR spectra of aqueous extracts from the gynandromorph female and male side gills.The rare gynandromorph blue crab offered a unique opportunity to compare male and female gills from a single crab. Any differences between male and female side gills are caused by inherent biochemical differences between the sexes not a difference in the crab's diet or habitat. P-31 NMR spectra were obtained from aqueous extracts from male and female side gills, lyphilized to dryness then dissolved in a dilute solution of trisodiium ethylenediaminetetraacetate in deuterium oxide. Only two P-31 NMR signals were seen in each extract, orthophosphate and AEP. AEP on the female side A represented only 3% of the phosphorus signals. The male side gill B had 21% of its phosphorus signals in AEP. Because AEP is normally found distributed throughout the male's tissues, it was not surprising that some AEP had been incorporated into the female gill.
