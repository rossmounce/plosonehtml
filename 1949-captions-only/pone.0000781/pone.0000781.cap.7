                Figure 7.  Volcano plots from FDR corrected t-tests of statistical significance (vertical axis) against magnitude of expression change (horizontal axis), where each point corresponds to a gene/transcript.Expression change (fold-change) is defined as a log2-transformed ratio of mean nonhybrid to mean hybrid expression level. (A) Xenopus laevis vs. Hybrids; (B) Xenpous muelleri vs. Hybrids. The red line denotes FDR adjusted alpha 0.05. The horizontal deviation from 0 towards the right or left reflects hybrid underexpression or overexpression, respectively.
