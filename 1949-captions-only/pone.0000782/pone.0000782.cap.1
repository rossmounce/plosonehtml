                Figure 1.  UV-induced germ cell death in adult starlet sea anemones.A The immunofluorescence image depicts the germ cell compartment of the mesenteria in a transverse section of an adult polyp. The epithelium of the body column consisting of ectoderm and endoderm is visible in the lower left corner. TUNEL staining (green) indicates the number of apoptotic cells in the mesenteria of adult polyps after 1200 J/m2 UV irradiation. Massive fragmentation of genomic DNA is detected in the germ cell compartment, whereas only few TUNEL positive cells were visible in the epithelium. Genomic DNA is stained with propidium iodide (red). Scale bar 150 µm. B Cell death in the germ cell compartment was quantified following different doses of UV irradiation by counting all TUNEL-positive gametes versus the total number of gametes. Error bars: standard deviation; * equals P&lt;0.05, ** equals P&lt;0.01, *** equals P&lt;0.001. C Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) with whole protein lysates of irradiated (UV- or γ-IR) or non-irradiated adult N. vectensis polyps revealed DNA-binding activity for the canonical p53 binding sequence. Lysate was either incubated with a radioactively labeled control oligonucleotide with random DNA sequence (left section of the EMSA) or with a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus p53 DNA binding sequence (right section of the EMSA). Two different protein complexes (arrow and arrowhead) were detected using whole animal lysates from adult polyps when incubated with the p53 DNA binding sequence encoding oligonucleotide. SAOS-2 cells transfected with human TAp63α or vector only were analyzed in parallel as controls.
