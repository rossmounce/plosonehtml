                Figure 2.  Protein sequence comparisons of the DNA binding domains of the human and N. vectensis p53 protein family.A Protein sequence comparison of the DNA binding domain sequences between the human (hu) and N. vectensis p53 protein family (nv). Black circles indicate all amino acids with direct contact to DNA identified in human p53 and black rectangles mark amino acids that complex a zinc atom. All of these amino acids are conserved in all N. vectensis p53 paralogs. B Protein sequence identities of the DNA binding domain within the p53 protein family of the species H. sapiens and N. vectensis are depicted. The thick double arrow indicates the range of protein sequence identities of all possible cross species sequence comparisons.
