Black circles indicate all amino acids with direct contact to DNA identified in human p53 and black rectangles mark amino acids that complex a zinc atom. All of these amino acids are conserved in all <em>N. vectensis</em> p53 paralogs. B Protein sequence identities of the DNA binding domain within the p53 protein family of the species <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>N. vectensis</em> are depicted. The thick double arrow indicates the range of protein sequence identities of all possible cross species sequence comparisons.</p>
