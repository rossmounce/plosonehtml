                Figure 4.  Nvp63 localizes to gametes.A–G Non-radioactive in situ hybridization revealed nvp63 expression in mesenterial gametes. A Adult N. vectensis polyps were sectioned longitudinally in the middle of the body column. B The Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&amp;E) of the boxed region in A depicts the three prominent tissues in anthozoa: Ectoderm (ec) and entoderm (en) are separated by a mesoglea (mg). The mesenteria (me) reside within the body cavitiy of the polyps. C Strong hybridization of the antisense riboprobe was observed within mesenteria (region according to boxed area in B). D The hybridization signal was absent in serial sections incubated with the corresponding sense probe. Higher magnification of nvp63-positive cells indicated that a sub-population of larger, nearly round cells (E) express high levels of nvp63 (F), which is absent in control hybridizations (G). Arrows indicate round shaped gametes. Scale bars: A 0.5 cm; C,D 50 µm; E–G 10 µm.
