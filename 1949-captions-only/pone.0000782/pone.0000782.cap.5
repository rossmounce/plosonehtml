                Figure 5.  Nvp63 cDNA sequence.The mRNA for nvp63 comprises 158 bp of 5′-untranslated region with an in-frame stop codon preceding the start-methionine, a coding DNA sequence of 1485 bp (495 amino acids) length, and 1200 bp of 3′ UTR terminated by a polyadenylation signal. The open reading frame encoding the nvp63 protein is underlined in red. The stop codon preceding the open reading frame in the 5′ UTR and the putative polyadenylation signal at the end of the 3′ UTR are boxed.
