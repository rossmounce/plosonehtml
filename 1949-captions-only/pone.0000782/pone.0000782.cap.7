Lysates of SAOS-2 cells transfected with myc-tagged nvp63, TAp63α, or TAp63γ were incubated with biotinylated DNA encoding the canonical p53 binding sequence or random sequence. DNA-protein complexes bound to streptavidin were detected with an anti-myc-tag antibody. The value determined for the binding to the random DNA sequence was subtracted from the value obtained for the binding to the p53 binding sequence for each protein lysate. All obtained values are normalized to control. The dashed line indicates the signal obtained for the lysate with the random DNA sequence and the signal obtained with the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence. B Co-transfection of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing several repeats of the canonical p53 binding sequence allowed the determination of the level of nvp63-mediated transactivation. The mutation R190A in nvp63 abolished while the deletion of the C-terminal 34 amino acids (ΔC) induced reporter gene transcription. A schematic depicts the nvp63 protein and mutated variants. The transactivation domain (TAD), the DNA binding domain (DBD), the oligomerization domain (OD), and the transactivation inhibitory domain (TID) are boxed in yellow, red, green and light grey respectively. The black triangle and bar in the DNA binding domain indicates the position of the point mutation (R190A). C UV irradiation (1200 J/m<sup>2</sup>) of nvp63 expressing SAOS-2 cells increased the transactivation ability of nvp63. The fold induction in nvp63-transfected SAOS-2 cells is normalized to controls.</p>
