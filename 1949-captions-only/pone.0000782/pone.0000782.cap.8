Subsequently, protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting. B Western blots depict the expression of nvvasa, nvGAPDH, and nvβ-actin after treatment of adult polyps with the indicated siRNA. Bar graphs indicate the amount of expression relative to cytoplasmic β-actin and after normalization to the scrambeled siRNA value. C Nvvasa1 is efficiently suppressed by RNA interference in the experimental setup. Adult polyps were incubated with a non-vasa siRNAs, a mixture of nvvasa1 and nvvasa2 siRNAs in equal amounts, or with nvvasa1 siRNAs or nvvasa2 siRNAs alone. The relative signal intensities normalized to nvGAPDH are visualized in the bar graphs below the Western blot signals. D Quantitative RT-PCR determined the knock down of nvp63 mRNA in adult polyps by the siRNA nvp63si1. The amount of nvp63 mRNA was normalized to nv18S-rRNA expression. E UV-induced apoptosis was determined at 12 J/m<sup>2</sup> after incubation of adult polyps with the siRNAs indicated. Nvp63 specific siRNAs suppressed UV-irradiation induced death of gametes. * equals P&lt;0.05, ** equals P&lt;0.01. F Cell death was detected by TUNEL staining (green) on mesenterial tissue sections from adult polyps incubated with either scrambled siRNA or nvp63 specific siRNAs. Genomic DNA was visualized with Hoechst 3342 (colored in red).</p>
