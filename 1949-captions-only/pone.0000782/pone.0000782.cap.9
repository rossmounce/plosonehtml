                Figure 9.  UV exposure in tidal marshes strongly depends on the sea level.The schematic qualitatively depicts the fluctuations in UV exposure for N. vectensis as a function of the sea level. Most of the DNA-damaging UV light drops within the first 1â€“2 meters to about 10% of UV irradiation present at the water surface. DNA damage caused by UV-irradiation decreases by several magnitudes within the first meters of coastal sea water.
