(A, B) CAP-H is not detected in early prophase. (C, D) In early prometaphase, condensing chromosomes show a faint and diffuse CAP-H labeling, but some bright accumulations (arrowheads) are observed on them. (E, F) In late prometaphase, CAP-H is detected as a single axis (arrows) running along and inside chromosomes. Note that the ends of these CAP-H axes (arrowheads) are brighter than the own axes. (G, H) Top view of a metaphase cell showing a ‘rosette’-like chromosome distribution. In these views a single CAP-H axis is seen in each chromosome. The centromeric (red arrowheads) and distal (white arrowheads) axes ends are brightly stained. (I–L) Lateral views of metaphase cells. In these views each chromosome shows two parallel CAP-H axes (arrows), one per sister chromatid. The centromeric (red arrowheads) and distal (white arrowheads) axes ends appear brightly stained. (M–P) Two different focal planes throughout an anaphase. A single CAP-H axis (arrows) is present inside each chromatid. In (F), (L) and (P) the CAP-H labeling on one chromosome/chromatid has been pseudocolored in red and superimposed on its corresponding DAPI image. Bar, 5 µm.</p>
