                Figure 3.  CAP-H distribution in meiosis II spermatocytes.Mouse spermatocytes were stained for CAP-H (green) and counterstained with DAPI (blue). (A, B) Late interkinesis nucleus. CAP-H appears at several nucleoli (nu) and as small spots in the nucleoplasm. (C, D) Prophase II spermatocyte. A diffuse CAP-H labeling, and bright spots, are observed along chromosomes. (E–H) Two different focal planes of a metaphase II spermatocyte. Bright CAP-H spots are present at chromosome ends. (I, J) Selected metaphase II chromosome. Each chromatid shows two CAP-H spots, one at the centromeric end (red arrowheads) and one at its distal end (white arrowhead). (K, L) Selected segregating chromatids in early anaphase II. Both chromatids present a CAP-H axis and one spot at each axis end. (M–O) Two focal planes of a late anaphase II spermatocyte. Each chromatid exhibits a single diffuse CAP-H axis between the centromeric and distal ends spots. In (B) and (L) the CAP-H labeling has been pseudocolored in red and superimposed on its corresponding DAPI image. Bars: (A–H, M–O) 5 µm; (I–L) 3 µm.
