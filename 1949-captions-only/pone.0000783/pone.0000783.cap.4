                Figure 4.  CAP-H accumulates preferentially at telomere complexes.Selected bivalents and chromosomes were stained for CAP-H (green), kinetochores revealed by an ACA serum (pink), TRF1 (red), and counterstained with DAPI (blue). (A) Metaphase I bivalent. A pair of CAP-H dots at the centromere region of each chromosome is below the closely associated sister kinetochores. (B) Metaphase II chromosome. The separated CAP-H spots at the centromere region appear below the kinetochores. (C) Metaphase I bivalent and (D) anaphase I half-bivalent. The CAP-H dots colocalize with the TRF1 signals.
