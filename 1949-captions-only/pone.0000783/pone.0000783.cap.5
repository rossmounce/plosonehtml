(A-C) Pachytene spermatocyte. RAD21 is located on the autosomal lateral elements and unsynapsed sex (XY) axial elements, while CAP-H concentrates at nucleoli. (D-F) Diplotene. RAD21 appears on either the desynapsed autosomal lateral elements, or the unsynapsed sex (XY) axial elements, and CAP-H remains associated to nucleoli. (G-J) Selected metaphase I autosomal bivalent. RAD21 appears enriched at homologous centromeres, conforming a T-shaped structure, and as a series of fainter patches at the interchromatid domain. Note that the RAD21 labeling is interrupted at the interstitial chiasma. By contrast, the CAP-H labeling is found as diffuse axes along the inner region of each chromatid, and as brighter spots at the centromeric and distal axes ends. (K-N) Selected metaphase I sex bivalent. The labeling patterns of RAD21 and CAP-H in sex bivalents resemble those found on autosomes, except for a larger and more continuous RAD21 labeling at the interchromatid domain. (O, P) Enlarged side view of a metaphase I centromere. RAD21 appears as a T-shaped structure, and the CAP-H spots partially colocalize with the middle region of the RAD21 signal. (Q, R) Enlarged top view of a metaphase I centromere. RAD21 appears as two associated rings that surround the CAP-H spots. Bars: (A–F) 5 µm; (G–N) 3 µm; (O–R) 1.5 µm.</p>
