                Figure 6.  Representation of a metaphase I bivalent showing the relative distributions of condensin I and RAD21-containing cohesin complexes.One chromosome is depicted in light grey and its homologue is darker grey. Chromosomes are telocentric, and the metaphase I bivalent shows a single interstitial chiasma. Kinetochores are indicated in yellow, kMTs in light grey, condensin I in green, RAD21 in red, and TRF1 in blue. The colocalisation of condensin I and TRF1 is shown in light blue. In (A), the condensin I complexes delineate a fuzzy axis inside each chromatid, with prominent accumulations at their proximal and distal ends which colocalize with TRF1. The two proximal condensin I accumulations appear below the closely associated sister kinetochores, and partially colocalize with the middle region of the T-shaped RAD21 structure at each centromere. RAD21-containing cohesin complexes are also depicted as patches at the interchromatid domain. (B) Hypothetical model accounting for the distribution of condensin I and RAD21-containing cohesin complexes in relation to radial chromatin loops in a mouse metaphase I bivalent. The longitudinal and transverse sections of the arms correspond to areas indicated in (A).
