(B) Cells from (A) were scored for their distribution as cytoplasmic or pancellular. (C) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-SIRT2 and incubated with or without leptomycin B (LMB). (D) Cells from (C) were scored for localization of GFP-SIRT2 in the nucleus. (E) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-SIRT2 followed by treatment with LMB. At indicated times, cells were fixed and visualized for nuclear localization.</p>
