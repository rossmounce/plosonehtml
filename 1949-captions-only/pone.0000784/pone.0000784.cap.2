                Figure 2.  A Crm1-dependent NES is located in the amino-terminus of SIRT2.(A) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP or full-length and deletion mutants of GFP-SIRT2 and visualized for subcellular distribution. (B) 293T cells were transfected with cDNAs used in (A) and lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by western blotting with an antiserum specific for GFP. (C) Schematic diagram of deletion analysis GFP-SIRT2 subcellular distribution. The region required for cytoplasmic localization is indicated. (D) Schematic of consensus Rev-like NES and proposed SIRT2 NES. Nuclear export signal sequences from proteins exported from the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent manner.
