(B) Subcellular distribution results of all single and double mutants of SIRT2 NES analyzed in (A). (C) 293T cells were transfected with GFP-SIRT2 single and double point mutants and lysates were separated by SDSâ€“PAGE and visualized by western blotting with an antiserum specific for GFP. (D) HeLa cells were transfected with SIRT2-FLAG and fibrillarin-GFP, treated with or without LMB for 2 hrs and subsequently stained for FLAG and visualize by confocal microscopy.</p>
