(B) HeLa cells were stained with antisera for endogenous SIRT2 (green) and Aurora A (red) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. (C) HeLa cells were stained with antisera for SIRT2 (green), acetylated tubulin (red), and Aurora A (blue) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. (D) 293T cells were transfected with Myc-Aurora A with or without SIRT2-FLAG. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and probed by western blotting with antisera specific for FLAG and Myc. 10% of protein input was analyzed by western blotting with antisera for FLAG or Myc.</p>
