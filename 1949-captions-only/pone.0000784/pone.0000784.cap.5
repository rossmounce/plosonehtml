                Figure 5.  Enrichment of the three proteins on the midbody is shown in the merge images.(A) HeLa cells were stained with antisera for SIRT2 (green) and Aurora B (blue) and acetylated tubulin (red), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Enrichment of the three proteins on the midbody is shown in the merged images. (B) 293T cells were transfected with Myc-Aurora A with or without SIRT2-FLAG. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and probed by western blotting with antisera specific for FLAG and Myc. 10% of protein input was analyzed by western blotting with antisera for FLAG or Myc.
