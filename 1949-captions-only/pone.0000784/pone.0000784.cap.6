                Figure 6.  Overexpression of SIRT2 leads increases mutlinucleation.HeLa cells were transfected with GFP, and wild-type or H187Y GFP-SIRT2 and 48 hours after transfection, cells were scored for the presence of multiple nuclei. Percentages represent average of counting ~200 cells in three independent transfections with error bars representing standard deviation.
