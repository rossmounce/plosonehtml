(a) Hamilton's one-sex force of selection at age <em>x</em> (shown relative to its value at birth) falls to zero with the decline of remaining survival-weighted female reproduction. b is the inverse of the top panel. In mutation-selection balance, the frequency of deleterious mutant alleles is expected to be proportional to 1/<em>S</em>, where <em>S</em> is the force of selection for a dominant or semi-dominant allele. The inverse of the force of selection is an indicator of age-specific mortality. The rapid increase in mortality at female menopause is the ‘wall of death.’</p>
