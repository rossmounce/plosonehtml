                Figure 4.  Two-sex model eliminates wall of death.In a the dashed red line shows the relative force of selection (as in Fig. 1) on a forager population with a life expectancy of 33.5 years using female-only demography. The solid blue line shows the two-sex relative force of selection and reveals an active defense against deleterious mutations into the 65â€“70 yr age interval. b shows the inverse of the force of selection, which describes the pattern of mortality. The wall of death is replaced by a gradual rise in mortality until very late ages.
