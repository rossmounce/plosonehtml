The solid blue line shows the two-sex relative force of selection and reveals an active defense against deleterious mutations into the 65â€“70 yr age interval. b shows the inverse of the force of selection, which describes the pattern of mortality. The wall of death is replaced by a gradual rise in mortality until very late ages.</p>
