                Figure 2.  CMV accumulation and virulence on Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.A. Accumulation of viral RNA (µg/g fresh weight) is estimated for 1:1 mix of inoculated and systemically infected leaves of plants inoculated at reproductive stage (Experiment 1). B. Virulence (V) is estimated as the effect of virus infection at reproductive stage on production of viable seeds (see text for details). Data are mean±standard errors of ten replicates. Accessions are presented according to the accumulation levels of LS-CMV in panel A. CMV isolate: LS-CMV (green lozenges), Fny-CMV (blue squares) and De72-CMV (red triangles).
