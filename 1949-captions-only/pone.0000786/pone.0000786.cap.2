Accumulation of viral RNA (µg/g fresh weight) is estimated for 1:1 mix of inoculated and systemically infected leaves of plants inoculated at reproductive stage (Experiment 1). B. Virulence (<em>V</em>) is estimated as the effect of virus infection at reproductive stage on production of viable seeds (see text for details). Data are mean±standard errors of ten replicates. Accessions are presented according to the accumulation levels of LS-CMV in panel A. CMV isolate: LS-CMV (green lozenges), Fny-CMV (blue squares) and De72-CMV (red triangles).</p>
