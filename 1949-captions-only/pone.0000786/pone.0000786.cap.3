                Figure 3.  Relationship between above-ground biomass (BM) and the weight of seeds produced per plant (SW) in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.A. Correlation SW/BM for accession average values of mock-inoculated plants of allometry group 1 (red) and allometry group 2 (blue), and frequency histogram of this relationship represented considering ten replicates of each accession. B. Effect of infection in SW/BM relationship (green) for allometry group 1. C. Effect of infection in SW/BM relationship (green) for allometry group 2, data are mean values of each accession.
