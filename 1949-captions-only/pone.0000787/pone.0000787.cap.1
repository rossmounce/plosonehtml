Among the CNC markers are <em>Sox9 (SoxE), Sox5/6 (SoxD), Twist1/2</em> and <em>Ets1/2</em> genes. All of these factors are expressed in post-migratory chondrogenic cranial neural crest <a href="#pone.0000787-PerezAlcala1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Soo1">[9]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Tahtakran1">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Hopwood1">[45]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Yan2">[46]</a>. <em>SoxE</em>, <em>SoxD</em>, and <em>Twist1/2</em> have been shown to cross-regulate, and to activate cartilage specifiers and effector genes. <em>SoxE</em> is required for expression of both <em>SoxD</em> and <em>Twist1/2</em> in migrating CNC <a href="#pone.0000787-PerezAlcala1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Spokony1">[34]</a>, while <em>Twist1/2</em> is necessary for the continued expression of <em>SoxE</em> in postmigratory CNC<a href="#pone.0000787-Soo1">[9]</a>. Both <em>SoxE</em> and <em>SoxD</em> cooperate to directly activate the definitive cartilage differentiation marker <em>Col2a1</em> in chondroblasts<a href="#pone.0000787-Lefebvre2">[47]</a>, while <em>Twist1/2</em> is required for expression of the <em>aristalless</em>-related transcription factors <em>Alx3/4</em> and <em>Cart1</em><a href="#pone.0000787-Soo1">[<em>9</em>]</a>. <em>Ets1/2</em> expression overlaps temporally and spatially with <em>SoxE</em>, <em>SoxD</em> and <em>Twist1/2</em>, though functional relationships between it and the other network components have yet to be demonstrated <a href="#pone.0000787-Tahtakran1">[11]</a>. In sea urchins, <em>Ets1/2</em> and <em>Alx3/4</em> orthologs are necessary for the formation of skeletogenic mesenchyme and are regulated by the same upstream factors, suggesting they cooperate in an evolutionarily ancient skeletogenic program <a href="#pone.0000787-Amore1">[48]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Ettensohn1">[49]</a>. As chondrogenesis begins, presumptive pharyngeal chondrocytes express genes grouped here as cartilage markers (<em>Barx1/2, Alx3/4, Cart1, Runx1/2/3, Bapx1</em>, and <em>GDF5</em>). These genes are expressed in differentiating CNC-derived chondrocytes <a href="#pone.0000787-Jones1">[12]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000787-tenBerge1">[14]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Yoshida1">[16]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Miller1">[21]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Barlow1">[50]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000787-Bruneau1">[52]</a>, are downstream of CNC specfiers and upstream of effector genes like <em>Col2a1</em> and <em>Aggrecan, Barx1</em> physically interacts with <em>Sox9</em> to directly activate <em>Collagen2a1</em> expression <a href="#pone.0000787-Meech1">[37]</a>. As indicated above, <em>Alx3/4</em> and <em>Cart1</em> are regulated by <em>Twist1/2</em><a href="#pone.0000787-Soo1">[<em>9</em>]</a>. <em>Runx1/2/3</em> expression in chondrocytes is dependent on <em>SoxE</em> function<a href="#pone.0000787-Yoshida1">[16]</a>. In the pharynx, <em>Bapx1</em> functions mainly to position the jaw joint by regulating expression of <em>GDF5</em><a href="#pone.0000787-Miller1"><em>[21]</em></a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Wilson1">[53<em></em>]</a>. In the mesoderm-derived axial skeleton, however, <em>Bapx1</em> is expressed broadly and operates upstream of <em>Sox9, Col2a1</em>, and <em>Runx1/2/3</em><a href="#pone.0000787-Rodrigo1">[<em>54]</em></a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Lettice1">[55<em></em>]</a>. Essential for maintenance and establishment of the chondrogenic subnetwork are signaling molecules of the <em>FGF</em> and <em>Endothelin</em> families which are secreted by surround pharyngeal endoderm and ectoderm<a href="#pone.0000787-Walshe1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Miller1">[21]</a> (not shown). These genes also mediate pharyngeal arch patterning by activating nested expression of various transcription factors in the nascent cartilages including <em>Dlx</em> and <em>Msx</em> genes, <em>Gsc</em>, and <em>Hand2</em> <a href="#pone.0000787-Miller1">[21]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000787-Miller2">[43]</a>(not shown). (B) The major expression domains of chondrogenic neural crest gene homologs in amphioxus neurulae and larvae. No single cell type expresses the complete set of vertebrate chondrogenic network genes, indicating the cranial neural crest cartilage program is a vertebrate novelty. Notably, most factors are expressed in mesodermal derivatives, suggesting neural crest-derived cartilage evolved via repeated cooption of primitively mesodermal genes.</p>
