(A) <em>SoxE</em> expression in ventral notochord and medial neural plate in late neurula. (B) Section through b in A. Superficial ectoderm staining is caused by adhesion of precipitate forming during the <em>in situ</em> hybiridzation procedure to the outside of the embryo. This artefact is distinguishable from actual signal because it is acellular, not visible in wholemount, and only readily apparent in overstained sections viewed using phase contrast optics. (C) <em>SoxE</em> expression throughout the neural tube and in ventral notochord cells at the anterior and posterior tips in early larva (24 h). (D) Section through d in C showing neural tube staining. (E) <em>SoxD</em> expression in the medial somites and notochord in late neurula. (F) Section through f in E. (G) <em>SoxD</em> expression in the posterior notochord, anterior gut, and cerebral vesicle of early larva. (H) Section through h in G showing notochord expression. (I)<em>Twist</em> expression in lateral somites and notochord in late neurula (J) Section through j in I. (K) <em>Twist</em> expression in ventrolateral mesoderm of early larva. (L) Section through the pharynx at l in K showing expression in pharyngeal mesoderm (arrow). (M) <em>Ets</em> expression in the posterior gut, anterior notochord, and ventral aspect of the anterior somites of late neurula. (N) Section through n in M. (O) <em>Ets</em> expression in the gut and anterior mesendoderm of early larva. (P) Section through the pharynx at p in O showing expression in pharyngeal mesoderm (arrow) and gut. (Q) <em>Twist</em> expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow) and right gut diverticulum (arrowhead) of 1.5d larva. (R) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at r in Q showing mesodermal expression (arrow). (S) <em>Ets</em> expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow), gut diverticulae (arrowhead), and cerebral vesicle of 1.5d larva. (T) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at t in S showing mesodermal expression (arrow). (U) Diagram of cross section midway through late neurula. (V) Diagram of cross section midway through early larva. (W) Diagram of cross section through first pharyngeal arch in 1.5d larva. In cephalochordate larvae, gill slits on opposite sides of the pharynx form asynchronously, with the right gill slits forming first. Thus, cross sections through the pharynx of amphioxus larvae reveal single gill bars rather than the symmetrical pharyngeal arches typical of analogous sections through vertebrate embryos. In U,V, and W, light blue is epidermal ectoderm, dark blue is the neural tube, brown is the notochord, yellow is endoderm, pink is somitic mesoderm, and red is pharyngeal arch mesoderm.</p>
