(A) <em>Alx</em> expression in the lateral somites and gut diverticulae of late neurula. Strongest expression is seen in the gut diverticulae and first somites. (B) Section through the first somites at b in A. (C) <em>Alx</em> expression in ventral mesoderm and the anterior gut diverticulae of early larva (24 h). (D) Section through the pharynx at d in C showing expression in the pharyngeal mesoderm (arrow). (E) <em>Alx</em> expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow) and the right gut diverticulum (arrowhead) of 1.5d larva. (F) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at f in E showing expression in mesoderm. (G) Anterior is to the left. Left side of an early larva focused in the plane of the ectoderm showing <em>Barx</em> expression in a patch of ectoderm (arrow) just caudal to the forming preoral pit. (H) Anterior is to the left. Left side of a 1.5d larva focused in the plane of the ectoderm showing <em>Barx</em> expression in a few ectodermal cells (arrow) caudal to the preoral pit (arrowhead). (I) <em>Bapx</em> expression in the medial somites of late neurula. (J) Section through j in I. (K) <em>Bapx</em> expression in a stripe of pharyngeal endoderm on the right side of an early larva approximating the region of the nascent first gill slit. (L) Section through l in K showing endodermal staining (arrowhead). (M) <em>Runx</em> expression in the posterior gut of late neurula. (N) Section through n in M. (O) <em>Runx</em> expression in the gut of early larva. (P) Section through p in O.</p>
