                Figure 3.  Expression of amphioxus Alx, Barx, Bapx, and Runx in late neurulae (15 h) and larvae.In all panels showing wholemount specimens, anterior is to the left unless otherwise indicated. (A) Alx expression in the lateral somites and gut diverticulae of late neurula. Strongest expression is seen in the gut diverticulae and first somites. (B) Section through the first somites at b in A. (C) Alx expression in ventral mesoderm and the anterior gut diverticulae of early larva (24 h). (D) Section through the pharynx at d in C showing expression in the pharyngeal mesoderm (arrow). (E) Alx expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow) and the right gut diverticulum (arrowhead) of 1.5d larva. (F) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at f in E showing expression in mesoderm. (G) Anterior is to the left. Left side of an early larva focused in the plane of the ectoderm showing Barx expression in a patch of ectoderm (arrow) just caudal to the forming preoral pit. (H) Anterior is to the left. Left side of a 1.5d larva focused in the plane of the ectoderm showing Barx expression in a few ectodermal cells (arrow) caudal to the preoral pit (arrowhead). (I) Bapx expression in the medial somites of late neurula. (J) Section through j in I. (K) Bapx expression in a stripe of pharyngeal endoderm on the right side of an early larva approximating the region of the nascent first gill slit. (L) Section through l in K showing endodermal staining (arrowhead). (M) Runx expression in the posterior gut of late neurula. (N) Section through n in M. (O) Runx expression in the gut of early larva. (P) Section through p in O.
