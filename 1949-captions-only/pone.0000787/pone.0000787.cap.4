                Figure 4.  Expression of amphioxus ColA, and FGF8/17/18 in late neurulae (15 h) and larvae.In all panels showing wholemount specimens, anterior is to the left. (A) ColA expression in the nascent notochord in late neurula. (B) Section at the level of b in A. (C) ColA expression in the neural tube and notochord in early larva (24 h). (D) Section through d in C showing weak expression in somitic mesoderm. (E) ColA expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow) of 1.5d larva. (F) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at f in E showing mesodermal expression (arrow). (G) ColA expression in 2 gill slit larva. Strong expression is seen in the mesoderm of the first and second pharyngeal arches (arrows) and in individual cells of the right gut diverticulum (arrowhead). (H) FGF8/17/18 expression in dorsal anterior ectoderm and two patches of pharyngeal endoderm. (I) Section through the pharynx at i in H showing FGF8/17/18 expression in ventral endoderm (arrow). (J) FGF8/17/18 expression in the pharyngeal endoderm of 1.5d larva (arrows). (K) Section through k in J showing expression in ventral endoderm (arrow).
