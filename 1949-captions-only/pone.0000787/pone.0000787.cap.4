(A) <em>ColA</em> expression in the nascent notochord in late neurula. (B) Section at the level of b in A. (C) ColA expression in the neural tube and notochord in early larva (24 h). (D) Section through d in C showing weak expression in somitic mesoderm. (E) <em>ColA</em> expression in the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch (arrow) of 1.5d larva. (F) Section through the first pharyngeal arch at f in E showing mesodermal expression (arrow). (G) <em>ColA</em> expression in 2 gill slit larva. Strong expression is seen in the mesoderm of the first and second pharyngeal arches (arrows) and in individual cells of the right gut diverticulum (arrowhead). (H) <em>FGF8/17/18</em> expression in dorsal anterior ectoderm and two patches of pharyngeal endoderm. (I) Section through the pharynx at i in H showing <em>FGF8/17/18</em> expression in ventral endoderm (arrow). (J) <em>FGF8/17/18</em> expression in the pharyngeal endoderm of 1.5d larva (arrows). (K) Section through k in J showing expression in ventral endoderm (arrow).</p>
