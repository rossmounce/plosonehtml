Numbers on top of amino acid sequences are alignment positions. The key to JOY annotations is as follows (a graphical version is viewable as <a href="#pone.0000788.s001">Table S1</a>); solvent inaccessible – UPPER CASE; solvent accessible – lower case; α-helix – dark grey shaded; β-strand – mid-grey shaded; 3<sub>10</sub> helix – light grey shaded; hydrogen bond to main chain amide – bold; hydrogen bond to main chain carbonyl – <span class="underline">underline</span>; hydrogen bond to other sidechain – tilde; disulphide bond – cedilla; positive φ---&gt;φ - <em>italic</em>; <em>cis</em>-peptide – breve.</p>
