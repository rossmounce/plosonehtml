                Figure 2.  Structure based sequence alignments of TIR domains.The program JOY was used to annotate the alignments for TLR1, TLR2 TLR4, TLR10, Mal and TRAM. Numbers on top of amino acid sequences are alignment positions. The key to JOY annotations is as follows (a graphical version is viewable as Table S1); solvent inaccessible – UPPER CASE; solvent accessible – lower case; α-helix – dark grey shaded; β-strand – mid-grey shaded; 310 helix – light grey shaded; hydrogen bond to main chain amide – bold; hydrogen bond to main chain carbonyl – underline; hydrogen bond to other sidechain – tilde; disulphide bond – cedilla; positive φ---&gt;φ - italic; cis-peptide – breve.
