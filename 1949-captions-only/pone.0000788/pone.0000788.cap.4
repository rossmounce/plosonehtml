                Figure 4.  Docking studies predict that the adaptors bind at the side of the TLR4 homodimer interface.The TLR4 protomers, represented as ribbon diagrams are in green and cyan. Docked Mal and TRAM are represented as stick models and the 50 best docking solutions generated by GRAMM for either Mal (A) or TRAM (B) have been superimposed upon one another. (C) High resolution complex of TLR4 dimer (green and cyan), Mal (pink) and TRAM (yellow). The position of each BB loop is labelled.
