Docked Mal and TRAM are represented as stick models and the 50 best docking solutions generated by GRAMM for either Mal (A) or TRAM (B) have been superimposed upon one another. (C) High resolution complex of TLR4 dimer (green and cyan), Mal (pink) and TRAM (yellow). The position of each BB loop is labelled.</p>
