                Figure 1.  Northern analysis of FLRG transgenic mice.Total RNA was prepared from various tissues from 10-week old female mice, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with a fragment derived from SV40 corresponding to the processing/polyadenylation sequences present in the transgenic construct. The blots were re-hybridized with a probe for the S26 ribosomal protein to control for loading.
