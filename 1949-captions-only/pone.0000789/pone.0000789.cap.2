                Figure 2.  Muscle weight increases in (A) female Mstn mutant and Z116A transgenic mice and (B) male Mstn mutant and F66 transgenic mice.Numbers represent percent increases relative to wild type mice and were calculated from the data shown in Table 1. (C) Distribution of fiber diameters. Gray bars represent muscles from wild type mice, and red bars represent muscles from Mstn−/−, F66, and F66/Mstn−/− mice.
