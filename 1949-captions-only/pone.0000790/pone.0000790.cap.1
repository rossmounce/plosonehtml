                Figure 1.  Best maximum likelihood tree of eukaryotes found using TREEFINDER, with 10 starting trees obtained with the global tree searching procedure.Numbers at nodes represent the result of the bootstrap analysis (underlined numbers; hundred bootstrap pseudoreplicates were performed) and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Black dots represent values of 100% bootstrap support (BP) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (BiPP) of 1.0. Nodes without numbers correspond to supports weaker than 50% BP and 0.8 BiPP.
