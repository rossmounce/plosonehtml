As expected, IFN-α treatment increased the levels of MHC Class I on HepG2 (A) and HHL (B); filled curve represents an isotype control, the solid line represents the MCH Class I expression. C) HepG2 cells were stimulated for 16 hours with a serial dilution of IFN-α at 0 IU/ml (closed circles), 10 IU/ml (open diamonds), 100 IU/ml (open squares), and 1000 IU/ml (open inverted triangles), prior to cytotoxicity assay with the CTL line 2. Treatment with IFN-α reduced the HepG2 cells sensitivity to CTL cytotoxicity in a dose dependent manner. D) This phenomenon was also found with the novel human hepatocyte cell lines (HHL). HHL-17 cells were either left untreated (closed circles) or stimulated for 16 hours with 1000 IU/ml (open inverted triangles) prior to co-incubation with the CTL line 1.</p>
