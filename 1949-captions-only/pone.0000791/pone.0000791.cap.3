The cells were then pulsed with the specific cognate peptide and washed, prior to co-incubation with the CTL line 2. As controls non-peptide-pulsed cells were used, or all PBMC were peptide pulsed or stimulated with PMA/ionomycin. A) The raw FACS data showing the CD8+ expression on the y axis's and IFN-γ on the x axis's. B) The percentage secretion data from such experiment. HepG2p represents peptide pulsed cells with or without IFN-α stimulation as indicated. This data is representative of 4 such experiments.</p>
