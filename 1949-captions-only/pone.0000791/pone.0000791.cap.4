HHL-17 cells were stimulated with IFN-α at either 0 IU/ml, 100 IU/ml or 1000 IU/ml for 16 hours. Un-stimulated hepatocytes expressed low levels of Bcl-2 (MFI of 6.08), while those treated with either 100 IU/ml or 1000 IU/ml of IFN-α lost expression (MFI of 3.99 and 3.42 respectively); filled curves represent an isotype control, and solid lines represent the Bcl<sub>2</sub> staining.</p>
