HepG2 cells, either stimulated with IFN-α (1000 IU/ml) (closed inverted triangles) or left un-stimulated (open diamonds), were incubated with cross-linked rFASL at concentrations ranging from 0.1 pg/ml to 2 µg/ml. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V binding and propidium iodine (P.I) incorporation. Ai) Raw FACS data is shown. Bii) HepG2 cells, either un-stimulated (open and closed circles), stimulated with 100 IU/ml (open and closed squares) IFN-α or 1000 IU/ml (open and closed inverted triangles) IFN-α, were incubated with 1 µg/ml (left, open symbols) or 2 µg/ml (right, closed symbols) cross-linked rFASL over a time course of up to 6 hours. Apoptosis was assessed by the cytosolic presence of the activated form of caspase 3. Bi) Raw FACS data.</p>
