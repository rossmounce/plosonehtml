FAS expression was negative under both conditions, mean fluorescence intensity of 4.60 and 4.34 respectively (open curves), and never higher than an isotype control (filled curve). B) Under normal conditions (closed squares) the HHL-16 cells were able to act as targets for CTL cytotoxicity after 4 hours co-incubation. However, stimulation with IFN-α, either at 100 IU/ml (closed triangles) or at 1000 IU/ml (closed inverted triangle), reduced killing below 10% even at the higher E:T ratio.</p>
