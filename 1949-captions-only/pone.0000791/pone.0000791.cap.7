                Figure 7.  Expression of the granzyme B inhibitor, serine proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9).A) RT-PCR revealed that IFN-Î± stimulated cells, HepG2 and HHL-9 cells, were able to upregulate PI-9. GAPDH expression was analysed as a positive control. Bi and ii) This was confirmed by FACS analysis as described in the methods and materials. Upregulation of PI-9 was shown to be dose dependent.
