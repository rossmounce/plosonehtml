                Figure 8.  Analysis of alternative triggers for PI-9 expression.A) The up-regulation of PI-9 was also found to be triggered by other inflammatory cytokines. HepG2 cells were treated for 16 hours with either IFN-γ at 100 IU/ml, or IL-1β at 50 ng/ml. GAPDH expression was used as a positive control. B) Stimulation of the HepG2 cell line with either IFN-γ (open squares) or IL-1β (open triangles) also inhibited CTL killing compared to the un-stimulated HepG2 cells (closed circle). C) HepG2 cells were left un-infected (Nil), or infected with either a baculovirus expressing a sub-genomic replicon (NS-replicon), or with a control baculovirus expressing LacZ (+Control). PI-9 expression was analysed by RT-PCR. PI-9 was strongly up-regulated only in the cells expressing the sub-genomic replicon. GAPDH expression was used as a positive control.
