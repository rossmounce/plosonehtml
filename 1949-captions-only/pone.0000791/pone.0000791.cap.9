A) Representative negative isotype control. Bâ€“D) PI-9 was detected in the majority of hepatocytes. Stronger PI-9 expression, as expected, was seen within the mononuclear infiltrate (highlighted by red arrows), while all the hepatocytes stained positively, albeit at a lower level (the strongest are highlighted by blue arrows).</p>
