                Figure 9.  Expression of PI-9 in liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis C.Liver specimens obtained from diagnostic biopsy were stained for PI-9 expression as described in the methods. A) Representative negative isotype control. Bâ€“D) PI-9 was detected in the majority of hepatocytes. Stronger PI-9 expression, as expected, was seen within the mononuclear infiltrate (highlighted by red arrows), while all the hepatocytes stained positively, albeit at a lower level (the strongest are highlighted by blue arrows).
