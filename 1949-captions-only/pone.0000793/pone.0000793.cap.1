                Figure 1.  Bayesian tree (unrooted) of LRIM1 from five species of the An. gambiae complex.Posterior probabilities ≥0.99 are indicated by *. Number of non-synonymous/synonymous substitutions are indicated above or on the left side of the branches. Estimated ω values are placed below or on the right side of the branches and are underlined. The foreground branch for the maximum likelihood tests of positive selection is indicated by a double line. For a more detailed phylogeny, including all posterior probabilities above 50% and sample names, see Figure S2 (supporting materials).
