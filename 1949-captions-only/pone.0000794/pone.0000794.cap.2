(B) An interneuron [arrowhead] ascending towards the cortical plate uses radial glial strand [red] as a migratory guide, before detaching from it. (C) Contact with a radial glial cell soma [red] in the ventricular zone alters the trajectory of an interneuron [arrowhead] from tangential to sharply radial. Time elapsed since the beginning of observations is indicated in minutes. (Also, see the AVI movie files provided in the supporting information). Scale bar: A, C, 100 µm; B, 80 µm.</p>
