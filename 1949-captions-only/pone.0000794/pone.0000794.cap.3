                Figure 3.  Changes in interneuronal migration following interactions with radial glia.(A–C) Changes in interneuronal migratory behavior before and after contact with radial glial endfeet (A), process (B), and cell soma (C) were monitored in real time. Interneurons displayed one of the following four types of behavior when they come in contact with a radial glial cell: (1) turn towards the radial glial cell, (2) migrate pass the radial glia without pausing, (3) turn back and migrate in opposite direction after contacting radial glia, or (4) remain attached to the radial glial cell following contact. The extent of these four types of interactions were measured per radial glial endfeet, process, or cell soma during the period of observation. Distinct radial glial cells can alter the migratory behavior of subsets of interneurons in the developing cerebral wall. Number of cells/group&gt;1000. Data shown are mean±SEM.
