                Figure 4.  Quantification of the direction of interneuronal migration in the embryonic cortex.(A–C) Neurons migrating in four distinct directions (towards the pial surface, towards the ventricular surface, tangentially towards cortex [subpallium→ pallium], tangentially towards ganglionic eminence [pallium→ subpallium]) within the cortical plate (A), intermediate zone (B), and ventricular zone (C) were measured. Surprisingly, significant numbers of interneurons across the cerebral wall migrate in cortex→ ganglionic eminence direction. Number of cells/group&gt;1500. Data shown are mean±SEM.
