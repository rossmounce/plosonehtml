                Figure 5.  Distinct migratory dynamics of tangentially migrating interneurons.Interneurons migrating tangentially in subpallium → pallium orientation extend branched leading processes (arrowhead, A) with elaborate growth cones (arrowhead, B) trailed by pre-somal (asterisk, A, B) swellings. (C, D) The leading processes of interneurons migrating in the opposite direction [pallium→ subpallium] tend not to branch and their tips are often club-like and small (arrowhead, C, D). Pre-somal swellings are evident in these neurons (asterisk, C, D). These panels are freeze frame images of actively migrating neurons. Scale bar: 20 µm.
