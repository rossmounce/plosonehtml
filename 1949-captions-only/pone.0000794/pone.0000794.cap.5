(C, D) The leading processes of interneurons migrating in the opposite direction [pallium→ subpallium] tend not to branch and their tips are often club-like and small (arrowhead, C, D). Pre-somal swellings are evident in these neurons (asterisk, C, D). These panels are freeze frame images of actively migrating neurons. Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
