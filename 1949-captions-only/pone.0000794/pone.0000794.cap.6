                Figure 6.  Migratory dynamics of distinct subsets of interneurons.(A, B) Interneurons in embryonic day 16 cerebral cortex were labeled with anti-calbindin or calretinin antibodies. (C) The migratory orientation of labeled interneurons as indicated by the direction of their leading processes was quantified across the cerebral wall. Majority of calretinin+ cells were oriented radially, towards pial surface direction, whereas a higher percentage of calbindin+ interneurons were oriented tangentially towards the cortex. Distinct subsets of interneurons may therefore undergo distinct patterns of migration within the cerebral wall. CP, cortical plate; IZ, intermediate zone; VZ, ventricular zone. Data shown are mean±SEM (n = 10); asterisk, significant when compared with controls at p&lt;0.01 (Student's t test). Scale bar: 75 µm.
