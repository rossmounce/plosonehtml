(C) The migratory orientation of labeled interneurons as indicated by the direction of their leading processes was quantified across the cerebral wall. Majority of calretinin<sup>+</sup> cells were oriented radially, towards pial surface direction, whereas a higher percentage of calbindin<sup>+</sup> interneurons were oriented tangentially towards the cortex. Distinct subsets of interneurons may therefore undergo distinct patterns of migration within the cerebral wall. CP, cortical plate; IZ, intermediate zone; VZ, ventricular zone. Data shown are mean±SEM (n = 10); asterisk, significant when compared with controls at p&lt;0.01 (Student's t test). Scale bar: 75 µm.</p>
