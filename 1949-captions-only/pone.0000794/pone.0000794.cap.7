                Figure 7.  In vivo two-photon microscopy of interneurons in living embryos.(A) Living embryos (E15) attached to the mother were immobilized on an optical stage. Two-photon imaging of GFP positive interneurons in the superficial surface of parietal cortical area (B) indicates multidirectional orientation of migrating interneurons. (C) Time lapse imaging of these neurons illustrate multidirectional movement of these neurons as they navigate to their appropriate locations within the developing cortex. This multidirectional movement of interneurons suggest that once interneurons invade cortex from the ganglionic eminence, local cues may influence the allocation of interneurons into distinct cortical areas. Arrows indicate neurons moving in different orientations. Time elapsed is indicated in minutes. M, medial; L, lateral; R, rostral; C, caudal. Scale bar: B, 30 µm; C, 40 µm.
