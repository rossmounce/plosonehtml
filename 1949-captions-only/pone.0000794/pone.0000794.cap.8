                Figure 8.  Interneuron-radial glial interactions in the developing cerebral cortex.Interneurons (green) migrating into the cerebral wall from the ganglionic eminence(GE) interact with radial glia (red) and can exhibit changes in direction of migration after contacting radial glia. Interneurons can use radial glia as a scaffold upon which to migrate as they ascend to the cortical plate (CP) or descend in the direction of the ventricular zone (VZ). Particular orientation and morphological dynamics of migration may be associated with particular subsets of interneurons. Once the interneurons invade the cortex from the ganglionic eminence, differential interactions between interneurons and radial glial scaffold and localized multidirectional migration of interneurons influenced by local guidance cues may facilitate interneuronal positioning within distinct domains of the developing cerebral cortex. Potential differences among interneurons and radial glia are indicated by shades of green and red, respectively. Putative local guidance cues are indicated by a gradient of pink. Blue arrows indicate direction of migration.
