The accessions in A are, from top to bottom, FGSC#4833, FGSC#852, FGSC#4829, FGSC#5914, FGSC#4817 and FGSC#4723. Conidial density in B was estimated using the Chrono program and plotted as a line graph for visual effect. The accessions in B are FGSC#6634 (black) and FGSC#3968 (grey). Accessions were grown at 25Â°C and represent one replicate to highlight circadian regulated conidiation (banding).</p>
