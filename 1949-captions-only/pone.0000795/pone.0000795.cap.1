                Figure 1.  Phenotypic variation in pigmentation, period and phase in N. crassa conidiation revealed by inverted race tube assay.Representative accessions are shown to highlight variation in pigmentation (A), period and phase (B). The accessions in A are, from top to bottom, FGSC#4833, FGSC#852, FGSC#4829, FGSC#5914, FGSC#4817 and FGSC#4723. Conidial density in B was estimated using the Chrono program and plotted as a line graph for visual effect. The accessions in B are FGSC#6634 (black) and FGSC#3968 (grey). Accessions were grown at 25Â°C and represent one replicate to highlight circadian regulated conidiation (banding).
