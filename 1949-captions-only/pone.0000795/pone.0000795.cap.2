Period (B), temperature compensation (C) and phase (E) were analyzed for the 106 accessions with a RI≥3 at both temperatures. Temperature compensation (C) was measured as Q10 (<a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). (F) Summary of period, phase and RI across the rhythmic accessions at 20°C and 25°C. 87-3 is the <em>N. crassa</em> reference accession that harbours the <em>bd</em> mutation and is the primary lab strain. All values presented are an average of four biological replicates (<a href="#pone.0000795.s006">Table S1</a>).</p>
