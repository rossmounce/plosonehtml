                Figure 2.  Significant phenotypic variation in period, phase and temperature compensation across 143 N. crassa accessions.Circadian period (A, B) and phase (D, E) were estimated using the Chrono program for 118 and 117 accessions at 20°C (grey) and 25°C (black) respectively that had an average rhythmicity index (RI) ≥ 3 (Materials and Methods). Period (B), temperature compensation (C) and phase (E) were analyzed for the 106 accessions with a RI≥3 at both temperatures. Temperature compensation (C) was measured as Q10 (Materials and Methods). (F) Summary of period, phase and RI across the rhythmic accessions at 20°C and 25°C. 87-3 is the N. crassa reference accession that harbours the bd mutation and is the primary lab strain. All values presented are an average of four biological replicates (Table S1).
