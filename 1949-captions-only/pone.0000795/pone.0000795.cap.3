                Figure 3.  Extensive genotypic variation in WC-1 SSR.(A) The wc-1 gene contains a 5′UTR, an intron, a 3′UTR (solid line) and two exons (boxes). WC-1 protein structure: AD, activation domain (striped boxes); LOV, light, oxygen and voltage domain (horizontal line boxes); PAS, PER-ARNT-SIM domain (horizontal line boxes); ZnFn, GATA-type zinc transcription factor DNA binding domain (grey dotted boxes). The number WC-1 5′AG/GA (B), NpolyQ (C) and CpolyQH (D) repeats were estimated across 143 N. crassa accessions (Materials and Methods). Repeat number was confirmed by sequencing the repeats in multiple accessions (Figure S1 and Table S1).
