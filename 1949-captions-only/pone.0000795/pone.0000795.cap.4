                Figure 4.  Genotypic variation WC-1, WC-2, FRQ and VVD.The number of 5′frq (A) and WC-2 CpolyN (B) repeats were estimated in the N. crassa accessions. (C) wc-1, frq and vvd SNPs were scored across 143 accessions. The allele frequency of the reference strain (black) is shown in comparison to the other allele (grey) across the accessions. (D–E) Associations between repeat length of NpolyQ and CpolyQH (D), and WC-2 CpolyN and NpolyQ (E). (F) The average length of both the NpolyQ and CpolyQH were significantly different by a student's t-test when grouped for the presence of the FRQ: R753 or FRQ: Q753 allele (p&lt;0.05). All data is available in Table S1.
