(C) <em>wc-1</em>, <em>frq</em> and <em>vvd</em> SNPs were scored across 143 accessions. The allele frequency of the reference strain (black) is shown in comparison to the other allele (grey) across the accessions. (D–E) Associations between repeat length of NpolyQ and CpolyQH (D), and WC-2 CpolyN and NpolyQ (E). (F) The average length of both the NpolyQ and CpolyQH were significantly different by a student's t-test when grouped for the presence of the FRQ: R753 or FRQ: Q753 allele (p&lt;0.05).
