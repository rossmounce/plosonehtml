Period (B) and phase (C) were measured for both parental strains (FGSC#3223 and FGSC#4274) as well as for 69 progeny from the cross (<a href="#pone.0000795.s007">Table S2</a>). (D) Association between period and phase of the progeny. (E) Period length was significantly associated with WC-1 genotype, regardless of FRQ genotype (<em>P</em>&lt;0.001). Since FRQ and WC-1 are on the same chromosome (linkage group), we scored FRQ: Q753R for crossover events between the two loci. Eleven crossover events were identified in the 69 progeny, FRQ: Q753 (black) and FRQ: R753 (grey). Average period and phase of two biological replicates are presented, and data available in <a href="#pone.0000795.s007">Table S2</a>.</p>
