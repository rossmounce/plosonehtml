                Figure 5.  WC-1 genotype segregates with period length in a cross between two N. crassa accessions.(A) Period, phase, genotype and latitude of collection information for the parental strains FGSC#3223 and FGSC#4724 at 25Â°C. Period (B) and phase (C) were measured for both parental strains (FGSC#3223 and FGSC#4274) as well as for 69 progeny from the cross (Table S2). (D) Association between period and phase of the progeny. (E) Period length was significantly associated with WC-1 genotype, regardless of FRQ genotype (P&lt;0.001). Since FRQ and WC-1 are on the same chromosome (linkage group), we scored FRQ: Q753R for crossover events between the two loci. Eleven crossover events were identified in the 69 progeny, FRQ: Q753 (black) and FRQ: R753 (grey). Average period and phase of two biological replicates are presented, and data available in Table S2.
