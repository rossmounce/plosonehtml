The peptides were selected as described in the text. 86% of the tested peptides bind stronger than 500 nM. The lower figure shows a Kullback-Leibler <a href="#pone.0000796-Kullback1">[52]</a> logo visualization of the HLA binding motifs as predicted by the <em>NetMHCpan</em> method. Peptide binders used to generate the logos for each HLA molecule were selected from a pool of 500,000 random natural nonamers using the <em>NetMHCpan</em> method with a binding threshold of 500 nM. The logos were generated with the logo program of Schneider and Stephens <a href="#pone.0000796-Schneider1">[53]</a>. Note that the binding motifs visualized in the logo plot are estimated from a set of approximately 5000 predicted binders, whereas the validated peptides only make up of the top 0.2%.</p>
