                Figure 2.  Predictive performance of the NetMHCpan method as a function of the distance to its nearest neighbor HLA allele.The nearest neighbor distance is estimated from the alignment score of the HLA pseudo sequences using the relation , where s(A,B) is the BLOSUM50 alignment score [47] between the pseudo sequences for alleles A and B, respectively. HLA-A alleles are shown as solid circles. HLA-B alleles are shown as +. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the pseudo sequence distance and the predictive performance for the 42 HLA alleles included in the plot is 0.67. Note, that the distance measure inherently assumes that all residues are equally important and independent of the pseudo sequence context. While this assumption is obviously inconsistent with the reality of primary anchors, it meets another essential requirement; it is simple and unbiased.
