The columns give the HLA residue numbering according the IMGT nomenclature. The rows demonstrate the interactions with the nine peptides positions. Squares in grey outline the peptide positions estimated to have contact the corresponding HLA residue. The lower part of the figure shows the amino acid polymorphism at each position in the pseudo sequence, both those that are common for HLA-A and â€“B, and those that are unique for the HLA-A and HLA-B loci, respectively (as of February 2007).</p>
