                Figure 1.  A new family of sea urchin ADP-ribosyl cyclases.A, Sequence alignment of the predicted coding regions of three ADP-ribosyl cyclases isolated from Stronglycentrotus purpuratus cDNA libraries (termed SpARC1-3) and representative members of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family. Conserved cysteine and catalytic residues are highlighted in yellow and green, respectively. Abbreviations: Ac, Aplysia californica; Hs, Homo sapiens; Sm, Schistosoma mansoni.
