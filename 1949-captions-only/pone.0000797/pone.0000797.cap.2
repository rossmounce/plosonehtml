                Figure 2.  SpARC1 is glycosylated.A, In vitro translation. mRNA coding for C terminally myc-tagged SpARC1 was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Autoradiogram of translation reactions performed in the absence (−) or presence (+) of canine pancreatic microsomes. B, Expression of SpARC1 in Xenopus laevis embryos. Western blot analysis using an anti-myc antibody of homogenates prepared from control embryos (C) or embryos injected with mRNA for myc-tagged SpARC1. Samples were either mock treated (−) or digested with PNGase F (+) prior to analysis (left). Migration of molecular mass markers (in kDa) is shown on the left of the panels.
