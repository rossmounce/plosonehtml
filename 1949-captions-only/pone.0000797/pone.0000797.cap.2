Autoradiogram of translation reactions performed in the absence (−) or presence (+) of canine pancreatic microsomes. B, Expression of SpARC1 in <em>Xenopus laevis</em> embryos. Western blot analysis using an anti-<em>myc</em> antibody of homogenates prepared from control embryos (C) or embryos injected with mRNA for <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1. Samples were either mock treated (−) or digested with PNGase F (+) prior to analysis (left). Migration of molecular mass markers (in kDa) is shown on the left of the panels.</p>
