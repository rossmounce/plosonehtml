In other experiments the embryos were freeze-thawed and sonicated in a hypotonic buffer (Hypo.). All samples were centrifuged and the resulting pellets and supernatant fractions analysed by Western blotting. B, Proteolytic protection. <em>Xenopus laevis</em> embryos expressing <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1 were homogenized in a sucrose-containing buffer and the homogenates incubated with or without 1% v/v Triton X-100. Samples were then treated with the indicated concentration of proteinase K before Western blot analysis.</p>
