                Figure 5.  SpARC1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum in Xenopus laevis oocytes and eggs.A, Confocal fluorescence images of Xenopus laevis oocytes co-expressing myc-tagged SpARC1 (red) and GFP-tagged human reduced folate carrier (hRFC, green). SpARC1 expression was detected by immunocytochemistry using an anti-myc primary antibody and an FITC labeled secondary antibody whereas hRFC was detected by GFP fluorescence. A plot of the individual emission intensities with depth averaged along a 5 µm wide section (arrowed line) in the overlay image is shown on the right. B, Lateral (‘xy’) images of SpARC1 expression (green) in oocytes and in eggs (right). The control image was obtained from an identically processed un-injected oocyte. Images were captured from the animal (A) and vegetal (V) poles as indicated.
