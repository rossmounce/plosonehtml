                Figure 6.  SpARC1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum in HEK cells.A, Western blot analysis using an anti-myc antibody of homogenates prepared from mock transfected cells (C) or cells transfected with myc-tagged SpARC1 (left). PNGase F treatment (right) was performed as described in Fig. 2. Bâ€“C, Expression of myc-tagged SpARC1 and DsRed2-ER (B) or mitochondrial GFP (C) in HEK cells transfected with the indicated plasmid or plasmid combination. SpARC1 expression was detected by immunocytochemistry using an anti-myc primary antibody and a Cy5-labelled secondary antibody, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were visualized by fluorescence of the DsRed2 and GFP reporters, respectively. Results from control, mock-transfected cultures are also shown. Images were captured at the wavelengths corresponding to the colours marked at the side of the figure.
