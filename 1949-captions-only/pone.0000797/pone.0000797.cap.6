PNGase F treatment (right) was performed as described in <a href="#pone-0000797-g002">Fig. 2</a>. Bâ€“C, Expression of <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1 and DsRed2-ER (B) or mitochondrial GFP (C) in HEK cells transfected with the indicated plasmid or plasmid combination. SpARC1 expression was detected by immunocytochemistry using an anti-myc primary antibody and a Cy5-labelled secondary antibody, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were visualized by fluorescence of the DsRed2 and GFP reporters, respectively. Results from control, mock-transfected cultures are also shown. Images were captured at the wavelengths corresponding to the colours marked at the side of the figure.</p>
