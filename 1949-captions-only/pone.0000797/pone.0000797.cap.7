                Figure 7.  SpARC1 catalyses NAADP production.A, Hypotonic lysates from Xenopus laevis embryos were incubated with NADP (1 mM) and nicotinic acid (NA, 50 mM) at pH 4 for 21 h and the resulting mixtures separated by HPLC. The top chromatograms are from lysates prepared from control embryos (dashed lines) and embryos injected with myc-tagged SpARC1 mRNA (solid line). The elution of authentic NAADP is shown below. B, Western blot comparing SpARC1 expression in 4 independent embryo preparations. C, Production of NAADP following incubation of a typical embryo homogenate with substrates for the indicated times. D, A plot of the initial rate of NAADP production (measured over 3 h) against the level of SpARC1 expression (determined by densitometric analysis of Western blot data for the preparations analysed in B).
