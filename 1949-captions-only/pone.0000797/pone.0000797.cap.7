The top chromatograms are from lysates prepared from control embryos (dashed lines) and embryos injected with <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1 mRNA (solid line). The elution of authentic NAADP is shown below. B, Western blot comparing SpARC1 expression in 4 independent embryo preparations. C, Production of NAADP following incubation of a typical embryo homogenate with substrates for the indicated times. D, A plot of the initial rate of NAADP production (measured over 3 h) against the level of SpARC1 expression (determined by densitometric analysis of Western blot data for the preparations analysed in B).</p>
