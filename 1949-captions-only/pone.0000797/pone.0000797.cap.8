A, Representative chromatograms from lysates prepared from control embryos (dashed lines) and embryos injected with <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1 mRNA (solid line). Both hypotonic lysates (Hypo.; top) or homogenates prepared in sucrose-containing medium (Sucrose; middle) were used. The elution of authentic cyclic GDP-ribose is shown below. B, Pooled data (mean+/−standard error of the mean) from 3 experiments comparing the amount of cyclic GDP-ribose produced using either control (C) or SpARC1-expressing preparations. C, Western blot analysis of <em>myc</em>-tagged SpARC1 expression in pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions prepared following centrifugation of the two reaction mixes from a typical experiment described in A at the end of the incubation period. D, <sup>45</sup>Ca flux uptake by homogenates prepared from <em>Xenopus</em> embryos (in sucrose-containing media) or sea urchin eggs either in the absence (−) or presence (+) of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (Tg; 1 µM). Data are presented as means±standard deviation of triplicate samples from one of 3 independent experiments.</p>
