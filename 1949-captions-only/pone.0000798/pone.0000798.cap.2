Effect on cell growth. MEL cells were cultured without or with 1.0 µg/ml artesunate for the indicated time. The cell numbers were measured by trypan blue exclusion. B. Protein expression of ABCB6 and ABCB7 after treatment with 2% DMSO for different time points. Actin expression served as loading control. C. Effect on differentiation. MEL cells (100,000 cells/ml) were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of artesunate for 48 h. The content of heme was estimated, by the method with oxalic acid. D. The cells transfected with sense- or antisense oligonucleotides for ABCB6 were induced with 2% DMSO without or with 0.18 µg/ml artesunate for 48 h.</p>
