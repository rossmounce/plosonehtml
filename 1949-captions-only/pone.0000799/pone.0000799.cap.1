                Figure 1.  The PAS effect of phage ΦMFP on E. coli MFP on Luria-Bertani agar plates.Only disks containing the β-lactam antibiotics aztreonam and cefixime (indicated by “+” symbols) produced large phage plaques in their proximity. Gentamicin and tetracycline gave no PAS effect. This host strain was resistant to both amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Note the absence of phages on the left-hand control plate indicating the lack of prophage induction.
