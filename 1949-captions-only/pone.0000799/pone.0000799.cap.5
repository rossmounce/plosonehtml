                Figure 5.  The PAS effect of phage T4 on various E. coli SOS and filamentation mutant strains.T4 was grown on E. coli sulA-inactivated and lexA non-inducible mutant strains (defective SOS systems), as well as an ftsZ-inactivated mutant strain (non-antibiotic induced filamentation), in the presence of disks of cefotaxime (CTX). Isogenic wild-type strains (wt) are also included and representative plaques demonstrating the PAS effect are indicated by red arrows. All plates were photographed at identical magnifications.
