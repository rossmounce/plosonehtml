                Figure 3.  GAS metagenome exogenous elements.Illustrated are loci of integration of phages and ICEs into the core chromosome. Prophages are indicated with triangles and ICEs with squares. Stacked triangles and squares indicate a common integration site. Elements are color-coded to indicate the source strain. Prophages and ICEs are numbered as they occur clockwise around the core chromosome for each strain. Integration loci are lettered alphabetically as they occur clockwise around the core chromosome. The six rRNA operons are shown as green bars. Gene designations are as follows: 1) secreted pyrogenic-toxin-superantigens: speA, speC, speH, speI, speK, speL, speM, and ssa; 2) secreted DNAses: sda, sdn, spd1, spd3, and spd4; 3) secreted phospholipase: sla; 4) antimicrobial resistance: erm(A), mef(A), and tet(O); 5) cell surface adhesins: R6 and R28; 6) none, these elements lack a known or obvious virulence gene.
