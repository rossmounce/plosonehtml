                Figure 4.  ICEs encoding antimicrobial resistance genes.(A) 2096-RD.2 encoding Tet(O). (B) 10750-RD.2 encoding Erm(A). Illustrated are predicted coding sequences with gene numbers and predicted functions. Gene numbers given in red denote unique gene content as determined by BLASTP comparison to the GAS metagenome (no hit at e = 1×10−6). CDS are color coded to designate functionally related groups: red, antimicrobial resistance; green, secreted and cell surface; blue, mobilization and transfer; violet, element maintenance; yellow, transcriptional regulation; grey, hypothetical and unclassified.
