The aminoterminal portion of the protein has an intimin/invasin-like domain (Structural Classification of Proteins superfamily: SSF49373) and shares similarity (45% from amino acid ~50-to-350) with a putative cell surface protein of unknown function (lmo1115) in the genome sequence of the intracellular pathogen <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> strain EGD-e. The carboxyterminal portion of the protein (~315-to-1350) has 8 Cna B-type domain repeats (Protein Family: PF05738) and shares similarity with multiple proteins annotated as collagen-binding. These characteristics suggest this protein may function as an adhesin/invasin.</p>
