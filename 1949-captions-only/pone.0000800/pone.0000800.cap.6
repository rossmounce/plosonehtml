CDSs are colored to designate the following groups: black, conserved flanking genes (SF370: 5′ Spy_0123 and 3′ Spy_0136); yellow, transcriptional regulators; red, extracellular matrix-binding and/or pilin-subunit proteins; tan, signal peptidases; green, sortases; purple, insertion sequences. Although there are differences both intra- and interserotype indicative of antigenic variation, nearly all of the extracellular matrix-binding proteins and pilin-subunit proteins have predicted secretion signal sequences and cell wall attachment domains in one or more of the genomes. Additionally illustrated is the similarity between the serotype M2 and GBS pilus encoding region proteins in global alignments. (B) Relationships among the FCT region variants. Nucleotide sequences bounded by the flanking conserved genes for the each of the sequenced GAS strains and the five GBS genes in panel A, were aligned with ClustalW and a neighbor-network was generated using SplitsTree.</p>
