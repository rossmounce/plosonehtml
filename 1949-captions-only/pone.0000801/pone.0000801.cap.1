                Figure 1.  Break light Dam activity assay.The fluorescence of the hemimethylated substrate oligonucleotide 1 is internally quenched by the dabcyl group. It is a substrate for Dam and yields the fully methylated product 2, which is rapidly cleaved by DpnI, thus forming fluorescent oligonucleotide 3.
