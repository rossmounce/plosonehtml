                Figure 3.  Inactivation of Y. pestis Dam.Dam was incubated in a PCR machine at 30 Â°C with the hemimethylated substrate oligonucleotide (triangles), with AdoMet (open circles) or with no additions (filled circles). Aliquots were withdrawn at time intervals and the activity measured. Activity is expressed as a percentage of the initial activity.
