                Figure 1.  RNAi screen identifies TrpC3 as a mediator of hypertrophy-associated gene expression.(A) Increase in cell size in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes stained with anti-α-actinin either untreated (left panel) or stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours (right panel) to induce hypertrophy. (B) Quantification of the two-dimensional cell area for the experiment described in A. Data are normalized to the mean of the cell-area for untreated cells. For each condition, an average of n = 28 cells were analyzed. (C) Luciferase expression in myocytes transfected with the BNP-luciferase (BNP-Luc) reporter gene in the absence (left bar) or presence (right bar) of 20 µM PE for 60 hours. BNP-luciferase activity is normalized to the activity of a co-transfected plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase. n = 4 biological replicates per condition. (D) Real-time RT-PCR measurements of TrpC mRNA expression in untreated myocytes (grey bars) or myocytes stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours (black bars). The data is normalized to the mean of the untreated myocytes for each TrpC gene. Asterisks indicate a significant difference between untreated and PE-stimulated cells. n = 4 measurements per condition. (E) Luciferase activity measured in myocytes transfected with BNP-Luc and d-siRNA targeting either the LacZ or CaV1.2 genes and stimulated with PE. CaV1.2 d-siRNA reduces the expression of the BNP-Luc reporter gene. n = 6 biological replicates per condition. (D) Ventricular myocytes were transfected with d-siRNAs targeting twenty of the twenty-two rat TRP channels along with BNP-Luc, stimulated with 20 µM PE for 48 hours and assayed luciferase activity. The luciferase activity of cells containing d-siRNAs targeting LacZ and the best hit, TrpC3 are shown. n = 12 biological replicates per condition. * indicates statistically significant difference compared to control, P&lt;0.0001. ** indicates P&lt;0.01. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean±SEM.
