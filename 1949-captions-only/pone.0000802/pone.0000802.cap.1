(<em>B</em>) Quantification of the two-dimensional cell area for the experiment described in <em>A</em>. Data are normalized to the mean of the cell-area for untreated cells. For each condition, an average of n = 28 cells were analyzed. (<em>C</em>) Luciferase expression in myocytes transfected with the BNP-luciferase (BNP-Luc) reporter gene in the absence (<em>left bar</em>) or presence (<em>right bar</em>) of 20 µM PE for 60 hours. BNP-luciferase activity is normalized to the activity of a co-transfected plasmid constitutively expressing <em>Renilla</em> luciferase. n = 4 biological replicates per condition. (<em>D</em>) Real-time RT-PCR measurements of TrpC mRNA expression in untreated myocytes (<em>grey bars</em>) or myocytes stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours (<em>black bars</em>). The data is normalized to the mean of the untreated myocytes for each TrpC gene. Asterisks indicate a significant difference between untreated and PE-stimulated cells. n = 4 measurements per condition. (<em>E</em>) Luciferase activity measured in myocytes transfected with BNP-Luc and d-siRNA targeting either the LacZ or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 genes and stimulated with PE. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 d-siRNA reduces the expression of the BNP-Luc reporter gene. n = 6 biological replicates per condition. (<em>D</em>) Ventricular myocytes were transfected with d-siRNAs targeting twenty of the twenty-two rat TRP channels along with BNP-Luc, stimulated with 20 µM PE for 48 hours and assayed luciferase activity. The luciferase activity of cells containing d-siRNAs targeting LacZ and the best hit, TrpC3 are shown. n = 12 biological replicates per condition. * indicates statistically significant difference compared to control, P&lt;0.0001. ** indicates P&lt;0.01. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean±SEM.</p>
