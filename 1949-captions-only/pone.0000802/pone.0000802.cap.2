Data is presented as percent decrease in expression compared to the mean expression of myocytes expressing LacZ-shRNA#1. Asterisks indicate significant difference compared to LacZ-shRNA#1. n = 4 per condition. (<em>B</em>) Real time RT-PCR measurements of BNP mRNA levels in myocytes infected with the same lentiviruses as in <em>A</em>. TrpC3 shRNAs reduce the expression of endogenous BNP mRNA. n = 4 per condition. (<em>C</em>) Luciferase activity in myocytes transfected with BNP-Luc and plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting either TrpC3 or LacZ. Cells were stimulated for 60 hours with 20 µM phenylephrine (PE), 100 nM endothelin-1 (ET1) or 150 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) to induce hypertrophy. n = 4 biological replicates per condition. (<em>D</em>) Luciferase expression in myocytes transfected with ANP-Luc and untreated or stimulated with 20 µM PE. n = 6 biological replicates per condition. (<em>E</em>) Myocytes transfected with plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting either LacZ or TrpC3 were stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours and then fixed and immunostained with an anti-ANP antibody. TrpC3 shRNA expression caused a decrease in ANP staining. (F) Quantification of immunostained cells treated as in <em>E</em>. The integrated ANP-immunofluorescence intensity across the two-dimensional projection of transfected cells was measured. Average n = 31 cells per condition. In all panels, cells not expressing TrpC3-shRNA were expressing a control shRNA against LacZ. * indicates statistically significant difference compared to control, P&lt;0.01. ** indicates P&lt;0.05. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean±SEM.</p>
