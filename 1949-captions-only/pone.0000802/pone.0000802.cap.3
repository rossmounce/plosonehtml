Cells were stimulated for 60 hours with 20 µM phenylephrine (PE), or left un-stimulated for the same period. <em>Inset</em>: Western blot analysis of HEK-293T cells transfected either with the parent plasmid or a plasmid expressing hTrpC3 C-terminally tagged with Myc and 6x-His epitopes. The band shown is ~100 kDa. (<em>B</em>) Luciferase measurements of myocytes containing plasmids encoding shRNAs targeting TrpC3 or LacZ and expression plasmids expressing hTrpC3 or an empty vector. hTrpC3 expression prevents the reduction of BNP expression caused by TrpC3-shRNA expression. For both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, n = 6 biological replicates per condition. * indicates statistically significant difference compared to control, P&lt;0.005. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean±SEM.</p>
