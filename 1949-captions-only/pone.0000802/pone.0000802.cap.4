Size is shown as percent increase compared to the size of unstimulated myocytes expressing negative control shRNA (the <em>left column</em>). Cell size was measured using an automated fluorescence microscope and analysis program. For each condition, n &gt;1000 transfected myocytes analyzed. <em>Columns 2–4</em> were each significantly different than <em>column 1</em>, P&lt;0.001. <em>Columns 2</em> and <em>4</em> (PE-stimulated myocytes expressing negative control shRNA or TrpC3-shRNA, respectively) are not significantly different from each other. (<em>B</em>) The results in <em>A</em> were confirmed by using manual-measurements of myocyte cell size in cells stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours. Cells expressing TrpC3-shRNA were not significantly different in size than those expressing LacZ-shRNA. n = 125 cells per condition. (<em>C</em>) Examples of myocytes expressing negative control shRNA (left) and TrpC3-shRNA (right) used in the manual measurement of cell size. Myocytes were stained with anti-α-actinin antibody (green), and cells that were expressing shRNAs are red. (<em>D</em>) Myocytes expressing LacZ- or TrpC3-shRNAs were stimulated with 20 µM PE for 60 hours and then fixed, immunostained with anti-ANP antibody, and measured simultaneously for cell size and ANP-immunofluorescence. TrpC3-shRNA had no effect on cell size (<em>columns 2</em> and <em>3</em>), but significantly decreased ANP expression (data displayed in Fig. 2<em>F</em>). Average n = 31 cells per condition. * indicates statistically significant difference compared to control, P&lt;0.0001. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean±SEM.</p>
