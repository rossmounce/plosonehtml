Cells were stimulated for 48 hours with PE to induce hypertrophy. The majority of cells display a punctate and perinuclear pattern of TrpC3-YFP (example shown in <em>A</em>, <em>left panel</em>). Co-staining with anti-α-actinin antibodies (<em>A</em>, <em>right panel</em>) reveals the localization of the Z-lines, which are closely apposed to the t-tubules. Magnifying a merge of the TrpC3-YFP and anti-α-actinin images (<em>A</em>, <em>inset</em>) shows little overlap between TrpC3-YFP puncta and the Z-lines. In some transfected myocytes, TrpC3-YFP puncta are completely excluded from the Z-lines (example shown in <em>B</em>, <em>inset</em>). (<em>C</em>) TrpC3-YFP expressed in a serum-starved, un-hypertrophied myocyte (<em>left panel</em>) is also distributed in puncta. The same punctate pattern is also observed in hypertrophied myocytes (<em>right panel</em>) expressing TrpC3 with an N-terminal YFP tag (YFP-TrpC3). (<em>D</em>) Live myocytes co-transfected with CFP-Myr (a marker of the plasma membrane) and TrpC3-YFP were imaged by epifluorecence and total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy. CFP-Myr imaged by epifluorescence (<em>left panel</em>) illustrates the extent of the plasma membrane. A TIRF image of TrpC3-YFP (<em>right panel</em>) indicates that, in live myocytes, tagged TrpC3 is found in puncta within 200 nm of the cell surface.</p>
