A. Median baseline concentration of interleukin-10 (exposed to nil control) stratified by the baseline concentration of interferon-gamma (exposed to nil control) (2.8 vs. 3.0 pg/mL for the low [&lt;0.07 IU/mL] and high [≥0.07 IU/mL] interferon-gamma concentrations; p = 0.263). B. Median increases in the interleukin-10 concentration stratified by increases in the interferon-gamma concentration after exposure to either of the antigens (0.3 vs. 0 pg/mL for the smaller [&lt;0.01 IU/mL] and larger [≥0.01 IU/mL] increases in the interferon-gamma concentrations; p = 0.004).</p>
