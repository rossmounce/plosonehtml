(B) The ratio of number of correlation coefficients in the experimental data to the random case for bin in <a href="#pone-0000804-g001">Figureô 1A</a>. At high correlations, the number of microRNA-mRNA pairs is larger than expected in the random case. This result suggests information exists in the correlation coefficients between miRNAs and mRNAs.</p>
