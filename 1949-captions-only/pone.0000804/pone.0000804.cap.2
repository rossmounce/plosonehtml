                Figure 2.  Percentage of predicted targets across a range of correlation coefficients.The percentage of targets over the range of correlation defined in Figure√¥ 1 decreases with the increasing correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs. This implies that the correlation indeed captures information about target prediction, and the negative slope might be related to direct targeting effect between miRNAs and mRNAs.
