                Figure 5.  Experimental Validation of Highly correlated miRNA/transcript pairs.The above figure represents Ctscrambled-Ctpre-mir/2′-O-Me from three individual transfection experiments of pre-miR-181c, pre-miR-182, 2′-O-Me-miR-19a, 2′-O-Me-scrambled and pre-mir-scrambled. PCAF, ASCC1, FADS2, HPS1, ANXA4, GSTO1, IFITM1, DDX11, TTC3 and PRR13 levels were determined after transfection.
