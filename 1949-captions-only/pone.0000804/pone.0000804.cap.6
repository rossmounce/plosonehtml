                Figure 6.  Immunoblot analysis of miR-181c treated cells.Immunoblots of U251 and U87 transfected cells transfected with either miR-181c pre-miRNA or a scrambled sequence. PCAF (A) and p53 (C) were immunodetected and actin was used as a loading control. Quantification of the immunoblots showed a significant difference in B and C (p&lt;0.01, t-test in all three comparisons).
