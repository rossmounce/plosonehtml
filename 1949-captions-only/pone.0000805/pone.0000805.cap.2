TST induration was significantly higher in HCWs with radiological lesions suggestive of possible active TB (p=0.03), as compared to those with normal CXR. With the individuals with a normal CXR as the reference, the mean IFN-g values (IU/mL) in the groups with calcified nodules alone, other inactive lesions, and lesions suggestion of active TB were not statistically significantly (p values 0.34, 0.63 and 0.91 respectively)</p>
