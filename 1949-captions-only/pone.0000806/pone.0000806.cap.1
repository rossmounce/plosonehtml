                Figure 1.  Local RBC flux is increased in the post-contraction muscle of control but not of mdx mice.Using in vivo video-microscopy, the numbers of RBC passing by through the primary arterioles (1st order) in control (a) and mdx (b) mice were counted and plotted against time (minutes) after a tetanic stimulation (50Hz). The y-axis represents the percent increase in the RBC number from the basal (100%) RBC flux. (a) In response to the direct tetanic stimulation on the muscles of control mice, arterioles both at junctional (NMJ, closed square, red solid line), and extrajunctional (non-NMJ, open circle, black solid line) areas showed a transient increase in the RBC. The contralateral side of the control mice (closed triangle, dash-dotted line) did not show any increase in the RBC flux, suggesting that the increase in RBC flux is the specific effect of contraction. (b) The response in RBC flux was completely absent in mdx mice (NMJ: closed square, red solid line, and non-NMJ: open circle, black solid line). RBC flux was increased in mdx mice by a local administration of SNAP (open square, red dash-dotted line), clenbuterol (closed diamond and greed solid line), or 8-CPT cGMP (closed diamond and blue dash-dotted line). Addition of 1 Âµg/ml of angiotensin-II (ATII) inhibited the 8-CPT cGMP-induced increase in RBC flux (open diamond, blue dash-dotted line). Addition of ATII transiently dropped the RBC flux below 50% of the basal level and the values (1.1% for 1min and 17.4% for 2 min) are indicated as numbers adjacent to each point. Unless otherwise specified, measurements were performed on arterioles in non-NMJ areas. ** and ***: Statistically significant difference from contralateral side in control mice (a) or from mdx mice without any treatment (b) by ANOVA (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively). n.s. Not significantly different from contralateral side by ANOVA (a). # and ##: Statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05 and 0.01) between NMJ and non-NMJ by Student-t test (a). Standard errors are shown as bars at each time point. The number of individual animals in each group is indicated in the parenthesis.
