Warmer colors correspond to higher intensity (note scale bar on right side). NO or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by stimulated myofibers reacts with DAF-FM (left column) or H<sub>2</sub>-DCFDA (right column) respectively, and releases a fluorescence signal. The longitudinal area between the two black arrows in the microscopic image corresponds to an individual myofiber (row1, Cont, no Stim). Myofibers in the control muscles produce a prominent amount of NO (left) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (right) in response to tetanic stimuli (50Hz), shown as Cont, Tet (row 2). The spot-like staining showed an increased production of NO in response to muscle contraction (“Cont, Tet” in the left column, examples pointed by a black arrow head), but were not prominent with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal (right column). A non-specific NOS inhibitor L-NAME (row3, left), or combination of EDHF inhibitors apamin and charybdotoxin (row 3, right), perturbed production of NO or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively, after tetanic stimulation (Cont, Tet+Inhibitors). Although the basal level of NO production in the <em>mdx</em> muscle is high (row 4, left column, <em>Mdx</em>, no Stim, p = 0.004 by Student-t test), muscles in these mice do not show an increase in the NO (row 5, left) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (row 5, right) production in response to muscle contraction (<em>Mdx</em>, Tet). <em>Mdx</em> mice showed greater numbers of spot-like staining for NO (examples pointed by a white arrow head) as compared to control mice, but these spots did not show an increase in intensity after muscle contraction. (b&amp;c) The quantification data of the detected signal of NO (b) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(c) in the sternomastoid muscles are shown. Average fluorescence released by myocytes was calculated by densitometry of the captured images from <em>in vivo</em> microscopy on different mice (the numbers of animals in each group indicated in the bottom row). The y-axis represents the percent increase in the arbitrary fluorescence unit per 30 (b) or 60 (c) minutes of observation. **: Statistically significant by ANOVA (P&lt;0.01). n.s.: Not statistically significant. #: Statistically significant between the basal level of control and <em>mdx</em> mice (P&lt;0.05). Error bars show standard error of each value.</p>
