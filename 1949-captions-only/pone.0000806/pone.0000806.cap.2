                Figure 2.   In vivo microscopic measurement of muscle production of NO and H2O2 in control and mdx mice after tetanic stimulation.(a) In vivo microscopic views of fluorescent signal (100×) are presented with pseudocolors added according to the fluorescent intensity of the signals (a). Warmer colors correspond to higher intensity (note scale bar on right side). NO or H2O2 produced by stimulated myofibers reacts with DAF-FM (left column) or H2-DCFDA (right column) respectively, and releases a fluorescence signal. The longitudinal area between the two black arrows in the microscopic image corresponds to an individual myofiber (row1, Cont, no Stim). Myofibers in the control muscles produce a prominent amount of NO (left) and H2O2 (right) in response to tetanic stimuli (50Hz), shown as Cont, Tet (row 2). The spot-like staining showed an increased production of NO in response to muscle contraction (“Cont, Tet” in the left column, examples pointed by a black arrow head), but were not prominent with H2O2 signal (right column). A non-specific NOS inhibitor L-NAME (row3, left), or combination of EDHF inhibitors apamin and charybdotoxin (row 3, right), perturbed production of NO or H2O2, respectively, after tetanic stimulation (Cont, Tet+Inhibitors). Although the basal level of NO production in the mdx muscle is high (row 4, left column, Mdx, no Stim, p = 0.004 by Student-t test), muscles in these mice do not show an increase in the NO (row 5, left) or H2O2 (row 5, right) production in response to muscle contraction (Mdx, Tet). Mdx mice showed greater numbers of spot-like staining for NO (examples pointed by a white arrow head) as compared to control mice, but these spots did not show an increase in intensity after muscle contraction. (b&amp;c) The quantification data of the detected signal of NO (b) and H2O2 (c) in the sternomastoid muscles are shown. Average fluorescence released by myocytes was calculated by densitometry of the captured images from in vivo microscopy on different mice (the numbers of animals in each group indicated in the bottom row). The y-axis represents the percent increase in the arbitrary fluorescence unit per 30 (b) or 60 (c) minutes of observation. **: Statistically significant by ANOVA (P&lt;0.01). n.s.: Not statistically significant. #: Statistically significant between the basal level of control and mdx mice (P&lt;0.05). Error bars show standard error of each value.
