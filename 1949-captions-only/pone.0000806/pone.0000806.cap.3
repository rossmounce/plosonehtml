(a) Intact cells in control mice with no treatment showed a normal striated pattern of staining of M/ER with DiOC<sub>6</sub> (Intact myofibers, control mouse#1). (b) Already dead myofibers (killed by electrical ablasion 1 hour before the experiment) are not stained and excluded from the study. (c) When cells are induced to death by combination of severe ischemia (L-NAME, apamin, charybdotoxin, and vascular oppression) and strenuous contraction (12 times repeat of tetanic stimuli), distribution of these DiOC<sub>6</sub>-stained compartments becomes granular (arrow heads) or bulged (arrows), or exhibit a rippled pattern (asterisk). Each image is in focus. Cell death identified by abnormal DiOC<sub>6</sub> labeling was confirmed by dye-exclusion staining with short exposure to Hoechst33258 (blue color at endpoint in each group). The black scale bar in the figure represents 10 Âµm.</p>
