                Figure 3.   In vivo microscopic assay of myofiber damage.Identical positions of the myofibers were traced by examining the anatomy of the individual myofibers (stained green), and/or the shape and relative location of NMJs (stained red by BTX-Alexa Fluor 594). (a) Intact cells in control mice with no treatment showed a normal striated pattern of staining of M/ER with DiOC6 (Intact myofibers, control mouse#1). (b) Already dead myofibers (killed by electrical ablasion 1 hour before the experiment) are not stained and excluded from the study. (c) When cells are induced to death by combination of severe ischemia (L-NAME, apamin, charybdotoxin, and vascular oppression) and strenuous contraction (12 times repeat of tetanic stimuli), distribution of these DiOC6-stained compartments becomes granular (arrow heads) or bulged (arrows), or exhibit a rippled pattern (asterisk). Each image is in focus. Cell death identified by abnormal DiOC6 labeling was confirmed by dye-exclusion staining with short exposure to Hoechst33258 (blue color at endpoint in each group). The black scale bar in the figure represents 10 Âµm.
