                Figure 4.  Replenishing NO prevents contraction-induced myofiber cell death.Mdx mice (open circle and black solid line, N = 6) showed progressive increase of damaged loci over the time course of 6 hours after a 6 times repeat of the tetanic stimuli (X-axis: time after tetanic contraction. Y-axis: damaged myofiber loci counted throughout the entire tissue). For quantification of myofiber damage, the numbers of damaged sites (loci) were counted instead of numbers of the damaged fibers, because there are various types and different locus onset of damage along the length of a myofiber (see Methods for detail). Administration of SNAP (NO donor, 100 µM) prevented the mdx mice fibers from undergoing contraction-induced damage (open square and red dash-dotted line, N = 5). In the groups where 8-CPT-cGMP (“cGMP”, 500 µM, closed diamond and blue dash-dotted line, N = 5), clenbuterol (“Clen”, 0.05 mg/ml, closed diamond and green solid line, N = 4), or tadalafil (“Tada”, 4 mg/kgBW, cross and orange solid line, N = 5) was given during muscle contraction, the increase in myofiber damage was abolished. Addition of 1 µg/ml of angiotensin-II (ATII) inhibited the myofiber protective effect by 8-CPT-cGMP (open diamond and blue dash-dotted line, N = 6). ATII alone did not cause myofiber damage (open diamond and blue dotted line, N = 4). Control mice with (closed triangle and blue solid line, N = 4) or without (open triangle and pink solid line, N = 6) SNAP administration did not show increase in myofiber damage. Statistical differences are indicated between mdx without drug treatment (black open circle) and all other groups except for 8-CPT cGMP plus ATII (**: p&lt;0.01, ***:p&lt;0.001), or all other groups except for 8-CPT cGMP or 8-CPT cGMP plus ATII (++: p&lt;0.01) by ANOVA. There was a statistically significant difference between groups with 8-CPT cGMP and with 8-CPT cGMP plus ATII (#: p&lt;0.05, ##: p&lt;0.01) by Student-t test. There was no significant difference between groups without any treatment (black open circle) and with 8-CPT cGMP plus ATII (blue open diamond) at any time point. Error bars in the graph are the standard errors to each value. All the drugs are removed and tissues are washed after muscle contraction. N refers to the number of animals used for each treatment.
