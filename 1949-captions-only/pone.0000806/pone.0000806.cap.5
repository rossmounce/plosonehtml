For quantification of myofiber damage, the numbers of damaged sites (loci) were counted instead of numbers of the damaged fibers, because there are different types of damage observed along the length of a myofiber (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> for detail). When ischemia stress was provided by applying L-NAME, apamin plus charybdotoxin (ChTx), and vascular oppression, control mice showed progressive increase in the amount of muscle damage (closed diamond and black solid line) under the application of increased stimuli (12 times). However, when L-NAME (open square and red dotted line), apamin plus charybdotoxin (closed triangle and blue solid line), or vascular oppression (open diamond and orange dotted line) was lacking, a comparable amount of myofiber injury was not achieved. Even when all reagents were present, the amount of myofiber damage was minimal without tetanic contraction (closed square and pink solid line). Tetanic stimulation and vascular oppression alone did not cause significant myofiber destruction (open circle and green dotted line). Six times stimuli applied in control mice (X mark and blue dash-dotted line) did not induce an equivalent amount of myofiber damage as compared to 12 times control (black diamond) or to 6 times <em>mdx</em> mice (<a href="#pone-0000806-g004">Figure 4</a>, open black circle). N = 5 mice for each treatment. *:p&lt;0.05, **:p&lt;0.01, by ANOVA. Standard errors are shown as bars added to each point.</p>
