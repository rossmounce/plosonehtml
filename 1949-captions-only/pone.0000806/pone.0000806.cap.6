                Figure 6.  Comparison of total RBC flux increase in control and mdx mice in response to tetanic stimulation and pharmacological agents.Total RBC flux increase was calculated as an integral of % change in RBC flux after stimulation. Tetanic stimulation increased the flux to 653.2 (%Ã—min, far left column) in control mice. Administration of L-NAME (2nd column), apamin plus charybdotoxin (3rd), or vascular oppression (5th) suppressed the increase in RBC flux. When all the above treatments were combined, RBC flux was further suppressed (6th). The level of ischemia in the control mice receiving all the combination (6th) was more severe as compared to mdx mice (far right). N = 8 mice, for each treatment. * and **: Statistically significant difference from all other treatments (p&lt;0.05 and 0.01, ANOVA). ##: Statistically significant difference between the two groups (p&lt;0.01, t-test). Standard error bars are added to the histogram.
