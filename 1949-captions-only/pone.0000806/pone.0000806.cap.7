                Figure 7.  Evans Blue staining of the damaged fibers in the hindlimb and the diaphragm muscles of mdx mice (4 weeks old).(a&amp;b) Six hours after the injection of Evans Blue dye, the extent of myofiber damage as indicated by blue staining was observed in the superficial hindlimb muscles (a) and the diaphragm (b). Three mice from each group are shown (a and b). Compare lateral and medial views of the stained fibers (arrows) in mice without (−) and with (+) tadalafil treatment (a). Mice without tadalafil treatment (−) show extensive blue staining (arrows in a and b). Tadalafil treatment (+) ameliorated the damage in the same muscle tissues, although it did not completely suppress the myofiber damage in some mdx mice. (c) Gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and diaphragm muscles were harvested and cryosectioned for fluorescence microscopic observation. In the non-treated group (Mdx#1 and #2 in c), all the muscles studied showed increased numbers of damaged myofibers stained by the injected dye (high fluorescence signals are shown in white). Tadalafil treatment reduced the numbers of damaged myofibers (Mdx#3 and #4 in c). The white scale bar at the bottom of images represents 100 µm for gastrocnemius, gluteus, and quadriceps, and 50 µm for diaphragm. (d) The number of positively stained damaged myofibers (in c) were counted and shown as bar graphs for the entire gastrocnemius, gluteus, and quadriceps muscles. For diaphragm muscles, the positively stained myofibers are shown as percentage of the total fiber count. Mdx mice without treatment (N = 10, white columns) showed extensive amount of myofiber damage. Tadalafil treatment (N = 8, columns shaded with hatched lines) showed a statistically significant decrease in the amount of damaged myofibers in gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus, and quadriceps muscles. *: p&lt;0.05, **&lt;p&lt;0.01 by t-test. N refers to the number of animals used for each treatment.
