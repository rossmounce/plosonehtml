                Figure 8.  Evaluation of the efficacy of tadalafil by conventional histology.(a) Two images from different animals in tadalafil-treated and non-treated groups are presented for trichrome staining of gastrocnemius muscles (left panels): Ectopic fibrosis in extensively damaged areas was observed in the non-treated group (−) (yellow arrows). In the treatment group (+), there are still damaged fibers and ectopic fibrosis observed, but not to the level seen in the non-treated group. In H&amp;E staining of gastrocnemius muscles (right panels), non-treated mdx mice showed many basophilic (purple) small cells reminiscent of infiltrating cells, proliferating fibroblasts/myoblasts, and tadalafil-treated group showed less. Myofibers with central nuclei, suggestive of regenerating fibers, are basophilic and prominent in the non-treated group, but were also observed in the treated group. Heterogeneity of fiber size was more prominent in the non-treated group. Yellow diamond arrows with “C” point to myofibers with central nuclei. Black scale bars on each micrograph image represent 50 µm. (b) The area size for ectopic fibrosis with blue staining was calculated in pixel size (n = 6 and 5 for non-treatment and tadalafil treatment groups). Tadalafil significantly reduced the amount of fibrosis in gastrocnemius (GC), gluteus (Glut), quadriceps (Quad), and diaphragm (Diaph) muscles (*: p&lt;0.05 by t-test). (c) The percentage of myofibers with central nuclei is shown in a histogram. Tadalafil treatment reduced the percentage of central nuclei (*:p&lt;0.05, **:p&lt;0.01 by t-test) (d) The variation in fiber size in gastrocnemius muscles was quantified and shown as percentage fiber distribution. In non-treated mdx mice, the fiber size was uneven ranging from small (&lt;300 µm2) to large (&gt;2800 µm2) cross sectional area. Tadalafil treatment reduced the variation by lowering the percentage of small myofibers (*: p&lt;0.05 by t-test)
