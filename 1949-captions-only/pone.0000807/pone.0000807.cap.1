Each 11bp-long sequence, located in the interval [+200, −1000] bp with respect to the TSS on the promoters of 22,000 human genes, was scored using the PSSM of the TATA box. Scores above −10.4 were identified as hits and marked by a point whose horizontal coordinate represents the location of the hit and the vertical coordinate represents the value of its score. The high density of hits at about 25 and 35bp upstream from the TSS identifies these locations as most likely to be functionally relevant. The 3 colored dotted lines represent 3 different thresholds (T) and the numbers next to each one of them are the % of TATA BS that were found in the location window [−100,TSS]. B. The GC content as a function of location in the interval [+200, −1000] bp with respect to the TSS. The vertical axis represents the percentage of promoters of 22,000 human genes that have a G or a C at each location. Pronounced dips are observed at the TATA box and at the TSS. C. Distribution of identified hits obtained for various values of the threshold, marked by red, green and blue horizontal lines on <a href="#pone-0000807-g001">Fig 1A</a>, with the % of hits found within the proximal peak also given there, for each threshold. As the threshold increases, the overall number of hits decreases, but the relative weight of the proximal peak increases from 8% (for threshold <em>T = </em>−10.6) to 27% (for <em>T</em> = −6.5). D. Our method identified BSs on 55 out of 81 promoters known to have proximal TATA BSs (see <a href="#pone.0000807.s007">text</a>), in the window [TSS, −100], and none in any of the other location windows (red dot). The threshold selected by our method was −10.27; if this threshold is used uniformly in the entire [200, −1000] interval, about 250 hits are found outside the first upstream interval. The black dots denote the number of hits in and outside the first window, with the numbers next to each point indicating the value of the uniform threshold used. The blue point shows the hits found by Xie et al, demonstrating that their conservation-based method is also effective in eliminating false positives, but has a much larger number of false negatives than our method.</p>
