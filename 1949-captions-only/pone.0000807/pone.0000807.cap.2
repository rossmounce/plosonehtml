                Figure 2.  Our method of search for BSs.A. Schematic method of search: we used groups of human genes that belong to 134 different functional GO classes G, to search for each one of 414 motifs M in twelve 100bp-long windows W in the interval [+200, −1000] bp with respect to the TSS. In total, 414×134×12 = 665,712 independent analyses were carried out, one for every (M,G,W) combination, represented as a path through the top three layers of boxes. Each analysis produced the number of genes of G for which the score of M in the window W exceeded a threshold T. The extent of over-representation of such hits was assessed by the hypergeometric test, which compared their number with similar hits in a random selection of |G| out of all 8,110 human genes used. A variation of the resulting p-values p (M,G,W) with the threshold T was studied. All resulting p-values were submitted to FDR analysis, and the statistically significant (M,G,W) combinations were intersected with those that were found significant also in mouse. B. The dependence of –log[ p (M,G,W)] on the score threshold T is shown for 12 windows, for G = Mitosis GO class and M = NFY1. For the window [TSS, −100] bp we get a very prominent peak, for the windows in [−100, −300] bp the peak is much smaller and broader, and for the other windows it is within the noise. We find significant enrichment for the [TSS,−100] window, with the optimal threshold derived from the location of the peak.
