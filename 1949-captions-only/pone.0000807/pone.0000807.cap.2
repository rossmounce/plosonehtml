Schematic method of search: we used groups of human genes that belong to 134 different functional GO classes <em>G</em>, to search for each one of 414 motifs <em>M</em> in twelve 100bp-long windows <em>W</em> in the interval [+200, −1000] bp with respect to the TSS. In total, 414×134×12 = 665,712 independent analyses were carried out, one for every (<em>M,G,W</em>) combination, represented as a path through the top three layers of boxes. Each analysis produced the number of genes of <em>G</em> for which the score of <em>M</em> in the window <em>W</em> exceeded a threshold <em>T</em>. The extent of over-representation of such hits was assessed by the hypergeometric test, which compared their number with similar hits in a random selection of |<em>G</em>| out of all 8,110 human genes used. A variation of the resulting p-values <em>p (M,G,W)</em> with the threshold <em>T</em> was studied. All resulting p-values were submitted to FDR analysis, and the statistically significant (<em>M,G,W</em>) combinations were intersected with those that were found significant also in mouse. B. The dependence of –log[ <em>p (M,G,W)</em>] on the score threshold <em>T</em> is shown for 12 windows, for <em>G</em> = Mitosis GO class and <em>M</em> = NFY1. For the window [TSS, −100] bp we get a very prominent peak, for the windows in [−100, −300] bp the peak is much smaller and broader, and for the other windows it is within the noise. We find significant enrichment for the [TSS,−100] window, with the optimal threshold derived from the location of the peak.</p>
