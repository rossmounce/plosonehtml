                Figure 3.  Summary of our main results.A. Using FDR of 0.1 we identify the over-representation of motif M on promoters of genes of functional GO class G, in location window W. Each row corresponds to one of 333 (M,G) pairs, composed of 56 GO classes and 159 motifs. Each bar represents an MGLC: grey–either human only or mouse only, and black-human and mouse. The 56 GO clusters divide into two groups, a “general GO group” of 52 GO classes and a “transcriptional GO group” of 4 GO classes. The motifs M of the latter are GC-rich–see first column, where orange denotes GC content above 60%, blue–below 30% and white–between both these values. B. Number of conserved MGLCs of the General GO group, in each window. 93% are in the [−200,0] bp range. C. Same for the transcriptional GO group. The distribution is broad and peaks between 300–500bp upstream from the TSS. D. Distributions of BSs according to their GC content, plotted separately for BSs associated with the two GO groups.
