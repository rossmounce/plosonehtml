                Figure 4.  Testing our results for human cell cycle expression data.A. For 60 groups of genes (each group defined by BS found for one of the 5 cell cycle associated motifs in one of the 12 location windows, see text) the distribution of the expression-based CCP scores [51] was compared to a reference background distribution. The resulting 60 p-values are plotted for the different motifs versus their location window. All 5 motifs get p-values less than 0.05 and also pass at FDR of 0.10. Two windows, [0, −100] and [−100, −200] bp, are most significantly over-represented. B. Significant sequence-based hyper-geometric over-representation scores for each of the motif-window combinations. A grey bar represents a significant score (MGLC) for human or mouse, for at least one of the cell-cycle related GO classes. A black bar stands for an MGLC in both human and mouse.
