A graphic representation of four constructs encoding a luciferase reporter (<em>luc</em>) gene under the regulation of three tandem repeats of a region from the SM22 promoter, each of which contained either an intact (<em>wt</em> in yellow ) or a mutated (<em>m</em> in red) BS of the Myocardin transcription factor. The intact motif is placed at different distances from the TSS in each construct. B. Fold activation of the luciferase construct, calculated as the ratio of promoter activity in the presence of Myocardin to the promoter activity in the absence of Myocardin. The <em>“m-m-wt-luc”</em> reporter was strongly activated by Myocardin. In contrast, the Myocardin-dependent activation of <em>“m-wt-m-luc”</em> and <em>“wt-m-m-luc”</em> was significantly weaker.</p>
