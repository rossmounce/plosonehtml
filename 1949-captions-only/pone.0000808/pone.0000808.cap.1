As a loading control, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (lower panel) prior to the northern blot analysis B) Lymphocytes from spleen were stimulated with combinations of IL-2 and anti-CD3 for two hours. Total RNA was used to perform quantitative real-time RT-PCR with gene specific primers and probes, to CSRNP-1, -2 and -3. Expression level were calculated from a standard curve made of serially diluted plasmids encoding each genes and normalized to the amount of ribosomal 18S RNA.</p>
