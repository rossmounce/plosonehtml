                Figure 2.  Sequence alignment and primary structure analysis of CSRNP proteins.A) Similarity plot from multiple proteins alignment of CSRNP family proteins. RefSeq from GenBank are as follow: M. musculus (m) CSRNP-1 (NP_695019), H. sapiens (h) AXUD1 (NP_149016), mCSRNP-2 (NP_700456), hCSRNP-2 (NP_110436), mCSRNP-3 (NP_700458), hCSRNP-3 (NP_079245), D. melanogaster CG4272 (NP_608673) and C. elegans C41D11.3 (NP_491368). The plot represents the running average of the similarity among the sequences based on a multiple sequence alignment (blosum62 scoring matrix, 10 amino acid comparison windows). The average similarity across the entire alignment is plotted as a dotted line. B) Schematic representation of the primary structures of CSRNP family members with depiction of particular features. C) Multiple sequence alignment of the conserved cysteine (arrows) rich motif.
