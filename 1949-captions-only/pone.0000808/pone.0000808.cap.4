Flag-tagged version of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 were ectopically expressed in 293T cells, proteins were analyzed by western blot with the anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibodies. B) Immunofluorescence analysis of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 proteins in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. CSRNP proteins were by stained with the anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibodies and visualized with anti-mouse secondary antibody (red). Nuclei were visualized by staining DNA with DAPI (blue). C) Transcription activity of CSRNP proteins in 293T cells. Transcriptional activity of CSRNP-1 was determined by fusing various regions of CSRNP-1 protein to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor. The constructs were transfected in 293T cells with a GAL4-luciferase reporter and a CMV-β-galactosidase reporter constructs. Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the the β-galactosidase activities. D) Transcription activity of CSRNP proteins in yeast cells. AH109 cells were transformed as indicated with the CSRNP-1, -2 or -3 GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions, GAL4p53 (positive control) or GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone (negative control). Transcription activity of the GAL4 fusions was determine by comparative growth assay of serially diluted AH109 transformed cells onto non-selective (left) minimal SD base minus tryptophan (TRP) plate or selective (right) SD minus TRP, minus adenine (ADE), minus histidine (HIS) plus 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopy​ranoside(X-α-Gal). The TRP marked plasmid was maintained under selection for tryptophan.</p>
