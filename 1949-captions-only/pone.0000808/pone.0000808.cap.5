A) CSRNP-1 (GeneID: 215418), B) CSRNP-2 (GeneID: 207785) and C) CSRNP-3 (GeneID: 77771). Neo, neomycin resistance cassette; DTA, diphtheria toxin cassette. Position of the probes used for southern blotting and of the primers (P1 to P8, arrow heads) used for PCR-based genotyping are also shown. D–E) Southern blot analysis of <em>Xba</em>I (D), <em>Sac</em>I (E) or <em>Xho</em>I (F) digested genomic DNA from tail biopsies. Blot was hybridizes with the external probe indicated in (A to C respectively). G–I). Total thymocyte lysates (G–H) or brain homogenates (I) and 293T cells ectopically expressing Flag-tagged version of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3, were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptides derived from CSRNP-1 (G), CSRNP-2 (H) or CSRNP-3(I). Specific signals are indicated by arrows.</p>
