                Figure 5.  Targeted disruption of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 in mice.A-C) Schematic representation of the CSRNP-1, -2 or -3 genomic loci and of the targeting constructs. A) CSRNP-1 (GeneID: 215418), B) CSRNP-2 (GeneID: 207785) and C) CSRNP-3 (GeneID: 77771). Neo, neomycin resistance cassette; DTA, diphtheria toxin cassette. Position of the probes used for southern blotting and of the primers (P1 to P8, arrow heads) used for PCR-based genotyping are also shown. D–E) Southern blot analysis of XbaI (D), SacI (E) or XhoI (F) digested genomic DNA from tail biopsies. Blot was hybridizes with the external probe indicated in (A to C respectively). G–I). Total thymocyte lysates (G–H) or brain homogenates (I) and 293T cells ectopically expressing Flag-tagged version of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3, were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptides derived from CSRNP-1 (G), CSRNP-2 (H) or CSRNP-3(I). Specific signals are indicated by arrows.
