Splenocytes were seeded a density of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and stimulated with anti-CD3 and IL-2, thereafter, the cultures were kept in IL-2-containing media. Viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue staining every 2–3 days and the cells were split back to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. The data shown represent the average of three animals per genotype. B) Activated T cells grown in the presence of IL-2 for 7 days were IL-2-depreived overnight and then stimulated with increasing amounts of IL-2 for 48 hours, then DNA synthesis was determined by pulsing with [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine for 16 hours. C) Activated T cells grown in the presence of IL-2 for 5 days were then stimulated overnight with plate-bound anti-CD3, viability was determined by trypan blue staining. D) Thymocytes were either gamma-irradiated (IR) with 500 rad or treated with 1 µM of dexamethasone (DEX) or 1 µg/mL anti-FAS, 20 hours later viability was determined by propidium iodine exclusion using flow cytometry. E) Cytokine secretion by activated T cells. T cells were purified by MACS and left unstimulated or treated with plate-bound anti-CD3 for 2 days. Thereafter, supernatant were harvested and cytokine secreted in the media were measured using Bio-Plex technology. There were no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) between any genotypes in any of these graphs.</p>
