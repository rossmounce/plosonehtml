                Figure 9.  CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 genes have redundant function required for mice survival.Comparison of the observed distribution of genotypes to the expected frequency for offspring obtained from CSRNP-1−/−/CSRNP-2+/−/CSRNP-3+/− breeder pairs at A) 4 weeks and B) birth. C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of CSRNP-1−/−/CSRNP-2−/−/CSRNP-3−/− triple knockouts. D) Normal morphological phenotype of CSRNP-1−/−/CSRNP-2−/−/CSRNP-3−/− triple knockout newborn with the exception of the absence of milk in their stomach. E–F) Comparison of the observed distribution of genotypes to the expected frequency for offspring obtained from CSRNP-1+/−/CSRNP-2−/−/CSRNP-3+/− and CSRNP-1+/−/CSRNP-2+/−/CSRNP-3−/− breeder pairs at 4 weeks, respectively. Chi square test were performed to determine the significance of differences between the expected and observed distributions.
