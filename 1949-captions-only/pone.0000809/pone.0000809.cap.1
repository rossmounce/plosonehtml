All images taken at 20×10 magnification. (B) (top) levels of <em>Gad1</em> mRNA (y-axis, log scale), expressed relative to <em>18S</em> rRNA and (middle and bottom) chip-to-input ratios (y-axis, log scale) of site-specific histone methylation (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in the nucleosomes positioned −374 to −273 bp of rat <em>Gad1</em> promoter. Data expressed as mean +/− S.E.M., with N = 3 for each of the three different culture conditions. Notice robust increase of <em>Gad1</em> mRNA and H3K4me3 levels in differentiated cultures (−FGF2+VA), in comparison to undifferentiated cells (+FGF2); that treatment with the antipsychotic clozapine did not affect histone methylation and <em>Gad1</em> gene expression in cultured neurons. VA = Valproic acid, Clz = Clozapine.</p>
