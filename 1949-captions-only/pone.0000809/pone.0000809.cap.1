                Figure 1.  Histone methylation changes at the Gad1 promoter in a neuronal differentiation assay.(A) (a–j) Digitized images showing (a–c) undifferentiated neural precursors grown in FGF2 (fibroblast growthfactor 2)-containing medium and (d–j) neurons differentiated in medium without FGF2 but with VA (sodium valproate); notice that precursors (a) , but not neurons (d) are defined by nestin immunoreactivity, while both type of cells express robust H3K4me3 immunoreactivity (c,f); (g,i) representative examples of neuronal marker (g, NeuN and i, GABA) immunoreactivity. All images taken at 20×10 magnification. (B) (top) levels of Gad1 mRNA (y-axis, log scale), expressed relative to 18S rRNA and (middle and bottom) chip-to-input ratios (y-axis, log scale) of site-specific histone methylation (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in the nucleosomes positioned −374 to −273 bp of rat Gad1 promoter. Data expressed as mean +/− S.E.M., with N = 3 for each of the three different culture conditions. Notice robust increase of Gad1 mRNA and H3K4me3 levels in differentiated cultures (−FGF2+VA), in comparison to undifferentiated cells (+FGF2); that treatment with the antipsychotic clozapine did not affect histone methylation and Gad1 gene expression in cultured neurons. VA = Valproic acid, Clz = Clozapine.
