Percentage of methylated <em>GAD1</em> CpG residues in DNA from immunoprecipitates (y-axis, • , anti-H3K4me3; △ , anti-H3K27me3) for 12 CpG's (shown in red) positioned between bp-1150 to +3400 relative to <em>GAD1</em> transcription start site. Primer pairs marked by arrows (<em>N</em> = 3–15 control subjects/CpG dinucleotide); (lower panel) averaged levels of methylation for each of the 12 <em>GAD1</em> CpG residues (see Fig. 2, upper panel) in schizophrenia subjects (S) , expressed relative to control, C (S/C, y-axis). Notice decreased methylation of 5/8 CpG's at the <em>GAD1</em> promoter of schizophrenia subjects (<em>B,C</em>) Averaged frequency of DNA methylation at across the 8 CpG's at the <em>GAD1</em> (<em>B</em>) proximal promoter (see Fig. 2A, upper panel) and (<em>C</em>) intron no. 2 in schizophrenia and matched control subjects, as indicated (<em>N</em> = 12 clones/primer pair/case or control). Data shown for open (“K4” = H3Kme3) and repressive (“K27” = H3K27me3) chromatin separately. Notice significant deficit in repressive chromatin-associated DNA methylation at the <em>GAD1</em> promoter in schizophrenia subjects.</p>
