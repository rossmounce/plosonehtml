                Figure 2.   GAD1 DNA methylation in prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia and comparison subjects.(A) (upper panel) GAD1 DNA methylation profile in open (H4K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) chromatin. Percentage of methylated GAD1 CpG residues in DNA from immunoprecipitates (y-axis, • , anti-H3K4me3; △ , anti-H3K27me3) for 12 CpG's (shown in red) positioned between bp-1150 to +3400 relative to GAD1 transcription start site. Primer pairs marked by arrows (N = 3–15 control subjects/CpG dinucleotide); (lower panel) averaged levels of methylation for each of the 12 GAD1 CpG residues (see Fig. 2, upper panel) in schizophrenia subjects (S) , expressed relative to control, C (S/C, y-axis). Notice decreased methylation of 5/8 CpG's at the GAD1 promoter of schizophrenia subjects (B,C) Averaged frequency of DNA methylation at across the 8 CpG's at the GAD1 (B) proximal promoter (see Fig. 2A, upper panel) and (C) intron no. 2 in schizophrenia and matched control subjects, as indicated (N = 12 clones/primer pair/case or control). Data shown for open (“K4” = H3Kme3) and repressive (“K27” = H3K27me3) chromatin separately. Notice significant deficit in repressive chromatin-associated DNA methylation at the GAD1 promoter in schizophrenia subjects.
