Notice overall low DNA methylation at proximal <em>GAD1</em> promoter. (Bottom) In schizophrenia, <em>GAD1</em> promoter DNA methylation in repressive chromatin (“K27”) is further decreased from control values. A hypothetical but plausible mechanisms would be the conversion from open chromatin to repressive chromatin that becomes tagged with the histone mark, H3K27me3, but without additional DNA methylation.</p>
