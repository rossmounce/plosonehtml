                Figure 4.  DNA methylation changes at GAD1 locus in schizophrenia.(Top) schematic presentation of GAD1 CpG dinucleotides (open labels, unmethylated and filled labels, methylated) in normal prefrontal cortex, showing higher levels of DNA methylation in repressive (“K27” = H3K27me3) as opposed to open (“K4” = H3K4me3) chromatin. Notice overall low DNA methylation at proximal GAD1 promoter. (Bottom) In schizophrenia, GAD1 promoter DNA methylation in repressive chromatin (“K27”) is further decreased from control values. A hypothetical but plausible mechanisms would be the conversion from open chromatin to repressive chromatin that becomes tagged with the histone mark, H3K27me3, but without additional DNA methylation.
