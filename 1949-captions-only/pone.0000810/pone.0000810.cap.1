Bitransgenic mice harboring both <em>CCSP-rtTA</em> and <em>EGFR<sup>L858R+T790M</sup></em> transgenes were labeled “C/L858R+T790M”. Bitransgenic mice harboring the <em>EGFR<sup>T790M</sup></em> and <em>EGFR<sup>L858R</sup></em> transgenes were labeled “C/T790M” and “C/L858R”, respectively. The latter strain of mice were previously described <a href="#pone.0000810-Politi1">[9]</a>.</p>
