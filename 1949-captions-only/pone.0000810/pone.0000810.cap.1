                Figure 1.  Design of transgenic constructs.Tet–tetracycline; mp-1 pA–poly A tract from the mouse protamine 1 gene; C–CCSP-rtTA. Bitransgenic mice harboring both CCSP-rtTA and EGFRL858R+T790M transgenes were labeled “C/L858R+T790M”. Bitransgenic mice harboring the EGFRT790M and EGFRL858R transgenes were labeled “C/T790M” and “C/L858R”, respectively. The latter strain of mice were previously described [9].
