RT-PCR performed in the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase (RT) using transgene-specific primers on mRNA from a bitransgenic animal on dox for 17.5 weeks (A) and various mice (genotypes as indicated) on dox for 5.5 weeks (B). “+” and “−“ denote known positive and negative lung samples derived from bitransgenic and non-transgenic mice on dox, respectively. “C/L+T” denotes C/L858R+T790M animals. C. Immunoblotting with antibodies against EGFR<sup>L858R</sup>, EGFR Y1092, and actin was performed on lung lysates derived from various mice on and/or off dox for varying periods of time; W–weeks. Genotypes are as indicated. “C/L+T” denotes C/L858R+T790M animals.</p>
