                Figure 3.  C/L858R+T790M mice fed doxycycline develop lung adenocarcinomas.Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections (Aâ€“F) of lungs derived from three different bitransgenic progeny of line 51 displaying different adenocarcinoma histological subtypes, including solid (A), bronchioloalveolar (A, C), and papillary (B, D), and one of line 12 with solid and bronchioloalveolar subtypes (E), fed dox for 11 (A, C), 16 (D), 17.5 (B), and 32 weeks (E), respectively. Lungs from bitransgenic mice fed a normal diet are shown in F. Lung tumors are composed mainly of type II pneumocytes, as indicated by the lack of staining for the Clara cell marker, CC26 (G) and positive staining for the type II cell marker, surfactant protein-C (SP-C) (H). Bars, 100 microns.
