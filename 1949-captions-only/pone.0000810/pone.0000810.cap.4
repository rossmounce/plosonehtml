                Figure 4.  Lung tumors in C/L858R+T790M mice require expression of mutant EGFR for tumor maintenance.A. Serial axial lung field MR images from a mouse administered dox for 21 weeks (W) and then fed a normal diet for the indicated amounts of time. Arrows indicate lung opacities; H, heart. B. Tumor volumes were quantified in the images depicted in A, using imaging software. See methods for details. C. H&amp;E-stained sections from lungs of bitransgenic mice on dox for 17 weeks with tumor by MRI and then taken off dox for the indicated times. Left–degenerating tumor surrounding a scar; right–dying tumor cells surrounded by an inflammatory response; arrowed–island of viable tumor cells.
