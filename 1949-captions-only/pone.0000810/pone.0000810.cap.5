                Figure 5.  Lung tumors in C/L858R+T790M mice are resistant to treatment with erlotinib.A. Serial axial (left) and coronal (right) images from C/L858R or C/L858R+T790M mice, treated with erlotinib for 8 days. Arrow depicts tumor; H–heart. B. Histological sections derived from the lungs of C/L858R (upper panel) or C/L858R+T790M (lower panel) mice treated with erlotinib for 0 or 8 days. Tumors were stained for the proliferation marker, Ki-67, and phospho-EGFR (pEGFR, Y1016). Far right: H&amp;E staining reveals significant treatment effect in a representative C/L858R tumor, but viable cells in the corresponding C/L858R+T790M tumor. C. Tumor volumes were quantified in the MR images obtained from the individual mice pre- and post-treatment with placebo or erlotinib. See Table S1 and methods for details. For comparison, tumor volumes from a drug-sensitive C/L858R mouse pre- and post-erlotinib treatment and from a C/L858R+T790M mouse on and off dox for the indicated times are also displayed. W–weeks; D–days. D. Immunoblotting with antibodies against EGFRL858R, EGFR Y1092, and actin was performed on lysates derived from lungs of tumor-bearing C/L858R+T790M mice, treated with placebo or erlotinib for the indicated times.
