Immunoblotting analyses of lung lysates derived from bitransgenic animals (line 51) treated with placebo or 17-AAG and sacrificed 6 hours later. Lane numbers correspond with the animal study numbers in <a href="#pone.0000810.s003">Table S3</a>. Lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies; p-phospho. B. Histology of lung tumors from bitransgenic mice treated with either placebo or 17-AAG for indicated times; H–hours; D–days. Lungs from placebo treated mice had viable tumor (upper panels), while lungs from drug-treated animals displayed areas of tumor necrosis surrounded by rims of viable cells (two middle panels), and degenerating tumors with inflammatory response (lower panels). Bars, 100 microns. C. Tumor volumes were quantitated in the MR images obtained from the individual mice pre- and post-treatment with placebo or 17-AAG. See <a href="#pone.0000810.s003">Table S3</a> and <a href="#s4">methods</a> for details. D–days; W–weeks.</p>
