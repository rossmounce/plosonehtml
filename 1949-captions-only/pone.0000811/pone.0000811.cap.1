                Figure 1.  Host (TIME cells) mRNA expression data during KSHV lytic infection.Clustered microarray data are displayed for 10,006 probes exhibiting a 1.9 fold change (relative to the average of the 0hr timepoints of the mock KSHV/Ad-RTA infected cells) in at least two time points. Detailed description of data filters is available in the Materials and Methods. The color bar describes the fold changes with respect to mock infected cells at time zero.
