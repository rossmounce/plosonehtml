Probe names are given for the microarray data and the corresponding short gene names are given along side the qRT-PCR data. Asterisk (*) indicates microarray data that were not confirmed by qRT-PCR. As noted in the Results section, these probes are part of the cluster of microarray probes that was removed from subsequent analyses. The color bar refers to the fold changes with respect to mock infected cells at time zero.</p>
