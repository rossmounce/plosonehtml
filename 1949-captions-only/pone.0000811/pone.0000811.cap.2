                Figure 2.  Validation of microarray results by quantitative RT-PCR.Normalized log2-ratios of the microarray data and the average ddCt qPCR values of select genes are directly compared in colorimetric form. Probe names are given for the microarray data and the corresponding short gene names are given along side the qRT-PCR data. Asterisk (*) indicates microarray data that were not confirmed by qRT-PCR. As noted in the Results section, these probes are part of the cluster of microarray probes that was removed from subsequent analyses. The color bar refers to the fold changes with respect to mock infected cells at time zero.
