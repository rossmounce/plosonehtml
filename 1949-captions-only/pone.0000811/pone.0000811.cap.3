                Figure 3.  Summary of changes in transcript levels during KSHV lytic infection.Pie chart represents the total number (8,817) of unique unigene cluster IDs that pass microarray spot quality filters in 75% of arrays. The three sectors represent genes that display changes in the indicated fashion. The filters used to define the induced and repressed are the same as in Figure 1. The unresponsive sector represents genes that did not pass the fold filter, but did pass the spot quality filters.
