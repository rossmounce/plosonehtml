                Figure 4.  mRNAs that escape KSHV mediated host shutoff.An expanded view of one cluster of mRNAs that exhibit elevated levels during lytic replication is displayed. Probes that map to select mRNAs are annotated. The color bar describes the fold changes with respect to mock infected cells at time zero.
