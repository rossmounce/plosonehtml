                Figure 5.  Host mRNA expression data upon expression RTA, vGPCR and GFP.RTA, vGPCR or GFP were ectopically expressed in TIME cells. 48hrs after adenoviral delivery of these cDNAs, samples were harvested and gene expression analysis was performed. Clustered microarray data are displayed for 2,392 probes exhibiting a 1.9 fold change (relative to the average of the three mock infected samples) in at least two arrays. Detailed description of the data filters is available in the Methods.
