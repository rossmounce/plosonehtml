                Figure 7.  Response of escapees to isolated expression of RTA, vGPCR or GFP.A. Expression data for mRNAs that escape KSHV mediated host shutoff (Fig. 1) are selected (169 probes) from the dataset presented in Fig. 3.
B. These data are summarized in a pie chart that depicts the influence of vGPCR and RTA on lytic escapee transcripts.
