                Figure 4.  Adipocyte size in the abdominal subcutaneous area is correlated to A) glucose disposal rate during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and to B) plasma adiponectin concentrations.Spearman correlation coefficients and p-values for South Asians and Caucasians respectively are as follows: A: r = −0.57, p = 0.0008; B: r = −0.71, p = &lt;0.0001. South Asians: dark triangles, solid line and Caucasians: white squares and dotted line
