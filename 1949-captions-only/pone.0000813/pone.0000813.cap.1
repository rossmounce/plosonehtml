Termite workers always grasp the short side of oval eggs when carrying them. The short diameter provides a critical morphological cue for egg recognition. A worker is shown grooming an egg (arrow). B, Dummy-egg bioassay. Workers bring eggs and egg dummies made of 0.5-mm glass beads coated with the termite egg recognition chemical and form an egg pile in the Petri dish. C, The dummy eggs carried into nursery cells of a semi-natural colony (colony size ca. 500) in the laboratory. Dummy eggs injected in galleries were carried within 48 h. D, Dummy eggs carried into an egg pile in a mature field colony. Dummy eggs were placed in the foraging area of the mature colony. As a result, 6,098 of 31,500 dummy eggs were carried into egg piles in the nursery cells within 48 h.</p>
