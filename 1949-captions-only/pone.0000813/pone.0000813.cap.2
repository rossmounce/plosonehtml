                Figure 2.  Comparison of the piling rates of dummy eggs made of glass beads coated with test chemicals.TEE: crude termite egg extract; pK: proteinase K digest of termite egg extract; BR: protein samples from the active peaks of BioRex 70 cation-exchange; Q1: UNO Q-1 anion-exchange chromatography; HIC: Methyl Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography; HEL: hen egg lysozyme; CEL: cellulase. Data are means and standard errors from nine replicates. The chemical concentrations were 1.0 µg/bead for TEE, pK, BR, Q1 and HCI, and 4.0 µg/bead for HEL, CEL and HEL+CEL. Data for each test chemical were compared to the control using two-tailed t-tests. **: P&lt;0.01; ***: P&lt;0.001.
