                Figure 1.  Schema of Separating Selective Interactions from Background Linkage Disequilibrium (BLD).(A) Mutation covariation due to BLD. Covariation of mutation A and R (shown in multiple sequence alignment, right) is caused by co-inheritance of the two mutations from a common ancestor (shown in the phylogenetic tree, left). (B) Mutation covariation due to selective interactions. Relative fitness models for mutations x and y, the double mutant (xy), and wildtype (0). Two models are contrasted: top, independent (additive) fitness effects don't cause amino acid mutation covariation; bottom, selective interactions cause covariation of x and y. (C) Distinguishing BLD vs. fitness using pairs of amino acid mutations (A) and synonymous (S) mutations.
