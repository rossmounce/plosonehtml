                Figure 3.  (A,A) Covariation Is Dramatically Higher than (A,S) and (S,S) Covariation in the Stanford-Treated Dataset but not the Stanford-Untreated Dataset.Sliding window results of average Dâ€² in A) Stanford-Treated Dataset and B) Stanford-Untreated Dataset. Amino acid mutation pairs (A,A), red; amino acid mutations to silent mutations (A,S), blue; silent mutation pairs (S,S), green. Each sliding window contains 4% of the data points in the set.
