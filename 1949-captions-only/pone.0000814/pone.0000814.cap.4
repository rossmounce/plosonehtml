                Figure 4.  Amino Acid Mutation Pairs that Show Strong Covariation Are Close to Active Sites in RT.HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) structure (PDB accession number 3HVTA) is shown using Protein Explorer (www.proteinexplorer.org). The RT41, 43 and 44, red; RT 67 and 70, green; RT 208, 210, 218, 219, yellow; active sites 110,185 and 186 in magenta. The grey sphere cluster is the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor â€” Nevirapine.
