The X and Y axes represent the codon positions in protease. Each cell represents the strongest covariation value (θ; see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>) measured for any mutation pair of the designated type between the two positions. The strength of the covariation is depicted on a color scale, with yellow indicating covariation score (θ) larger than 1 and varying shades up to blue indicating covariation score (θ) larger than 5 (the covariation of two mutations is at least five times greater than random). White indicates no evidence of covariation.</p>
