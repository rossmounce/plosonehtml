                Figure 5.  The Covariation Maps of Three Different Types of Mutation Pairs in HIV Protease.The covariation maps of A) amino acid mutation pairs (A,A), B) amino acid mutations to silent mutations (A,S) and C) silent mutation pairs (S,S). The X and Y axes represent the codon positions in protease. Each cell represents the strongest covariation value (θ; see Materials and Methods) measured for any mutation pair of the designated type between the two positions. The strength of the covariation is depicted on a color scale, with yellow indicating covariation score (θ) larger than 1 and varying shades up to blue indicating covariation score (θ) larger than 5 (the covariation of two mutations is at least five times greater than random). White indicates no evidence of covariation.
