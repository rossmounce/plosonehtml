                Figure 1.  Arabidopsis rRNA transgene construct and DNA blot of transgenic lines.A. Map of the T-DNA construct used to generate transgenic plants. RB and LB indicate right and left borders of the transferred DNA (T-DNA), respectively. The arrow denoted by +1 indicates the transcription initiation site at the gene promoter; this site is 92 bp upstream of a 19 bp oligonucleotide cassette inserted into the rRNA gene sequences. The coding regions of the 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs are depicted as red rectangles, and the kanamycin resistance gene as a light blue rectangle. A complete, unit-length rRNA gene is ~10.5 kb in size. The transgene is larger than unit length due to the presence of intergenic spacer sequences downstream, as well as upstream, of the coding sequences. B. Possible single and tandem transgene integration patterns expected for DNA blots following digestion of genomic DNA with I-Ppo I and probing with the kanamycin resistance gene. Note that only I-Ppo I fragments containing the kanamycin resistance gene will be detected on the Southern blot, thus the 18.5 kb fragment of a head-to-head tandem insertion would not be detected. C. DNA blot of genomic DNA from transgenic lines following digestion with I-Ppo I and detection with a 32P-labeled, kanamycin resistance gene probe. The digested fragments were size-separated on a 0.3% agarose gel. Bacteriophage Lambda DNA digested with HindIII served as a size ladder for the estimation of fragment lengths.
