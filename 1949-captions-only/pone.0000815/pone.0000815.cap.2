RT-PCR analysis of rRNA transgene activity in six independent transgenic lines. The diagram shows the location of primers used to detect transgene expression. A unique 19 bp tag located 92 bp downstream of the transcription start site distinguishes transgene transcripts from endogenous rRNA transcripts. RNA from wild-type (wt) or transgenic plants was treated with reverse transcriptase (RT), or was treated with RNase prior to reverse transcriptase as a control. Two equal aliquots of from each treatment were then subjected to PCR using primer pairs to detect transcripts downstream (D) or upstream (U) of the expected transcription start site, with the TGrev primer being end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P. Reaction products were run in adjacent lanes of the gel and visualized by autoradiography. PCR using rRNA gene plasmid DNA (p) served as controls for the D and U PCR products. Stronger D than U signals suggest that transcripts are initiated properly from the rRNA gene promoter. U signals result from transcripts that read-through the promoter region from upstream. B.
