Leaf photos are not to the same scale. B. Detection of rRNA genes and transcripts in <em>A. thaliana×A. lyrata</em> hybrids. The diagram shows the intervening sequence 1 (ITS1) region, the location of PCR primer sites within 18S and 5.8S rRNA coding sequences and the <em>Hha</em> I sites used to discriminate genes and transcripts of <em>A. thaliana</em> from those of <em>A. lyrata</em>. PCR using genomic DNA (lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16) verifies that rRNA genes of the parental species are present in the hybrids (lanes 7, 10, 13, 16). Products resulting from reverse transcription (RT) of purified RNA followed by PCR and <em>Hha</em> I digestion were subjected to electrophoresis in lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17. Controls in which RT was omitted prior to PCR are represented by lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The lack of products in the latter controls indicates that RNA samples are free of contaminating genomic DNA. Note that the <em>A. lyrata×A. thaliana</em> F1 hybrids express <em>A. lyrata</em> but not <em>A. thaliana</em> rRNA genes (lanes 8, 11, 14, 17) in all independent F1 hybrids (four are shown).</p>
