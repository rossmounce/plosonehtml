                Figure 3.  Nucleolar dominance in A. thaliana×A. lyrata F1 hybrids.A. A. thaliana×A. lyrata hybrids display morphological features intermediate between those of the parents, including flower size and leaf shape. Leaf photos are not to the same scale. B. Detection of rRNA genes and transcripts in A. thaliana×A. lyrata hybrids. The diagram shows the intervening sequence 1 (ITS1) region, the location of PCR primer sites within 18S and 5.8S rRNA coding sequences and the Hha I sites used to discriminate genes and transcripts of A. thaliana from those of A. lyrata. PCR using genomic DNA (lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16) verifies that rRNA genes of the parental species are present in the hybrids (lanes 7, 10, 13, 16). Products resulting from reverse transcription (RT) of purified RNA followed by PCR and Hha I digestion were subjected to electrophoresis in lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17. Controls in which RT was omitted prior to PCR are represented by lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The lack of products in the latter controls indicates that RNA samples are free of contaminating genomic DNA. Note that the A. lyrata×A. thaliana F1 hybrids express A. lyrata but not A. thaliana rRNA genes (lanes 8, 11, 14, 17) in all independent F1 hybrids (four are shown).
