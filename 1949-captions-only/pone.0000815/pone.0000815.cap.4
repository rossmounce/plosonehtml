                Figure 4.  Locus-dependent rRNA transgene expression in A. thaliana×A. lyrata hybrids.A. Detection of transgene transcripts using RT-PCR and a transgene-specific primer pair. Transgene transcripts were detected in T3 plants of A. thaliana transgenic Line 1, Line 9 (two lines descended from different T2 sibs; 9a and 9b), and Line 2 (lanes 5–12). No RT-PCR products were detected using RNA of wild-type A. thaliana or A. lyrata (lanes 1 and 3) or wild-type hybrids (lane 13), confirming the transgene specificity of the PCR assay. Hybrids formed using transgenic A. thaliana lines were analyzed in lanes 15–24. Two sibling Line 1×A. lyrata hybrids were analyzed in lanes 15–18. Note that transgene transcripts were detected in all hybrids except the hybrid derived from Line 2. B. Line 2 transgenes are present in hybrids, but are consistently silenced. DNA or RNA of non-transgenic A. thaliana (ecotype Landsberg) and four independent Line 2×A. lyrata hybrids was tested by PCR or RT-PCR, respectively. Note that the transgenes are present in the hybrids (see DNA control lanes, labeled D) but are not expressed into RNA (R lanes). C. Endogenous A. thaliana rRNA genes are silenced in transgenic hybrids. RT-PCR was conducted as in Figure 3B using RNA of the progenitor species (lanes 1 and 2), and of hybrids resulting from crossing A. lyrata with transgenic Lines 1, 4, and 9 (lanes 5, 8, 11, 14). PCR controls using genomic DNA as template shows that all hybrids inherited rRNA genes from both parents (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12), although only A. lyrata rRNA genes are expressed.
