Detection of transgene transcripts using RT-PCR and a transgene-specific primer pair. Transgene transcripts were detected in T3 plants of <em>A. thaliana</em> transgenic Line 1, Line 9 (two lines descended from different T2 sibs; 9a and 9b), and Line 2 (lanes 5–12). No RT-PCR products were detected using RNA of wild-type <em>A. thaliana</em> or <em>A. lyrata</em> (lanes 1 and 3) or wild-type hybrids (lane 13), confirming the transgene specificity of the PCR assay. Hybrids formed using transgenic <em>A. thaliana</em> lines were analyzed in lanes 15–24. Two sibling Line 1×<em>A. lyrata</em> hybrids were analyzed in lanes 15–18. Note that transgene transcripts were detected in all hybrids except the hybrid derived from Line 2. B. Line 2 transgenes are present in hybrids, but are consistently silenced. DNA or RNA of non-transgenic <em>A. thaliana</em> (ecotype Landsberg) and four independent Line 2×<em>A. lyrata</em> hybrids was tested by PCR or RT-PCR, respectively. Note that the transgenes are present in the hybrids (see DNA control lanes, labeled D) but are not expressed into RNA (R lanes). C. Endogenous <em>A. thaliana</em> rRNA genes are silenced in transgenic hybrids. RT-PCR was conducted as in <a href="#pone-0000815-g003">Figure 3B</a> using RNA of the progenitor species (lanes 1 and 2), and of hybrids resulting from crossing <em>A. lyrata</em> with transgenic Lines 1, 4, and 9 (lanes 5, 8, 11, 14). PCR controls using genomic DNA as template shows that all hybrids inherited rRNA genes from both parents (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12), although only <em>A. lyrata</em> rRNA genes are expressed.</p>
