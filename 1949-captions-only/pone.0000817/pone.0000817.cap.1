                Figure 1.  mRNA levels of NDUFV, NDUFV2 subunits of complex I and of Sp1 in post mortem brain specimens and lymphocytes of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls.RNA was extracted from postmortem brain specimens of schizophrenic patients (SCH n = 15) and healthy subjects (Cont n = 15), and from lymphocytes of 10 inpatients and 10 healthy subjects. A. Prefrontal cortex (BA 46/9), B. Striatum (including nucleus accumbens), C. Ventral parieto-occipital cortex (BA19) and D. Densitometry values and a representative gel of mRNA levels in Lymphocytes.
