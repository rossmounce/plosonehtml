                Figure 2.  Inhibition of the transcription of NDUFV1, NDUFV2 and NDUFS1 subunits of complex I and of Sp1 and RELN by mithramycin in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.Cell were treated for 12, 24 and 36 hrs with 150 nM mithramycin and mRNA levels of all 5 genes were analyzed by RT-PCR. A. NDUFV2. B. NDUFV1 and NDUFS1 and RELN after 24 hrs treatment with mithramycin. C. Sp1 and D. A representative gel, demonstrating mithramycin inhibition of the expression of the three subunits of complex I and of RELN with no change in Sp1 and β-actin. Results are means±SD of 3–4 experiments.
