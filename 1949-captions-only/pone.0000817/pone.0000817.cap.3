                Figure 3.  Protein levels of NDUFV1, NDUFV2 and NDUFS1 subunits of complex I, but not that of Sp1 are reduced following treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with mithramycin.Densitometry value of protein levels (A) and a representative gel (B) of all 4 genes in cells treated for 24 hrs with 150 nM mithramycin. Results are means±SD of 3–4 experiments. *p&lt;0.005 **p&lt;0.014 ***p&lt;0.024 vs. untreated control cells.
