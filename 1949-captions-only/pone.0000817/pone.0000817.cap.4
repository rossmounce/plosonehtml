                Figure 4.  The effect of mithramycin on the transcriptional activity of the NDUFV2 predicted promoter in SH-SY5Y cells.A. Cells were transiently transfected with two concentrations of the pNDUFV2-Luc reporter construct (construct) for 24 hrs and analyzed for luciferase activity. B. One hour before the transfection cells were pre-incubated with or without mithramycin (150 nM). The results are meansÂ±SD of three experiments normalized for106 cells. *p&lt;0.0001.
