                Figure 5.  Sp1 binding to its three consensuses sequences in the 461 bp promoter sequence of NDUFV2.For electrophoretic mobility shift assay nuclear extracts of SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with the three double strand 32P-end labeled oligonucleotides (specified in Material and Method section), and a commercial 32P-end labeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence for Sp1 (Sp1 consensus) in the presence (lanes marked 3) or absence (lanes marked 2) of cold competitors, or 150 nM mithramycine (lanes marked 5). For supershift assay, nuclear extracts were preincubated with Sp1 antibody prior to the addition of the appropriate oligonucleotide (lanes marked 4). Lanes marked 1 are free end-labeled probes.
