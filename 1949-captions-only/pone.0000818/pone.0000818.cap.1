Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. T cells were identified as CD3 positive, NK cells as CD56 positive, CD3 negative, and B cells as CD19 positive. Staining was performed on freshly isolated PBL (A, C and E) and on PBL that were cultured for 72 hr in the presence of IL-2 (100 u/ml) and human serum (B, D and F). Each dot blot shows a gated specific sub-population. An isotype matched antibody was used to determent the background staining for each antibody and is represented in the figure as the horizontal line. (H) Freshly isolated PBMC were incubated for 72 hr with 50 ng/ml of the indicated cytokines. Biotinylated 172.4 mAb was detected using Cy-5 streptavidin and used in combination with other fluorescently labeled mAbs in a four color staining. The PBL were analyzed for the expression of CD100 on NK cells and each dot plot represents a gated NK cells (CD3-, CD56+). Figure shows one representative experiment out of four performed.</p>
