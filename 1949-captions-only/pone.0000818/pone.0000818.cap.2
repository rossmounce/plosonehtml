(B) <sup>35</sup>S-labeled P815 cells were pre-incubated with the indicated mAbs and tested for lysis by NK cells at the indicated E:T ratios. (C) <sup>35</sup>S-labeled P815 cells were pre-incubated with the combination of the indicated mAbs and tested for lysis by NK cells. E: T ratio of 10:1 is presented. Figure shows one representative experiment out of four performed.</p>
