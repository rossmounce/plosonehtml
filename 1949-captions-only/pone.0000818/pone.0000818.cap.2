                Figure 2.  Killing of target cells is not influence by mAb 172.4.(A) 35S-labeled 721.221 cells were pre-incubated with the indicated mAbs and tested for lysis by NK cells at different effectors to targets (E:T) ratios as indicated in the figure. (B) 35S-labeled P815 cells were pre-incubated with the indicated mAbs and tested for lysis by NK cells at the indicated E:T ratios. (C) 35S-labeled P815 cells were pre-incubated with the combination of the indicated mAbs and tested for lysis by NK cells. E: T ratio of 10:1 is presented. Figure shows one representative experiment out of four performed.
