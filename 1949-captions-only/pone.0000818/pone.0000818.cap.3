The immunoprecipitate was analyzed first on non-reducing and then on reducing SDS-PAGE. The left lane is an aliquot of immunoprecipitated proteins resolved under reducing conditions. Molecular weight markers are as shown. The two forms of CD100 (150 and 120 kDa respectively) are indicated with arrows. (B, D) ELISA plates were coated with CD100-Ig and assayed for binding to the indicated antibodies as described in “Materials and Methods”. (C) ELISA plates were coated with CD99-Ig and assayed for binding to the indicated antibodies as described in “Materials and Methods”. The background binding to BSA was subtracted. Figure shows one representative experiment out of four performed. (E) IL-2 activated NK line was stained with either 172.4 or the commercial anti human CD100 antibody A8. FITC conjugated Goat F(ab') anti mouse IgG antibody was used as secondary Ab. Gray histogram is staining with secondary antibody only. Figure show one representative experiment out of 5 performed.</p>
