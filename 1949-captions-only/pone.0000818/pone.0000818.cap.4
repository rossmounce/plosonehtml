                Figure 4.  NK cytotoxicity and IFNγ secretion is enhanced after binding to CD72.(A) 35S-labeled BW or BW/CD72 cells were tested for lysis by activated NK cells at different effectors to targets ratio as indicated in the figure. *p&lt;0.005. (B) 35S-labeled BW/CD72 cells were pre-incubated with the indicated fusion proteins and tested for lysis by activated NK cells at the indicated E:T ratios.*p&lt;0.05. (C) 35S-labeled BW cells were pre-incubated with the indicated fusion proteins and tested for lysis by activated NK cells at the indicated E:T ratios. The differences observed between the various treatments were not statistically significant. (D) NK cells were incubated with BW or BW/CD72 in the presence or absence of the various cytokines indicated in the figure and IFNγ secretion was measured by ELISA. Figure shows one representative experiment out of four performed. * p = 0.03, **p = 0.01
