                Figure 5.  The interaction between CD100 and CD72 leads to the phosphorylation of serine residues on proteins associate with CD100.(A) 35S-labeled activated NK cells were incubated for 20 minutes with adherent BW or BW/CD72 cells. The wells were washed, the remaining cells were lysed and the level of radioactivity was measured in CPM units (counts per mint). The results presented after subtraction of NK cells only. (B) 35S-labeled activated NK cells were incubated for 20 minutes with adherent BW/CD72 cells that were pre incubated with CD100-Ig or CD99-Ig for 2 hr prior to the incubation with NK cells. The wells were washed, the remaining cells were lysed and the level of radioactivity was measured. *p = 0.02. (C) Activated NK cells were incubated with target cells (BW or BW/CD72), in 37Â°C, for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated by mAb 172.4. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a reducing SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were detected in western blot by using rabbit anti phospho-serine polyclonal Ab. CD100 levels were detected in western blot by using the A8 anti human CD100. (D) Densitometrical analysis of the level of phosphorylation on serine residues of the three proteins indicated by arrows in Figure 5C. The levels of phosphorylation are relative to their level at time zero which was set as one. Figure shows one representative experiment out of two performed.
