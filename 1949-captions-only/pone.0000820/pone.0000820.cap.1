                Figure 1.  Three local minimum conformations of the ligand taken from crystal structure 1QL9 and two related transition state conformations.Upper panel: local minimum, transition state, and crystal structure conformations of the ligand. The C atom of the crystal structure conformation is green. The C atoms of the local minimum conformations of L1, L2, and L3 are yellow, magenta, and cyan, respectively. The C atoms of the two transition state conformations are blue. The O, N and S atoms are red, blue, and orange, respectively. Lower panel: the potential energy diagram for the exchange between L2 and L1. The unit of the potential energy is kcal/mol.
