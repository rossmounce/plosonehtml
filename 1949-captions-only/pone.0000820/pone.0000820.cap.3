                Figure 3.  Graphic representation of mass-weighted root mean square deviations (mwRMSDs) of 0.11–0.97 Å between crystal structure conformations and their corresponding local minimum conformations obtained by using normal mode analysis.The C atoms of the crystal structure conformation and the local minimum conformation are green and yellow, respectively. The O, N, F and S atoms are red, blue, grey, and orange, respectively.
