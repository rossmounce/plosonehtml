<h4>Adverse effect of excessive energy minimization on chemical database development</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The results of this study suggest that excessive energy minimization of a ligand alone may fold or partially fold the ligand, leading to a conformation that is more stable in its free state but not suitable for docking into a protein. The partial folding caused by the conventional energy minimization method is common to the 100 ligands under study, as evident from the observation that the potential energies of all 100 ligand conformations obtained using the energy minimization without the NMA monitor are by average 1.1 kcal/mol lower than those using the NMA monitor except for the ligand of crystal structure 3STD (<a href="#pone-0000820-g005">Figure 5</a>). It is worth noting that the potential energy of the ligand local minimum conformation of crystal structure 3STD obtained without the NMA monitor is only 0.08 kcal/mol higher than that obtained with the NMA monitor. Docking a folded or partially folded ligand into a protein binding site requires computational effort to unfold the ligand. This effort is necessary in view of the entropy contribution to binding. This is because the unfolded ligand conformation such as the NEM-generated local minimum conformation is often captured at a <em>shallow</em> minimum of the ligand potential energy surface. The unfolded conformation at a shallow “energy well” can gain more entropic energy than the partially folded conformation at a deep “energy well,” which can outweigh the penalty in potential energy (≈1.1 kcal/mol in average) for moving the conformation from the deep “energy well” to the shallow “energy well.” This cautions about possible adverse effect of excessive energy minimization on generating a database of ligand conformations for virtual screening.</p>
