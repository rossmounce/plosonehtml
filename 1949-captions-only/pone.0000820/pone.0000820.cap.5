                Figure 5.  Scatterplot of the potential energy differences between two local minimum conformations obtained without and with normal mode analysis for the 100 ligands.The ligand ID is the row order of the ligand in Table S1â€”namely, the IDs of the ligands in the first and last rows of Table S1 are 1 and 100, respectively.
