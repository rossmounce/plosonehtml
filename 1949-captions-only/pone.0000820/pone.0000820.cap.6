                Figure 6.  Overlay of crystal structure 1BR6 with the EUDOC-generated complex whose bound ligand conformation was generated by using the NEM procedure.The C atoms of the EUDOC-generated and crystal structures are green and yellow, respectively. The O and N atoms are red and blue, respectively. The mass-weighted root mean square deviation of the ligand conformation between EUDOC-generated and crystal structures is 0.49 Ã….
