                Figure 7.  Overlay of crystal structure 1L2S with the EUDOC-generated complex whose bound ligand conformation was generated by using the NEM procedure.The C atoms of the EUDOC-generated and crystal structures are green and yellow, respectively. The O, N, and Cl atoms are red, blue, and magenta, respectively. The mass-weighted root mean square deviation of the ligand conformation between EUDOC-generated and crystal structures is 0.93 Ã….
