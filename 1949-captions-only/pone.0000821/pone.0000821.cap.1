                Figure 1.  DUC18 CTL mediate regression of CMS5 tumors.3×106 CMS5 tumor cells were injected s.c. and were allowed to grow for 8 days prior to transfer of 30×106 in vitro activated DUC18 T cells. This transfer protocol was repeated for all subsequent experiments. A) Tumor sizes for 6 DUC18 T cell+ recipient and 4 control mice are shown. Data are representative of 3 experiments. B) Mean tumor sizes +/− SEM for 30 DUC18 T cell+ recipient mice.
