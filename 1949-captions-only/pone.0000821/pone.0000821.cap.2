A) Prior to transfer, some cells were stained for CD25, CD27 and CD62L. Remaining cells were left in vitro without further stimulation, and were stained for the same markers on days 2 and 6. Data from one experiment, representative of three, are shown. B) Following DUC18 T cell transfer, dLNs, spleens, and tumors were harvested from mice and stained on days 2,4, and 6. All analyses were done by gating on live, Thy1.1<sup>+</sup>Vβ8.3<sup>+</sup> DUC18 T cells. Shown are mean fluorescence intensity +/− SEM for combined results from 3 independent experiments, n = 8–10 mice at each time point.</p>
