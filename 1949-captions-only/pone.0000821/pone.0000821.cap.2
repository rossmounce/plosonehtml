                Figure 2.  Divergent phenotypic profiles of tumor-infiltrating and peripheral lymphoid organ DUC18 CTL.Thy1.1 DUC18 T cells were activated for four days in vitro and transferred i.v. into Thy1.2 CMS5-tumor bearing mice. A) Prior to transfer, some cells were stained for CD25, CD27 and CD62L. Remaining cells were left in vitro without further stimulation, and were stained for the same markers on days 2 and 6. Data from one experiment, representative of three, are shown. B) Following DUC18 T cell transfer, dLNs, spleens, and tumors were harvested from mice and stained on days 2,4, and 6. All analyses were done by gating on live, Thy1.1+Vβ8.3+ DUC18 T cells. Shown are mean fluorescence intensity +/− SEM for combined results from 3 independent experiments, n = 8–10 mice at each time point.
