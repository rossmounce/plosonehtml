A) On day 4, 5×10<sup>6</sup> each TAMRA<sup>+</sup> control cells and CFSE<sup>+</sup> targets were injected i.v. Spleens and dLNs were harvested and analyzed on day 5. Percentages of cells within the indicated gates are shown. Data are representative of 3 experiments. B) CMS5 cells were injected s.c. and allowed to grow for 8 days. At this time, 3×10<sup>6</sup> each TAMRA<sup>+</sup> Meth A reference cells and CFSE<sup>+</sup> CMS5 targets were injected i.t. Tumors were harvested and analyzed on day 9; the percentages of TAMRA<sup>+</sup> and CFSE<sup>+</sup> cells in individual tumors were determined by flow cytometry. C) The mean ratio +/− SEM of CFSE<sup>+</sup> CMS5 to TAMRA<sup>+</sup> Meth A cells was calculated using data from 13 individual mice. D) Tumor areas were measured on day 8 after CMS5 challenge. Four days later, fluorescently labeled tumor cells were injected as in B. Tumor sizes were measured just prior to i.t. injections and again the following day. Data represent the means +/− s.d. for 12 tumors from 4 independent experiments. No statistical difference is present in the size of control versus FL+ tumors at day 13 (p = 0.11) or in the change in control versus FL+ tumor sizes from day 12 to day 13 (p = 0.40). E) DUC18 T cells were transferred into tumor-bearing mice as in A. On day 4 post-T cell transfer, fluorescently labeled tumor cells were injected as in B. Tumors were harvested and analyzed on day 5. Percentages of cells within the indicated gates are shown. Data from 1 experiment are shown; representative of 10.</p>
