                Figure 5.  Increased cell death over time in tumor-infiltrating DUC18 CTL.Thy1.1 DUC 18 effector T cells were transferred into tumor-bearing recipients on day 0. On the indicated days, organs were harvested and stained for Thy1.1/Vβ8.3+ DUC18 T cells. A) The percentage of DUC18 T cells that were dead was determined by gating on the DUC18 T cell population and analyzing the PIbright percentage. Data were pooled from 9 mice in 3 independent experiments. B) Organs were harvested on day 6 post-T cell transfer, and samples were stained with Thy1.1, Vβ8.3, Annexin V Alexa 488 and 7AAD. Histograms are shown after gating on the DUC18 T cell population, and represent data from a single mouse. C) The percentage of Annexin V+ DUC18 T cells is shown, based on the region shown in the histogram in B (p value for % apoptotic DUC18 T cells at day 6 in tumors versus dLNs = 0.0002 and for tumors versus spleens = 0.0007). Cumulative data from 3 independent experiments are shown.
