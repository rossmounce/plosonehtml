                Figure 1.  Frequency of recognition of HIV-1 B consensus 2001 peptides as a function of their similarity to human proteins.410 peptides spanning the HIV-1 B consensus 2001 proteome were tested by ELISpot using PBMC from a cohort of 314 HIV-1 infected&nbsp;individuals.&nbsp;The vertical axis corresponds to the percentage of individuals who recognized a given peptide. The horizontal axis corresponds to the number of matches to the human proteome for each peptide. Matches were derived by dissecting the 410 peptides into overlapping 6-mers offset by one residue, and then scored against the RefSeq protein sequence database. Matches were normalized to account for the length of the starting peptide (ranging from 15â€“20 AA in length).
