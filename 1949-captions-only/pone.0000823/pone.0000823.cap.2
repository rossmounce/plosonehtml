                Figure 2.  Magnitude of the ELISpot responses elicited by HIV-1 B Nef peptides as a function of their similarity to human peptides.The vertical axis corresponds to the mean number of spot-forming cells counted in ELISpot assays. The horizontal axis corresponds to Nef peptides that have 2, 3 or 4 differences with their closest human peptides.
