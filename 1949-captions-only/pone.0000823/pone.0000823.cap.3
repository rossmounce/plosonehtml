                Figure 3.  Frequency of recognition of HIV-1 B consensus 2001 peptides as a function of their intrinsic disorder prediction score.The vertical axis corresponds to the percentage of HIV-1 infected individuals that recognized each of the 410 peptides spanning the HIV-1 B consensus 2001 proteome. The horizontal axis corresponds to the disorder prediction score for each peptide, calculated using predictions of order/disorder made with the VSL1 predictor (PONDRÂ®).
