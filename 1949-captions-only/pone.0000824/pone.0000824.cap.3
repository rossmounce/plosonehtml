                Figure 3.  The distribution of malaria relative risk in Africa.Three different types of risk were calculated as follows: (a) the probability of occurrence of each vector in each cell was multiplied by both the human population density of the cell and the HBI of the vector. The relative risk of malaria in the cell was calculated as the sum of these values; (b) the vector possessing the maximum probability of occurrence was identified for each cell. Its probability of occurrence was multiplied by its HBI and the human population density of the cell. The relative risk of malaria in the cell was calculated as the product of these three values; and (c) the probability of occurrence of each vector in each cell was multiplied by the human population density of the cell and the HBI of the vector. The relative risk of malaria in the cell was calculated as the maximum of these values. The maps plot the natural logarithm of the relative risk.
