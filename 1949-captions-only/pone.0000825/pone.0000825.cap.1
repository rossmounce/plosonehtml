                Figure 1.  Sequence variation in the human CXCR1 locus.a, Genomic organization of CXCR1 and positions of genetic variants (Variants 1–5) in the intron, the coding sequence (CDS) and in the 3′untranslation region (3′UTR). b, Comparison of the human CXCR1 gene with its rat ortholog (Il8ra). BLAST homologies indicating strongly conserved regions are shown by the lines connecting the genes. The five CXCR1 variants identified in the patients are all located in or near strongly conserved regions as indicated. The rat was selected, as the human CXCR1 gene does not have an ortholog in the mouse where the equivalent of the human CXCR2 (mIL-8Rh or Il8rb) gene carries out the same function. c, Predicted effects of CXCR1 variants on putative transcription factor binding motifs based on a TRANSFAC search. The transcription factors and % score match of the mutant alleles are shown. d, Variant 1 (enlarged, bold) potentially disrupts the RUNX1 binding motif.
