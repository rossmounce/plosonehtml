BLAST homologies indicating strongly conserved regions are shown by the lines connecting the genes. The five <em>CXCR1</em> variants identified in the patients are all located in or near strongly conserved regions as indicated. The rat was selected, as the human <em>CXCR1</em> gene does not have an ortholog in the mouse where the equivalent of the human CXCR2 (mIL-8Rh or <em>Il8rb</em>) gene carries out the same function. c, Predicted effects of <em>CXCR1</em> variants on putative transcription factor binding motifs based on a TRANSFAC search. The transcription factors and % score match of the mutant alleles are shown. d, Variant 1 (enlarged, bold) potentially disrupts the RUNX1 binding motif.</p>
