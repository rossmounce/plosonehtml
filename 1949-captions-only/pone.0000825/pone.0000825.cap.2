Binding (arrow) was stronger to the wild type (lane 2) than to the variant 1 oligonucleotide (lane 4). Lanes 1 and 3 are probes without proteins. b, Competitive inhibition of binding by cold intact probe (100-fold excess, lane 3), but not by unspecific probe (100× excess, lane 4). A super-shifted band, indicated by the arrow, was obtained with anti-RUNX1 (lane 5) but not with control antibody (anti ATF-2) (lane 6). Hatched lines indicate removed excess lanes. c, Inhibition of specific wild-type binding by unlabeled wt probe (10×–100×, lanes 2–5) and reduced efficiency of competition with unlabelled SNP1 probe (10×–100×, lane 6–9). d, The inhibition of the DNA-protein interaction in Panel <em>c</em> was quantified in a Phosphor Imager. e, Effect of SNP1 on RUNX1-dependent transcriptional transactivation. Allelic differences in relative luciferase activity in pAML1 (wt/SNP1)-TK-luc transfected A498 cells with or without co-transfection with an AML-1b expression vector. Data show the mean ± SEMs of three separate experiments done in duplicate. *P = 0.0104 and **P = 0.1199 by the Mann-Whitney <em>U</em> test, two-tailed. f, RUNX1 and PU.1 interacts with the <em>CXCR1</em> promoter in transfected A498 cells. The <em>CXCR1</em> promoter activity was quantified using luciferase. The signal was enhanced by co-transfection with the AML1b (RUNX1) and PU.1 expression plasmids.</p>
