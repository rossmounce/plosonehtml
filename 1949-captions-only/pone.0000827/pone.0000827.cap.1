Me = media; Lu = lumen; En = endothelium. In a kidney extract obtained from WT mice, the anti-TRPV4 antibody detected a protein of ~95 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight (98 kDa). Furthermore, an additional band of ~107 kDa, presumably representing the glycosylated protein, is detected by the antibody. In extracts from TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice, no signals were present. Equal protein loading of the blots was validated by visualization of tubulin.</p>
