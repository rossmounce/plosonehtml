                Figure 1.  Immunohistochemistry for TRPV4 in CAs (upper panel) and Western blot analysis of TRPV4 protein expression in kidneys (lower panel) of WT and TRPV4−/− mice.Note the absence of specific staining in CA of TRPV4−/− mice. Me = media; Lu = lumen; En = endothelium. In a kidney extract obtained from WT mice, the anti-TRPV4 antibody detected a protein of ~95 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight (98 kDa). Furthermore, an additional band of ~107 kDa, presumably representing the glycosylated protein, is detected by the antibody. In extracts from TRPV4−/− mice, no signals were present. Equal protein loading of the blots was validated by visualization of tubulin.
