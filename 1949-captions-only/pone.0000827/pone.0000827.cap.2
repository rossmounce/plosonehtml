Voltage-dependent inhibition by RuR (1 µmol/L). Right panel, 4αPDD-inducible currents were undetectable in CAEC of TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice. B, left panel, Representative recording of AA (10 µmol/L)-inducible TRPV4 currents in CAEC of WT and inhibition by RuR (1 µmol/L). Right panel, small AA-inducible cation-currents in CAEC of TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice. C, left panel, HTS (206 mosmol/L)-inducible TRPV4-currents in CAEC of WT. Right panel, HTS-inducible cation currents of smaller amplitude in CAEC of TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice. D, left panel, Partial voltage-dependent inhibition of HTS-inducible TRPV4 currents in CAEC of WT and almost complete inhibition by the combination of RuR and Gd<sup>3+</sup> (10 µmol/L). Right panel, RuR insensitivity and Gd<sup>3+</sup> sensitivity of HTS-inducible cation currents in CAEC of TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice. E, Mean 4αPDD-, AA-, and HTS-inducible TRPV4 and other cation currents in CAEC of WT and TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of cells investigated. Values are given as means±SEM; * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, <em>t</em> test.</p>
