C, PE-induced contraction of CA from WT (CA, n = 4) and TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice (CA, n = 4) in the presence of L-NNA and INDO. D, Change in passive diameter (normalized to body weight) of CA from WT (CA, n = 13) and TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice (CA, n = 10) in response to increasing intravascular pressure and in the presence of SNP. Values are given as means±SEM.</p>
