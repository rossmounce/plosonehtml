                Figure 3.  Compliance of carotid arteries (CA) of WT and TRPV4−/− mice.A and B, Diameter of CA pressurized to 80 mmHg (basal) and in the extravascular presence of PE, K+, and SNP in the absence and presence of L-NNA (300 µmol/L) and INDO (10 µmol/L); WT CA, -L-NNA/INDO: n = 11 and+L-NNA/INDO: n = 8; TRPV4−/− CA, -L-NNA/INDO: n = 7 and+L-NNA/INDO: n = 8. C, PE-induced contraction of CA from WT (CA, n = 4) and TRPV4−/− mice (CA, n = 4) in the presence of L-NNA and INDO. D, Change in passive diameter (normalized to body weight) of CA from WT (CA, n = 13) and TRPV4−/− mice (CA, n = 10) in response to increasing intravascular pressure and in the presence of SNP. Values are given as means±SEM.
