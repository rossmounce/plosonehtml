Shear stress-induced vasodilation was elicited by switching to a perfusion medium containing 5% dextran (5% Dex). B, Flow/reperfusion-induced vasodilation of CA of WT and TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> mice in the absence and presence of L-NNA and INDO. WT CA, n = 9 and n = 8; TRPV4<sup>−/−</sup> CA, n = 7 and n = 7, respectively. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, <em>t</em> test.</p>
