                Figure 5.  Shear stress- and flow/reperfusion-induced vasodilation in CA of WT and TRPV4−/− mice.A, Shear stress-induced vasodilation in CA of WT and TRPV4−/− mice in the absence and presence of L-NNA and INDO; WT CA, n = 12 and n = 9; TRPV4−/− CA, n = 6 and n = 8, respectively. Shear stress-induced vasodilation was elicited by switching to a perfusion medium containing 5% dextran (5% Dex). B, Flow/reperfusion-induced vasodilation of CA of WT and TRPV4−/− mice in the absence and presence of L-NNA and INDO. WT CA, n = 9 and n = 8; TRPV4−/− CA, n = 7 and n = 7, respectively. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, t test.
