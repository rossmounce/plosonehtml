                Figure 2.  PTB binds to the 3′ end of fosB I4.(A) 32P-labeled mini RNA substrates from the 5′, M and 3′ region of I4 were incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of HeLa nuclear extract before UV cross-linking, resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. (B) 32P-labeled mini RNA substrates from the 5′, M and 3′ region of I4 were incubated in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract before UV cross-linking. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with antibody that recognizes PTB or a control antibody that does not recognize splicing factors, resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The 5′, M and 3′ substrates are transcripts from three regions of the intron as defined in the legends of Fig. 1. The position of protein molecular weight markers is indicated on the right in kDa.
