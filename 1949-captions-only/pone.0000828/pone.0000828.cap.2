(B) <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mini RNA substrates from the 5′, M and 3′ region of I4 were incubated in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract before UV cross-linking. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with antibody that recognizes PTB or a control antibody that does not recognize splicing factors, resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The 5′, M and 3′ substrates are transcripts from three regions of the intron as defined in the legends of <a href="#pone-0000828-g001">Fig. 1</a>. The position of protein molecular weight markers is indicated on the right in kDa.</p>
