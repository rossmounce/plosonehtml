Addition of the control plasmid ensured equal levels of DNA within the transfection assay. The amounts of PTB 1 plasmid used per well in the transfection assays were 1.5 (dark grey box), 1.0 (stripped box) and 0.5 Âµg (stippled box). The data is representative of single experiment in which all conditions were performed in duplicate. The splicing products of the <em>fosB</em> mini-gene transcripts were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using primers that detect both the intron retained transcript (IR) and the intron spliced transcript (IS). An example of the PCR products generated from ISS/WT transcripts isolated from HeLa cells co-transfected with either bluescript (A) or PTB 1 (B) is shown in the inset. The data is represented as the ratio of IS to IR mRNA. Bars display the standard error, *p&lt;0.05.</p>
