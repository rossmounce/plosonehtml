Two nucleotides indicated by asterisks were mutated to disrupt PTB binding (ISS/T6). <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mini RNA transcripts generated from the 3′ regions of I4 within the ISS/WT and ISS/T6 constructs were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of HeLa nuclear extract before UV cross-linking. Samples were then resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. (B) <em>In vitro</em> splicing reactions containing <sup>32</sup>P-labeled ISS/WT and ISS/T6 fosB pre-mRNA substrate were incubated in HeLa nuclear extract and the resultant products of splicing were resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The size the of RNA markers are shown on the right in nt. IR, IS, IVS-E5 and E4 indicate the intron retained transcript, the intron spliced transcript, the intermediate lariat and exon 4, respectively. (C) RNA products from the gels in (B) were cut out and PCR assays with primers specific for each product were used to amplify the IR, IS and IVS-E5 products. DNA markers are indicated on the right in nt. (D) HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with ISS/WT (white box) or ISS/T6 mutant <em>fos B</em> mini-gene sequence (dark grey box) and either a control plasmid (bluescript) or a construct containing cDNA corresponding to PTB 1. Addition of the control plasmid ensured equal levels of DNA within the transfection assay. The amounts of PTB 1 plasmid used per well in the transfection assays were 1.5 µg (light grey stippled box), and 0.5 µg (dark grey stippled box). The data is representative of single experiment in which all conditions were performed in duplicate. The splicing products of the <em>fosB</em> mini-gene transcripts were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using primers that detect both the intron retained transcript (IR) and the intron spliced transcript (IS). The data is represented as the ratio of IS to IR mRNA. Bars display the standard error, *p&lt;0.01.</p>
