Alternatively, samples were phosphatase treated either after or before the UV cross-linking step (lanes 2 and 3, XP and PX, respectively) or phosphatase digested and kinase treated before or after cross-linking (lanes 4 and 5, PKX and XPK, respectively). Samples were resolved by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The position of a protein molecular weight marker is indicated on the right in kDa.</p>
