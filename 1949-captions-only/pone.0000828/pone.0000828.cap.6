                Figure 6.  PTB and U2AF65 bind to the 3′ end of fosB I4.(A) 32P-labeled mini RNA substrate transcribed from the 3′ region of I4 within the ISS/WT construct were incubated in the presence of either control HeLa nuclear extract (lanes 1 and 3) or PTB-depleted HeLa nuclear extract (lanes 2 and 4) before UV cross-linking. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with either an α-PTB antibody (lanes 1 and 2) or an α-U2AF65 antibody (lanes 3 and 4). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. (B) 32P-labeled mini RNA substrates transcribed from the 3′ region of I4 within either the ISS/WT (lanes 1 and 3) or ISS/T6 constructs (lanes 2 and 4) were incubated in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract before UV cross-linking. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with either an α-PTB antibody (lanes 1 and 2) or an α-U2AF65 antibody (lanes 3 and 4), resolved by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.
