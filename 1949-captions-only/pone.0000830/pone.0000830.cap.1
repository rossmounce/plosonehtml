                Figure 1.  These three curves depict the gain (loss) in assembled singletons when a 400 000 sequences project is divided equally into two 200 000 sequences projects on sub-communities of increasing sizes, assuming uniform abundance.The values of the horizontal axis are the sizes, in fraction, of the smaller sub-communities. In curve (A), the total number of species is 5000, thus N(L−T)/(MG) = 0.1072 In curve (B), the total number of species is 1000, and N(L−T)/(MG) = 0.5360 approaches ln 2. In curve (C), with only 680 species, N(L−T)/(MG) = 0.7882 exceeds ln 2, and losses are observed when the smallest subcommunity is too small.
