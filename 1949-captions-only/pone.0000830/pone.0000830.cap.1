In curve (A), the total number of species is 5000, thus <em>N</em>(<em>L</em>−<em>T</em>)/(<em>MG</em>) = 0.1072 In curve (B), the total number of species is 1000, and <em>N</em>(<em>L</em>−<em>T</em>)/(<em>MG</em>) = 0.5360 approaches ln 2. In curve (C), with only 680 species, <em>N</em>(<em>L</em>−<em>T</em>)/(<em>MG</em>) = 0.7882 exceeds ln 2, and losses are observed when the smallest subcommunity is too small.</p>
