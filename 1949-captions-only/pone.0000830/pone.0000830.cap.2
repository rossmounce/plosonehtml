                Figure 2.  These three curves show the gain in assembled singletons when a 400 000 sequences project is divided equally into two 200 000 sequences projects on sub-communities of increasing sizes, for three communities with different structure and diversity.The values of the horizontal axis are the sizes, in fraction, of the smaller sub-communities. For the top curve, the community has 4991 equally abundant species. For the middle curve, the community has 4991 species whose abundance distribution mimics the distribution of surnames in the Province of Quebec. The community for the bottom curve is formed by the 1319 most abundant species of the preceding community.
