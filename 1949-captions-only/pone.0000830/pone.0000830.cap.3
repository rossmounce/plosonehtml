                Figure 3.  This figure shows parts of the spectra of assemblies resulting from a split of a 400 000 sequences simulated project of Quebec-Ohana in two sub-communities representing, respectively, 10% and 90% of the species.The small sub-community has fewer small contigs than the large sub-community, but more larger contigs, for sizes greater than 5.
