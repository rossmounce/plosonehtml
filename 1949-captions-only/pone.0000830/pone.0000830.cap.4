                Figure 4.  These three curves show the distances between the two assembly spectra obtained by splitting equally a sequencing effort on two sub-communities of pM and (1âˆ’p)M species, for values of p from 0.05 to 0.5, and for three communities with different structure and diversity.For all values of p, the two curves corresponding to Quebec-Ohana communities are very close. For p larger than 0.3, the three curves are almost identical.
