Association of SLC30A8 SNP rs13266634 (A) and HHEX SNPs rs1111875 (B) and rs7923837 (C) with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Plasma levels of glucose (lower panels) and insulin (upper panels) during IVGTT. Dominant model: black circles â€“ homozygous carriers of the major allele; white circles: heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the minor allele.
