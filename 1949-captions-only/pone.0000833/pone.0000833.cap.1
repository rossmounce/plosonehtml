Heterozygous neuroblasts showed normal spindles with correct localization of CP190 at the poles in metaphase (A/B) and anaphase (B), and normally condensed chromosomes. Homozygous neuroblasts (C/D) showed fragmented, hyper-condensed and aneuploid chromosomes, and disorganised mitotic spindles usually lacking CP190.</p>
