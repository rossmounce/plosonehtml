                Figure 1.  Dpa1 mutants show abnormal chromosome condensation and unorganised mitotic spindles.Neuroblasts of heterozygous or homozygous third instar larvae (prepared as in 4) were stained for: centrosomes (red) using CP190 antibodies (a kind gift from Will Whitfield) and Goat anti-rabbit TxRed (Jackson labs); spindles (green) using anti-tubulin (Clone DM1A-Sigma) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Jackson Labs); and DNA (blue) using DAPI (Sigma). Heterozygous neuroblasts showed normal spindles with correct localization of CP190 at the poles in metaphase (A/B) and anaphase (B), and normally condensed chromosomes. Homozygous neuroblasts (C/D) showed fragmented, hyper-condensed and aneuploid chromosomes, and disorganised mitotic spindles usually lacking CP190.
