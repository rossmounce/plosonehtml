Shaded arrows designate the 2<sup>nd</sup> dsRNA made from MCM6/7. b. Agarose gel of RT-PCR products showing the effects of RNAi depletion of individual MCMs on MCM mRNA expression levels. Horizontal numbers designate the MCM targeted by RNAi. Vertical numbers show the RT PCR target. The data presented is one complete representative data set from multiple repetitions. c. Western blot to show the effect of RNAi depletion of individual MCMs on MCM protein expression levels in total cell extracts. Horizontal numbers designate the MCM targeted by RNAi. Vertical numbers show the antibody used for western blotting. Tubulin expression is included as a loading control. The data presented is one complete representative data set from multiple repetitions.</p>
