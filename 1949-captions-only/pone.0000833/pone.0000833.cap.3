                Figure 3.  Immunoblot to show the effect of MCM depletions on the levels of MCM2, MCM5 ORC5 and CDC45 bound to chromatin.Coomassie stained histones are included as a loading control. The amount of each protein was compared to the histones using Alpha Innotech imager software. Horizontal numbers show the MCM protein targeted by RNAi. Several repetitions of this experiment were performed and this represents 1 complete data set.
