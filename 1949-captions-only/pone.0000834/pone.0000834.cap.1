                Figure 1.  The raw data produced by OPT.Drosophila cleared in Murray's clear, is almost transparent when imaged under brightfield conditions (A–B). The cleared fly allows full excitation and emission of fluorescent light when excited at 480±40 nm (C–F). w1118, and Cha&gt;GFP [30] both have detectable levels of autofluorescence (C–D). However when compared at equal exposure times the GFP line shows greater fluorescence (E–F).
