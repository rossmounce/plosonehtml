                Figure 3.  Visualizing through the head cuticle with confocal microscopy.The CNS can be visualized through the cleared head. Both w1118 (A–F) and Cha&gt;GFP (G–H) were visualized. The brain was imaged from the front (A–C, and G–H) and back (D–F) and structures such as the fan shaped body and ellipsoid body were detected (H arrow and arrowhead).
