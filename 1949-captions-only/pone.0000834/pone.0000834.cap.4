                Figure 4.  Identification of neurodegenerative vacuoles using OPT.OPT was used to identify regions of neurodegeneration in the brains of flies lacking the RNA editing enzyme Adar. Regions that lacked fluorescence were identified from sections in different orientations (A–C) and then these potential vacuoles were highlighted as domains (with different colors) using the MAPaint software (D–F). This was repeated in all sections that the vacuole extended into and this was reconstructed in 3D with respect to the Drosophila head. (I–J). The vacuoles were confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin staining of the OPT imaged head (G–H).
