                Figure 5.  Visualization of â-galactosidase activity.The tau-lacZ enhancer trap flies [26] were stained for â-galactosidase and imaged in brightfield (L). The brightfield channel captured both the â-galactosidase activity and the transparent exoskeleton, both of which are represented in red. The brightfield signal was then superimposed onto the anatomical information generated from the autofluorescence of the same specimen, this is shown in green (A–I). Finally the β-galactosidase activity was painted blue, and reconstructed in 3D along with the other two channels, brightfield red and anatomy green (J–K).
