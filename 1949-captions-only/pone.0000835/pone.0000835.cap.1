COS-7 cells co-transfected with empty vector or OTCΔ were assayed for GFP (A) or luciferase (B) 32 h after transfection. (C): identification of an mtUPR element in the <em>chop</em> promoter was determined by a deletion analysis as shown. Deletions are shown as distance (bp) from the <em>chop</em> transcription start site. The fold activation of the promoter constructs in cells transfected with OTCΔ (slash bars) are compared with vector controls (open bars) as relative luciferase (RLU) activity. RLU activity of the promoter constructs in cells treated with or without 2 µg/ml tunicamycin (TM), to produce erUPR is shown as a control. Data represents the mean±SEM from experiments performed in triplicate.</p>
