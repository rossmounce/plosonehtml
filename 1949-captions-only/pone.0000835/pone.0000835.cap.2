                Figure 2.  Chop and c/ebpβ promoters contain AP-1 sites and are inducible by mtUPR.(A) Nucleotide sequence alignment of the mammalian chop promoters (−278 to −222) from human, bovine, mouse and rat. Bold letters show the highly conserved bases of the AP-1 site and the asterisks show the highly conserved sequence surrounding the AP-1 site in chop promoters. The position of the putative novel element of N 30 [18] is shown in the box. (B): Nucleotide sequences of mammalian c/ebpβ promoter region around AP-1 site (Human, Mouse, and Rat) is compared with the chop promoter sequence (−278 to −233). The numbers refer to the distance from transcription initiation site of human chop or human, mouse, and Rat c/ebpβ. The asterisks indicate the conserved nucleotides around the AP-1 site. (C): C/EBPβ expression in response to mtUPR. Extracts from cells transfected with vector or OTCΔ were subjected to western blotting and probed with antibodies against C/EBPβ and tubulin as control and show that C/EBPβ, like CHOP is induced by expression of OTCΔ.
