Bold letters show the highly conserved bases of the AP-1 site and the asterisks show the highly conserved sequence surrounding the AP-1 site in <em>chop</em> promoters. The position of the putative novel element of N 30 <a href="#pone.0000835-Xie1">[18]</a> is shown in the box. (B): Nucleotide sequences of mammalian <em>c/ebp</em>β promoter region around AP-1 site (Human, Mouse, and Rat) is compared with the <em>chop</em> promoter sequence (−278 to −233). The numbers refer to the distance from transcription initiation site of human <em>chop</em> or human, mouse, and Rat <em>c/ebp</em>β. The asterisks indicate the conserved nucleotides around the AP-1 site. (C): C/EBPβ expression in response to mtUPR. Extracts from cells transfected with vector or OTCΔ were subjected to western blotting and probed with antibodies against C/EBPβ and tubulin as control and show that C/EBPβ, like CHOP is induced by expression of OTCΔ.</p>
