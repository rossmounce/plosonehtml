Extracts from cells transfected with vector or OTCΔ, and treated with or without 10 µM of MEK specific inhibitor PD98059, were subjected to Western transfers probed with antibody against p-JNK. (B) and (C): mtUPR induction of the <em>yme1l1</em>(B) and <em>mpp</em>β(C) promoter is inhibited by the MEK specific inhibitor, PD98059. COS-7 cells co-transfected with vector or OTCΔ and <em>yme1l1</em>and <em>mpp</em>β promoter-reporter constructs, with or without 10 µM of PD98059 were used for luciferase assay 32 h after transfection. The fold activation of the promoter constructs in cells expressing OTCΔ compared with those expressing vector alone, with or without of PD98059, is shown as relative luciferase (RLU) activity. Data represent the mean±SEM from experiments performed in triplicate.</p>
