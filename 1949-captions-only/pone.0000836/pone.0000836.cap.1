B) Both the ER-C4 clone, in which RA signaling was impaired by treatment with the RARα antagonist ER50891 (top), and the DNC8 clone, expressing the dominant negative RARα403 (bottom), were growth-stimulated by RA as shown by both colony formation assay and cell proliferation assay, while their cognate controls (T47D and LXC5, respectively) were growth inhibited. C) RA expedites the G1-S transition in DNC8 cells (left), and significantly induces cyclin D1 transcription (right).</p>
