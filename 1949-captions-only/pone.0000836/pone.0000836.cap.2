                Figure 2.  RA promotes tumor growth in vivo.A) LXC5 and DNC8 cells were xenografted in nude mice, which were treated with RA according to the experimental scheme. B) Weekly assessment of tumor size over six weeks showed that DNC8 xenograft tumors of mice that received RA treatment grew significantly more than tumors of mice that did not received RA treatment (right). LXC5 xenograft tumors underwent growth inhibition in response to RA (left). C) RA significantly promoted cell proliferation as demonstrated by a significantly higher number of Ki67-positive cells (left) and increased cyclin D1 transcription (right) in RA-treated DNC8 cells.
