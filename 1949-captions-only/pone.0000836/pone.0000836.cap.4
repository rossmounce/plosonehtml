                Figure 4.  RARα antagonists counteract both RA-induced growth inhibition and nSMase-mediated CER synthesis.A) RO415253 (RO) (left) and ER50891 (ER) (right) rescued T47D cells from RA-induced growth-inhibition. B) Both RO and ER counteracted the RA-induced CER synthesis. C) Both RO and ER significantly counteracted the transcription of nSMase as well as the transcription of the control downstream RARα direct target RARβ2.
