                Figure 5.  Fenretinide can induce CER also in cells without a functional RARα.A) DGK analysis of CER (autoradiography of CER species in the upper inserts) showing that RA induces CER only in cells with a functional RARα signaling (left), while fenretinide, a retinoid whose action is RAR-independent, can induce CER also in cells without a functional RARα signaling (right). B) Fenretinide-induced CER accumulation has an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect, as shown by cell proliferation assay (left) and the presence of cleaved PARP (right), respectively.
