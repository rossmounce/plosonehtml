                Figure 6.  RA fails to downregulate both SK1 transcription and activity in cells with functional RARÎ± inhibition.A) Downregulation of SK1 activity (S1P spots in the upper insert) in response to RA occurs in LXC5 cells but not DNC8 cells. B) SK1 transcription (but not the transcription of SK2, S1PP, S1P lyase) is downregulated in response to RA in LXC5 cells but not in DNC8 cells.
