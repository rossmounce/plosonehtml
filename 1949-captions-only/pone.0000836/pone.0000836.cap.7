                Figure 7.  Evidence that RA fails to regulate in an opposite fashion CER synthesis and SK activity in cells lacking endogenous RARα.A) Lack of endogenous RARα signaling (left) is demonstrated by lack of RA-induced transcription of the RARα target RARβ2 (right). B) MDA-MB-231 are modestly, but significantly, growth-promoted by RA. C) RA fails to induce nSMase transcription (left), CER synthesis (middle), SK1 transcription downregulation (middle), and decrease of SK activity (right) in MDA-MB-231 cells. D) RA-induced MDA-MB-231 proliferation is significantly decreased by treatment with a SK inhibitor. E) Fenretinide can effectively induce both CER synthesis (left) and apoptosis (right) in MDA-MB-231 cells.
