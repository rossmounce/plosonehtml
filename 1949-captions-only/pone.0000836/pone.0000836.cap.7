B) MDA-MB-231 are modestly, but significantly, growth-promoted by RA. C) RA fails to induce <em>nSMase</em> transcription (left), CER synthesis (middle), <em>SK1</em> transcription downregulation (middle), and decrease of SK activity (right) in MDA-MB-231 cells. D) RA-induced MDA-MB-231 proliferation is significantly decreased by treatment with a SK inhibitor. E) Fenretinide can effectively induce both CER synthesis (left) and apoptosis (right) in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p>
