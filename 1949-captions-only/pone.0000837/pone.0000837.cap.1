                Figure 1.  Increased bone mass due to the GSK-3β insufficiency by radiological and histological comparisons of Gsk-3β+/+ and Gsk-3β+/– littermates at 12 weeks of age.(A) Plain X-ray of the whole body. (B) Plain X-ray of the entire femur. (C) 3D-CT image of the distal femur. (D) von Kossa staining of the proximal tibia (bar, 200 µm) and toluidine blue staining of the growth plate indicated by the inset box above (bar, 20 µm). (E) Histomorphometric analyses of bone volume and bone formation parameters in the proximal tibia. BV/TV, trabecular bone volume per tissue volume; C.Th, cortical thickness; Ob.S/BS, osteoblast surface per trabecular bone surface; Ob.S/B.Pm, osteoblast surface per trabecular bone perimeter; MAR, mineral apposition rate; BFR/BS, bone formation rate per trabescular bone surface. Lower right panel shows fluorescent micrographs of calcein-labeled mineralization fronts of the trabecular bones (bar, 10 µm). (F) Histomorphometric analyses of bone resorption parameters in the proximal tibia. N.Oc/B.Pm, number of osteoclasts per 100 mm of bone perimeter; Oc.S/BS, osteoclast surface per bone surface; ES/BS, eroded surface per bone surface. For (E) and (F), data are mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of 10 mice per genotype. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs. Gsk-3β+/+. (G) Formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts by the co-culture of calvarial primary osteoblasts (POB) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMφ) derived from either Gsk-3β+/+ or Gsk-3β+/– mice. Representative pictures (left; bar, 200 µm) and the number of osteoclasts expressed as mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of 8 wells per group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. Gsk-3β+/+ X Gsk-3β+/+.
