(B) Cell proliferation determined by the XTT assay in osteoblasts during 8 days of culture. Data are the mean (symbols)±SEM (error bars) of 6 dishes/genotype. (C) ALP (top), Alizarin red (middle), and von Kossa (bottom) stainings in osteoblasts cultured for 2 weeks. (D) mRNA levels of type I collagen (Col I), osteopontin, ALP, osteocalcin, Twist-1 and Twist-2, determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis in osteoblasts cultured for 2 weeks. Data are mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to that of the <em>Gsk-3</em>β<sup>+/+</sup> culture 6 wells per genotype. *<em>P&lt;</em>0.01 vs. <em>Gsk-3</em>β<sup>+/+</sup>. (E) von Kossa staining (top) and osteocalcin mRNA level determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis (bottom) of osteoblasts transfected with the adenovirus expressing GFP, wild-type GSK-3β, constitutively active GSK-3β (CA-GSK-3β), or kinase-inactive GSK-3β (KI-GSK-3β), and cultured for 2 weeks. (F) von Kossa staining (top) and osteocalcin mRNA level (bottom) of osteoblasts cultured with and without lithium chloride (LiCl, 16 mM) or SB216763 (10 µM) for 2 weeks. For (E) and (F), the mRNA levels are mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount of mRNA compared to that of the control <em>Gsk-3</em>β<sup>+/+</sup> culture of 6 wells per group. *<em>P&lt;</em>0.01, significant stimulation by the genetic GSK-3β insufficiency. #<em>P&lt;</em>0.01, significant effects by the adenoviral overexpression or the GSK-3β inhibitors.</p>
