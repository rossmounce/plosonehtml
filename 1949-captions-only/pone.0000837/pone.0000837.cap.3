                Figure 3.  Suppression of Runx2 transcriptional activity by GSK-3β.(A) Expressions of GSK-3β and Runx2 determined by immunoblot analysis in mouse calvaria, tibia, and cultured calvarial primary osteoblasts (POB). (B) von Kossa staining (left) and osteocalcin mRNA level determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis (right) of Gsk-3β+/+ and Gsk-3β+/– osteoblasts transfected with the adenovirus expressing GFP or Runx2, and cultured for 2 weeks. The mRNA levels are mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount of mRNA compared to that of the Gsk-3β+/+ with GFP culture of 6 wells per group. *P&lt;0.01, significant stimulation by the Runx2 overexpression. (C) Luciferase reporter analysis of the effects of GSK-3β overexpression on the Runx2 transcriptional activity. HuH-7 cells were transfected with 1,050 OC-Luc alone or in combination with the plasmid expressing Runx2, and co-transfected with 0.1 or 0.2 µg plasmid expressing wild-type GSK-3β, CA-GSK-3β, or KI-GSK-3β, and cultured for 2 weeks. (D) Luciferase reporter analysis of the effects of GSK-3β inhibitors on the Runx2 transcriptional activity. HuH-7 cells were transfected with 1,050 OC-Luc alone or with the plasmid expressing Runx2, and cultured in the presence or absence of two doses of lithium chloride (LiCl) or SB21673 for 2 days. For (C) and (D), data are mean (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative activity compared to control culture of 6 wells per group. *P&lt;0.01 vs. Runx2 alone.
