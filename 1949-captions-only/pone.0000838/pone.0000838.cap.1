                Figure 1.  CCR2/CCR5 Haplotypes and abridged phylogenetic tree.Haplotypes were constructed based on the evolution of linked CCR2 and CCR5 mutations, including a valine to isoleucine substitution at codon 64 in the CCR2b gene (CCR2-64I), CCR5 mutations -2733A→G, -2554 G→T, -2459A→G, -2135C→T, -2132C→T, -2086A→G, -1835C→T, and the delta-32 deletion in the open reading frame of CCR5 (CCR5-ORF).
