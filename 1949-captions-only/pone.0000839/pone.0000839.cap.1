Open and filled arrows identify mutant and wild-type alleles, respectively. (B) Immunoblot analysis of protein samples prepared from isolated retinas of wild-type (<em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup>), heterozygous (<em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/−</sup>) and null (<em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup>) mice using a C-terminal antibody to AE3 (<em>top panel</em>), which recognizes both AE3 isoforms. Open and filled arrows show full length (AE3fl), and cardiac (AE3c) AE3 isoforms, respectively. Parallel blot of protein samples from above were probed with α-tubulin as a loading marker (gray arrow) (<em>bottom panel</em>). (C) Facial characteristics of 8-month old <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mouse.</p>
