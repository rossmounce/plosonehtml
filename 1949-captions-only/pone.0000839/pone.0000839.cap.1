                Figure 1.  Loss of the wild-type Slc4a3 allele and AE3 protein expression in Slc4a3 gene-targeted mice.(A) PCR genotyping of mutant mice using genomic DNA extracted from ear notch biopsies. Open and filled arrows identify mutant and wild-type alleles, respectively. (B) Immunoblot analysis of protein samples prepared from isolated retinas of wild-type (Slc4a3+/+), heterozygous (Slc4a3+/−) and null (Slc4a3−/−) mice using a C-terminal antibody to AE3 (top panel), which recognizes both AE3 isoforms. Open and filled arrows show full length (AE3fl), and cardiac (AE3c) AE3 isoforms, respectively. Parallel blot of protein samples from above were probed with α-tubulin as a loading marker (gray arrow) (bottom panel). (C) Facial characteristics of 8-month old Slc4a3−/− mouse.
