                Figure 2.  Histological analysis, funduscopy, and immunohistochemistry examination of the Slc4a3 −/− mouse retina.Retina cross-sections (20 µm-thick) from Slc4a3+/+ (a) and Slc4a3−/− (b) mice stained with hematoxylin-eosin, scale bar = 50 µm. Electron micrographs of Slc4a3+/+ (c) and Slc4a3−/− (d) mouse retinas, scale bar = 5 µm; OS = outer segment; IS = inner segment; ONL = outer nuclear layer; OPL = outer plexiform layer; INL = inner nuclear layer; IPL = inner plexiform layer; GCL = ganglion cells layer. Fundus photos in 8-month-old Slc4a3+/+ wild type (e) and Slc4a3−/− littermate mouse (f). Confocal microscopic pictures of retina flat mounts stained with GFAP (g, h), scale bar = 50 µm. Confocal microscopic reconstructions (z-stack of 50 µm depth) of fluorescein-filled blood vessels in retina flat mounts showing several loops indicative of shunting between venule and arteriole (arrows) in 8 month old Slc4a3−/− (k) not seen in WT (i); at higher magnification, tortuous vessels are obvious in Slc4a3−/− (j) compared with straight trajectories in Slc4a3+/+(l), scale bar = 100 µm. Confocal fluorescence image of six-month old Slc4a3−/− mouse retina (m), stained with anti-glial fibrilar acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, at the level of the optic nerve head (anterior lamina cribosa), scale bar = 50 µm.
