                Figure 3.  Localization of AE3fl and AE3c in mouse retina and retinal changes in Slc4a3 −/− mice.(a–d) Retina cross sections of 4 months Slc4a3+/+ mice (a, c), showing staining of the outer plexiform layer and Müller cells somas (arrows) and processes (arrowheads), and horizontal cells (diamond), using C-terminus antibody (a); somas in the ganglion cell layer were also immunolabeled. N-terminus antibody (specific to AE3c isoforms) labeled horizontal cell somas and dendrites (c). Specific staining was absent in 4 months Slc4a3−/− littermates (b, d) scale bar = 25 µm. GFAP was restricted to inner limiting membrane in Slc4a3+/+ mice (e), while it stained radial (arrows) and tangential (stars) processes and was elevated in the inner limiting membrane (arrowheads, a and b) in age-matched Slc4a3−/− mice (f); scale bar = 20 µm. (g) Western blot analysis of protein samples (50 µg) prepared from whole retinal lysates of wild-type Slc4a3+/+, and null Slc4a3−/− mice, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (top panel); α-tubulin served as a loading marker (bottom panel). (h) Summary of GFAP expression normalized to α-tubulin. Values are expressed relative to Slc4a3+/+ protein levels. Brackets represent number of retinas analyzed. *Indicates statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.05), compared to Slc4a3+/+ wild type mice. Immunostaining of Slc4a3+/+ (i) and null Slc4a3−/− mice (j) retinas examined by confocal microscopy using double-labeling for Bassoon (OPL, red) and PKC-α (rod bipolar cells, green). Arrows indicate sprouting of processes in the OPL of Slc4a3−/− mice; scale bar = 20 µm.
