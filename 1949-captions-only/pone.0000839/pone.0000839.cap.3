N-terminus antibody (specific to AE3c isoforms) labeled horizontal cell somas and dendrites (c). Specific staining was absent in 4 months <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> littermates (b, d) scale bar = 25 µm. GFAP was restricted to inner limiting membrane in <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> mice (e), while it stained radial (arrows) and tangential (stars) processes and was elevated in the inner limiting membrane (arrowheads, a and b) in age-matched <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice (f); scale bar = 20 µm. (g) Western blot analysis of protein samples (50 µg) prepared from whole retinal lysates of wild-type <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup>, and null <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (<em>top panel</em>); α-tubulin served as a loading marker (<em>bottom panel</em>). (h) Summary of GFAP expression normalized to α-tubulin. Values are expressed relative to <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> protein levels. Brackets represent number of retinas analyzed. *Indicates statistically significant difference (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05), compared to <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> wild type mice. Immunostaining of <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> (i) and null <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice (j) retinas examined by confocal microscopy using double-labeling for Bassoon (OPL, red) and PKC-α (rod bipolar cells, green). Arrows indicate sprouting of processes in the OPL of <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice; scale bar = 20 µm.</p>
