                Figure 4.  ERG responses in Slc4a3 −/− mice.(a) Diminished ratios of ERG b-wave over a-wave maximal amplitudes for Slc4a3−/− mice under scotopic adaptation when normalized against age-matched Slc4a3−/− mice. Lowered b/a ratios indicate preferential b- over a-wave loss, and these differences were statistically significant at 1–8 months of age. (b) Decline with age of scotopic a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, as well as photopic b-wave amplitude and critical flicker fusion for Slc4a3−/− mice, normalized against age-matched Slc4a3−/− mice. In comparison with other parameters, scotopic a-wave amplitude began to decline at later ages. (c–e) Intensity response curves for scotopic (c) a-waves and (d) b-waves, as well as for (e) photopic b-waves. (f) Amplitude of flicker response in function of stimulus frequency under photopic adaptation. (g–i) Representative ERG traces obtained during intensity response series under (g) scotopic and (h) photopic adaptation, and during (i) flicker frequency series under photopic adaptation. For panels (a–f), results depict the mean ± s.e.m. For panels (g–i), units on the left are in (g–h) cds/m2, and (i) Hz.
