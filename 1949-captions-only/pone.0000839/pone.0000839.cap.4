Lowered b/a ratios indicate preferential b- over a-wave loss, and these differences were statistically significant at 1–8 months of age. (b) Decline with age of scotopic a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, as well as photopic b-wave amplitude and critical flicker fusion for <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice, normalized against age-matched <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In comparison with other parameters, scotopic a-wave amplitude began to decline at later ages. (c–e) Intensity response curves for scotopic (c) a-waves and (d) b-waves, as well as for (e) photopic b-waves. (f) Amplitude of flicker response in function of stimulus frequency under photopic adaptation. (g–i) Representative ERG traces obtained during intensity response series under (g) scotopic and (h) photopic adaptation, and during (i) flicker frequency series under photopic adaptation. For panels (a–f), results depict the mean ± s.e.m. For panels (g–i), units on the left are in (g–h) cds/m<sup>2</sup>, and (i) Hz.</p>
