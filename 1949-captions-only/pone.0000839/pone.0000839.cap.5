(A) HEK293 cells individually transfected with CAII, CAXIV, and NBC1, cDNAs, and mock-transfected HEK293 cells, respectively, were used for positive and negative control of retinal immunoblots. Protein samples (50 µg) were probed with α-tubulin as a loading marker for <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> and <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> retinas. (B) Summary of the protein expression normalized to α-tubulin. Values are expressed relative to the <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> protein expression. The amount of CAII, CAXIV, and NBC1 protein is increased in the <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mutant relative to wild type <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> mice. Brackets represent number of retinas analyzed. *Indicates statistically significant difference (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05), compared to <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>+/+</sup> wild type mice.</p>
