                Figure 5.  Expression of carbonic anhydrases II and XIV, and NBC1 Na+/HCO3 − cotransporter proteins in Slc4a3−/− mice.CAII, CAXIV, and NBC1 expression in adult Slc4a3−/− and wild type mouse retinal extracts, detected on immunoblots. (A) HEK293 cells individually transfected with CAII, CAXIV, and NBC1, cDNAs, and mock-transfected HEK293 cells, respectively, were used for positive and negative control of retinal immunoblots. Protein samples (50 µg) were probed with α-tubulin as a loading marker for Slc4a3−/− and Slc4a3+/+ retinas. (B) Summary of the protein expression normalized to α-tubulin. Values are expressed relative to the Slc4a3+/+ protein expression. The amount of CAII, CAXIV, and NBC1 protein is increased in the Slc4a3−/− mutant relative to wild type Slc4a3+/+ mice. Brackets represent number of retinas analyzed. *Indicates statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.05), compared to Slc4a3+/+ wild type mice.
