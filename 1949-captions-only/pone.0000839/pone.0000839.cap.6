Immunofluorescence signals were visualized by Alexa fluor 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (red, 1:100 dilution). Sections were mounted in a DAPI media to identify nuclei, and images collected with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective (Neofluar oil). Merged images display CAII and CAXIV labeling overlapping nuclei staining. Scale bar = 20 µm. ONL = outer nuclear layer; OPL = outer plexiform layer; INL = inner nuclear layer; IPL = inner plexiform layer; GCL = ganglion cells layer.</p>
