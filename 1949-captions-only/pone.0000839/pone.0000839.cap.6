                Figure 6.  Localization of carbonic anhydrases II and XIV in Slc4a3−/− mouse retina.Frozen vertical sections of adult wild type Slc4a3+/+ and Slc4a3−/− null mouse littermates retina were mounted in the same slide and labeled with goat anti-CAII ((A), 1:100 dilution) or goat anti-CAXIV ((B), 1:100 dilution) antibodies. Immunofluorescence signals were visualized by Alexa fluor 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (red, 1:100 dilution). Sections were mounted in a DAPI media to identify nuclei, and images collected with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective (Neofluar oil). Merged images display CAII and CAXIV labeling overlapping nuclei staining. Scale bar = 20 µm. ONL = outer nuclear layer; OPL = outer plexiform layer; INL = inner nuclear layer; IPL = inner plexiform layer; GCL = ganglion cells layer.
