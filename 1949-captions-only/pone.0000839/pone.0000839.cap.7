Nuclei (blue) are stained with DAPI dye. Apoptotic nuclei are shown (green) in retinas of age-matched <em>Slc4a3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice littermates, with predominant apoptotic nuclei found at 6-months of age. (B) Model demonstrating functional significance of AE3fl expression in Müller glial cells, and functional significance of AE3c in horizontal cells. In Müller cells, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CAII) can trap CO<sub>2</sub> release by the photoreceptors intracellularly by converting to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. AE3fl located in Müller cells end feet facilitate the removal intro the vitreous or the blood of the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, in a process that is maximized by the CAXIV. In horizontal cells, AE3c may contribute to pH<sub>i</sub> homeostasis by exchanging intracellularly produced HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> with Cl<sup>−</sup>. CAII and CAXIV are also involved in tight regulation of horizontal cells pH<sub>i</sub>, increasing the effectiveness of the bicarbonate buffer system.</p>
