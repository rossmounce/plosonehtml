                Figure 7.  Apoptosis in retinas of Slc4a3−/− mice.(A) Absence of apoptotic nuclei in retinas of 4 and 6-month-old Slc4a3+/+ mice. Nuclei (blue) are stained with DAPI dye. Apoptotic nuclei are shown (green) in retinas of age-matched Slc4a3−/− mice littermates, with predominant apoptotic nuclei found at 6-months of age. (B) Model demonstrating functional significance of AE3fl expression in Müller glial cells, and functional significance of AE3c in horizontal cells. In Müller cells, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CAII) can trap CO2 release by the photoreceptors intracellularly by converting to HCO3− and H+. AE3fl located in Müller cells end feet facilitate the removal intro the vitreous or the blood of the HCO3− and H+, in a process that is maximized by the CAXIV. In horizontal cells, AE3c may contribute to pHi homeostasis by exchanging intracellularly produced HCO3− with Cl−. CAII and CAXIV are also involved in tight regulation of horizontal cells pHi, increasing the effectiveness of the bicarbonate buffer system.
