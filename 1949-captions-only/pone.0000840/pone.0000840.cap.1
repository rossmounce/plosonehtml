                Figure 1.  Cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart of monthly incidence of hospitalizations due to myocardial infarction from January 1, 1997 to March 30, 2006.Assigning 1997 and 1998 as a baseline period, a target mean of 47.1 hospitalizations due to myocardial infarctions per 100,000 and a standard deviation of 2.8 per 100,000.The threshold for CUSUM was calculated as 1.18, yielding an average-run-length of 50 (dashed red line). An aberration, two standard deviations from baseline, was initially detected in January of 2000, with a CUSUM value of 1.37 and 51.5 myocardial infarction-related hospitalization per 100,000 stays (solid line).
