Prescriptions for rofecoxib and celecoxib peaked in 2001 with 52,466,000. Incidence of stays due to myocardial infarction also peaked in 2001 with 62.3 hospitalizations per 10,000. B) Line graphs show the interrupted time series of myocardial infarction-related hospitalizations. Prescriptions for rofecoxib and celecoxib explained approximately 50.3 percent of the deviance in yearly variation of myocardial infarction related hospitalizations.</p>
