Also shown is a coiled-coil prediction for Yel1 <a href="#pone.0000842-Lupas1">[40]</a>. (B) Alignment of Yel1 with its two closest relatives from Fungi. The sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW and shaded grey when more then half the residues are related and black when they are identical. The positions of the Sec7, the PH domain and regions related to the EFA6 family of GEFs are indicated. (C) Alignment of the second EFA6-like domain found in Yel1 (highlighted in (B)) with those from other species. The C-terminal 157 residues of Yel1 were used for a PSI-BLAST search (cut off E&lt;0.005, and after one iteration found Drosophila EFA6 (CG31158, E = 4×10<sup>−5</sup>), and after two iterations found several mammalian EFA6s (E = 6×10<sup>−10</sup>). No members of the other mammalian Sec7 domain families were obtained, even after six iterations after which no further sequences were found above the threshold. (D) Alignment of the Sec7 domain from Yel1 with those from yeast Sec7 and Syt1 and human EFA6B (PSD4), ARNO (PSCD2) and GRP1 (PSCD3). The critical catalytic glutamate (E) is highlighted (red asterix). <em>Aa, A. aegypti; Eg, E. gossippi; Dm, D. melanogaster; Hs, H. sapiens; Kl, K. lactis; Sc, S. cerevisiae; Sp, S. pombe.</em></p>
