Arfs and Arls were tagged at the C-terminus and expressed from a <em>PHO5</em> promotor in both a wild-type (BY4741, top panel) and a <em>yel1</em>Δ strain (lower panel). Only the distribution of Arf3 was affected by loss of Yel1. (B) Arf3 tagged in the genome of wild-type (BY4741), and <em>yel1</em>Δ mutant strains under its own promotor. Under these conditions loss of Yel1 results in an increase in cytoplasmic Arf3 as in (A). In addition some weak plasma membrane fluorescence is apparent, although this is no longer restricted to sites of polarisied growth, and is not affected by additional loss of Syt1 (C).</p>
