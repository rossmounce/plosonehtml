                Figure 3.  The Sec7 domain of Yel1 is required for its localisation and for the localisation of Arf3.Fluorescent micrographs of live yeast expressing the indicated fusion proteins. (A) Yel1 was tagged with GFP in the genome of an arf3Δ strain, whereas Arf3-RFP was expressed in the same cells from a CEN plasmid under the control of a PHO5 promotor. The two proteins were found to co-localise both to regions of polarised growth and to occasional intracellular structures. At the bud neck and bud tip the distribution of Yel1 was more restricted than that of Arf3 (arrows, right hand panels). (B) Loss of the N-terminal portion of the Yel1 protein (GFP-Yel1(388-687) resulted in its redistribution to the cytoplasm, along with Arf3-RFP. (C) Expression of the Sec7 domain of Yel1 (RFP-Yel1(1-285)) failed to rescue the mislocalisation of Arf3-GFP in a yel1Δ strain.
