The kinetics of GDP to GTP exchange on Arfs were monitored by determining the binding of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS to 2.5 µM rArf1, rArf3 or rArl1 in the absence or presence of 50 nM Yel1 Sec7 domain as described in <a href="#s3">Materials and Methods</a>. Fold stimulation (right hand panel) is shown as the difference in GDP to GTP exchange at 2 mins+ and –GEF. It should be noted that the rate of spontaneous exchange on Arl1 is higher than that of Arf1 or Arf3, perhaps implying that, at least <em>in vitro,</em> Arl1 has a lower intrinsic affinity for nucleotides than either of the other G protein. Since the N-terminal amphipathic helix is known to play a role in “locking” G proteins in their GDP-bound conformation, it may be that removal of this domain from Arl1 has a more stimulatory effect on spontaneous nucleotide exchange than the same deletion from Arf1 or Arf3. (B) Comparison of the efficiency of Sec7 domains from different GEFs to stimulate GDP to GTP exchange on Arf3. Exchange on rArf3 was monitored as in (A) with Sec7 domains from Yel1 (cross symbols), Syt1 (squares), Sec7 (triangles) and human ARNO (circles) added at a final concentration of 50 nM. Fold stimulation (right hand panel) is shown as the difference in GDP to GTP exchange at 2 mins+ and –the different GEF proteins. Values are the means of two or three independent experiments performed in duplicate and were converted to pmoles by determining the CPM/pmole of GTPγS for each experiment. The maximum binding corresponded to ≈15–20% of the concentration of rArf3 used.</p>
