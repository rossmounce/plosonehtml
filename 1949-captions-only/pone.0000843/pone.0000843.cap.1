Example images are displayed at three time points following the start of illumination (marked above). Arrowheads at 30 s point at punctate staining of putative neurons. Note the larger and steadily increasing number of diffusely-fluorescing, putative astroglia in slices from the mutant mouse. Scale bar = 25 µm. (B) Summary diagram of diffuse DAF-2DA fluorescent changes over time. Data are displayed as mean FI±S.E.M from identified single cells (control-26 cells from 4 slices, open circles; mutants–58 cells from 4 slices, closed squares).</p>
