                Figure 2.  Diffusely-stained astrocytes are prevalent in confocal images from mutant mice.(A) Example of confocal images from DAF-2DA incubated neocortical slices. Punctate, putative neuronal staining is dominating in slices from control mice (left), and diffuse fluorescence is dominating in the mutant's slice (right). Scale bar = 25 µm. (B) Diffuse DAF-2DA staining (green) is co-localized with the specific astrocytic marker SR101 (red). Examples from confocal images of a single cell are displayed. Scale bar = 10 µm. (C) Merging image of SR101 and DAF-2DA staining (projection of four 5 µm thick images). Cells which stain with both dyes appear in yellow. Over 95% of the cells displayed co-localization (4 slices, 2 animals). Scale bar = 20 µm.
