The arrowhead points to the location of the pipette tip. Scale bar = 20 Âµm. (B) A fluorescent image of the same region as in (A) reveals several diffusely fluorescent cells. The arrowhead position is the same as in (A). (C) A series of current pulses at 0.1 nA increments were delivered through the recording pipette (inset). A plot of the current pulse intensity (I) vs. the voltage deflection (Vm) reveals linear relationship characteristic of astroglia.</p>
