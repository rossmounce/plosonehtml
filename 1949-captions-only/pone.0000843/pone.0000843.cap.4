                Figure 4.  Mutant astroglial NOS activity is unaffected by NOS2 inhibitor.Example images from slices incubated in the selective NOS2 inhibitor 1400W (3 µM) for at least 30 minutes. At 30 seconds from the beginning of illumination (left panels), neuronal punctate fluorescence (arrow heads) was abundant in slices from either mutant or control mice. At 180 seconds (right panels), astrocytic diffuse fluorescence is abolished in slices from control mice, but not in mutant slices. Images were taken with ND4 filter to slow the response and allow for cells' separation. Scale bar = 20 µm.
