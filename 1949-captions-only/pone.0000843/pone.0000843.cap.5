Single cells FI is plotted over time of illumination, and data are expressed as mean±SEM. (A) Putative neurons identified by punctate DAF-2DA fluorescence were not affected by thapsigargin in either mutant (closed squares, 32 cells, 6 slices) or control (open circles, n = 27 cells, 7 slices) mice. (B) Astroglial diffuse fluorescence displayed normal kinetics in control, thapsigargin-treated slices (n = 19 cells, 7 slices), but was almost completely abolished in slices from mutant mice (n = 2 cells, 6 slices).</p>
