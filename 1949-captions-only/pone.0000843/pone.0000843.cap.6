(B) The results of NOS radioenzymatic assay reveal an increase in the total NOS activity in mutant mice neocortex (open bars, p = 0.01). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent NOS fraction (gray bars) did not differ between the two mice strains. Data from 3 animals of each strain is displayed as meanÂ±SD.</p>
