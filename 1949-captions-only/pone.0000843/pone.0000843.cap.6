                Figure 6.  NOS proteins are conserved in the mutant neocortex, but NOS activity is increased.(A) Example of western blot analysis from 3 control and 3 mutant mice neocortex, demonstrating tight conservation of all 3 NOS proteins. (B) The results of NOS radioenzymatic assay reveal an increase in the total NOS activity in mutant mice neocortex (open bars, p = 0.01). The Ca2+-independent NOS fraction (gray bars) did not differ between the two mice strains. Data from 3 animals of each strain is displayed as meanÂ±SD.
