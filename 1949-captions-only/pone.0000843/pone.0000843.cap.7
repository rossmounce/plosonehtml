                Figure 7.  Pyramidal neurons do not exhibit DAF-2DA fluorescence.(A) IR/DIC image of a recorded pyramidal neuron (arrow) and the patch pipette. Scale bar = 25 Âµm. (B) Fluorescence image of the recording region, revealing fluorescent cells other than the recorded one. The arrow marks the location of the recorded neurons as in (A). (C) Example traces from the recorded neuron in response to injected current pulses. The firing pattern is typical of a regular-spiking pyramidal neuron.
