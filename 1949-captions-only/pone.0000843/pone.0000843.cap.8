                Figure 8.  Mutant mice differed from their controls in stress related aspects of exploratory behavior.(A) Control mice (n = 16,) were compared to mutant mice (n = 11, open circles) in the Open-Field test. The general motor activity was measured as the total distance traveled during the test. The Freezing was measured as the latency to escape from the center of the field. Rearing and entries to the center of the field episodes were counted. (B) Example parameters from the results of the Hole-Board test are displayed. The motor activity is measured as the total distance traveled during the test. Grooming episodes are counted (control-n = 6, gray closed squares controls; mutants-n = 9, open circles). For all tests, data is displayed as mean±S.E.M. Significant difference between the groups on a specific day are marked: *-p≤0.05; **-p≤0.01; ***-p≤0.001.
