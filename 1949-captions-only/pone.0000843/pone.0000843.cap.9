                Figure 9.  Mutant mice exhibit increased in stress-related parameters on the Elevated Plus maze.Control mice (n = 13, dark gray bars) were compared to mutant mice (n = 10, light gray bars) on the Elevated Plus maze. The time spent in the open or closed arms was measured. Risk assessment designates the combined number of stretch/attend postures and head dipping episodes. Systemic injection with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (50 mg/kg i.p., n = 10) 10 hours prior to testing improved the performance of mutant mice on the Elevated Plus maze, resulting in significant differences between them and saline-injected animals (n = 11). Control animals were injected with saline only (n = 11), and their motor behavior was not significantly different from non-injected animals.
