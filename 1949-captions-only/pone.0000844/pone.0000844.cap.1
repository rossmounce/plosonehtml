Control cells were transfected with pSHAG1Luc vector. Knockdown of NDRG1 downregulates E-cadherin protein levels but not other proteins of the E-cadherin complex or PCNA, actin was used as a loading control. (B) DU-145 cells transfected with pCMVNDRG1 and pCMVNDRG1flag constructs, 48 h post transfection cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 ÂµM) for 6h and probed for E-cadherin by western blotting. E-cadherin is stabilized in cells overexpressing NDRG1 or NDRG1flag. (C) Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue array shows representative tumors stained for both NDRG1 and E-cadherin. Analysis of average intensity of both the proteins reveal NDRG1 and E-cadherin expression correlates significantly (n = 32, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8448). (D) DU145 cells transfected with NDRG1-Flag constructs were lysed with cell lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated and probed for proteins of the E-cadherin complex, none of the probed proteins of the E-cadherin complex interacts with NDRG1. (Figures A, B and D are representatives of at least three independent experiments.)</p>
