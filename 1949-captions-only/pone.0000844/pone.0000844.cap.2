                Figure 2.  NDRG1 colocalizes with recycling E-cadherin and co-fractionates with recycling endosome.(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of CWR22R cells labeled with E-cadherin antibody and chelated with EDTA. Cells were replated on calcium supplemented media and probed with primary antibody against NDRG1 and secondary antibodies against NDRG1 and E-cadherin after different time intervals. NDRG1 colocalizes with recycling E-cadherin. (B) Organelle fractions (from top to bottom) of DU-145 cells chelated with EDTA and subjected to a sucrose density gradient centrifugation were analyzed by western blotting. NDRG1 strongly localizes to a membrane organelle in cells treated with EDTA. (C) Western blotting of EDTA chelated NDRG1 positive fractions in DU-145 cells reveals NDRG1 cofractionates with E-cadherin (D) Western blotting of NDRG1 positive fractions after sucrose density gradient in HEK293 cells reveals NDRG1 co-fractionates with recycling and late endosomal markers cells after Ca2+ chelation. (All figures are representatives of at least three independent experiments.)
