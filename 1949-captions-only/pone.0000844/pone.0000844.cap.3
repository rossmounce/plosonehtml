                Figure 3.  NDRG1 interacts with GTP-bound Rab4GTPase.(A) HEK293 cells transfected with NDRG1Flag vector lysed in Tris-buffered saline, immunoprecipitated using M2-agarose and probed for different RabGTPase by western blotting. NDRG1 interacts specifically with Rab4a. Lanes 2 and 3 are immunoprecipitation from two different experiments. (B) Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using Rab4a antibody and probed with flag antibody detects a single band in NDRG1 flag transfected cell lysates. (C) Immunoprecitation of NDRG1 carried out in cell lysis buffer containing 1% TritonX100 and in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Binding of NDRG1 to Rab4a is sensitive to TritonX100. (D) NDRG1flag purified from Drosophila S2 cells and bound to M2 agarose were incubated with purified Rab4aGST loaded with GTPÎ³S and GDP. Bound proteins were analyzed by western blotting, NDRG1 specifically binds to Rab4aGST loaded with GTP.
