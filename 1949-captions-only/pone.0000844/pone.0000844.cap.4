                Figure 4.  NDRG1 interacts with wild type and Q67L mutant of Rab4a but not with S22N mutant.(A) Immunoprecipitation of flag-tagged wild type and mutant Rab4a reveals NDRG1 interacts specifically with wild type and GTP-bound Q67L mutant of Rab4a. (B) Confocal microscopy of NDRG1DsRed2-HEK293 stable cells reveal NDRG1 localize asymmetrically around the nucleus (N) to discrete perinuclear (PN) vesicles. NDRG1 is also seen to localize to membrane ruffles (arrow). Scale bar indicates 10Âµm length. (C) Wild type and GDP-bound (S22N) EGFP fusion of Rab4a transfected in NDRG1DsRed2-HEK293 stable cells reveal vesicular NDRG1 colocalizes with wild type Rab4a but not with the S22N mutant.
