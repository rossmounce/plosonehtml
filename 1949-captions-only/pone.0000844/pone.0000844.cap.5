(B) <em>In vitro</em> translated NDRG1 was incubated with purified recycling endosomes in the presence of recombinant GTPÎ³S bound Rab4a and HEK293 cytosol.NDRG1 recruits on recycling endosomes independent of Rab4a or other cytosolic proteins. (C) Lipid overlay assay using purified NDRG1flag protein (1ug) shows NDRG1 binds strongly to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. (All figures are representatives of at least three independent experiments.)</p>
