                Figure 5.  NDRG1 recruits to recycling endosome by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and interacts with Rab4GTPase.(A) NDRG1DsRed2-HEK293 stable cells transfected with Rab4aQ67LEGFP mutant reveal NDRG1 interacts with Rab4aQ67LEGFP at the perinuclear region. (B) In vitro translated NDRG1 was incubated with purified recycling endosomes in the presence of recombinant GTPÎ³S bound Rab4a and HEK293 cytosol.NDRG1 recruits on recycling endosomes independent of Rab4a or other cytosolic proteins. (C) Lipid overlay assay using purified NDRG1flag protein (1ug) shows NDRG1 binds strongly to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. (All figures are representatives of at least three independent experiments.)
