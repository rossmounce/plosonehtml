The lower image panel is a still from <a href="#pone.0000844.s005">Movie S3</a>. (B) Transferrin recycling assay in HEK293 cells transfected with NDRG1 shRNA and control shRNA reveal a slower clearance of biotinylated transferrin from the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) in knockdown cells. The graph below shows the percentage of recycled transferrin (see <a href="#s3">methods</a>) in the NDRG1 knockdown (▴) as compared to control (▪) cells. The error bars represent standard deviation of 3 independent experiments. (C) Transferrin recycling assay in HEK293 cells transfected with NDRG1flag constructs and empty vector constructs reveal a faster clearance of biotinylated transferrin from the ERC in NDRG1 overexpressing cells as compared to empty control cells. The graph below shows the percentage of recycled transferrin in the NDRG1 overexpressing cells (▴) as compared to control (▪) cells.</p>
