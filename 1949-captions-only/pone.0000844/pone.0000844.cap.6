                Figure 6.  NDRG1 affects transferrin recycling kinetics.(A) Live Cell confocal images of stable NDRG1DsRed2-HEK293 cells pulsed with transferrin for 5 min to load the early endosome and 60 min to load recycling/sorting vesicles reveal NDRG1DsRed2 colocalizes with recycling transferrin. The lower image panel is a still from Movie S3. (B) Transferrin recycling assay in HEK293 cells transfected with NDRG1 shRNA and control shRNA reveal a slower clearance of biotinylated transferrin from the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) in knockdown cells. The graph below shows the percentage of recycled transferrin (see methods) in the NDRG1 knockdown (▴) as compared to control (▪) cells. The error bars represent standard deviation of 3 independent experiments. (C) Transferrin recycling assay in HEK293 cells transfected with NDRG1flag constructs and empty vector constructs reveal a faster clearance of biotinylated transferrin from the ERC in NDRG1 overexpressing cells as compared to empty control cells. The graph below shows the percentage of recycled transferrin in the NDRG1 overexpressing cells (▴) as compared to control (▪) cells.
