                Figure 7.  Live cell confocal microscopy confirms NDRG1 involvement with recycling E-cadherin.Live cell confocal images of stable NDRG1DsRed2-HEK293 cells transfected transiently with E-cadherinEGFP construct and plated in calcium-supplemented media after being chelated with EDTA shows NDRG1DsRed2 positive vesicles interact with recycling E-cadherinEGFP both near the perinuclear space and close to the membrane. The image is a still from Movie S4.
