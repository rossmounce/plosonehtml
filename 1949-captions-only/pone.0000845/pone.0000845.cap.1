                Figure 1.  H19 RNA is largely induced in response to hypoxic stress and moderately by hypoxia-mimicking condition triggered by CoCl2 in Hep3B.Hep3B cells were cultured under normal culture conditions for 24 hours before hypoxic or CoCl2 manipulation. Cells were either placed into an aneoropack rectangular jar to create a hypoxic condition within an hour, or left under normal culture conditions. Incubation lasted for 24 hours before RNA extraction. (A) Shown are RT-PCR products of H19 gene (28 PCR cycles) cultured under normal conditions-lane 1, or hypoxic conditions-lane 2 (lane M indicates the marker, and C is a PCR blank without a target). (B) PCR for Histone H3.3 as a positive control for RT-PCR integrity. Shown also are RT-PCR products of both the H19 gene (32 PCR cycles) (C), the GAPDH gene (D) for untreated Hep3B (lane1) and for 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 µM CoCl2 treated cells (lanes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively). Incubation with the indicated concentrations of CoCl2 lasted for an additional 22 hours before RNA extraction. QPCR analysis for H19 RNA levels normalized to β-actin in Hep3B treated CoCl2 is shown in (E) where the numbers above the bars indicate the concentrations of CoCl2 used.
