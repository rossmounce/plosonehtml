(B): Hep3B cells were transfected under normal medium with siRNA duplex that targets the luciferase gene (lanes 1 and 5) and with 3 different H19 siRNA duplexes (lanes 2–4). Twenty four hours post transfection, media was changed, and 100 µM CoCl<sub>2</sub> containing media was added except for lane 5 which continued to grow under normal culture media; the incubation lasted for an additional 22 hours. (C): Shown are RT-PCR products of GAPDH gene as a positive control for RT-PCR integrity.</p>
