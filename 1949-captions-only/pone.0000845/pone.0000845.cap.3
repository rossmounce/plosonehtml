Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were either placed into an aneoropack rectangular jar , or left under normal oxygen concentration. Incubation lasted for 24 hours before RNA extraction. Shown are RT-PCR analyses for H19 RNA (28 PCR cycles). (A): Hep3B transfected with Luc siRNA (lanes 1, 2) and H19 siRNA (lanes 3, 4) both in normal (lanes 1, 3) and hypoxic (lanes 2, 4) culture conditions, respectively. PCR analysis of a house-keeping gene Histone H3.3 (B), and uPAR (C). In (D) QPCR analysis for H19 RNA levels normalized to β-actin in Hep3B cells is depicted.. A Quantitative SYBR Green RT–PCR was performed on human total RNA for both H19 and β-actin to estimate H19 RNA copy number under different manipulations and efficiency of knockdown under hypoxic conditions.</p>
