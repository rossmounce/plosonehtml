                Figure 4.  Transient H19 RNA knockdown in Hep3B cells inhibited tumorigenicity in vivo.Hep3B cells were transiently transfected with H19 siRNA3 or Luc siRNA. Forty eight hours post transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized and counted. Equal numbers of cells (1.5×106) were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal part of CD-1 nude mice (n = 7 for both, and 4 for mock transfected). Palpable tumors were observed 15 days post inoculation in mice inoculated with Hep3B, transiently transfected with Luc siRNA. Tumor volumes were followed up and measured using a caliper until day 30 post inoculation, after which mice were sacrificed. Significant (p&lt;0.03) reductions of about 82% of both mean tumor weights (A) (± standard error) and mean tumor volumes (p&lt;0.03) (B) (± standard error) were observed. Values represent end-points just before and after sacrificing animals. Shown are also representative features of tumors in 2 mice of each group (mice 1 and 2 are the H19 siRNA3 treated Hep3B cells, and mice 3 and 4 are the Luc siRNA ) before tumor surgical exposure (C), and after exposure of their internal tumors (D).
