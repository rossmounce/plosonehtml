Two weeks later, palpable tumors appeared and tumor volumes were measured for an additional two weeks . Shown are end point measurements of the mean tumor volumes of the two groups (upper left pannel), their mean tumor volumes kinetics (upper right), and a representative gross morphology of tumors derived from the TA11<sup>H19-ve</sup> (lower left) and TA31<sup>H19high</sup> cells(down and right).</p>
