                Figure 5.  The effect of over-expression of H19 RNA on the tumorigenic potential of bladder carcinoma cells in vivo.Equal amounts (2Ã—106) of TA31H19high and TA11H19-ve cells were implanted subcutaneously to CD-1 mice (n = 5, each). Two weeks later, palpable tumors appeared and tumor volumes were measured for an additional two weeks . Shown are end point measurements of the mean tumor volumes of the two groups (upper left pannel), their mean tumor volumes kinetics (upper right), and a representative gross morphology of tumors derived from the TA11H19-ve (lower left) and TA31H19high cells(down and right).
