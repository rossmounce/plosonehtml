                Figure 6.  The in vivo effect of H19 silencing on the tumorigenic potential of human bladder carcinoma cells-UMUC3.One million UMUC3 cells were injected subcutaneously to athymic mice (n = 3 for GFP siRNA, and 5 for H19 siRNA ), 48 hours after transiently transfected with siRNAs. Palpable tumors were observed 6 weeks later in 2 out of 3 mice of the GFP siRNA group, while in none of the H19 siRNA group . Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after inoculation. Mean tumor volumes (B, P&lt;0.05), and mean tumor weights (A, p&lt;0.06) are depicted. Values represent end-points just before and after sacrificing animals. Pictures depict the external features of the tumors in mice inoculated with UMUC3 transfected with GFP siRNA (C), and H19 siRNA (D).
