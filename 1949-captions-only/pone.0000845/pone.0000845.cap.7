                Figure 7.  H19 RNA knockdown impedes p57Kip2 mRNA induction in response to hypoxic stress, in Hep3B cell line.Hep3B cells were seeded and transfected either with H19 siRNA or Luc siRNA as described . Shown are RT-PCR analyses for H19 RNA (28 PCR cycles). (A): Hep3B transfected with luc siRNA (lanes 1, 2) and H19 siRNA (lanes 3, 4) both in normal (lanes 1, 3) and hypoxic (lanes 2, 4) culture conditions, respectively. And similar treatments are assessing the mRNA levels of: (B). p19INK4 (C). p57Kip2 (D). Histone.
