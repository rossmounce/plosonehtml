Shown are RT-PCR analyses for H19 RNA (28 PCR cycles). (A): Hep3B transfected with luc siRNA (lanes 1, 2) and H19 siRNA (lanes 3, 4) both in normal (lanes 1, 3) and hypoxic (lanes 2, 4) culture conditions, respectively. And similar treatments are assessing the mRNA levels of: (B). p19<sup>INK4 </sup>(C). p57<sup>Kip2</sup> (D). Histone.</p>
