                Figure 8.  Expression levels of selected genes in Hep3B cells transfected either with H19 and GFP siRNAs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.A few genes that showed variations as a result of H19 knockdown under different manipulations were selected, based on their potential importance in tumorigenesis, for further RT-PCR analysis to confirm the results of the microarray data. In the figure +denotes (+H19) and â€“(-H19). The genes chosen were (A)-FGF18; (B)-IGFBP4; (C)-ANG; (D)-LBR; and (E)-AKT1 . The knockdown, of H19 and the RT-PCR integrity are shown in Figure 7.
