                Figure 2.  Influence of rhizobacteria inoculation on the shoot height of the model plants.Influence of eight rhizobacterial strains on the shoot height of four weed and two crop species after 2 and 4 weeks. The dotted line marks the average height of the plants in the control pots that did not receive rhizobacteria. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of the means (n = 4). * This bacterial strain x plant species combination differs significantly from all others (Î± = 0.001).
