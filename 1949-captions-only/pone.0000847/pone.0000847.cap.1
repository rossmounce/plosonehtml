                Figure 1.  Flowchart of the codon-pair context analysis performed by ANACONDA.A) The software selects valid ORFs from the total set available for each species (ORFeome) and counts all combinations of two consecutive codons (codon-pair context) that are present in the sequences. B) The observed values are incorporated into a contingency table in which the lines correspond to the 5′ codon (ribosome P-site) and the columns to the 3′ codon (ribosome A-site) of each pair. C) The contingency table of observed values is then compared to another table in which the values expected under independence are calculated. The cell corresponding to each pair of codons was colored in green for preferred contexts or red for rejected ones. This produces a color-coded map for the 61×64 two-codon contexts of one ORFeome. D) To aid simultaneous comparison of a large set of ORFeomes the 61×64 map is automatically converted into one single column with 3904 lines, one for each pair of codons. E) Finally, the columns that illustrate the two-codon context bias of each individual ORFeome are placed side by side, yielding a large-scale codon context comparison map. Both maps for codon context bias, i.e. the 61×64 map for a single species and the large-scale codon context comparison map can be rearranged using clustering methodologies that highlight similar codon-pair context patterns.
