                Figure 3.  Nucleotide context preferences can be detected in total genome sequences.A large-scale map for codon-pair context was produced using either the ORFeome (panel A) or the total genome (panel B) sequences of 119 species (see Figure 1 and Methods). Such patterns are either universal i.e. present in every species, or visible only in special phylogenetic groups. Surprisingly, most of the ORFeome patterns were also present in total genome sequences, implying that the major forces that drive the evolution of coding sequences are not necessarily connected to mRNA translation. Moreover, when a Differential Map Display (DDM) was built to compare the two former maps (panel C) it became clear that eukaryotes have a more heterogeneous behavior, since they showed greater resemblance between coding and non-coding sequences (darker pattern in the DDM), but they also produced the larger differences found in the DDM (*). These differences correspond either to two-codon context rules imposed by the translational machinery and hence specific of ORFeomes, or to genome biases that are strongly repressed in coding sequences, where they are probably associated to increased decoding error rates. ORFeomes were arranged in the map by domain of life (Eukaryota, Archaea and Eubacteria from left to right) and sorted as shown in Figure S2. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts, while in the DDM major differences (above 15) between residuals of the previous maps are shown in light blue.
