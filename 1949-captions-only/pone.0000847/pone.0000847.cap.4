                Figure 4.  Influence of dinucleotide bias on the codon-pair context preferences.A) In order to highlight the influence of dinucleotide bias on codon-pair contexts, the maps of H. sapiens, M. musculus, S. cerevisiae and E. coli were arranged according to their (N3-N1) context. High degree of context discrimination was achieved by these two positions in higher eukaryotes, especially for the dinucleotide CpG (blue square), however this effect was weak in yeast and E. coli showed an opposite preference pattern (green). Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts. B) In order to further evaluate the role of the dinucleotide N3-N1 bias on codon-pair context biases dinucleotide preferences were determined using total genome sequences. The dinucleotide combinations with highest bias were displayed in green (preferred dinucleotides) or red (rejected ones) and correspond to dinucleotides that appear 1% above or bellow the expected level, respectively. The UpA dinucleotide is strongly repressed throughout all domains of life. Other constraints imposed on ORFeomes by genomes biases include the rejection of CpG dinucleotides in higher eukaryotes and the accumulation of CpA and UpG in higher eukaryotes or UpU and ApA in almost all organisms. The last preference is related to high number of tandem repeats of more than 3 consecutive Us or As (Figure S4). ORFeomes were arranged in both maps by domain of life (Eukaryota, Archaea and Eubacteria from left to right) and sorted as shown in Figure S2.
