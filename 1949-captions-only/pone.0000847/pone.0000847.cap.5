For this, the adjusted residuals of such contexts were included in an ORFeome comparison map. It was clear that NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>GN and NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>AN were indeed the most negative codon-pair contexts bearing out-of-frame stops, followed by NUA<sub>3</sub>-G<sub>1</sub>NN. The other groups of contexts tested did not generate codon-pair context rules, although some of them contained the strongly repressed UpA dinucleotide. The hypothesis that rejection of codon-pair contexts containing out-of-frame stop codons, namely NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>N and NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>G<sub>2</sub>N evolved to avoid premature termination was partially contradicted by the existence of similar patterns of NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>NN-type contexts that do not include any out-of-frame stops, namely NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>N and NNU<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>1</sub>U<sub>2</sub>N. ORFeomes were arranged in the map by domain of life (Eukaryota, Archaea and Eubacteria from left to right) and sorted as shown in <a href="#pone.0000847.s002">Figure S2</a>. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts.</p>
