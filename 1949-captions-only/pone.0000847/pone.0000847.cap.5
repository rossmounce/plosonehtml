                Figure 5.  Genome dinucleotide bias has a strong influence on codon-pair context.Since the most generalized negative codon-pair context rule detected corresponds to the general expression NNU3-A1NN, which includes the out-of-frame translation termination contexts NNU3-A1A2N and NNU3-A1G2N, other out-of-frame context terminators were analyzed separately. For this, the adjusted residuals of such contexts were included in an ORFeome comparison map. It was clear that NNU3-A1GN and NNU3-A1AN were indeed the most negative codon-pair contexts bearing out-of-frame stops, followed by NUA3-G1NN. The other groups of contexts tested did not generate codon-pair context rules, although some of them contained the strongly repressed UpA dinucleotide. The hypothesis that rejection of codon-pair contexts containing out-of-frame stop codons, namely NNU3-A1A2N and NNU3-A1G2N evolved to avoid premature termination was partially contradicted by the existence of similar patterns of NNU3-A1NN-type contexts that do not include any out-of-frame stops, namely NNU3-A1C2N and NNU3-A1U2N. ORFeomes were arranged in the map by domain of life (Eukaryota, Archaea and Eubacteria from left to right) and sorted as shown in Figure S2. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts.
