All other cases were colored in black (see <a href="#pone.0000847.s016">Figure S5</a> for different display thresholds). Codon-pair context patterns specific of ORFeomes are highlighted on the side of panel A. B) To visualize the patterns that appear in genomes and are absent in ORfeomes, large-scale comparative maps obtained with total genomes and ORFeomes were subtracted and only the cells that yielded differences above 15 were displayed. This highlighted patterns that are strongly preferred or repressed in coding sequences and may correspond to mistranslation hot spots.</p>
