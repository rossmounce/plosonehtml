Injection of anterograde tracers in prefrontal cortices (brown injection, center-bottom) was employed to determine the quantitative distribution of terminals in the ventral anterior nucleus using brightfield microscopy (LM-BF; right-bottom photomicrograph). Material from the latter cases was used to conduct a detailed analysis of the ultrastructural features of cortical terminals (yellow shading) in the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus and to identify the neurochemical characteristics of their postsynaptic targets (blue shading) in the electron microscope (EM; right-center photomicrograph), and reconstruct synapses in three dimensions (3D; right-top). <em>B,</em><em> Thalamo-cortical pathways:</em> To study the origin and laminar termination of thalamo-cortical pathways in the prefrontal cortex we used two approaches. First, injection of retrograde tracers in all layers (blue injection 1, center-top) labeled neurons in the ventral anterior nucleus that project to all layers of prefrontal cortex. Application of the tracer only to the superficial layers of prefrontal cortex, by placing a tracer soaked sponge (~1mm long) on the surface of the prefrontal cortex (blue injection 2, center-top), labeled projection neurons in the ventral anterior nucleus that project only to the superficial layers. The distribution and density of CB+ (light blue) and PV+ (dark blue) thalamic projection neurons in the ventral anterior nucleus were estimated using fluorescence or confocal laser microscopy (CLM-FL) and three dimensional reconstruction of the nucleus (right, top). In a second approach, injection of anterograde tracers in the ventral anterior nucleus (brown injection, center-bottom) was used to quantitatively map the laminar distribution and measure the size of CB+ (orange) and PV+ (yellow) terminals in the prefrontal cortex, using double labeling immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. The laminar relationship of thalamic axonal terminations in the prefrontal cortex to local inhibitory neurons labeled with CB (green) or PV (red) was studied using fluorescence or confocal laser microscopy (CLM-FL; left photomicrographs).</p>
