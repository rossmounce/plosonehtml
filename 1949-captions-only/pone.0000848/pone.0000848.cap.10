                Figure 10.  Appositions of laminar-specific thalamo-cortical terminals with local inhibitory neurons labeled with CB and PV in the prefrontal cortex.The first three images in each column are incrementally rotated by 30° around their Y axis, and the last row of renderings shows three-dimensional reconstructions of apposed neurons (red or pink) and fibers (green or yellow) in the images directly above. Columns A, B, Some thalamo-cortical terminals in layer II of area 32 (yellow) that are anterogradely labeled with green fluorescent tracer and also express CB (red) were closely apposed to CB+ local inhibitory neurons, likely forming synapses (blue arrowheads). Columns C, D, Some thalamo-cortical terminals in layer IIIb of area 9 (yellow) that are anterogradely labeled with green fluorescent tracer and also express PV (red), were closely apposed to local inhibitory neurons labeled for PV, and also form close appositions and possible synapses (blue arrowheads). Scale bar: 50 µm.
