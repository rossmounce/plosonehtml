                Figure 2.  Bouton population analysis of prefrontal terminations in the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus.A, The dimorphism of sizes of boutons from prefrontal projections to the ventral anterior nucleus. Brightfield photomicrograph showing BDA-labeled prefrontal axons and boutons from area 32 terminating in the ventral anterior nucleus, as large boutons (black arrowheads), or small boutons (black arrows). Scale bar: 50 µm. B, Large and small axonal bouton populations from prefrontal cortices in the ventral anterior nucleus. Normalized density (%) of large and small boutons in the ventral anterior nucleus from prefrontal axons. C, Mean major diameter of boutons from axons originating in prefrontal cortices and terminating in the ventral anterior nucleus. Range of diameters of boutons is also indicated (vertical lines). D, Cluster analysis of the diameter of boutons (± variance) emanating from prefrontal cortices and terminating in the ventral anterior nucleus (VA).
