                Figure 3.  Large and small bouton populations in the ventral anterior nucleus.Separate reconstructions are shown for the principal nucleus (VA) and its magnocellular part (VAmc). A, Reconstructed hemisphere of a rhesus monkey brain, shown from the medial surface, which was rendered transparent to show the position of the ventral anterior nuclei (VA: green; VAmc: yellow) surrounded by the thalamic reticular nucleus (purple). Bâ€“F, Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the topographical distribution of large (blue) and small (red) boutons from prefrontal axons in the ventral anterior nuclei. The VAmc is in the foreground and appears larger in 3D space, but it is actually smaller. For details about the size of each nucleus see text. Numbers below each pair show the prefrontal cortical origin of boutons from areas 9, 10, 13, 32 and D46.
