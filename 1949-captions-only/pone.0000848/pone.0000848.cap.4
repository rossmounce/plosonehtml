The inset in F shows the synapse of that bouton at higher magnification showing docked vesicles (green arrowheads); scale bar: 0.25 µm. G and H show two serial sections of the same large bouton. The TMB labeling of the CB+ dendrite is obvious in G (yellow arrowheads), and the gold labeling of the perisynaptic NR1 receptors is clearly apparent in H (black dots and blue arrows). In many cases labeled receptor molecules were observed presynaptically (e.g., E) or inside axons (e.g., G). Red asterisks (*) indicate postsynaptic densities. Scale bar: 1 µm.</p>
