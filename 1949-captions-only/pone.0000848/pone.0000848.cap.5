Unlabeled boutons (pink) were included for comparison. <em>Câ€“G,</em> The position of vesicles (green spheres) and mitochondria (yellow structures inside boutons) are shown in the reconstructions. The large bouton in C is a reconstruction of the bouton in <a href="#pone-0000848-g004">Fig. 4E</a>, and the small bouton in D is a reconstruction of the bouton in <a href="#pone-0000848-g004">Fig. 4C</a>. <em>E,</em> In most cases with large boutons (Lb), there were two separate clusters of vesicles: a smaller pool (solid circle), adjacent to the postsynaptic density (red), and a larger pool distal to the postsynaptic specialization (dotted circle). E, contains the same structures as C, but is rotated 180<sup>o</sup> in the y axis, and the bouton and its mitochondria were removed to facilitate distinction of vesicle clusters. Large boutons (Lb) were at least 2 times bigger than small boutons (Sb). <em>H,</em> The relationship of bouton volume to vesicular content was linear.</p>
