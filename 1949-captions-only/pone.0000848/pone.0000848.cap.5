                Figure 5.  Presynaptic features of large (Lb) and small (Sb) boutons in the ventral anterior nucleus.A-B, 3D reconstruction of labeled prefrontal boutons (blue; same as in Fig. 4B, G) forming synapses (red) with PV+ or CB+ dendrites (grey). Unlabeled boutons (pink) were included for comparison. Câ€“G, The position of vesicles (green spheres) and mitochondria (yellow structures inside boutons) are shown in the reconstructions. The large bouton in C is a reconstruction of the bouton in Fig. 4E, and the small bouton in D is a reconstruction of the bouton in Fig. 4C. E, In most cases with large boutons (Lb), there were two separate clusters of vesicles: a smaller pool (solid circle), adjacent to the postsynaptic density (red), and a larger pool distal to the postsynaptic specialization (dotted circle). E, contains the same structures as C, but is rotated 180o in the y axis, and the bouton and its mitochondria were removed to facilitate distinction of vesicle clusters. Large boutons (Lb) were at least 2 times bigger than small boutons (Sb). H, The relationship of bouton volume to vesicular content was linear.
