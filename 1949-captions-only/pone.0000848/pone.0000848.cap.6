                Figure 6.  Morphological and neurochemical features of prefrontal cortico-thalamic synapses in the ventral anterior nucleus.A, center, Proportion of small (light red) and large (light blue) boutons from prefrontal axons in the ventral anterior nucleus. B, Most large boutons formed synapses with CB+ dendrites of thalamic projection neurons (dark blue) and very few established synapses with PV+ dendrites (grey); C, most of these CB+ dendrites contained NR1 receptors (navy blue), few had other receptors, but not mGluR1a (light grey). B`, Most small boutons formed synapses with PV+ dendrites of thalamic projection neurons (light orange) and few formed synapses with CB+ dendrites (grey); C`, most of these PV+ dendrites contained mGluR1a receptors (red), and fewer had other receptors (light grey).
