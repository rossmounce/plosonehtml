                Figure 7.  Summary of thalamo-cortical terminals from the ventral anterior nucleus within laminar microenvironments in the prefrontal cortex.A, Neurolucida drawing of a strip of prefrontal cortex from area 9, showing the distribution of thalamo-cortical axons (grey), CB+ (yellow dots) or PV+ terminals (blue dots), cortico-thalamic projection neurons (brown), and local inhibitory neurons (red for CB+ and green for PV+). Bâ€“G, Quantitative laminar distribution (%) of: B, thalamo-cortical terminals; C, cortico-thalamic projection neurons; D, CB+ thalamo-cortical terminals; E, PV+ thalamo-cortical terminals; F, CB+ inhibitory neurons in prefrontal cortex; G, PV+ inhibitory neurons in prefrontal cortex.
