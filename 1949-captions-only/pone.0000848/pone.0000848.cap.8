                Figure 8.  The two neurochemical classes of thalamo-cortical projection neurons in the ventral anterior nuclei labeled with CB or PV.Projection neurons were retrogradely labeled with a tracer (FE; green fluorescence), then immunohistochemically labeled in 300 µm sections for CB or PV (red fluorescence), and then microinjected to show the dendritic tree (LY or Alexa Fluor 488) resulting in yellow fluorescence. A, Intracellularly filled CB+ projection neuron. B, Intracellularly filled PV+ projection neuron. C, 3D-reconstruction of the topographical distribution of the population of CB+ (red) and PV+ (green) projection neurons in the ventral anterior nuclei. The neurons are intermingled in both nuclei. Scale bars: A-B, 50 µm; C, 1.5 mm.
