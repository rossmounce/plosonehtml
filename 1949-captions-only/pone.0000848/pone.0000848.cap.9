                Figure 9.  Thalamo-cortical terminations in different layers of the prefrontal cortex.Most thalamo-cortical terminals in the superficial layers are CB+, whereas in the middle-deep layers most are PV+. A–C, Thalamo-cortical terminals (green) in prefrontal cortex from the ventral anterior nucleus and their relationship to CB+ processes and local inhibitory neurons (red). Yellow shows double labeled thalamo-cortical terminals that are CB+. Axonal terminations from the ventral anterior nucleus in the superficial layers of: A, area 32; B, area 9; C, area 46. D–E, Thalamo-cortical terminals (green) in the prefrontal cortex from the ventral anterior nucleus and their relationship to PV+ processes and local PV+ inhibitory neurons (red). Yellow shows double labeled thalamo-cortical terminals that are PV+. Axonal terminations from the ventral anterior nucleus in the middle-deep layers of: D, area 46; E, area 9. F, Widespread axonal terminations of small and large boutons in the superficial layers of area 9. One thalamo-cortical axon is shown in pseudo-color (red). G, Focused axonal terminations in the middle-deep layers of area 9. Labeled cortico-thalamic neurons are seen in layers V and VI. H, Mean major diameter of boutons from axons originating in the ventral anterior nucleus and terminating in different layers of the prefrontal cortex. The range of diameters of boutons (vertical solid lines) and the mean values in the superficial and middle-deep layers (grey boxes) are also indicated. I, Cluster analysis of the diameter of boutons (± variance) emanating from the ventral anterior nucleus and terminating in different prefrontal cortical layers. Populations of small and large boutons can be identified in all layers; however, boutons in the superficial layers are significantly smaller than in the middle-deep layers. Dark and light grey boxes indicate the mean values±standard error in the superficial and middle-deep layers. Scale bars: A–F, 100 µm; G, 200 µm.
