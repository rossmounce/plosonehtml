                Figure 3.  Sequences at the breakpoints of alternative arrangements of 2Rj.The standard arrangement represented by PEST is aligned to the inverted arrangement represented by BKO in the regions (1â€“4) immediately surrounding the breakpoints. Vertical lines indicate sequence identity. In bracketed bold text is the terminal sequence of the intervening inverted repeat (represented by a dashed line in the diagram). Underlined are putative target site duplications in inverse complementary orientation.
