                Figure 5.  Structure of the LCR excision found at the proximal end of 2Rj in a subsample of the Bamako chromosomal form from Mali.Uppercase letters within boxes represent intact chromosomal regions 2 and 4, and the complete 14.6 kb LCR (shaded in gray). Shown below is the corresponding sequence after excision of the LCR. Dashes represent deleted sequence. The excision event also removed the flanking 198 bp of region 2 and 232 bp of region 4, but left 17 bp at the 3â€² end of the LCR.
