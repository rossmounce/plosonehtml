Most vaccine trials contained several immunogens. Eleven serospecificites are reported for pneumonococcal vaccines. The order from top to bottom is serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23 F. The four meningococcal vaccine results are from the only infant trial in this data base and are a single determination of each of the A, C, W173 and Y specificities. Polio values are ranges for neutralizing activity for Polio 1, 2 and 3, respectively, from left to right. References to the individual trials are contained in supplementary file <a href="#pone.0000850.s002">Database S1</a>.</p>
