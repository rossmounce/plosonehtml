                Figure 4.  Effect using immunogens that elicit different levels of immunity in a two component (dashed lines) or three component (dotted lines) vaccines on efficacy and the percent population protected.Model assumes that the diversity of the immune response generated by each component is similar (fold range is 65 fold) and that the immune response to the individual components is not correlated. Vaccines contain a second or third immunogen that generate 1/10 (red), 1/3 (green), 1/2 (blue) or equal geometric mean immune responses (black) to the geometric mean of the first component. Other details are described in the Figure 3 legend.
