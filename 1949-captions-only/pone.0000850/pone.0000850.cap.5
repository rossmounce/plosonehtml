                Figure 5.  Effect of the correlation of immune responses to the immunogens in a two component (dashed lines) or three component (dotted lines) vaccine on efficacy and the percent population protected.Model assumes that the diversity of the immune response generated by each component is similar (fold range is 65 fold) and that the level of the immune response to the individual components is similar. Immune responses have a correlation coefficient (r) of 1 (lower black line), 0.75 (red), 0.5 (yellow), 0.25 (green), 0 (upper black), −0.25 (blue) and −0.5 (purple). Other details are described in the Figure 3 legend.
