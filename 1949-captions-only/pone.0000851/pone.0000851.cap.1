                Figure 1.  Purification of late endosomes from control and U18666A treated-BHK cells.BHK cells were treated or not with U18666A at 3 µg/ml for 18 hours. A: Cells were labeled with filipin (to detect cholesterol) and anti-LBPA antibodies. B: Cells were submitted to subcellular fractionation, as described in experimental procedures, to separate late from early endosomes. 10 µg of protein from each fraction were separated in 12.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted for the presence of the small GTPases rab7 (late endosomal marker) and rab5 (early endosomal marker), calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum marker), caveolin-1 (caveolar marker) and ß-galactosyl transferase (Golgi enzyme). An equivalent proportion (C) or an equal amount of protein (D) of the late endosomal fraction from BHK cells treated or not with U18666A (3 µg/ml for 18 hours) was submitted to lipid extraction and 1D TLC for cholesterol determination. The cholesterol was quantified by densitometry. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). E: The protein content of equivalent volume of the late endosomal fraction from BHK cells treated or not with U18666A was determined. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3).
