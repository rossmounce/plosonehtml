                Figure 4.  Lipid composition of late endosomes from control and U18666A treated cells.A: Late endosomes were purified from control and U18666A treated cells. An equivalent amount of protein (100 Âµg) from each late endosomal fraction was submitted to lipid extraction. The samples were run on two dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates for phospholipids analysis. The phospholipids were quantified by densitometry and each one expressed as percentage of the total amount of phospholipids on the plate. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). I: unidentified lipid, PI: phosphatidyl inositol, PS: phosphatidyl serine, PE: phosphatidyl ethanolamine, PC: phosphatidyl choline, LBPA: Lysobisphosphatidic acid. B: The content in total PC and PE, corresponding to an equivalent amount of protein was compared between control and U18666A treated cells.
