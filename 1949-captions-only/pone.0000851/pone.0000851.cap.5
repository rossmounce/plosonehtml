Six fractions of 400 µl were collected. A: Lipids were extracted and the amount of cholesterol determined by 1D TLC. Cholesterol contents were expressed as a percentage of the total cholesterol on the gradient. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). B: After pooling fractions 1 and 2 from the top of the Optiprep gradient (corresponding to the DRMs), lipids were extracted and analyzed by 2D TLC (shown TLC corresponds to the U18666A condition). I: unidentified lipid, PI: phosphatidyl inositol, PS: phosphatidyl serine, SM: sphingomyelins, PE: phosphatidyl ethanolamine, PC: phosphatidyl choline, LBPA: Lysobisphosphatidic acid. C–D: The amount of each phospholipid in fractions 1+2 (C) and fraction 6 (D) were quantified by densitometry. Each phospholipid is expressed as percentage of the total amount of phospholipids on the TLC plate. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). E: In order to evaluate the distribution of SM, PS, PC, LBPA and I4 through out the Optiprep gradient upon fractionation of late endosomes form U18666A treated cells, the content of these lipids in fractions 1+2 and in fraction 5+6 was determined. For each lipid, the distribution between these two pools was plotted.</p>
