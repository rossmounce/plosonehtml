                Figure 6.  Effect of U18666A on late endosomal proteins.A: Late endosomes were isolated from control and U18666A treated BHK cells. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE either in terms of equal volume (Yield, same fraction of total late endosomes) or equal amount of protein (enrichment) and immunoblotted for the presence of Lamp-1, Rab7, flotillin-1 (Flot-1) or GPI-anchored proteins, which were revealed using an aerolysin overlay. BC: For each of these proteins, the change in abundance upon U18666A treatment vs. control was determined through quantitation by densitometry. Quantifications were performed both for analysis by Yield and by Enrichment. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). * represent statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05). D: DRMs were prepared from late endosomes (BHK cells +/− U18666A) by flotation on an OptiPrep gradient. Six 400 µl fractions were collected and their protein content determined. Each fraction protein content is expressed as percentage of the total amount of proteins along the gradient. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3).
