The cells were then transferred to 37°C for different periods of time in a toxin-free medium. 40 µg protein of the PNS was analyzed by western blotting against PA to detect the heptameric channel form and against MEK1, using an anti N-terminal antibody. B: BHK cells were pretreated or not during 18 hrs with U18666A and then incubated with Dil labeled VSV (0.3 MOI) at 4°C for 10 min. The temperature was then increased to 37°C. The number of cells containing fused viruses was counted 45 min post-infection. C:BHK cells were pretreated or not during 9 hrs with U18666A and then infected with VSV at an MOI of 1. After 3 hrs of VSV infect, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against VSV-G. Typically, ≈70% of the cells were infected under control conditions and the number of infected cells was expressed as a percentage of the untreated control.</p>
