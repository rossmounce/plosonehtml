                Figure 2.  Six induced plant volatile compounds were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis using between-group-linkage method and square Euclidean distances, based on the probability of the induced volatile compound to be emitted by 10 host and non-host plants (left), and the behavioral responses (first choice %) of naive female O. dissitus to these six induced plant volatiles versus blank control (hexane) in Y-tube olfactometer at four dosages (right).DMNT: (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene; TMTT: (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetra​ene.χ2 test for significant differences between numbers of parasitoids in each arm. * P&lt;0.05; ** P&lt;0.01; *** P&lt;0.001. Forty to 45 females have made a choice in each dose. Unsuccessful parasitic wasp response rates in these experiments ranged from 10% to 25%.
