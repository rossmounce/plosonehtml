                Figure 3.  Responses of naive female O. dissitus in Y-olfactometer to different odor sources.3A, responses to blends of compounds of authentic standards or individual compounds versus individual compounds. A three-compound mixture containing 50 ng 10 µL−1 of each Z3Hol: (Z)-3-hexenol, TMTT: (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetra​ene,and 3Oxime: 3-methylbutanal oxime; and a two-compound mixture containing 75 ng 10 µL−1 of TMTT and 3-methylbutanal oxime, while each individual compound is diluted to the concentration of 150 ng per 10 microliters. 3B, responses to the odors of mechanically damaged (MD) host plant (lima beans) and mechanically damaged (MD) non-host plants (Chinese rose and Boston ivy). χ2 test for significant differences between numbers of parasitoids in each arm. * P&lt;0.05; ** P&lt;0.01. Forty to 45 females have made a choice in each experiment.
