                Figure 2.  Decreased bacterial burden in mice with T-cell targeted deletion of HIF-1 α.A: T cell lineage specific HIF-1 α deficient mice have much less bacterial burden in liver and spleen 72 hrs after CLP *:p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, means±SEM, N = 3 per group. B: Growth of gas-forming bacteria and tissue destruction during CLP-induced sepsis in mice with HIF-1 α-expressing T cells, but not in mice with HIF-1 α gene–deleted T cells. Masses of bacteria form rings around gas bubbles in spleens of mice with HIF-1 α expressing T cells. Much less bacteria could be seen in the spleen taken 72 h after CLP from mice with HIF-1 α deficiency in T cells. C: T-cell specific deficiency in HIF-1 α enhances effector functions of bactericidal granulocytes. Left Panel: Much stronger upregulation of activation marker CD11b on tissue granulocytes (CD11b+/Gr-1bright cells) isolated from HIF-1 α-deleted mice compared to HIF-1 α -expressing control mice. *:p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, N = 3. Right Panel: Higher spontaneous production of hydrogen peroxide by tissue granulocytes (CD11b+/Gr-1bright cells) in HIF-1 α-deleted mice than in HIF-1 α-expressing control mice. *:p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, N = 3.
