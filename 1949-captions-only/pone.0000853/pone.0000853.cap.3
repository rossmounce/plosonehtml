                Figure 3.  HIF-1α is a negative regulator of TCR-triggered pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo.A: T lymphocytes deficient in HIF-1α undergo more cell divisions as compared to wild type T cells. Splenic T cells were purified, stained using CFSE, activated for 72 hours and analyzed by flow cytometry as described. A representative dot plot of wild type CD4 T cells (A) and HIF-1α deficient T cells (B) showing both activation by CD25 expression and cell divisions. (C) Comparison of number of divisions by CD4 T cells.*: p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, N = 3 per group. B: T cell specific disruption of HIF-1 α gene substantially increases pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by ex vivo TCR-activated T cells. Spleen T cells were derived from T cell lineage specific HIF-1 α deficient mice. Cells were activated for 24 h under hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Extracellularly secreted cytokines were determined by ELISA. *:p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, N = 5. C: Higher intracellular levels of IFN-γ production by inflamed peritoneum-located hypoxic HIF-1 α deficient CD8+ T cells as compared with similarly located in vivo hypoxic HIF-1 α expressing T cells after CLP. Peritoneal lavage was performed 72 hrs after CLP and 1,5×106 T cells were restimulated and stained with anti-IFN-γ mAb. D: Levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 are significantly higher as compared to mice with selective disruption of HIF-1α gene in T-cells. Peritoneal fluid (TNF-α, left panel) and serum (IL-6, right panel) were withdrawn at the indicated times after CLP and cytokines were determined by ELISA.
