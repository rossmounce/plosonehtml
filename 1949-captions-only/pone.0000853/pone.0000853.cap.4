Unstimulated cells served as controls (WT, κΟ).<span class="underline"> A:</span> <em>T cell specific disruption of HIF-1 α gene substantially increases NF-κB binding activity in ex vivo TCR-activated T cells.</em> Nuclear extracts were prepared from harvested cells and EMSA was conducted. The experiment was repeated and representative data of two experiments are shown. All lanes contain hot binding probe for NF-κB. Specificity of EMSA was tested in the presence of 50 fold excess of either unlabeled probe (Con 1) or CRE specific probe (Con 2), respectively.<span class="underline"> B:</span> <em>T cell specific disruption of HIF-1 α gene increases NF-κB p50 and p65 binding activity in ex vivo TCR-activated T cells.</em> NF-κB-ELISA was conducted with nuclear extracts. *:p&lt;0.05 vs. WT, N = 4.<span class="underline"> C:</span> <em>T cell specific disruption of HIF-1 α gene increases NF-κB p50 mRNA expression in ex vivo TCR-activated T cells.</em> RNA was prepared and subsided to quantitative RT-PCR. *:p&lt;0.01 vs. WT.
