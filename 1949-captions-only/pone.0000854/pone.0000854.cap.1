                Figure 1.  Identification of N-terminal residues of SF2/ASF that contribute to the inhibitory function of this domain.(A) Amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extension of RRM1 of SF2/ASF, indicating mutations generated and tested by in vitro splicing and UV crosslinking assays. The first residues of RRM1 are in bold, with the RNP-2 submotif underlined. (B) Recombinant SF2/ASF and mutant proteins used in this study, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining. M: molecular-weight markers. (C) In vitro splicing of IgM M1-M2 pre-mRNA in HeLa S100 extract alone (lane 1), and in S100 complemented with 16 pmol of SF2/ASF, Î”RS, and N-terminus mutant proteins, as indicated (lanes 2-19). The splicing efficiency is indicated below each lane.
