                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic alignment of the N-termini of SF2/ASF orthologs and paralogs.SR protein N-terminal RRM extensions were aligned using ClustalW. Accession numbers are provided for each sequence in the alignment. Sequences in the Î²1 strand and arginine residues in the extensions are indicated by bold lettering.
