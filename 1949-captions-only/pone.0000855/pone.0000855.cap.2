                Figure 2.  Growth rate as a function of the enzyme production rate constant, pEA, over a range of nutrient concentrations.Dark areas mark where the growth rate is maximized for the respective Aext, and the solid and dashed white lines indicate 90% and 99% of the maximum, respectively. Values of  are not physically realizable, but are included to show the insensitivity to pEA at high Aext. Note the nonlinear brightness scale, which accentuates small deviations from the maximum.
