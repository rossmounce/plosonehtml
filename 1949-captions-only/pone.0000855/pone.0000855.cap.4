                Figure 4.  The behavior of a cell with well-tuned transcriptional regulation of the enzyme production.The normalized growth rate (see figure 2) was optimized for those Aext indicated by points, with an equal number of generations spent in each environment. The resulting system responds to Aext as indicated by the thick curve. For comparison, the straight white line shows the best pEA in absence of regulation.
