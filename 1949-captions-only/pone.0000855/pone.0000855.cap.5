The sharp transition of the optimal <em>p</em><sub>E<sub>B</sub></sub> in (B) signals a need for nonlinearity when <em>p</em><sub>E<sub>B</sub></sub> is actively regulated. The thick lines indicate what the simple transcriptional network of <a href="#pone-0000855-g001">figure 1(B)</a> can accomplish, when optimized over a wide range of environments, either emphasizing high (solid) or low (dashed) nutrient levels. Comparison with <a href="#pone-0000855-g004">figure 4</a> shows that it is far more difficult to achieve near-optimal regulation when the second metabolic pathway is added.</p>
