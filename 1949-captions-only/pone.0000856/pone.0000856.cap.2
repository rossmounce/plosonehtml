                Figure 2.  Expression of truncated gp91phox proteins.(A) Schematic representation of the phagocyte NADPH oxydase and truncated forms gp91phox expressed in a bacterial cell-free translation system. Gp91phox full-length (FL) is presented at the top of the diagram: transmembrane domains are shown in black. FAD and NADPH binding-sites are represented in red and pink respectively. Truncated gp91phox were designed with a his-tag located either at the N or at the C terminal part of the protein. (B) Analysis of the expression of the ten gp91phox truncated proteins by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his.
