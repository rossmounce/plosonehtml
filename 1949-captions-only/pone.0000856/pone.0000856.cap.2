Gp91<sup>phox</sup> full-length (FL) is presented at the top of the diagram: transmembrane domains are shown in black. FAD and NADPH binding-sites are represented in red and pink respectively. Truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> were designed with a his-tag located either at the N or at the C terminal part of the protein. (B) Analysis of the expression of the ten gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated proteins by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his.</p>
