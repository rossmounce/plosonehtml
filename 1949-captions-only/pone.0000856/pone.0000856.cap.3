                Figure 3.  Solubility and activity of gp91phox recombinant proteins.(A) Optimization of the solubility of the gp91phox truncated proteins by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his. (B) Diaphorase assay of purified soluble truncated gp91phox proteins using NBT or INT as electron acceptor. Results were expressed as moles of NBT or INT reduced/min/mol gp91phox truncated forms. Results are expressed as the average of at least two experimentsÂ±SD.
