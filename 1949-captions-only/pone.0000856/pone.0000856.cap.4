(B) Diaphorase activity measured with the gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-C protein (10 pmol) in presence of cytosol from normal (N) or p67<sup>phox</sup> deficient (p67<sup>0</sup>) EBV B lymphocytes using INT (open bars) as electron acceptor. Results are expressed as the mean activity of three experimentsÂ±SD. * indicates results significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from the control performed in presence of normal cytosol.</p>
