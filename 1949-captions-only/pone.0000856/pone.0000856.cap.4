                Figure 4.  Specificity of the diaphorase activity measured with gp91phox recombinant proteins.(A) Diaphorase activity measured with cytochrome b558 purified from neutrophils (10 pmol) in presence of cytosol from normal (N) or p67phox deficient (p670) EBV B lymphocytes using NBT (black bars) or INT (open bars) as electron acceptor. (B) Diaphorase activity measured with the gp91phox 221-C protein (10 pmol) in presence of cytosol from normal (N) or p67phox deficient (p670) EBV B lymphocytes using INT (open bars) as electron acceptor. Results are expressed as the mean activity of three experimentsÂ±SD. * indicates results significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from the control performed in presence of normal cytosol.
