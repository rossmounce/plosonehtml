                Figure 5.  gp91phox 221-C proteoliposomes.(A) Expression of membrane protein in presence of lipids analyzed by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his. (B) Diaphorase assay of purified proteoliposomes gp91phox 221-C using NBT or INT as electron acceptor, n≥2. (C) Delivery gp91phox 221-C with proteoliposomes in HCT116 cells after 8 hours of incubation. As a negative control, cells were incubated with the same amount (0.5 µg) of empty liposomes. The proteins were detected by fluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal anti-his antibody. (D) Confocal analysis of the distribution of gp91phox 221-C protein delivered with proteoliposomes in HeLa cells after 8 hours of incubation. As a negative control, cells were incubated with 0.5 µg of empty liposomes or 0.5 µg of soluble gp91phox 221-C. Cells were labelled for the exogenous protein using an anti-gp91phox antibody (Red) and for the endogenous Clathrin (Green). The cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM510 (NLO) laser confocal microscope. The image plane was chosen to be near the equator of the cell body and nucleus. (E) Higher magnification of the white boxed area in (D) with the respective xz projections.
