                Figure 6.  gp91phox 90-N proteoliposomes.(A) Diaphorase assay of purified proteoliposomes gp91phox 90-N using NBT or INT as electron acceptor, nâ‰¥2. Cellular uptake of gp91phox 90-N proteins delivered with proteoliposomes in HeLa cells after 8 or 24 hours of incubation. The proteins were detected by fluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal anti-his antibody (B) or a monoclonal anti-gp91phox antibody (C).
