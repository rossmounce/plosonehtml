                Figure 1.  Mixed strain infections of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi CB and AJ in mice pre-immunised with either strain, or in a non-immune batch mate.(A) shows total parasitaemias during the course of mixed strain infections in immunised and non-immune mice as measured by microscopic examination of thin blood smears stained with Giemsa's stain: non-immune mouse (dotted line with open circles), two CB-immunised mice (dashed lines with filled symbols), two AJ-immunised mice (unbroken lines with filled symbols). Strain specific parasitaemias (AJ in pink; CB in green) are shown (B) in the non-immune mouse, (C) in the two CB-immunised mice and (D) in the two AJ-immunised mice. The strain specific parasitaemias in the mixed strain infections were calculated from the total parasitaemias measured on thin blood smears stained with Giemsa's stain and from the proportions of CB and AJ parasites in the mixtures as determined using strain specific RTQ-PCR (see text). Squares and triangles represent mouse 1 and 2, respectively, in the CB and AJ immunised mice in Fig. 1A, C and D.
