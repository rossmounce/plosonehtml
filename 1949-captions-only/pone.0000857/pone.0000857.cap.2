                Figure 2.  Course of blood stage induced infection of the uncloned CB x AJ cross progeny grown in a non-immune mouse (dotted line with open circles), in a CB-immunised mouse (pink line filled squares) and in an AJ-immunised mouse (blue line with filled symbols).Arrows indicate day of infection when the uncloned cross progeny grown in the immunised mice or the non-immune mouse were sub-inoculated for expansion in non-immune mice (see text).
