                Figure 3.  The Comparative Intensities of 92 AFLP markers of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi strain AJ from the progeny of a genetic cross between P. c. chabaudi strains CB-pyr10 and AJ following selection in mice immunised strain AJ (see text).AJ-specific markers (indicated by black diamonds) were located on a P. c. chabaudi genetic linkage map, generated from a genetic cross between AS and AJ [34]. Numbers after letter ‘C’ and ‘g’ represent P. c. chabaudi chromosome numbers and P. c. chabaudi unassigned linkage groups, respectively, in the genetic linkage map [34]. Of the six AJ markers which were most reduced under AJ-specific immune selection (see Table 2), five (indicated by asterisks) could be located to P. c. chabaudi chromosome 8, forming a selection valley with the P. c. chabaudi msp-1 gene at its lowest point (see text). RTQ-PCR values for the proportions of the AJ-immune selected cross progeny carrying the AJ alleles of the Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (msp-1) are indicated by the red triangle and Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (ama-1) by the green triangle in the AJ-immune selected cross progeny. The red line indicates Comparative Intensity of 50%.
