Numbers after letter ‘C’ and ‘g’ represent <em>P. c. chabaudi</em> chromosome numbers and <em>P. c. chabaudi</em> unassigned linkage groups, respectively, in the genetic linkage map <a href="#pone.0000857-Martinelli2">[34]</a>. Of the six AJ markers which were most reduced under AJ-specific immune selection (see <a href="#pone-0000857-t002">Table 2</a>), five (indicated by asterisks) could be located to <em>P. c. chabaudi</em> chromosome 8, forming a selection valley with the <em>P. c. chabaudi msp</em>-1 gene at its lowest point (see text). RTQ-PCR values for the proportions of the AJ-immune selected cross progeny carrying the AJ alleles of the Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (<em>msp</em>-1) are indicated by the red triangle and Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (<em>ama</em>-1) by the green triangle in the AJ-immune selected cross progeny. The red line indicates Comparative Intensity of 50%.</p>
