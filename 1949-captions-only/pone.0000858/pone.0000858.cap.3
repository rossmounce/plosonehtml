The first and second HhH motifs are denoted as H1'h'H2' and H1hH2, respectively. (B) Cartoon diagram of the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains. The first and second HhH motifs are connected by the connector alpha-helix Hc (yellow). (C) A ribbon diagram of the NTD. The hinge regions (h' and h) are depicted with a ball-and-stick model (green). 2<em>F</em><sub>o</sub>–<em>F</em><sub>c</sub> electron density maps (contoured at 1.0 σ) of several key amino acid residues are in purple. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are shown in red and blue, respectively. (D) Surface charge potential of the NTD. The positively and negatively charged regions are indicated by blue and red, respectively. The two borders of this 92° arched basic patch are 15 Å and 14 Å in length, respectively. (E) Top view of the NTD surface charge potential reveals a central channel that is 18 Å long and 14 Å wide. The channel is too narrow to accommodate a B-type dsDNA substrate.</p>
