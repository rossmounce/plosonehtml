The putative dsDNA binding regions in the NTD are shown in blue. The L1 and L2 ssDNA binding motifs are shown in pink and green, respectively. ATP binding sites are shown in yellow. The polymerization motif (PM) is indicated by an arrow. (B) A local surface charge potential of the L1 motif and the NTD region. Positive and negative charges are indicated by blue and red, respectively. (C) A ribbon diagram of two neighboring protomers (grey) showing the L1 motif (pink) and the NTD (cyan). The side chains of key basic residues K27, K60, R217, R223, and R229 are depicted in ball-and-stick representations.</p>
