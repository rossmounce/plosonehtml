                Figure 6.  ssDNA binding.The 5′-biotinylated (dT)50 oligonucleotide (10 µM in nucleotides) was first injected into BIAcore SA sensor chips. Wild-type or point mutant SsoRadA protein (1, 5, 10 µM) was passed over the chip at 25°C. Curves represent responses with the background subtracted. Binding signal was not detected when solutions that did not contain SsoRadA protein were injected.
