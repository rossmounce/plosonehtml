                Figure 7.  dsDNA binding.Nucleoprotein gel of reactions containing 4.3 µM (in bps) dsDNA without SsoRadA protein (first lane in upper panel) or with 1, 5, or 10 µM of SsoRadA protein. The nucleoprotein complexes were fixed with glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 2.5%, separated from free DNA on a 0.5% agarose gel, and visualized with ethidium bromide.
