An anionic dsDNA associates with the NTD along the border of a 92Â° basic arch via electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding. Lys27 and Lys60 are located at each end of this arched basic patch (<a href="#pone-0000858-g003">Figure 3</a>). As a result, NTD-dsDNA association may lead to DNA bending or distortion or flipping of base pairs. L1-ssDNA and NTD-dsDNA interactions function in unison to mediate homologous search and pairing between a <em>3<sub>1</sub></em> overwound right-handed RadA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and dsDNA.</p>
