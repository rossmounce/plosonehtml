                Figure 8.  A new hypothesis for homology interactions mediated by RadA protein filaments.Interactions between three arginine residues of the L1 motif and sugar-phosphate backbone of ssDNA result in the nucleotide bases of ssDNA facing the NTD (Figure 1). An anionic dsDNA associates with the NTD along the border of a 92Â° basic arch via electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding. Lys27 and Lys60 are located at each end of this arched basic patch (Figure 3). As a result, NTD-dsDNA association may lead to DNA bending or distortion or flipping of base pairs. L1-ssDNA and NTD-dsDNA interactions function in unison to mediate homologous search and pairing between a 31 overwound right-handed RadA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and dsDNA.
