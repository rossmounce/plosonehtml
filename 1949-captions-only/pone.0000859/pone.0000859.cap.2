Scale bar = 100 µm. (B) Low magnification of transverse paraffin sections from kidneys of a naturally scrapie-sick and a healthy sheep demonstrating PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the medullary and cortical regions of the kidney. Dotted lines indicate the locus of the kidney capsule or the edge of the tissue section. The small transparent box indicates the region shown at higher magnification and resolution in figure C. Scale bar = 1 cm. (C) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposits and tubular structure fit together in the cortical part of the kidney in scrapie-sick sheep. Scale bar = 100 µm. (D) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is also found to a high degree in the collecting ducts of the medulla (arrowhead) as well as in the papillae (arrow) of kidneys derived from naturally scrapie infected sheep. Scale bar = 30 µm.</p>
