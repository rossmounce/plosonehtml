                Figure 3.  PrPSc detected by immunohistochemistry in scrapie-affected Sarda sheep.(A) Immunohistochemical analysis of the cortex, medulla and papillae of naturally scrapie-sick sheep and control sheep derived from scrapie-free flocks. Antibodies 2G11 and F99 were used. Scale bar = 30 Âµm. (B) Immunofluorescence using 2G11 identifies tubular deposits in the medullar-cortical junction of the kidney of a scrapie-sick sheep. Scrapie-free control is devoid of detectable positive signal.
