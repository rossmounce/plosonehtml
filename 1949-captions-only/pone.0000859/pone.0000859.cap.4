Undigested brain is loaded to control for PK digest (lane 1). Kidney homogenates from independent scrapie sick animals were loaded (lanes 7â€“10). (B) Relative quantification of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal intensity found in kidney homogenates in relation to brain derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Our results indicate that the highest amounts of renal PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detected were appr. up to 20% of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal detected in brain.</p>
