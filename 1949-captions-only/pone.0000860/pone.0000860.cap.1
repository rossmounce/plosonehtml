PGCs (TG-1 positive cells) can be easily distinguished from neighbouring cells by their stronger Eed nuclear staining. Both primary antibodies are mouse monoclonals but after sequential detection the signals can be distinguished because TG1 signal is restricted to the cell membrane/cytoplasm and Eed protein is present only in the nucleus. (B) Indirect IF on the hind gut of 9.5 dpc XX embryos and whole genital ridges of 10.5 dpc and 11.5 dpc XX embryos detecting Oct4 (in green) and H3K27me3 (in red). At 9.5 dpc PGCs and neighbouring somatic cells present similar nuclear levels of H3K27me3. At 10.5 dpc and 11.5 dpc, PGCs show much higher levels of this modification than neighbouring somatic cells. The bottom panels show an example where DNA was counterstained with DAPI (blue) to reveal the nuclei of all cells in the section. Images correspond to a single confocal section at 630Ã— original magnification.</p>
