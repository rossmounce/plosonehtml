Most PGCs showed diffuse nuclear staining for Su(z)12 and no detectable accumulation corresponding to Xi. b) 9.5 dpc and c) 11.5 dpc XX PGCs stained for Oct4 in green and H3K27me3 in red. At 9.5 dpc approximately 50% of Oct4 positive cells showed H3K27me3 Xi foci (arrow) while at 11.5 dpc most Oct4 positive cells showed only diffuse nuclear staining for H3K27me3 and no detectable accumulation on the Xi. (B) Scoring results for a) Su(z)12, and b) H3K27me3. Plots represent the percentage of Oct4 positive (PGCs) and Oct4 negative (control) cells showing a Su(z)12, or a H3K27me3 Xi signal; error bars represent variation between embryos. Su(z)12 data corresponds to the analysis of 8 embryos/slides; a total of 545 Oct4 positive cells and 1649 Oct4 negative cells were scored. H3K27me3 data corresponds to the analysis of 6 and 7 embryos/slides for 9.5 dpc and 11.5 dpc respectively; a total of 274 (at 9.5 dpc) and 1099 (at 11.5 dpc) Oct4 positive cells were scored, over 1400 cells were scored in controls.</p>
