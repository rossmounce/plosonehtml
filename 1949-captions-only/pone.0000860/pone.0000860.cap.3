                Figure 3.  Xist RNA expression in XX PGCs.(A) Example of FACS plot showing GFP-positive and GFP-negative cell populations collected for analysis from dissociated genital ridges of female Oct4-GFP embryos. GFP intensity is shown on the X axis. (B) Example of RNA FISH analysis detecting Xist RNA in the Oct4-GFP negative cells shown in (A). (C) Example of RNA FISH analysis showing Xist RNA domains are absent in the majority of the Oct4-GFP positive PGCs shown in (A). (D) Scoring results showing proportion of cells from XX embryos with Xist RNA domains in Oct4-GFP positive cell (PGCs) compared to unsorted dissociated cell (control) populations. For 9.5 dpc 105 FACS sorted and 405 control cells obtained in two independent experiments were scored. For 11.5 dpc data 140 FACS sorted and 262 control cells were scored.
