                Figure 2.  Automatic cell injection system.Microrobot-A and microrobot-B, which are three-degrees-of-freedom motorized micromanipulators with a travel of 25 mm and a 0.04 Âµm positioning resolution along each axis, control the position of embryos and micropipette, respectively. The system obtains visual feedback through the camera and microscope. The computer-controlled pico-injector provides positive pressure for material deposition.
