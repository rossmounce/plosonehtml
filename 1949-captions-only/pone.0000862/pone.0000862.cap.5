                Figure 5.  Illustration of the automated injection flow.Except for the task of bringing next embryo into the field of view (from E to F), control of both microrobots is based on “looking-then-moving”. Top row: 3-D view. Bottom row: microscopic (image) 2-D view. (A) The vertical height of the micropipette tip is determined with a computer vision approach. This step is required only once at the beginning of one batch. (B) Micropipette at the home position. The white curve outlines the recognized cytoplasm contour. The white dot represents the cytoplasm center. (C) Embryo is brought to the center of the field of view. Micropipette is positioned at the switching point. (D) Micropipette tip penetrates the embryo and deposits materials at a pre-set destination in a specified volume. (E) Micropipette retracts out of the embryo. (F) Micropipette returns to the home position, and the next embryo is brought into the field of view. From (B) to (C), and from (E) to (F), the two microrobots move in parallel to increase injection throughput.
