                Figure 7.  Development of zebrafish embryos injected with fluorescent dyes and ntl-MO.A-C show embryos injected with fluorescent dyes, D-E show embryos injected with ntl-MO. Dye injected embryos are shown immediately following injection (A), 24 hr after injection (B), and 48 hr after injection (C). (D) Ntl-MO injected embryos 24 hr following injection. (E) Comparison of ntl-MO injected embryo (left) with uninjected control embryo (right) 48 hr following injection.
