                Figure 2.  TLR-induced proliferation of murine B-cell subsets.A, FACS sorted follicular B-cells (CD19+ B220+CD23+CD21−) were cultured in vitro with various TLR ligands as indicated for 3 days and proliferation measured as described in Materials and Methods. B-D, FACS sorted marginal zone, B-1, and peyer's patch B-cells (CD19+ B220+CD23−CD21+ for marginal zone B, CD19+B220+CD23− for peritoneal B-1 B and CD19+B220+ for peyer's patch B cells) were cultured in vitro with various TLR ligands as indicated for 3 days and proliferation measured by thymidine incorporation as described in Materials and Methods.
