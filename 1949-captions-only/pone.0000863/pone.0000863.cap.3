                Figure 3.  TLR-induced B-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion of murine B-cell subsets.A, FACS sorted follicular B-cells (CD19+ B220+CD23+CD21−) were cultured in vitro with various TLR ligands as indicated for 5 days and antibody profile of culture supernatants measured by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. B-D, FACS sorted marginal zone, B-1 and peyer's patch B-cells (CD19+ B220+CD23−CD21+ for marginal zone B, CD19+B220+CD23−for peritoneal B-1 B and CD19+B220+ for peyer's patch B cells) were cultured in vitro with various TLR ligands as indicated for 5 days and antibody secretion measured by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods.
