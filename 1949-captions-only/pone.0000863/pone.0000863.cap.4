B220<sup>+</sup> CD23<sup>+</sup> cells were further gated for YFP and IgM expression. Numbers shown in each plot indicate frequency of gated cells within total lymphocytes. FACS profile of Naïve (B220<sup>+</sup> CD23<sup>+</sup> eYFP<sup>−</sup> IgM<sup>+</sup>) B cells pre-sort and post-sort. The purity of post-sort was ~99%. B, FACS sorted naïve B cells as described in panel A and memory B cells (B220<sup>+</sup> CD23<sup>+</sup> IgG<sup>+</sup>) from 10% v/v SRBC immunized mice (day 12) were probed for TLR expression by Real-time PCR, C, FACS sorted naïve B cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of various TLR ligands for 3 days and proliferation measured by thymidine incorporation as described in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. D, FACS sorted naïve B cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of TLR ligands for 5 days, culture supernatants were harvested and ELISA was performed as described in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. Experiments were performed three times with similar results and a representative profile is shown.</p>
