                Figure 4.  TLR induced proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion of naïve follicular B cells.A, Splenocytes taken from naive GCCxRosaYFP mice were stained with anti-B220-allophycocyanin and anti-CD23-phycoerythrin to detect follicular B cells. B220+ CD23+ cells were further gated for YFP and IgM expression. Numbers shown in each plot indicate frequency of gated cells within total lymphocytes. FACS profile of Naïve (B220+ CD23+ eYFP− IgM+) B cells pre-sort and post-sort. The purity of post-sort was ~99%. B, FACS sorted naïve B cells as described in panel A and memory B cells (B220+ CD23+ IgG+) from 10% v/v SRBC immunized mice (day 12) were probed for TLR expression by Real-time PCR, C, FACS sorted naïve B cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of various TLR ligands for 3 days and proliferation measured by thymidine incorporation as described in Materials and Methods. D, FACS sorted naïve B cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of TLR ligands for 5 days, culture supernatants were harvested and ELISA was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Experiments were performed three times with similar results and a representative profile is shown.
