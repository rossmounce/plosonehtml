For TLR expression, blue represents an 1 fold increase relative to β-actin, green represents 2 fold increase, yellow represents 3 fold increase, red represents 4 fold increase and dark brown represents ≥5 fold increase. For proliferation, blue represents an 1 fold increase relative to unstimulated medium controls, green represents 2 fold increase, yellow represents 3 fold increase, red represents 4 fold increase and dark brown represents 5 fold increase. For antibody secretion, blue represents an 1 fold increase relative to unstimulated medium controls, green represents 2 fold increase, yellow represents 3 fold increase, red represents 4 fold increase and dark brown represents 5 fold increase.</p>
