                Figure 1.  Sequence and structure of the AmphiGli transcripts.A: Alignment of the zinc finger region of AmphiGli with the equivalent region of a selection of vertebrate Gli proteins, Drosophila Ci, AmphiZic and mouse Zic1. The 5 zinc finger domains are indicated, and the paired cysteine and histidine residues of each finger are in bold. B: Schematic comparison of conserved domains in AmphiGli with vertebrate and Drosophila Gli proteins. The arrows indicate the approximate position of cleavage of Drosophila Ci. NR; N terminal regulatory domain . ZNF; zinc finger region. CT; C terminal transactivation domain that is absent from AmphiGliS. Numbers indicate protein length in amino acids (aa). C: Inferred differential splicing that yields the two AmphiGli transcripts. D: Sequence alignment of the C terminal transactivation region found in AmphiGli-L with a selection of other Gli proteins. E: Molecular phylogenetic tree of amphioxus, human and Drosophila Gli zinc finger sequences, rooted with the related Zic and Glis sequences. Previously identified gene groups have been boxed [38], and AmphiGli groups robustly within the Gli group. Accession numbers of sequences used are indicated. Numbers next to nodes indicate percentage puzzling support values, and for clarity values lower than 80 have been omitted. Species codes are; Mm, Mus musculus. Hs, Homo sapiens. Xl, Xenopus laevis. Gg, Gallus gallus. Dr, Danio rerio. Ci, Ciona intestinalis. Dm, Drosophila melanogaster.
