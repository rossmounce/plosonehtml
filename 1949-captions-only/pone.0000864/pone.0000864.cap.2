                Figure 2.  Expression of AmphiGli during amphioxus embryonic and early larval development.All embryos and larvae are oriented with anterior to the left, and sections are oriented with dorsal towards the top. A. Gastrula in dorsal aspect, with dorsal AmphiGli. The blastopore (bp) is indicated. B. Early neurula in dorsal view, with AmphiGli expression excluded from the midline. C. Mid neurula stained for AmphiGli expression. D. Embryo at the end of neurulation stained for AmphiGli, with expression visible in dorsal mesoderm, neural plate and left head cavity (hc). E. AmphiGli expression in an embryo in which the neural tube has closed. Expressing cells are visible in the cerebral vesicle (cv), left head cavity and forming gill slits (gs). F, G. Transverse sections through an embryo at the stage and position shown in D. The neural plate (np) and somite (s) are indicated. H, I. Transverse sections through an embryo as shown in E. The neural tube (nt) has now closed, and AmphiGli expression in the neural tube is fading. Expression is maintained but fading in the somites, and in addition is activated in the endoderm of the developing gill slits (gse). J. Anterior of an early larva stained for AmphiGli, with expression located in the cerebral vesicle, pre-oral pit (pp), gill slits and in small patch of cells associated with the external opening of the club-shaped gland (csg). K. 60 hour old larva, in which two gill slits have fully formed, the eye spot (es) is visible and feeding has begun. AmphiGli expression is found in the cerebral vesicle, pre-oral pit, gill slits and club-shaped gland. L–O. Expression of AmphiHh at the gastrula, neurula, post-neurula and larval stages respectively. P–R. Expression of AmphiGli-L at the early neurula stage, late neurula stage and larval stages respectively. The scale bars equal 30 µm (A–C, H, P–R), 15 µm (D), 10 µm (E), 20 µm (F, G, I, J, K), 25 µm (L–O),
