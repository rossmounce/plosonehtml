A. Gastrula in dorsal aspect, with dorsal <em>AmphiGli.</em> The blastopore (bp) is indicated. B. Early neurula in dorsal view, with <em>AmphiGli</em> expression excluded from the midline. C. Mid neurula stained for <em>AmphiGli</em> expression. D. Embryo at the end of neurulation stained for <em>AmphiGli</em>, with expression visible in dorsal mesoderm, neural plate and left head cavity (hc). E. <em>AmphiGli</em> expression in an embryo in which the neural tube has closed. Expressing cells are visible in the cerebral vesicle (cv), left head cavity and forming gill slits (gs). F, G. Transverse sections through an embryo at the stage and position shown in D. The neural plate (np) and somite (s) are indicated. H, I. Transverse sections through an embryo as shown in E. The neural tube (nt) has now closed, and <em>AmphiGli</em> expression in the neural tube is fading. Expression is maintained but fading in the somites, and in addition is activated in the endoderm of the developing gill slits (gse). J. Anterior of an early larva stained for <em>AmphiGli</em>, with expression located in the cerebral vesicle, pre-oral pit (pp), gill slits and in small patch of cells associated with the external opening of the club-shaped gland (csg). K. 60 hour old larva, in which two gill slits have fully formed, the eye spot (es) is visible and feeding has begun. <em>AmphiGli</em> expression is found in the cerebral vesicle, pre-oral pit, gill slits and club-shaped gland. L–O. Expression of <em>AmphiHh</em> at the gastrula, neurula, post-neurula and larval stages respectively. P–R. Expression of <em>AmphiGli-L</em> at the early neurula stage, late neurula stage and larval stages respectively. The scale bars equal 30 µm (A–C, H, P–R), 15 µm (D), 10 µm (E), 20 µm (F, G, I, J, K), 25 µm (L–O),</p>
