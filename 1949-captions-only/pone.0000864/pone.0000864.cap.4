B–M show the results of over-expression of AmphiGli-L. B, E, H, K show GFP, indicating cells that have taken up the construct. C, F, I, L show staining with the antibody indicated on the left, and D, G, J, M show these two images merged. Arrows point to repression of Pax7 (C, D), and activation of Cad7 and MNR2/HB9 (F and I respectively). N–V show the results of over-expression of AmphiGli-S. N, Q, T show GFP, indicating cells that have taken up the construct. O, R, U show staining with the antibody indicated on the left, and P, S, V show these two images merged. Pax7 and MNR2/HB9 expression is unaffected (O, R), while the arrow points to repression of Nkx2.2 (U).</p>
