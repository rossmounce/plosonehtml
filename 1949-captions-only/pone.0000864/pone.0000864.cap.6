The cell specific marker that indicates the cells that have the FLP'ed construct, i.e. are expressing the <em>AmphiGli-S</em> (A–D) or the <em>AmphiGli-L</em> (E–H) constructs is in green (A, D, E and H). The Ci protein is labelled in red (B, D, F and H). Ci is expressed only in the anterior compartment and its expression delimits the anterior compartment. The expression of Engrailed is in blue (C, D, G and H). Engrailed is expressed throughout the posterior compartment, overlapping with Hedgehog expression. Engrailed also becomes expressed in a small group of cells just within the anterior compartment (and thus overlapping with Ci expression). This expression is dependent on hedgehog and is thought to represent the highest level hedgehog signalling target <a href="#pone.0000864-Mullor1">[73]</a>. Expressing <em>AmphiGli-S</em> in small clones of cells leads to a complete down-regulation of Engrailed expression in the anterior compartment domain of expression (arrows, A–D). A similar clone of cells expressing <em>AmphiGli-L</em> shows some but weaker down regulation of Engrailed (arrows, E–H).</p>
