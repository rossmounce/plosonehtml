At the ends of the branches are representatives of each taxon, and adjacent to these are schematic diagrams illustrating the expression of <em>Hh</em> and <em>Gli</em> genes at key developmental stages, with arrows indicating the predicted direction of hedgehog signalling. Labelling on branches of the tree indicates predicted ancestral gene complement (in black) or actual gene complement in living taxa (in red). Single <em>Hh</em> and <em>Gli</em> genes are predicted to have been present in the common ancestor of the Deuterostomes. In the Ambulacraria (represented by the echinoderm <em>Lytechinus variegatus</em> and the hemichordate <em>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</em>), these genes do not appear to have duplicated, though hemichordate <em>Gli</em> has yet to be isolated. The spatial expression of <em>Gli</em> genes is unreported in Ambulacraria, however <em>Hh</em> expression has been reported as localised to the apical tip in <em>S. kowalevskii</em> and to the endoderm in <em>L. variegatus</em>. In the Chordata, midline <em>Hh</em> expression is observed in all three lineages, with corresponding <em>Gli</em> expression in adjacent tissues (though note neural restriction of <em>Hh</em> and <em>Gli</em> in <em>C. intestinalis</em>, indicating the loss of notochord <em>Hh</em> and associated mesodermal <em>Gli</em> expression from this lineage). Adjacent to the <em>B. floridae</em> and <em>M. musculus</em> diagrams are simplified representations of the diversity of activator and repressor forms of Gli present in each lineage.
