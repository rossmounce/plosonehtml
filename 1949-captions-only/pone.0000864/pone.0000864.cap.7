                Figure 7.  The evolution of hedgehog/Gli signalling in the Deuterostomia.The tree shows the phylogenetic relationships of the major deuterostome taxa. At the ends of the branches are representatives of each taxon, and adjacent to these are schematic diagrams illustrating the expression of Hh and Gli genes at key developmental stages, with arrows indicating the predicted direction of hedgehog signalling. Labelling on branches of the tree indicates predicted ancestral gene complement (in black) or actual gene complement in living taxa (in red). Single Hh and Gli genes are predicted to have been present in the common ancestor of the Deuterostomes. In the Ambulacraria (represented by the echinoderm Lytechinus variegatus and the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii), these genes do not appear to have duplicated, though hemichordate Gli has yet to be isolated. The spatial expression of Gli genes is unreported in Ambulacraria, however Hh expression has been reported as localised to the apical tip in S. kowalevskii and to the endoderm in L. variegatus. In the Chordata, midline Hh expression is observed in all three lineages, with corresponding Gli expression in adjacent tissues (though note neural restriction of Hh and Gli in C. intestinalis, indicating the loss of notochord Hh and associated mesodermal Gli expression from this lineage). Adjacent to the B. floridae and M. musculus diagrams are simplified representations of the diversity of activator and repressor forms of Gli present in each lineage. Superscript numbers adjacent to genes indicate the following references from which the data were taken: 1 [74]. 2 [39]. 3 [75]. 4 [6]. 5 [5]. 6 [38].
