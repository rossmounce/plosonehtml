                Figure 3.  Disruption of respiratory-ventilator entrainment by unilateral stimulation at the dorsolateral pons (pontine stim.) in (a) a paralyzed, and (b) an unparalyzed animal both with intact vagi.Conventions as in Fig. 1. The response in the unparalyzed animal was more variable but the overall effects were similar to those of the paralyzed animal. (c) Absence of respiratory-ventilator entrainment before, during or after pontine stimulation in the same animal shown in (a) after vagotomy.
