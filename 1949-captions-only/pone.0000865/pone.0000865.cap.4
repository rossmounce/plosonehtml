In the absence of PEEP (top panel), phasic volume-related inputs entrain the respiratory rhythm generator (I-E) via the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) which also modulates the pneumotaxic center in dorsolateral pons (dl-pons). Immediately upon the application of PEEP (middle panel), tonic activities in the NTS and dl-pons elicit the Hering-Breuer reflex prolongation of expiration and shortening of inspiration, momentarily impairing entrainment. Finally, habituation of the NTS and desensitization of the pneumotaxic center (bottom panel) eventually buffer the effect of PEEP, restoring the respiratory rhythm. Sustained stimulation of dl-pons produces similar Hering-Breuer reflex and desensitization effects as PEEP.</p>
