                Figure 1.  A trend toward increased size of insect hind legs is characterized by variation in both the identity and magnitude of enlarged segments.(A) First instar nymph of grasshopper Schistocerca americana. (B) Dissected nymphal T2 and T3 legs, showing enlarged femoral (fe) and tibial (ti) segments in the latter. (C) An abbreviated insect phylogeny illustrating a trend toward differential enlargement of hind leg segments. Plus and minus refer to the presence or the absence of increase in the T3 segment size (compared to forelegs), respectively. Two pluses indicate a great enlargement, while a +/âˆ’ denotes a presence of size increase in some but not all of the members of the group. Note that the depicted leg size differential refers to that observed in first instar nymphs (for hemimetabolous groups) and first instar larvae (for holometabolous groups), and not to adult morphologies.
