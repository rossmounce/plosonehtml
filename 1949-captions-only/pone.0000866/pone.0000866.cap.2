                Figure 2.  Expression of Ubx in Oncopeltus.(A–C) Combined UbdA (Ubx+abd-A) expression (green) visualized by FP6.87 antibody. (D) Dissected T2 and T3 nymphal legs. (E–F) Ubx mRNA accumulation pattern at 25% and 50% development, respectively. Whereas early expression is localized solely in the A1 segment (E), the later stages also exhibit signal in T3 legs and posterior abdomen (F).
