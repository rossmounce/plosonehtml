                Figure 3.  Phenotypic effects of Ubx-RNAi in Oncopeltus.(A) Distribution and proportion of embryos with Ubx depleted phenotypes per clutch, starting with the first clutch after injection. (B) There is a complete absence of embryonic Ubx expression in the depleted embryos from the fourth clutch on. (C–D) Morphology of first instar nymphs in wild type and Ubx-depleted individuals. (E) The magnified image corresponding to panel D, showing the presence of an ectopic appendage on the A1 segment. (F–G) Dissected T2 and T3 legs of wild type and Ubx-RNAi first nymphs, respectively. The star indicates the tibial segment. In Ubx-RNAi nymphs, there is a visible size decrease in the hind legs, making these appendages very similar to T2 legs. (H) The differences in the total leg lengths in wild type and Ubx-RNAi hatchlings. (I) The differences in the size of individual T2 and T3 leg segments between wild type and Ubx-RNAi nymphs. In the latter, the overall length decrease in the hind legs is primarily caused by the shortening of the tibia, and to a much lesser degree the femur and tarsus. In both panels (H and I), the differences in leg length between wild type and RNAi first instar nymphs are statistically significant.
