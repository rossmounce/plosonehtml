(B) Embryonic <em>Ubx</em> mRNA expression is localized in the T3 leg and A1 segment. (C–F) Compared to wild type, there is a complete absence of <em>UbdA</em> signal in both early (C–D) and late (E–F) <em>Ubx</em>-depleted embryos, indicating a complete silencing of expression throughout embryogenesis. (G) Wild type and <em>Ubx</em>-RNAi embryos at 85% development, displaying clearly reduced hind legs as well as ectopic appendages on A1. To better visualize their size, the T3 legs and A1 appendage were artificially colored. (H–I) Dissected T2 and T3 legs in wild type (H), and <em>Ubx</em> embryos (I). Insets show that the paired spurs at the tibia-tarsus joint remain present in the depleted embryos. (J–K) The differences in the total leg lengths and in the lengths of individual segments between wild type and <em>Ubx</em>-RNAi hatchlings, respectively. (J) The T3 leg exhibits the most significant overall overall shortening. (K) This decrease in the total length is primarily caused by the shortening of the femur and tibia, and to lesser degree of the tarsus.</p>
