                Figure 5.  The embryonic roles of Ubx in the evolution of insect body plan.(A) During early insect evolution, Ubx gained two new functions: one in the abdomen (limb repression) and another in hind legs (differential growth). The striped rectangles depict lineage-specific modulations of Ubx expression in different T3 leg segments. This, in turn, provided positional information as to which regions of the hind legs will be enlarged. (B) A model of how Ubx may regulate the differential enlargement of hind legs. The degree of enlargement is directly proportional to the expansion of Ubx expressionâ€“the larger the expression, the bigger the affected segment(s).
