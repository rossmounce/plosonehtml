The striped rectangles depict lineage-specific modulations of <em>Ubx</em> expression in different T3 leg segments. This, in turn, provided positional information as to which regions of the hind legs will be enlarged. (B) A model of how <em>Ubx</em> may regulate the differential enlargement of hind legs. The degree of enlargement is directly proportional to the expansion of <em>Ubx</em> expressionâ€“the larger the expression, the bigger the affected segment(s).</p>
