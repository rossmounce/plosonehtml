Data are expressed in a logarithmic scale. Scalp recordings have been obtained by means of a bipolar (Cz-Fz) montage. Intracranial (cortex and hippocampus) stereo-EEG recordings have been obtained by a bipolar montage between two contiguous contacts of a platinum-iridium microwire. Very low frequency range (VLF, 0.5–1.0 Hz); delta frequency range (1.1–5.0 Hz); theta frequency range (5.1–8.0 Hz); alpha frequency range (8.1–12.0 Hz); sigma frequency range (12.1–15.0 Hz); beta frequency range (15.1–30.0 Hz).</p>
