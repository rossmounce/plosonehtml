                Figure 3.  Examples of EEG patterns recorded from intracranial (cortex and hippocampus) and scalp electrodes during slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM).Electrooculogram (EOG) and chin electromiogram (EMG) are also reported. See text for other methodological details about recordings. A clear slow rhythm is present in the hippocampal recording also during REM sleep.
