                Figure 5.  NREM/REM EEG power ratio in the entire (Hz by Hz) 0.5â€“30 Hz frequency range of the whole night, separately for scalp and hippocampal recordings.The horizontal line indicate the mean REM sleep EEG power (value = 1). Mean values close to this line indicate that NREM and REM sleep power are equivalent in that frequency bin.
