                Figure 1.  The allelic richness observed in introduced L. leucozonium populations, at both microsatellite loci and the sex-determination locus, is best explained by the introduction of a single founder.(A) The allelic richness observed in NA (solid line), and that estimated for founder populations derived from the French population (squares) or a source population with 50% less allelic richness (triangles). (B) The observed number of sex-determination alleles in NA (solid line) and those estimated for founder populations derived from a source population with 20 (squares) or 9 (triangles) sex-determining allelesâ€“the range expected in natural hymenopteran populations. Dashed lines and error bars indicate standard deviation.
