                Figure 1.  Expression pattern of p110α and p110δ as assessed by X-gal staining of lacZ (β-Gal) reporter mice.(A) p110δ gene locus of p110δ lz mice. (B) Broad expression of p110α/LacZ in p110α lz mice at E10.5. Scale bar, 500 µm (C) Side view of an E13.5 p110δ lz embryo reveals high X-gal staining in the developing central and peripheral nervous system, and the liver (LV). Scale bar, 1 mm. (D) p110δ/LacZ expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in the central retina at E12.5. Scale bar, 100 µm (E) p110δ/LacZ expression in the facial motor nuclei (FMN) within the hindbrain as they migrate from rhombomere (r) 4 to their final position in r6 at E12.5. Scale bar, 150 µm. (F) p110δ/LacZ expression in axonal processes and cell bodies within the vomeronasal epithelium (shown here at E15.5). Scale bar, 100 µm. (G) p110δ/LacZ expression in the DRG, motor neuron pool (MN) and interneurons (IN) in cross-sections through the spinal cord at E13.5. Scale bar, 100 µm.
