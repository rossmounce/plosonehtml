Both drugs were used at 10 µM for 10 min (<em>n</em>≥6 independent experiments). *p&lt;0.01. (B) E13.5 DRG explants were cultured for 24 h on 20 µg/ml laminin and treated with Sema3A (0.3 µg/ml) for 30 min. Increased growth cone collapse in response to Sema3A (0.3 µg/ml) in p110δ KI DRGs (right). Each data point represents the %±SEM (<em>n</em>≥3 independent experiments). In each experiment at least 80 growth cones were counted. *p&lt;0.02. (C) Example of DRG explants in each group, which have been stained for βIII-tubulin (<em>red</em>) and phalloidin (<em>green</em>). Scale bar, 20 µm.</p>
