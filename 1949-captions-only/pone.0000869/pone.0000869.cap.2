                Figure 2.  Increased sensitivity of p110δ KI DRG growth cones to collapse in response to PI3K inhibition or Sema3A treatment.(A) Growth cone collapse in DRG explants induced by LY294002 (a pan-PI3K inhibitor) or IC87114 (a p110δ-selective inhibitor). Both drugs were used at 10 µM for 10 min (n≥6 independent experiments). *p&lt;0.01. (B) E13.5 DRG explants were cultured for 24 h on 20 µg/ml laminin and treated with Sema3A (0.3 µg/ml) for 30 min. Increased growth cone collapse in response to Sema3A (0.3 µg/ml) in p110δ KI DRGs (right). Each data point represents the %±SEM (n≥3 independent experiments). In each experiment at least 80 growth cones were counted. *p&lt;0.02. (C) Example of DRG explants in each group, which have been stained for βIII-tubulin (red) and phalloidin (green). Scale bar, 20 µm.
