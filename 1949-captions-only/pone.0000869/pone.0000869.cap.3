                Figure 3.  Reduced outgrowth of p110δ KI DRG neuron under limiting substrate conditions.Left panel, example of E13.5 DRG neurons derived from WT and p110δ KI mice, cultured on 10 µg/ml laminin for 24 h. Right panel, relative axonal length in p110δ KI and WT DRG neurons at 1, 5, 10 and 20 µg/ml laminin (right). Length was expressed relative to that of WT DRG neurons cultured in the presence of 10 µg/ml laminin. Each point represents the mean of at least 3 experiments±SEM, each experiment was carried out in duplicate. n = 60 neurons in each treatment. *p&lt;0.01.
