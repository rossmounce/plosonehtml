(B) Inactivation of p110δ in p110δ KI mice leads to an increase in lipid phosphatase activity in PTEN immunoprecipitates from homogenates of brain <em>(left panel)</em> or DRGs <em>(right panel)</em> from WT and p110δ KI mice. Graphs show the lipid phosphatase activity in 3 independent experiments, measured in triplicates. p&lt;0.001. (C) Inactivation of p110δ does not affect Rac, but increases RhoA activity. <em>Left panel,</em> brain lysate from WT and p110δ KI mice was subjected to pull-down with GST-PBD or GST-RBD, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies to Rac1 or RhoA. <em>Right panel,</em> graphs represent the mean±SEM of Rac1-GTP (left) or RhoA-GTP loading of 2 experiments, each performed in triplicate. (D) Inhibition of ROCK rescues the effects of p110δ inactivation on axonal elongation at 10 µg/ml laminin. <em>Left panels,</em> example of an E13.5 DRG explant (e) of p110δ KI mice cultured for 24 h in the absence (control) or presence of Y27632 (10 µM). Scale bar, 20 µm. <em>Right panels,</em> length of axons extending from WT and p110δ KI DRG explants, in the absence (−) or presence (+) of Y27632 (10 µM). Each data point represents the mean±SEM of 3 independent experiments.</p>
