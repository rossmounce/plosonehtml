                Figure 2.  Estimated potential crown shapes for 10 common species and 10 rare species with contrasting estimated crown shapes.Each species is shown at the average height, and average dbh, of that species observed in the data. The full potential crown shape is shown as the grey dashed lines; the solid lines give the realized crown shape drawn at the average observed crown ratio of the species in the data, so the solid lines give a picture of the realized crown shape of a typical individual of the species. Species are given in order of the MLE estimate for the trait score Tj (95% confidence interval for Tj given in parentheses), which is one of the two species-specific parameters estimated, the other being the depth bias Vbias,j (see Appendix S3). Taxus distichum (var. nutans) is not native to the US, but was found in the inventory data.
