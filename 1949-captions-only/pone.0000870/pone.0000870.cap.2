The full potential crown shape is shown as the grey dashed lines; the solid lines give the realized crown shape drawn at the average observed crown ratio of the species in the data, so the solid lines give a picture of the realized crown shape of a typical individual of the species. Species are given in order of the MLE estimate for the trait score <em>T<sub>j</sub></em> (95% confidence interval for <em>T<sub>j</sub></em> given in parentheses), which is one of the two species-specific parameters estimated, the other being the depth bias <em>V<sub>bias,j</sub></em> (see <a href="#pone.0000870.s003">Appendix S3</a>). <em>Taxus distichum</em> (var. <em>nutans</em>) is not native to the US, but was found in the inventory data.</p>
