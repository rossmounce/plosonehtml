Predictions are from implementing the ITD model for each FHM forest inventory plot. The parameter estimation allowed two free parameters for each species <em>j</em>. Observations for species <em>j</em> were generated by averaging all available canopy status data for <em>j</em>, and all available crown radius and crown depth measurements for canopy trees of species <em>j</em>. Slope refers to slope from a least-squares linear regression of either observed canopy radius vs dbh, or predicted canopy radius vs dbh.</p>
