Values are only given where there were at least 30 trees in the dbh class for the species. The parameter estimation allowed only two free parameters for each species. Values in parentheses are the successional age of the species, calculated after <a href="#pone.0000870-Caspersen1">[50]</a>: high values indicate a late successional species. The successional age of <em>Picea engelmanni</em> should not be compared with the other species in the figure because it is the only western species: its successional age is greater than the average for western species, indicating that is late successional.</p>
