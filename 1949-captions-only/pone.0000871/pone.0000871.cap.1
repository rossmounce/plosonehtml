As subjects fixate the display board, dots that are on each side of the stimulus will be sent to opposite hemispheres. This is true even when both eyes are used to view the stimulus, as illustrated in any basic textbook on visual function. Thus for dot pairs that are horizontally aligned, one member will be sent to the ipsilateral side of the brain and the other to the contralateral side. This might be expected to impair performance in a minimal transient discrete cue task wherein pairs must have millisecond-level contiguity to provide for effective shape recognition.</p>
