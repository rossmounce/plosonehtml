In the first and third panels a full display set is shown, these being all the dots that were paired and successively displayed to a given participant. To form the pair a dot was chosen at random, and then was yoked with another, requiring that the axis of alignment across the two must be approximately vertical or horizontal. This process was repeated until all possible pairs were chosen. The second and fourth panels show the pairs being successively displayed.</p>
