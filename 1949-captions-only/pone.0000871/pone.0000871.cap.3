Each dot pair was shown in 0.2 ms, and the interval between successive pairs was varied from 0â€“6 ms. Model values reflecting mean recognition level for each of the eight treatment combinations have been plotted. There was no indication of a difference in recognition as a function of vertical or horizontal dot alignment, but there was a significant linear decline as a function of the temporal interval between dot pairs.</p>
