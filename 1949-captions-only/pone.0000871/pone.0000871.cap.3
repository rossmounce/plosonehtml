                Figure 3.  Lack of horizontal/vertical differential indicates retina cue-binding.Experiment 1 examined dot-pair alignment and temporal separation of pairs as factors for successful recognition of the shapes. Each dot pair was shown in 0.2 ms, and the interval between successive pairs was varied from 0â€“6 ms. Model values reflecting mean recognition level for each of the eight treatment combinations have been plotted. There was no indication of a difference in recognition as a function of vertical or horizontal dot alignment, but there was a significant linear decline as a function of the temporal interval between dot pairs.
