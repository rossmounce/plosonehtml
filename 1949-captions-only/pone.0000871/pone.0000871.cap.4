                Figure 4.  Manipulation of between-pair timing provides similar evidence.Experiment 2 used horizontally aligned dots, kept the interval between successive pairs at a constant 3 ms, and varied the interval between members of each pair from 0â€“1.5 ms. There was a significant linear decline in recognition as the interval between pair members was increased.
