                Figure 5.  Decline of recognition for T3 intervals as a function of Dot#.For Experiment 3, model predictions at the eight T3 intervals are plotted across the four display set sizes that were chosen for analysis. Recognition declined in a systematic manner as the number of dots in the display set was increased, with very consistent alignment of plot points except for the largest display set shown at the longest T3 interval.
