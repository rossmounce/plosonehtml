                Figure 6.  Decline of recognition for Dot# groups as a function of T3 interval.The model predictions for the four chosen display set sizes of Experiment 3 are plotted across the range of T3 intervals. Recognition declined in a systematic manner as a function of the delay between successive dot pairs. Alignment across plot points was most consistent for T3 intervals in the 0â€“2 ms range.
