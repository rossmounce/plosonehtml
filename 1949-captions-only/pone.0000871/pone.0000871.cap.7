A. This illustration approximates the camera Lucida drawing by Dacey <a href="#pone.0000871-Dacey1">[37]</a> of a typical primate polyaxonal amacrine cell. The dendritic branches are shown in blue, and evidence indicates that stimulus influence is restricted to this zone. The axon branches are shown in red. These branches have vericosities along their full length that would provide a spreading ring of synaptic influence upon activation of the cell. The scale bar is 500 microns. B. An array of polyaxonal cells is provided to illustrate linkage of cells through an extensive overlapping axon plexus. The span of the axon field, shown in pink, ranges from roughly 7.5 to 40 degrees of visual angle for central and peripheral retina, respectively. For any given location of the retina, axons from approximately 200â€“300 PA1 cells overlap, providing a plexus with an average spacing of approximately 2 microns <a href="#pone.0000871-Wright1">[45]</a>.</p>
