                Figure 7.  An example of modeling variants with OPM: A primary transcript is spliced to yield two splicing variants, A and B, each containing a different exon combination, as expressed in both the OPD at the top and the OPL text at the bottom.Modeling other types of variants, e.g., protein phosphorylation, protein ubiquitination, RNA editing, can be done in a similar manner.
