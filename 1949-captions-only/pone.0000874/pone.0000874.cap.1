                Figure 1.  Survey of promoters responsive to mtUPR.Reporter constructs for mitochondrial proteins YME1L1, MPPβ (mitochondrial processing peptidase β subunit), Trx2 (mitochondrial thioredoxin), Tim17A, End G (Endonuclease G), NDUFB2 (subunit of complex I), and ClpP, which have CHOP consensus, and Lon, Sam50, Afg3L2, Paraplegin without CHOP consensus, or NOX3 (NADPH oxidases 3) and Typ I (Type I iodothyronine deiodinase), which are non-mitochondrial proteins but have CHOP consensus sequence in the promoter region, were tested. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with vector or vector containing OTCΔ and promoter-luciferase constructs and were used for luciferase assay 32 h after transfection. Data represent the mean±SEM from experiments performed in triplicate.
