                Figure 2.  Nucleotide sequence alignment of the promoter region of mtUPR responsive genes.(A): mtUPR Genes, indicating the position in the promoter relative to the transcription start site, are shown on the left hand side of the figure. Asterisks identify identical sequences and bold letters show the highly conserved elements MURE1, CHOP, and MURE2. (B): Consensus sequence of the MURE1 and MURE2 elements, as well as the sequence for CHOP taken from [12].
