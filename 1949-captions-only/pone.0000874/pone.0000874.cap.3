                Figure 3.  Effect of the mutation on MURE1 and MURE2 elements on mtUPR responsiveness.A. Effect of MURE1 mutations on yme1l1 promoter activity.; B. Effect of MURE2 mutations on yme1l1 promoter activity; C. Effect of MURE2 mutations on mppβ promoter activity. Luciferase activity is compared for each mutation in cells co-transfected with empty vector or vector- OTCΔ and the promoter reporter constructs and is expressed as the activity relative to that obtained for the wild type promoter (RLU-relative luciferase units). The results represent the mean±SEM for 3 independent experiments. The promoter sequence for wild type and mutants is shown.
