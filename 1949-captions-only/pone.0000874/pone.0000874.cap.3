Effect of MURE1 mutations on <em>yme1l1</em> promoter activity.; B. Effect of MURE2 mutations on <em>yme1l1</em> promoter activity; C. Effect of MURE2 mutations on <em>mppβ</em> promoter activity. Luciferase activity is compared for each mutation in cells co-transfected with empty vector or vector- OTCΔ and the promoter reporter constructs and is expressed as the activity relative to that obtained for the wild type promoter (RLU-relative luciferase units). The results represent the mean±SEM for 3 independent experiments. The promoter sequence for wild type and mutants is shown.</p>
