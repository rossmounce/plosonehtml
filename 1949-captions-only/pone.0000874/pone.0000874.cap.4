                Figure 4.  Spacing of MURE1, CHOP and MURE2 motifs.MURE1-CHOP (A), CHOP-MURE2 (B) and MURE1-MURE2 (C). Each figure shows the number of motif pairs with the given separation found in the set of predicted mitochondrial proteins. Separation is defined as the distance from the first base of the first motif to the first base of the second motif.
