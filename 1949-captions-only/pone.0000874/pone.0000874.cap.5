                Figure 5.  Comparison of regulatory circuits for mtUPR and erUPR.MtUPR activates transcription of both chop and c/ebpÎ² genes through an AP-1 site. These 2 transcription factors then bind to a CHOP element in the mtUPR responsive genes, along with transcription factors of unknown identity which bind to the MURE1 and 2 elements. ErUPR also activates transcription of CHOP (but not C/EBP genes) through an ER response element (ERSE). The function of CHOP in erUPR appears to be restricted to the induction of apoptosis through transcriptional activation of BIM.
