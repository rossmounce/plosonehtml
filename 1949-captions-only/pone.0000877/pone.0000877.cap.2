                Figure 2.  Scheme of the NCP positions within the chromatin fiber.Top: the spheres represent 3D positions of the nucleosomes' centers of mass. The joints in between them show the DNA connectivity. The j angle is the azimuthal rotation angle in between consecutive nucleosomes. Bottom: schematic representation of the cylindrical surface containing all nucleosomes' centers of mass. The angle q is the nucleosomes tilt. A scaled all-atom structure of nucleosomal DNA has been included in one of the box representing nucleosomes. The lower case l corresponds to the left-handed helicity of the DNA path connecting nucleosomes. The capital R corresponds to the right-handedness of the helices made by stacked nucleosomes. This fiber is therefore denominated 5Rl in our classification.
