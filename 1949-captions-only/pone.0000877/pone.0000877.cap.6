The bones supporting the linker DNA are shown in blue. We start from a straight conformation and then try to see whether or not it is possible to superimpose the last bp of the DNA linker (in red) with the first DNA bp of the consecutive nucleosome (in green) when relocating the effector on the target.</p>
