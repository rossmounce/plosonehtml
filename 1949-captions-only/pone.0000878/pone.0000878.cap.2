                Figure 2.  Expression profile of pmp and ompA genes throughout the development of C. trachomatis clinical strains.(A) Strain L2 shares the same ompA genotype as L2/434; and strains E/537C-05 (B), E/S-141 (C) and E/CS-500-96 (D) share the same ompA genotype as E/Bour. Values represent the meanÂ±SEM based on three independent experiments for time points of 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h post infection. See methods for details.
