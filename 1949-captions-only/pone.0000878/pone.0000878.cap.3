                Figure 3.  Predicted pmpF promoter sequence for reference and clinical strains.Sequences are for reference strains E/Bour and L2/434, and clinical strains E/537C-05, E/S-141, E/CS-500-96, and L2. The predicted transcription promoter for pmpF is located within a 100% conserved region of the pmpG/pmpF IGR, where putative -10 and -35 elements are in blue characters and boxed. Potential A/T spacer region is underlined, and the predicted transcription start site is shown in a larger font below a red asterisk. The putative RBS for pmpF is in orange characters, and the putative RNase E cleavage sites are highlighted in grey. Numbers represent positions relative to the start codon of pmpF (highlighted in yellow). The start codon of pmpG is highlighted in blue.
