The predicted transcription promoter for <em>pmpF</em> is located within a 100% conserved region of the <em>pmpG/pmpF</em> IGR, where putative -10 and -35 elements are in blue characters and boxed. Potential A/T spacer region is underlined, and the predicted transcription start site is shown in a larger font below a red asterisk. The putative RBS for <em>pmpF</em> is in orange characters, and the putative RNase E cleavage sites are highlighted in grey. Numbers represent positions relative to the start codon of <em>pmpF</em> (highlighted in yellow). The start codon of <em>pmpG</em> is highlighted in blue.</p>
