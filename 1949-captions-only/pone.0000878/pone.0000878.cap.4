                Figure 4.  Distribution/Location of the putative RNase E cleavage sites within the pmpFE operon coding sequence.The sequence is for reference strains E/Bour and L2/434 and for clinical strains E/537C-05, E/S-141, E/CS-500-96 and L2. Black vertical lines represent all RNase E cleavage sites conserved among all strains under study; green vertical lines show the ones only conserved among the four “E” strains; orange vertical lines represent those specific solely for both L2 strains. Numbers represent nucleotide positions relative to the start codon of pmpF.
