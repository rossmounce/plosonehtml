Black vertical lines represent all RNase E cleavage sites conserved among all strains under study; green vertical lines show the ones only conserved among the four “E” strains; orange vertical lines represent those specific solely for both L<sub>2</sub> strains. Numbers represent nucleotide positions relative to the start codon of <em>pmpF.</em></p>
