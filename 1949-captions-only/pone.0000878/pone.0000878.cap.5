Immunoreactivity to each fusion protein for sera from patients infected with strain Ba (n = 3), D (n = 3), E (n = 8), F (n = 5), G (n = 1), Ia (n = 1), J (n = 2) or K (n = 3) are shown. Of note is that immunoreactivity was consistent for sera from patients infected with the same clinical strain except for strain F (<a href="#pone-0000878-t002">Table 2</a>); all eight patients infected with strain E were reactive to rPmpD.</p>
