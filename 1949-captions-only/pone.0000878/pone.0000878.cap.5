                Figure 5.  Dot-Blot of serum immunoreactivity against recombinant (r)PmpD and rPmpF.Sera was obtained from adolescents singly infected and uninfected with a different C. trachomatis clinical strain as described previously [17] (see also methods). rPmpD and rPmpF concentrations were standardized for use on the blots. Immunoreactivity to each fusion protein for sera from patients infected with strain Ba (n = 3), D (n = 3), E (n = 8), F (n = 5), G (n = 1), Ia (n = 1), J (n = 2) or K (n = 3) are shown. Of note is that immunoreactivity was consistent for sera from patients infected with the same clinical strain except for strain F (Table 2); all eight patients infected with strain E were reactive to rPmpD.
