In Membrane Builder, one can place the protein appropriately in a lipid bilayer by aligning its principal axis or a vector between two specific C<sub>α</sub> atoms along the <em>Z</em>-axis, by translating the protein along the <em>Z</em>-axis, and by rotating it around the <em>X</em>-axis. It is assumed that the membrane normal is parallel to the <em>Z</em>-axis and its center is located at <em>Z = </em>0 Å. Alignment with the principal axis is useful for the proteins that have a symmetric shape. The usage of a vector defined by specific two residues is useful for irregular-shaped proteins if one can identify two residues that are parallel to the <em>Z</em>-axis. In the case that the protein structure is not easily aligned with the available options, one should align it in a local machine and then upload it. One can skip the alignment step for the protein structures from OPM database <a href="#pone.0000880-Lomize1">[25]</a> or pre-oriented structures.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec2.p2"></a><p>After alignment, Membrane Builder generates pore water, if specified, and calculates the protein cross-sectional area along the <em>Z</em>-axis. We have developed a new method to generate water molecules inside pores with any kind of shapes and numbers (see Pore Water Generation for details). The cross-sectional area profile is used to determine protein areas that correspond to the maximum values at 10 Å&lt;<em>Z</em>&lt;20 Å and −20 Å&lt;<em>Z</em>&lt;−10 Å, respectively. <a href="#pone-0000880-g002">Figure 2</a> shows the calculated profile for PDB:2HAC (ζ-ζ transmembrane dimer). The protein areas in the top and bottom lipid leaflets are used to determine the system size in the next step. The cross-sectional area of pore water, if generated, is incorporated into the protein area so that the system size in the <em>XY</em> plane is determined as the sum of the protein area and the lipid area (see below).</p>
