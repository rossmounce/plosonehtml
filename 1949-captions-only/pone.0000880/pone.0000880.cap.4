                Figure 4.  Packing image with lipid-like pseudo atoms around PDB:2HAC.An option of 1.5 lipid layer was used to estimate the number of lipid molecules. Both primary (blue region) and image systems (yellow region) in XY plane are visualized to provide a general idea about the lipid packing in the protein/membrane complex.
