The insertion method can build a lipid bilayer quickly, and the generated lipid bilayer is pre-equilibrated. However, the insertion method has a couple of limitations related to the system size and the protein shape. On the other hand, the replacement method can generate a lipid bilayer for virtually any kinds of shape and size of membrane proteins. However, it takes more time to generate a lipid bilayer, e.g., 5 to 50 minutes depending on the system size, and the generated bilayer is not pre-equilibrated. The library of lipid bilayers with holes and the library of lipid molecules for each lipid type are freely available at the archive on the CHARMM-GUI website.</p>


<h4>Pore Water Generation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Ion channels, transporters, and porins have pores that are large enough to accommodate water molecules. A traditional way of generating the so-called pore water is to build a cylindrical water box, place the box inside the pore, and remove water molecules that overlap with the protein. It is easy to implement and works well for some cases. During the tests of Membrane Builder, however, we have encountered many cases that the traditional method cannot be applied directly. For example, a closed form of mechanosensitive channel (PDB:2OAR) has a pore opened only half of the transmembrane region, and the cross-sectional area profile varies markedly. If the pore were filled by the traditional method, large number of water molecules would be left in the protein exterior near the closed region of the protein. Another example is bacterial porins (e.g., PDB:1PHO) with three pores, so that it is not conceivable to fill the pores automatically with the traditional method.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>In order to make the generation process of pore water more general and persuasive, we have developed a new method based on a simple idea that water molecules inside the pore would remain while those outside of the protein would evaporate during a high temperature dynamics. As shown in <a href="#pone-0000880-t001">Table 1</a>, water molecules can access to the pore vestibules in the lipid head group regions, but not into the hydrophobic region due to the restraints for water during equilibration. Therefore, Membrane Builder only solvates the transmembrane region, as shown in <a href="#pone-0000880-g007">Fig. 7A</a>, and runs molecular dynamics at a high temperature (5,000 K) with protein fixed and planar restraint potentials on the top and bottom of the water box to keep pore water molecules in the transmembrane region. Most water molecules that are outside of the protein are quickly removed after a couple of dynamics cycles, as shown in <a href="#pone-0000880-g007">Fig. 7B</a>. However, it is conceivable that a few water molecules may stay near the protein exterior if they interact with protein strongly. To resolve this problem, we have introduced the refinement step of pore water generation in Step 4 to remove those water molecules interactively by selecting residue numbers of water molecules after users' visual inspection. Users can verify this step by visualizing the pore region again after removing selected water molecules.</p>
