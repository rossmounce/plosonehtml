                Figure 1.  A–C: Plots of the degree distributions of nodes in the reaction networks of M. tuberculosis, M. leprae and E. coli.D–F: Log-log plots of the degree distribution function P(k) versus the degree k. P(k) defines the probability of a given node making exactly k connections in the network. The fit to the curve shows a power law behaviour and has an exponent of ~1.4 for all three networks. G–I: Representative degree distributions of nodes in random networks generated with the same total number of nodes and edges as the reaction networks of M. tuberculosis, M. leprae and E. coli.
