The fit to the curve shows a power law behaviour and has an exponent of ~1.4 for all three networks. G–I: Representative degree distributions of nodes in random networks generated with the same total number of nodes and edges as the reaction networks of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, <em>M. leprae</em> and <em>E. coli.</em></p>
