                Figure 3.  2evc plots for the giant components of the reaction networks of M. tuberculosis (A), M. leprae (B) and E. coli (C).Plateaus represent sub-clusters of reactions. The giant component in the reaction network of E. coli does not resolve into sub-clusters as indicated by the single plateau in plot C. Arrows indicate plateaus representing the sub-cluster of mycolic acid pathway reactions in the mycobacterial networks.
