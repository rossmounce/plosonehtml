The RNA was isolated at different time points, as indicated. Data show real time PCR for expression of ENPP1 and other genes involved in adipocyte maturation. Mean and SD from 3 experiments are presented in arbitrary units after correction for 18S expression. One-way ANOVA p-value for multiple group comparison was &lt;0.05 for each of the gene expression data shown in figure. Pre-adipocyte are shown as dark bars, mature adipocyte are shown as open bars</p>
