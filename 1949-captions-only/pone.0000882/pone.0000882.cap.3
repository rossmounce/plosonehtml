                Figure 3.  Human ENPP1 K121K and K121Q over-expression induce changes in the expression of genes present of 3T3-L1 induced to maturation.The expression levels of several adipogenic markers in vector only, in ENPP1 K121K and ENPP1 K121Q stable cell lines 10 days after DMI induction were measured by QPCR and normalized by the level of 18S. Experiments were repeated 3 times. The average values and SD are shown for the vector (open bars) and he transfected cells (dark bars).
