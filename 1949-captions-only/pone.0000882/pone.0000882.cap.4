                Figure 4.  Human ENPP1 K121K and K121Q over-expression induce insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 cells.Panels A and B-Cells were treated with 5 µg/ml of insulin for 15 minutes. Total and phosporylated insulin receptor Akt were determined by Western Blot. Results are shown as bar graph of the ratio between phosphorylated and total insulin receptor. Phosphorylated Akt was determined by western blot. The quantitative values of the bands are shown beside the western blot image for 3 separate experiments. Panel C-3T3-L1 adipocytes were seeded in 6-well plates. Cells were stimulated with 100 nM and glucose uptake measured by incubation with 0.1 mM 2-deoxyglucose containing 1 µCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-glucose, [U-14C] at 4°C for 5 min.
