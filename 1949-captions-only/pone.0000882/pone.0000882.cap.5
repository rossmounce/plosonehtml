                Figure 5.  Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in the absence of ENPP1.Panel A. Oil-red-O stained mouse embrionic fibroblasts (MEF) from ENPP1 knockout mice after induction of adipogenesis using stimulation with DMI. Cellular triglyceride content is presented as fold changes from the triglyceride content of cells containing vector. Results are reported as mean and SD from three experiments (8 wells were analyzed in each experiment). Panel B. The expression levels of several adipogenic markers in differentiated wild-type and ENPP1 knockout MEFs were measured by QPCR and normalized by the level of 18S. Experiments were repeated 3 times.
