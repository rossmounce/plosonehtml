                Figure 1.  GC-D genomic structures in mouse, treeshrew and various primate genomes, according to genome assemblies (human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse) or trace archive sequences (other species).Tall black boxes represent exons where full-length, high-quality sequence is available; tall light-gray boxes represent exons where only partial or low-quality sequence is available. Mouse GC-D exons and introns are drawn to scale and numbered (total genomic length 36.8kb), other species are shown with exons aligned to mouse GC-D – in reality, intron sizes differ from mouse. Regions of the protein encoded by each exon are indicated above mouse GC-D (TM: transmembrane). Horizontal lines depict genomic “scaffolds” (see Text S1 – a scaffold consists of a set of multiple “contigs” of overlapping sequence reads, in which the set of contigs are ordered, linked and oriented using paired end sequences); gaps within scaffolds are shown as narrow, dark-gray boxes; gaps between scaffolds are shown as breaks in the horizontal line. Deleterious mutations found in human GC-D are shown below the exons in which they appear: del44 and del1 indicate 44-bp and 1-bp deletions, respectively. Two nonsense mutations and two frameshifts in exon 19 are not shown, as they truncate the protein by only a few amino acids.
