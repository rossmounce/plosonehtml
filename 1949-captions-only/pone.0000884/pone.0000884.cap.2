At each alignment position, sequences matching the consensus are shown as white letters with black background, and sequences that do not match are black on white. Insertions/deletions are shown as “−“ characters; areas of missing sequence are entirely blank. Each inactivating mutation is labeled below the alignment: e.g. 9A is the 5′-most mutation in exon 9. Note that the 24-bp deletion in drill and macaque does not introduce a frameshift: it is thus unclear whether it would interfere with function. A full alignment is provided in <a href="#pone.0000884.s004">Figure S1</a>. Species abbreviations: mm., marmoset; or., orangutan.</p>
