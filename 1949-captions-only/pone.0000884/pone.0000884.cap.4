We considered only a subset of species; if all species had been used, missing sequence data (exon deletions and/or absence from available data) would have meant that the number of codons available for analysis was too low. Nonsynonymous (<em>K<sub>a</sub></em>) and synonymous (<em>K<sub>s</sub></em>) rates of evolution were estimated for each branch using PAML's codeml (see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>, <a href="#pone.0000884.s006">Text S1</a>). The <em>K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub></em> ratio is given above each branch, and the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, respectively, are given below each branch in parentheses. For each branch of the tree, a statistical test was performed to determine whether the sequences observed are consistent with the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Branches where the null (neutral) hypothesis was rejected with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.05 or less (i.e. branches where GC-D evolved under purifying selection) are drawn with thick lines.</p>
