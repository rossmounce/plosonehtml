                Figure 2.  PrpA of B. abortus (BaSeq1) is an hydroxyproline-2-epimerase.Reactions were performed with 3–10 µg of the enzyme and 40 mM of substrate in specific buffers during 1 h at 37°C. (A) Pro racemization reactions were performed in NaOAc, pH 6. (B) OH-Pro epimerization reactions were set up in parallel in TE, pH 9. Data from Spera et al [13] was transposed to the Figure under shade and TcPRAC was used as control; BaPrpA : purported ‘proline racemase protein A’; BaSeq1 was produced from PrpA-corresponding sequence 1 from B. abortus (Table 1 and Figure S1). Percent of L- or D-Pro racemization (C) and percent of OH-L-Pro or OH-D-Pro epimerization (D) using specific buffers, 10 µg of the enzyme and 20 mM of substrate during 30 min at 37°C.
