                Figure 3.  Pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (PYC), the specific inhibitor of PRAC, is not an inhibitor of HyPRE.(A) Percent of L-Pro racemization or (B) OH-L-Pro epimerization in absence (black bars) or in presence of 1 or 10 mM of PYC (white bars). Reactions were performed at 37°C for 30 min with 10 µg of the corresponding enzymes in NaOAc, pH 6 (PRAC reactions) or TE, pH 8 (HyPRE reactions) and 20 mM of substrate.
