                Figure 5.  Alignments of PRAC and HyPRE protein sequences.MCGH and MIII* PRAC motifs are shaded respectively in yellow and green. Catalytic Cys residues are coloured in red. R1, R2 and R3 indicate critical compulsory differences allowing for the discrimination of PRAC and HyPRE. In the left margin, sequences corresponding to PRAC are underlined contrasting to HyPRE sequences (plain text). Residues involved in substrate specificity are shaded in green (PRAC) or blue (HyPRE). The proposed signature for HyPRE (squared) gather an additional block of specific residues downstream PRAC MIII*. Sequences that do not meet those requirements and thus present unknown functions are in light gray.
