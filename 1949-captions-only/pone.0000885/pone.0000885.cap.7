Cys catalytic residues (orange). (B) Close view of <em>Tc</em>PRAC (left panel) and <em>Pa</em>HyPRE (right panel) pockets. The two catalytic Cys residues of PRAC (C<sub>130</sub> and C<sub>300</sub>) and of HyPRE (C<sub>88</sub> and C<sub>236</sub>) are shown in the reaction center colored in orange sticks. Hydrophobic F<sub>102</sub> (green sticks) and aliphatic V<sub>60</sub> (blue sticks) residues are depicted respectively in PRAC and HyPRE reaction centers where Pro and OH-Pro were modeled. Polarity hindrance imposed by the aromatic PRAC F<sub>102</sub> residue and the solvent accessible area for the ligand made possible by HyPRE V<sub>60</sub> residue are shown. (C) Phylogram of PRAC and HyPRE aligned sequences showing the unrooted tree using <em>H. influenzae</em> DapE as uncontroversial outgroup. Bacterial and protozoa PRAC cluster together suggesting that divergence of PRAC and HyPRE took place before the separation of bacteria and eukaryotes.</p>
