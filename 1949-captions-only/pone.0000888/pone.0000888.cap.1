Intracellular recording <em>in vivo</em> from a neuron in cat primary visual cortex. Time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval (relative labels not shown for clarity). A fast EMA is represented as a green line and a slow EMA in red line. The points of crossing between both of them have been used to calculate the beginning and end of up states, highlighted with a blue box. Same in B. B. Intracellular recording <em>in vitro</em> from a supragranular neuron in a prefrontal cortex slice from the ferret. C. Histogram of the membrane potential values corresponding to the trace in A. It shows two clearly differentiated states separated by a transitional valley (see Gaussian fit in green superimposed to the histograms, with parameters −76.6 and −67.0 for the mean, 0.8 and 5.3 for the standard deviation). D. Histogram of the membrane potential values corresponding to the trace in B (fitting curves with parameters −64.6 and −57.0 for the mean, 0.5 and 7.6 for the standard deviation).</p>
