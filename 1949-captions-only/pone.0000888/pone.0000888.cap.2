                Figure 2.  Offline up and down states separation in drifted recordings.A. In vivo intracellular recording from a neuron in the primary visual cortex from the cat. A drift in the membrane potential is illustrated. B. Intracellular recording in vitro from a neuron in the prefrontal cortex of the ferret. The slow EMA follows the average membrane potential, providing a value of reference that discriminates the up and down levels. See the high frequencies detailed in the inset. Time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval. C and D. Histograms corresponding the A and B traces respectively. Note that in the drifted recordings the bimodality of the Vm values is not as clear as in stable recordings like in Fig. 1.
