A drift in the membrane potential is illustrated. B. Intracellular recording <em>in vitro</em> from a neuron in the prefrontal cortex of the ferret. The slow EMA follows the average membrane potential, providing a value of reference that discriminates the up and down levels. See the high frequencies detailed in the inset. Time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval. C and D. Histograms corresponding the A and B traces respectively. Note that in the drifted recordings the bimodality of the Vm values is not as clear as in stable recordings like in <a href="#pone-0000888-g001">Fig. 1</a>.</p>
