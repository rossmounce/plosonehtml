                Figure 3.  Offline detection of up and down states by MAUDS in special situations. A and B.Correctly identifying up states where no action potentials occur in highly hyperpolarized neurons recorded in vitro in prefrontal cortex from the ferret. Note that in B there is correct detection of down states in spite of the repetitive occurrence of short lasting sharp events. C. Filtering isolated synaptic events occurring in the middle of a down state. D. Sorting suspicious down states intermingled into long-lasting up states (third up state). C and D correspond to intracellular recordings obtained in vivo from cat's primary visual cortex. In all panels time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval.
