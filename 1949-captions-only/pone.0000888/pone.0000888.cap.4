Intracellular recording from primary visual cortex of the cat <em>in vivo</em>. There is a respiratory movement artifact that generates rhythmic drifts of the membrane potential. B. Detail of a portion of the membrane potential shown in A (second 15, 16, 17). Time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval. C and D. The distributions of membrane potentials in panels A and B, respectively.</p>
