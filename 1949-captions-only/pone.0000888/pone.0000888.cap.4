                Figure 4.  Offline identification of up and down states in intracellular recordings with artifacts.A. Intracellular recording from primary visual cortex of the cat in vivo. There is a respiratory movement artifact that generates rhythmic drifts of the membrane potential. B. Detail of a portion of the membrane potential shown in A (second 15, 16, 17). Time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval. C and D. The distributions of membrane potentials in panels A and B, respectively.
