Up states recorded in a fast spiking neuron in the primary visual cortex of the cat. B. Online detection of up and down states in an intracellular recording in cat primary visual cortex during subthreshold and suprathreshold up states in a drifted recording (note that due to the drift the suprathreshold up states seem to be more hyperpolarized than the subthreshold ones). In A and B spikes have been truncated. C. Online detection of up states recorded in the barrel cortex of a rat. In all these cases the animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>). In all panels time marks in the horizontal axes of the traces indicate 1 second interval.</p>
