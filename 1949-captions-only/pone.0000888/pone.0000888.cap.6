                Figure 6.  Online detection of up states and their use as triggers.A. Online detection of up states during in vitro intracellular recordings in primary visual cortical slices from the ferret. Bottom trace: extracellular multiunit recording representing the population firing in the vicinity from the intracellular recorded neuron. B. Online detection of up states in a recording from ferret oscillatory slices, primary visual cortex. In this case the beginning of the up state has been used to trigger a hyperpolarizing pulse (âˆ’0.2 nA) at different times with respect to the occurrence of the up state in order to estimate changes in the input resistance. C. Slow oscillations in the barrel cortex of the ketamine anesthetized rat. Unfiltered local field potential (top) and intracellular suprathreshold recording (bottom). D. Averaged up states (n = 20) using the detection of initiation of up state as a point of reference with online MAUDS analysis, LFP (top) and intracellular recording (bottom). E. Subthreshold oscillations. F. Averaged intracellular responses to a puff of air to the whiskers (n = 20). The sensory response is highlighted with a yellow box. Same in G. G. Averaged up states while giving the whisker stimulation at regular intervals after the initiation of the up state (5 in each case), four intervals are represented.
