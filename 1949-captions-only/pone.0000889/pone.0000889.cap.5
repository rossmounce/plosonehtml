                Figure 5.  The occurrence of impedance-matching hearing within amniotes.A middle ear exhibiting the functional criteria for impedance-matching has thus far been recorded in synapsids, lepidosauromorphs, and archosauromorphs (marked with an asterisk), and was assumed not to have evolved before the Mesozoic; the presence of a tympanic middle ear in the taxa of our study (here informally named “nycteroleters”) represents the only known occurrence of such a structure in Paleozoic amniotes. Whether or not a true tympanic middle ear was also present in a closely related clade, the Procolophonoidea, remains unresolved.
