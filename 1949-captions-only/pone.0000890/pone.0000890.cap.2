                Figure 2.  The effect on recognition accuracy of rotating objects away from the learned orientation was confined to the within-modal conditions, with no effect in the cross-modal conditions.(Error bars = s.e.m.; asterisk = significant difference; horizontal line = chance performance at 25% in the four-alternative forced-choice task used).
