                Figure 3.  Interaction between modality and rotation.Rotation away from the learned orientation only affected within-modal, not cross-modal, recognition accuracy. (Error bars = s.e.m.; asterisk = significant difference; horizontal line = chance performance at 25% in the four-alternative forced-choice task used).
