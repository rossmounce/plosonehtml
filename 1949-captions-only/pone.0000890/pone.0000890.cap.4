                Figure 4.  Interaction between the within-modal conditions and the axis of rotation.Haptic within-modal recognition accuracy was equally disrupted by rotation about each axis whereas visual within-modal recognition was disrupted by the x- and y-rotations more than the z-rotation. The graph shows the percentage decrease in accuracy due to rotating the object away from the learned view. (Error bars = s.e.m.; asterisk = significant difference).
