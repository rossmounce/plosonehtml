However, the tasks involving video stimuli (Vd-Perc, Vd-Conc, Vd-Phon) regarded longer reaction times than the photo stimulus tasks with the video action task evoking the longest reaction times. This reflects the nature of this task, focusing attention towards the performed hand action, whereas the other tasks directed attention towards the depicted object.</p>
