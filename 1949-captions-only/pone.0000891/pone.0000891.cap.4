                Figure 4.  Areas showing a significantly higher activation for decision on action observation (“is the hand holding the object with all five fingers?”) than for conceptual or phonological tasks involving the same video stimuli (Vd-Perc &gt; (Vd-Phon+Vd-Conc)).Comparison with the bilateral network for action observation (Fig. 3a) revealed that most the bilateral parietal and right frontal activations were activated when an action observation-related task was done but not if a concurrent cognitive task of conceptual or phonological decision on the same stimuli were performed.
