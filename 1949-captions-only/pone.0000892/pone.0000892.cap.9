                Figure 9.  Dilution test with different volume ratios of experimentally mixed -decim:-decula in a 2% agarose gel stained with Sybrsafe.First column: Amplification with -decim-specific primers 2607/2787; Second column: Amplification with -decula-specific primers 2607/2787. The less abundant mtDNA type was revealed using species-specific primers. Ladder is a 100 bp ladder with 1000 bp band on left.
