PERV transmitting PK-15 cells are grown on top of the membrane of the insert and human 293T cells on the bottom of the well of the culture dish. Virus particles are depicted diffusing through membrane pores. (B) The zoonotic transmission of PERV from PK-15 cells to 293T cells is shown by the time-dependent accumulation of PERV <em>pol</em> gene DNA in the human cells (solid diamonds and squares). No concomitant transfer of pig genomic DNA occurred through the duration of these experiments (open diamonds and squares). This graph summarizes data for two independently derived PK-15 clones, V1 (squares) and V2 (diamonds). All data points were calculated using results from duplicate Q-PCR reactions of genomic DNA from three parallel (but independent) co-cultures. The error bars indicate the SEM.
