PK-15 and 293T cell lysates were used as negative controls. CEM and H9 were used as positive controls for APOBEC3G expression. A non-specific (but pan-species) band is shown as a protein loading control (marked by an asterisk). (B) Q-PCR data using genomic DNA prepared from 293T cells co-cultured with two independently derived APOBEC3G expressing PK-15 clones (G1 and G2, circles and triangles, respectively) or two vector control clones (V1 and V2, diamonds and squares, respectively). The experimental parameters are identical to those used in <a href="#pone-0000893-g001">Figure 1B</a>.</p>
