Two datasets, each with an independent PK-15 clone in three replica co-culture wells, were collected in parallel and averaged for each data point. One standard error of the mean is shown. The experimental parameters are identical to those used in <a href="#pone-0000893-g001">Figure 1B</a>. The inset immunoblots show the APOBEC3G and Î±-tubulin levels of representative PK-15 clones expressing the indicated construct. The human T cell line H9 provided a positive control for APOBEC3G expression.</p>
