                Figure 4.  The APOBEC3G-dependent Inhibition of PERV Transmission Is Deamination-Independent.PERV-specific Q-PCR data using genomic DNA prepared from 293T cells co-cultured with PK-15 clones expressing APOBEC3G (G; triangles), APOBEC3G-E259Q (GE259Q; circles) or empty vector (V; squares). Two datasets, each with an independent PK-15 clone in three replica co-culture wells, were collected in parallel and averaged for each data point. One standard error of the mean is shown. The experimental parameters are identical to those used in Figure 1B. The inset immunoblots show the APOBEC3G and Î±-tubulin levels of representative PK-15 clones expressing the indicated construct. The human T cell line H9 provided a positive control for APOBEC3G expression.
