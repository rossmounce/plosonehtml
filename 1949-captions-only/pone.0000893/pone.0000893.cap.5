                Figure 5.  Genetic Variation in Zoonosed PERV DNA Sequences.(A) A schematic of the PERV genome showing coding regions (gag, pol and env) and long-terminal repeats (LTRs). The relevant 193 bp pol gene fragment is indicated. (B) An ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel showing that PERV pol gene DNA was amplified readily from 293T cells cultured with PK-15 control clones (None) and pig APOBEC3F over-expressing clones (A3Fo/e) but not with PK-15 clones expressing human APOBEC3G (A3G; top panel). PERV pol gene DNA (top panel) and pig genomic DNA (APOBEC3F locus; middle panel) PCR products were detected in PK-15 genomic DNA, whereas human beta-actin was strongly detected in the 293T cell genomic DNA samples (a much weaker amplification of pig beta-actin occurred because the human primers had partial complementarity to pig sequences, 20/21 and 17/18 nucleotides).
