The relevant 193 bp <em>pol</em> gene fragment is indicated. (B) An ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel showing that PERV <em>pol</em> gene DNA was amplified readily from 293T cells cultured with PK-15 control clones (None) and pig APOBEC3F over-expressing clones (A3Fo/e) but not with PK-15 clones expressing human APOBEC3G (A3G; top panel). PERV <em>pol</em> gene DNA (top panel) and pig genomic DNA (<em>APOBEC3F</em> locus; middle panel) PCR products were detected in PK-15 genomic DNA, whereas human <em>beta-actin</em> was strongly detected in the 293T cell genomic DNA samples (a much weaker amplification of pig <em>beta-actin</em> occurred because the human primers had partial complementarity to pig sequences, 20/21 and 17/18 nucleotides).</p>
