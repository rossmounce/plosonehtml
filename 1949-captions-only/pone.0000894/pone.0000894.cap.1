                Figure 1.  Phylogeny of GABA receptor protein sequences.The two clades, based on the presence (α, γ, and ε) or absence (ρ, β, δ, θ, and π) of a benzodiazepine binding site, are indicated by BZ+ and BZ–, respectively. Bootstrap values (maximum likelihood analysis) are indicated at all nodes while posterior probabilities (Bayesian analysis) are only indicated when smaller than 100%. The scale bar represents 1 amino acid substitutions per site. Ach: acetylcholine receptor.
