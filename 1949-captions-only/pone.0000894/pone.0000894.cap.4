                Figure 4.  Phylogenetic trees used to formulate hypotheses about the selective forces that shaped the evolution of the GABAA subunits.(a) the GABAA receptor θ and β subunits ; (b) the GABAA receptor ε and γ subunits. Selective pressures are allowed to vary among sets of branches to test for the a priori hypotheses listed at the bottom of the figure: H0: the null hypothesis that all branch-specific rates are equal; H1: burst of evolution following the main gene duplication event (ε/γ and θ/β); H2: also allows for a rate change after the burst of evolution; H3: extends H2 to allow for burst of evolution after all duplication events depicted on each tree. Hypotheses test are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per codon site, with branch lengths estimated under the null model (H0).
