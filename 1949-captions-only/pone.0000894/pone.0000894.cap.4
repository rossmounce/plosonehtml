Selective pressures are allowed to vary among sets of branches to test for the a priori hypotheses listed at the bottom of the figure: H<sub>0</sub>: the null hypothesis that all branch-specific rates are equal; H<sub>1</sub>: burst of evolution following the main gene duplication event (ε/γ and θ/β); H<sub>2</sub>: also allows for a rate change after the burst of evolution; H<sub>3</sub>: extends H<sub>2</sub> to allow for burst of evolution after all duplication events depicted on each tree. Hypotheses test are reported in <a href="#pone-0000894-t001">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0000894-t002">2</a>. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per codon site, with branch lengths estimated under the null model (H<sub>0</sub>).</p>
