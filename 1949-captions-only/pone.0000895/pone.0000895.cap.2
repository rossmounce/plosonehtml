Trends are studied using linear regression. <em>HOXA1</em> shows a linear association. <em>MGMT</em>-M2B shows a non-linear shift, with the <em>P</em>-value referring to a <em>T</em>-test of the difference in mean methylation value for subjects under or over 50 years of age. For the biphasic linear trends of <em>PAX8</em> and the <em>ALU</em> sequence <em>ALU-M1B</em> (<a href="#pone.0000895.s003">Table S2</a>) , the <em>P</em>-values refer to a test of change of slope. Green dots = controls, blue triangles = schizophrenia and red squares = Alzheimer's subjects. (B) Schematic summary of the four different types (1â€“4, see text for details) of developmental methylation profiles in human temporal cortex across the lifespan (x-axis, B = birth), as illustrated by the representative examples in (A). (C) Listings and proportion of gene loci (total = 48; excluding <em>AR</em> and <em>FAM127A</em> which showed gender-specific methylation) that show significant age-dependent methylation changes: colors refer to the scheme in (B). Gray sector refers to the subset of loci without a significant age effect. N = 125 subjects. All p-values are adjusted for diagnosis; *** p&lt;0.0001, ** p&lt;0.001, * p&lt;0.05.</p>
