N = 125 subjects, including Alzheimer subjects (red squares), schizophrenics (blue triangles) and controls (green dots). P-values refer to T-tests for comparison of Alzheimer subjects versus all other subjects older than 60 years. One outlier (ID 2763, 104 years old, <a href="#pone.0000895.s005">Table S4</a>) was omitted from the age-associated analyses.</p>
