Left, fetal samples (gw = gestational week); right, child and adult brains (yrs = years) and, as positive control, murine embryonic carcinoma, “P19” cells. Notice expression of DNMT3a—indicated by a ~120 kDa band—across all ages. (B, C) Digitized images of temporal cortex nuclei from 1 year old infant, processed for DNMT3a (red) and NeuN (green) immunoreactivity and counterstained with DAPI. Notice numerous neuronal nuclei expressing both markers, including representative example marked by arrowhead. Occasional non-neuronal DNMT3a+ nucleus is marked by arrow. (D,E) show weak background staining and formalin fixation-related autofluorescence in negative controls processed without primary antibodies. (F–H) Images from layers III, IV and V of parallel sections from adult temporal cortex, stained for Nissl (F) or hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled DNMT3a antisense (G) or sense riboprobe (H). Notice in (G) robust expression of DNMT3a mRNA in a subset of layer III and V neurons. Images in B–E taken at with 20× objective. Bar (F–H) in H = 100 µm.</p>
