Notice absence of detectable background and autofluorescence in these samples that were processed without prior fixation (B) Representative FACS of unfixed NeuN labeled material similar to the one shown in (A) (top) and of negative control (bottom); blue dots mark sorted neuronal nuclei (NeuN+). (C) Heatmap showing methylation levels of neuronal DNA isolates for 10 different genes across the lifespan (range: 0.6–97 years). Each gene is grouped into quartiles (blue = 1 low, green = 2 medium-low, yellow = 3 medium high, red = 4 high extent of methylation). The larger the number of samples with no detectable methylation, the fewer the number of observations coded green and yellow. White space = no data. * = p&lt;0.05 , Mann-Whitney U permutation based on comparison of immature/young (0.6–16 years) to old (62+years) samples. Notice that neuronal DNA from advanced age group shows significant increase in DNA methylation for 3/10 gene loci (<em>PGR, SYK, HOXA1</em>), but decreased levels at <em>S100A2</em> locus.</p>
