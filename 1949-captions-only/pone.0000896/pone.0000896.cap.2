                Figure 2.  Prevalence of haematozoan parasites across mainland and island populations of Acrocephalus spp, Z. lateralis, and N. temporalis.Shading indicates the proportion of individuals infected with Plasmodium spp. (black), Haemoproteus spp. (light grey) and Leucocytozoon spp. (dark grey). Asterisks indicate significantly lower parasite prevalences in island endemic species (Plasmodium spp. in A. aequinoctialis, above, and A. rimitarae, below) and recently introduced island populations (Haemoproteus spp. in Z. lateralis) relative to their mainland counterparts.
