                Figure 3.  Immune response of island taxa relative to a mainland counterpart.Cell-mediated (PHA-induced patagial swelling) and constitutive innate (agglutination and lysis of rabbit red blood cells) measures of immune response in endemic and recently-introduced island taxa (circles) are indicated relative to control values (centered at zero) from a closely-related mainland taxon. Numbers indicate sample size and standard error is depicted by vertical bars, or by grey shading in the case of the mainland control. Filled circles indicate a significant difference from the mainland control.
