                Figure 1.  A. Rensch's rule as it is often represented schematically.The dashed line is the line of isometry (male size = female size); the solid line represents Rensch's rule, with SSD increasing with size in species with MBSSD, decreasing with size in species with FBSSD. However, this representation also makes the assumption (not stated by Rensch) that in taxa with mixed SSD, those species with FBSSD will be smaller than species with MBSSD. B. An alternative representation of Rensch's rule, with SSD decreasing with size in FBSSD species, increasing in MBSSD species as before, but both MBSSD and FBSSD species can span the full range of sizes present in the group.
