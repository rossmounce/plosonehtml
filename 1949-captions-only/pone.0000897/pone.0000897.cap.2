Also shown are OLS estimates of the relationship between SSD and log(male size) for each family; families with &gt;50% FBSSD species are shown as solid lines, those with &gt;50% MBSSD species as dotted lines. Note that this plot is equivalent to plotting log(female size) against log(male size) with the slopes presented in <a href="#pone-0000897-t001">table 1</a>, but it is easier to see differences between families on the SSD scale.</p>
