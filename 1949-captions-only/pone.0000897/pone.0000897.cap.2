                Figure 2.  SSD (defined here as log(female size/male size)) against log(male size) for the 30 avian families in our dataset for which we had body size data for â‰¥ 10 species.The dashed horizontal line indicates no scaling of SSD with size. Also shown are OLS estimates of the relationship between SSD and log(male size) for each family; families with &gt;50% FBSSD species are shown as solid lines, those with &gt;50% MBSSD species as dotted lines. Note that this plot is equivalent to plotting log(female size) against log(male size) with the slopes presented in table 1, but it is easier to see differences between families on the SSD scale.
