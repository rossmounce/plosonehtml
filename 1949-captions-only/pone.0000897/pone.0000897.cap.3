                Figure 3.  The family-specific slope estimates from table 1 plotted against PMB, the proportion of species within a family displaying MBSSD.The dotted horizontal line indicates isometry. Circles indicate families with PMB &lt;0.5, triangles those with PMB &gt;0.5, the horizontal solid lines are the means of these two groups, and the shaded grey regions are their respective 95% C.I.s. Solid symbols are those families with PMB ≤0.2 or ≥0.8. The size of each symbol is proportional to the number of species in that family for which we had data. Error bars represent the standard error of the family-specific slope estimates, and for clarity are extended only towards a slope of 1. Three families with a PMB of 0.5 are indicated by crosses, and were not included in the above analysis. Also shown (dashed line) is the simple linear regression of family-specific slope on PMB (weighted by the reciprocal of the s.e. of the family-specific slope).
