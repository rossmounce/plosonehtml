                Figure 4.  SSD against log(male size) for four families with mixed SSD, A. Laridae, B. Tyrannidae, C. Fringillidae, D. Trochilidae.In each case, species with FBSSD are shown as filled symbols, those with MBSSD as open symbols. We also include three regression lines on each figure. The solid line is the slope across all species, and is significantly negative in each case. The dashed line is the slope for species with FBSSD only, and differs from isometry only in D. The dotted line is for species with MBSSD only, which is significantly negative in all panels except D.
