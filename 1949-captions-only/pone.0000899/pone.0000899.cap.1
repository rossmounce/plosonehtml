Wild-type or gp150-deficient (gp150<sup>−</sup>) eGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated (1 mg mAb/10<sup>4</sup> p.f.u.) with mAb 6H10 (anti-gp70, IgG2a, non-neutralizing) or mAb 7D6 (anti-gH/gL, IgG2a, neutralizing), or with no antibody (virus only), then added to RAW264.7 macrophages (1 p.f.u./cell) or BHK-21 fibroblasts (0.1 p.f.u./cell). 18 h later, infected cells were identified by viral eGFP expression, and appear dark in this image. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. B. Wild-type eGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions (10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u.) were incubated (2 h, 37°C) with 1 of 4 different gH/gL-specific mAbs or without antibody (virus only). The virus/antibody mixtures were then added to RAW264.7 cells (1 p.f.u./cell). 18 h later, infected cells were enumerated by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. The dashed line shows the level of infection with virus alone. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. C. EGFP-expressing MHV-68 was incubated (2 h, 37°C) with mAb T1A1 (20 µg/ml) or not, plus either the neutralizing, gH/gL-specific mAb 7E5 or the anti-H2-K<sup>b</sup> mAb Y3 as a negative control. The virus/antibody mixtures were then used to infect BHK-21 fibroblasts (1 p.f.u./cell) or RAW264.7 macrophages (5 p.f.u./cell). Infection was quantitated 18 h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. UI = uninfected, VIR = virus only. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
