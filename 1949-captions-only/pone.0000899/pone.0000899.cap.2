The virus/antibody mixtures were then added to RAW264.7 macrophages (3 p.f.u./cell) or BHK-21 fibroblasts (0.3 p.f.u./cell). 18 h later, LPS (350 ng/ml) was added for 6 h to maximize viral eGFP expression <a href="#pone.0000899-Rosa1">[17]</a> and infection was quantitated by flow cytometry of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Each value is expressed as a percentage of the eGFP expression with virus alone. A log scale is used to encompass the huge range between infection enhancement and neutralization. Virus alone would be 100%, or log = 2 (dashed line). The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
