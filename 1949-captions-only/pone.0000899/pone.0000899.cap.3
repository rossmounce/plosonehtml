Vero cells were left infected (UI) or infected (1 p.f.u./cell, 18 h) with vaccinia virus recombinants as indicated, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for MHV-68 glycoproteins. T2C12 and T7G7 see different gH/gL neutralizing epitopes <a href="#pone.0000899-Gill1">[22]</a>. The data are from 2 separate experiments. B. MHV-68 carrier mice (3 months post-infection) were infected with vaccinia virus recombinants as shown. The control recombinant (VAC-cont) expresses the murine invariant chain with an ovalbumin-derived epitope. Sera were taken 10 days post-infection, pooled from 5 mice per group, and used to stain MHV-68 glycoprotein-expressing CHO cell lines as indicated. nil = untransfected, gHL = transfected with gH/gL-GPI fusion protein, gB = transfected with gB-GPI, gp150 = transfected with gp150. Naive = serum from naive mice. The arrows indicate strong increases in glycoprotein staining. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
