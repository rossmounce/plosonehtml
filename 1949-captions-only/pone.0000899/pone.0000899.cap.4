                Figure 4.  Altered functional impact of sera from MHV-68 carrier mice boosted with individual virion glycoproteins.EGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated with sera from MHV-68 carrier mice boosted 10 days earlier with vaccinia virus recombinant as shown. The virus/antibody mixtures were then used to infect RAW264.7 macrophages (5 p.f.u./cell) or BHK-21 fibroblasts (100 p.f.u./well). RAW264.7 cell infection was quantitated 18 h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. BHK-21 cell infection was measured by plaque assay. The dashed lines show infection with virus alone (no serum). The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.
