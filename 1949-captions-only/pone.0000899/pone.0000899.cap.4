The virus/antibody mixtures were then used to infect RAW264.7 macrophages (5 p.f.u./cell) or BHK-21 fibroblasts (100 p.f.u./well). RAW264.7 cell infection was quantitated 18 h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. BHK-21 cell infection was measured by plaque assay. The dashed lines show infection with virus alone (no serum). The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
