Pooled serum samples (5 mice per group) at 5 months post-boosting of MHV-68 carrier mice with the vaccinia virus recombinant shown, were used to inhibit MHV-68 infection of BHK-21 cells in a plaque reduction assay. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. The dashed line shows the titer of the same amount of virus without added antibody. B. The same serum samples as in A were tested for their effect on RAW264.7 cell infection. eGFP-expressing MHV-68 virions were incubated with serum dilutions as shown (2 h, 37°C) then added to RAW264.7 macrophages (3 p.f.u./cell). Infection was assayed 18 h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression. The dashed lines show infection levels for MHV-68 incubated with either no serum or with sera pooled from age-matched naive mice. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. C. Sera from individual vaccinia-boosted, MHV-68 carrier mice, again at 5 months post-boosting, were incubated with MHV-68 virions (2 h, 37°C). The infectivity titer of each serum/virus mixture was then determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 fibroblasts. Each solid line shows the result for a serum sample from one mouse. The dashed line shows the mean titer of the group. The dotted line shows the mean titer of 3 virus samples without added immune serum. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
