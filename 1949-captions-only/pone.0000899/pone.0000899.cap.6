Wild-type MHV-68 virions were filtered to remove any aggregates, then diluted as shown (nominal PFU) and incubated or not with 10% serum pooled from mice infected 3 months previously with wild-type MHV-68. Each sample was then titrated on BHK-21 cells (p.f.u.) and used to infect naive mice intranasally (mice infected). Infection of mice was determined by plaque assay of lungs harvested 7 days later, and were scored simply as positive or negative depending on whether any virus was present. The <em>in vivo</em> data are pooled from 3 different experiments that all gave consistent results. B. Wild-type MHV-68 virions were incubated with pooled serum samples from vaccinia virus boosted MHV-68 carrier mice as in A, then given intranasally to naive mice (5 Âµl of serum per mouse with the virus dose shown, using 6 mice per group). Lungs were titered for infectious virus at 7 days post-infection and scored as either infected or not. The data are pooled from 2 equivalent experiments (3 mice per group each).</p>
