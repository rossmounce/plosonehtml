Branch lengths based on maximum-likelihood estimates of non-synonymous substitutions along 1995 bp of the <em>FoxP2</em> gene are superimposed onto a cladogram based on published trees <a href="#pone.0000900-Murphy1">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000900-Teeling1">[33]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000900-Teeling2">[34]</a>. Bat lineages are coloured to show the echolocating Yinpterochiroptera (blue) that mostly possess high duty constant frequency (CF) calls with at least partial Doppler shift compensation, the Yangochiroptera (orange) that mostly possess low duty cycle calls, as well as the absence of laryngeal echolocation in Yinpterochiroptera fruit bats (violet). The taxa analysed are listed in the <a href="#s4">Methods</a> and in <a href="#pone.0000900.s002">table S2</a>.</p>
