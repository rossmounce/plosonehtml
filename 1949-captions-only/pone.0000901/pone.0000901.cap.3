Previous studies showed that environmental conditions during much earlier developmental periods in life, i.e. the pre- and early post hatching period, strongly affect subsequent adult traits <a href="#pone.0000901-Lindstrm1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Groothuis1">[27]</a> such as male attractiveness <a href="#pone.0000901-deKogel1">[14]</a>. Our findings expand on these previous studies by showing that the period during which secondary sexual characters develop also has a significant effect on attractiveness even several months later.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>In zebra finches the second month of life is a period of major behavioural, morphological and physiological changes. During this month the neuronal song system in the brain is still developing <a href="#pone.0000901-Bottjer1">[23]</a> and the gonads show a major increase in growth <a href="#pone.0000901-Sossinka1">[21]</a>. This is also when song learning <a href="#pone.0000901-Slater1">[28]</a>, moult into secondary adult plumage and the transition of beak colour from the black in juveniles to orange in adults occurs <a href="#pone.0000901-Zann1">[20]</a>. The experimental conditions males experienced during our experiments may have affected any of these or other traits, as our experiments were designed to test if nutritional conditions in general during the second month have lasting effects on adult attractiveness rather than to manipulate specific traits. In mammals including humans, traits in adults like dominance, learning capacity or other psychological traits are known to be affected by conditions during puberty <a href="#pone.0000901-Hodes1">[29]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-KaltialaHeino1">[30]</a>. Even though such effects have not yet been documented for birds, they may well exist, as the suite of events in the second month of life in zebra finches are somewhat similar to those during puberty in mammals. Indeed this early period of independence might be particularly revealing with regard to a birds own behavioural abilities and its condition. Here birds have to master environmental and social constraints on their own and this is a period of high mortality <a href="#pone.0000901-Zann1">[20]</a> and thus a period of high selection pressure. Traits that develop during this period then are more revealing with respect to a male's own abilities to acquire resources rather than its parents' abilities who are a key determinate to provide resources that are required for the traits that develop earlier. Females choosing males that experienced good conditions during this developmental period then are likely to choose those males that are more competitive and possibly of higher quality. One potential cue females might have attended to are differences in male plumage ornaments. Although we did not measure these traits at the time of the experiments, the significant difference in plumage ornaments at the end of the nutritional treatments might have persisted until adulthood and affected female choice.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>Regardless of the possible role of plumage traits in the choice experiments, the significant effects on plumage are interesting in themselves with respect to their signal value. The preferred males had larger orange cheek patches than did unpreferred males at day 60, i.e. immediately after the nutritional treatments ended. These males with the larger cheek patches were also the males that had experienced the better nutritional conditions. Thus, our data show that the size of the cheek patches immediately after moult into adult plumage are indicators of nutritional conditions during the preceding month of development and at that age, patches can function as honest signals of past condition <a href="#pone.0000901-Cotton1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Andersson1">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Zahavi1">[32]</a>. The size of the cheek patch has been shown recently to be also affected by social experience during this developmental period <a href="#pone.0000901-Leader1">[33]</a>. The orange cheek patches are fully developed by day 60 but intensity develops further over the weeks thereafter <a href="#pone.0000901-Zann1">[20]</a>. Our subjects were kept under identical conditions after day 60 so that males that had developed smaller cheek patches until day 60 possibly did not catch up thereafter. If so, poorer nutritional conditions led to poorer rather than delayed plumage maturation. Even though plumage characters are known to be affected by specific nutrient and protein requirements during moult <a href="#pone.0000901-Cotton1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Hill1">[26]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Jacot1">[34]</a> the plumage traits of young male zebra finches appear to be indicators of a specific developmental period in which many other traits develop and survival is low <a href="#pone.0000901-Zann2">[35]</a>. The sexual plumage ornaments, at least in young males, thus could be signals representing a range of condition-dependent traits that develop during this specific period.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4"></a><p>Taken together, our findings identify the environmental conditions at the point of nutritional independence from the parents as an important source of variation in attractiveness <a href="#pone.0000901-Lindstrm1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Hadfield1">[36]</a>. Several traits important in reproduction and thus relevant to fitness develop at this stage and males may not be able to compensate without costs for developmental stress experienced at that time. Thus, females attending to traits reflecting this specific developmental period of a potential mate are likely to make an adaptive decision, a consideration that emphasizes the importance of environmental determination of fitness-relevant traits <a href="#pone.0000901-Charmantier1">[37]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000901-Griffith1">[38]</a>.</p>

<h4>Subjects and experimental rearing conditions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>We conducted the experiments in 2004 on non-domesticated zebra finches <a href="#pone.0000901-Forstmeier1">[39]</a>(about F7 generation of wild caught birds) at the University of Bielefeld, Germany. For breeding, we kept 52 pairs in individual cages (83×30×40 cm) which were supplied daily with dried and germinated seeds, egg, and fresh water enriched with vitamins. Each cage was provided with an attached wooden nest box (12.5×12×14 cm) and with coconut fibres to be used as nesting material. Rooms had a temperature of 25°C and a L:D regime of 16:8 hours. Nests were checked daily for egg laying and for presence of hatchlings. In total, 21 pairs bred successfully and produced a total of 42 male and 34 female offspring. Breeding success was low in part due to first time breeding. When fledglings were 35 days old (the typical time of nutritional independence), they were transferred to mixed-sex groups of three to six individuals (size of aviaries 200×80×100 cm). They remained in these groups with different nutritional treatments until day 60, i.e. until secondary sexual characters were fully developed and until males had learned their song <a href="#pone.0000901-Zann1">[20]</a>. These mixed-sex groups were assigned to two different nutritional treatments. In both treatments subjects were supplied daily with a mixture of dried seeds and fresh water (plus additional vitamins three times a week). The high quality treatment group was additionally supplied with germinated seeds, egg food and boiled hens' eggs. Same sex siblings were assigned to different nutritional treatments during this period so that we could control for genetic effects and early developmental background. Overall we used nine such pairs of groups. Each pair of groups had one adult male as song tutor in a cage (45×24×31 cm) attached to front of the two aviaries (<a href="#pone-0000901-g004">Fig. 4a</a>). On day 60, all subjects were transferred to mixed sex groups in large aviaries where they received an intermediate diet consisting of standard diet supplemented by germinated seeds. Two weeks prior to the mate choice tests all subjects were transferred to same sex groups (aviary size 100×300×330 or 90×180×190 cm). At day 60, body mass was taken with a Pesola scale to the nearest 0.5 g. Tarsus length was measured with callipers to the nearest 0.01 mm, and wing length with a ruler (flattened wing) to the nearest 1 mm. On day 60, we also took two digital portrait pictures from the left side of the males' head using a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera. Pictures were taken from approximately 30 cm in front of a grey or black background (<a href="#pone-0000901-g003">Fig. 3</a>). Sample size of males from which we took pictures is lower than total sample size as we started taking these photos after some males were older than 60 days. Consequently we did not take any pictures of these males, so that photos were available for 12 out of the 18 pairs of pairs of males that were used in mate choice tests.</p>
