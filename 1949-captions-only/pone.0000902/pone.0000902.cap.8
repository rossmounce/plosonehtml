B, SNP frequencies of RPA194-associated promoters are plotted as described in <a href="#pone-0000902-g005">Fig. 5</a>. Arrows show the region as well as the direction of changes caused by basonuclin-deficiency. C, Pair-wise chi-square tests on SNP frequencies shown in B were performed. The resulting <em>p</em> values are plotted in alignment with panels in A and B. The notations are as described in <a href="#pone-0000902-g004">Fig. 4</a> and <a href="#pone-0000902-g005">5</a>.</p>
