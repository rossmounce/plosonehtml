                Figure 4.  Relative protein levels of the γ1 (A) and γ3 (B) isoforms in differentiated skeletal muscle cells from R225W carriers and matched control subjects.The integrated densitometry value (IDV) for each γ subunit was divided by the IDV of the loading control, β-actin. Means +/− SD. n = 2–4, Student's t-test, p = 0.389 (A), p = 0.229 (B).
