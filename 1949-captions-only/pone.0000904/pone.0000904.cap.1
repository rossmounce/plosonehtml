                Figure 1.  MA-plot analysis of microarray results of a B. pertussis clinical strain (PRCB179).The mean of intensity (A) is plotted against log-transformed intensity ratio (M) of individual spots. Two distinct clusters of the genes are shown. The genes present in both reference and testing strains were centered on zero, and the genes lost in the testing strain formed a separate cluster defined by M-value&lt;âˆ’2.
