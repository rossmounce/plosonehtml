                Figure 2.  Dendrogram analysis of PFGE profiles of B. pertussis clinical and reference strains.The DNA profiles obtained after restriction with XbaI are shown, and only different PFGE profiles identified among the strains tested by microarray were included. The unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) with 1% band tolerance and 1% optimization settings was used as the clustering method.
