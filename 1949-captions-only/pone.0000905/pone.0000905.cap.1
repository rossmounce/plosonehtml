                Figure 1.  Examples of predicted pseudoknot structures.(a) An example of base pairing between the D–T loop regions of E. coli tRNA(Phe)–predicted with default parameters. (b,c) Prediction of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) self cleavage ribozymes for the genomic (b) and antigenomic (c) sequences (Kuhn length 8 nt). For the genomic HDV (b), the secondary structure prediction is also shown above. The secondary structure of the antigenomic HDV is unchanged by pseudoknot formation. (d) Examples of predictions of the pseudoknots in E. coli tmRNA: (PK1) PK1 with default parameters, (PK4) PK4 with Kuhn length of 7 nt and minimum stem length 3 bp. On the left is the predicted secondary structure alone, and on the right, the same prediction including the pseudoknot option. (e) The turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and the tandem pseudoknots of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) frame shift sequence. Structures created using a modified version of naview [15].
