                Figure 3.  Example of a two state system.The alpha operon ribosomal binding site [21] is one example where the minimum free energy of the bare RNA is different from that of the observed structure bond to the ribosome. (a) A sequence from E. coli fitted with a Kuhn length of 7 nt. (b) The same sequence under constraints. The correct pseudoknot could only be obtained when the Shine-Dalgarno sequence region and the upper stem regions in the loop (Fig. 3a) were excluded.
