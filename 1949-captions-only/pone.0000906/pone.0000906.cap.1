                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the psoriasis susceptibility locus on Chromosome 20p13.A. Genetic map of the linkage interval (tel, telomere; cen, centromere). Position of microsatellites used in the linkage analysis is indicated in centimorgans (cM). B. Z plot for association tests performed with FBAT under the assumption of linkage, for SNPs selected in Stage I. Position of SNPs is indicated in megabases (Mb). The dotted line indicates the threshold for significance of the association test (a Z score&gt;3 corresponds to a P&lt;0.05). C. Detailed physical map on the contig NT_011387.8 at the 3 candidate loci. Positions of the SNPs genotyped in stage I and in stage II are shown with arrows. Red arrows indicate SNPs showing evidence for association (P≤0.05) in stage I; orange arrows indicate SNPs showing evidence for association (P≤0.05) in stage II; black arrows indicate SNPs showing no evidence for association in the univariate analysis.
