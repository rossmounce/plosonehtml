<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3"></a><p>The water soluble CNT-amine construct, <strong>2</strong>, was reacted with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetr​aazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraaceticacid (DOTA-NCS, Macrocyclics, Inc., Dallas, TX) to yield a CNT-DOTA construct in metal-free conditions at pH 9.5 (adjusted with 1 M metal free carbonate solution) for 40 minutes at room temperature at a stoichiometry of 2:1 (DOTA-NCS to amine). The product was purified using a 10 DG gel permeation column (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with metal-free water (MFW, Purelab Plus System, U.S. Filter Corp., Lowell, MA) as the mobile phase. The 10 DG column was rendered metal free by washing with 30 mL of 10 mM EDTA followed by rinsing with 60 mL of MFW. The product was lyophilized to yield a solid that was the CNT-DOTA construct (<a href="#pone-0000907-g001">Figure 1</a>, compound <strong>3</strong>). Raman spectroscopy was employed to characterize <strong>3</strong> (as described above). AFM images were obtained using a Veeco Dimension 3100 (Woodbury, NY) operated in the tapping mode with a scanning frequency of 84 Hz and a scan rate of 0.500 Hz. Cantilever tips were supplied from Vecco probes (force constant of 3 k/m). Samples were spin coated onto a freshly cleaved mica surface. TEM images were obtained using a Philips EM-201 (Amsterdam, Netherlands) with 1 nm resolution, HV = 80 kV. Samples are adsorbed onto plasma-treated formvar-coated copper grids. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic and chromatographic characterization of <strong>3</strong> was performed by gel permeation HPLC using a Beckman Coulter System Gold Bioessential 125/168 diode array detection system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with an in-line Jasco FP-2020 fluorescence detector (Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, 0.020 mg of <strong>3</strong> dissolved in <em>N,N</em>-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma Biotech grade 99.9+%) was chromatographed with a stationary phase of PLgel MIXED-A column (300 mm×7.5 mm) (Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA) and a DMF mobile phase at 1 mL/min at ambient temperature. The extent of DOTA substitution per mass of CNT in compound <strong>3</strong> was determined using the spectrophotometric method <a href="#pone.0000907-Dadachova1">[13]</a> of Dadachova <em>et al.</em> The number of primary amines that remained after appending the DOTA-NCS was again assayed using the Sarin assay <a href="#pone.0000907-Sarin1">[12]</a>. The mass of CNT was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy (at 600 nm) to measure the CNT concentration from the linear region of a standard curve of absorbance at 600 nm versus different concentrations of CNT.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p5"></a><p>The <sup>86</sup>Y-CNT construct (<a href="#pone-0000907-g001">Figure 1</a>, compound <strong>4</strong>) was prepared by adding 296 MBq (8 mCi) of acidic <sup>86</sup>Y chloride to 0.150 mg of CNT-DOTA (compound <strong>3</strong>) (10 g/L) in MFW and 0.050 mL of 3 M ammonium acetate (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) to yield a pH 5.5 solution. The reaction mixture was heated to 60°C for 30 min. and then purified by size exclusion chromatography using a P6 resin (BioRad) as the stationary phase and 1% human serum albumin (HSA, Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland) in 0.9% NaCl (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) as the mobile phase.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p6"></a><p>The control construct was a mixture of <sup>86</sup>Y-DOTA and CNT-amine (compound <strong>2</strong>). This mixture was prepared by the adding 37 MBq (1 mCi) of acidic <sup>86</sup>Y chloride to 0.5 mg (10 g/L in MFW) of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-​tetraaceticacid (DOTA, Macrocyclics, Inc.) and 0.050 mL of 3M ammonium acetate to yield a pH 5.5 solution.

<h4>Synthesis and Characterization of <sup>111</sup>In-CNT</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>The analogous <sup>111</sup>In-CNT construct (compound <strong>5</strong>) was prepared by adding 111 MBq (3 mCi) of acidic <sup>111</sup>In chloride (Perkin Elmer, N. Bellerica, MA) to 0.150 mg of <strong>3</strong> (10 g/L) in MFW and 0.050 mL of 3 M ammonium acetate to yield a pH 5.5 solution. The reaction mixture was heated to 60°C for 30 min. and then purified by size exclusion chromatography using a P6 resin as the stationary phase and 1% HSA in 0.9% NaCl as the mobile phase. A small aliquot of the final product was used to determine the radiochemical purity by ITLC-SG using the methods described above. Combined spectroscopic, radiographic, and chromatographic characterization of the CNT construct was performed by reverse phase HPLC, using a Beckman Coulter System Bioessential 125/168 diode array detection instrument equipped with an in-line γ-RAM Model 3 radioactivity detector (IN/US, Tampa, FL). There was a delay of 0.3 min. that corresponded to the time to transit from the diode array detector to the downstream radionuclide detector. Compound <strong>5</strong> (0.010 mg) was analyzed using a Gemini (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) 5u reverse phase C18 column (250×4.6 mm) to chromatograph these molecules with a 0 to 100% gradient of 0.1M tetraethylammonium acetate (Aldrich), pH 6.5 and acetonitrile (Aldrich) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.</p>


<h4>Experimental Design</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Ten male athymic nude mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY), 10–12 weeks old, were separated into three groups. Group I (n = 4) received an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 6.7 MBq (0.18 mCi) and 0.012 mg <strong>4</strong> in 0.20 mL <em>via</em> the retroorbital sinus. Group II (n = 3) received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 6.7 MBq and 0.012 mg <strong>4</strong> in 0.20 mL. Group III (n = 3) received an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 13.3 MBq (0.36 mCi) <sup>86</sup>Y-DOTA+0.015 mg of <strong>2</strong> in 0.20 mL <em>via</em> the retroorbital sinus. All animals were imaged by PET on day 1 at 3 hours post-injection; group I and II animals were imaged by CT at this time as well, while still under anesthesia. On day 2, 24 hours post-injection, Group I and II animals were imaged by PET. For all <em>in vivo</em> experiments housing and care were in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>


<h4>CT Imaging</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>CT imaging was performed using the CT component of the X-SPECT (Gamma Medica, Northridge, CA) a dedicated small-animal SPECT-CT scanner for non-invasive, ultra-high-resolution imaging <em>in vivo</em> of single-photon-emitting radiotracers and ultra-high-resolution CT scans for anatomic registration. The imaging times for the CT studies were 10 min. with a resolution of ≈0.100 mm. These CT imaging studies require animals to be fully anesthetized using isofluorane anesthesia.</p>


<h4>Micro-PET Imaging</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>The microPET Focus™ 120 (CTI Molecular Imaging, Inc., Knoxville, TN) is a dedicated small-animal scanner for imaging PET radiotracers. An energy window of 350–750 keV, a coincidence timing window of 6 nsec, and an acquisition time of 10–20 min. were used. The resulting list-mode data were sorted into 2D histograms by Fourier re-binning and transverse images reconstructed by filtered back-projection into a 128×128×95 matrix. The reconstructed spatial resolution is 2.6 mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) at the center of the field of view. The image data were corrected for non-uniformity of response of the microPET™ (i.e. were normalized), deadtime count losses, physical decay to the time of injection, and the <sup>86</sup>Y positron branching ratio but no attenuation, scatter, or partial-volume averaging correction was applied. An empirically determined system calibration factor (i.e. µCi/mL/cps/voxel) for mice was derived by imaging a mouse-size cylinder containing <sup>18</sup>F uniformly dispersed in water and used to convert voxel count rates to activity concentrations. The resulting image data were then normalized to the administered activity to determine by region-of-interest analysis the percent of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of tissue corrected for radioactive decay to the time of injection.</p>


<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>AsiPRO VM 5.0 software (Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN) was used to perform image and region of interest (ROI) analyses with the PET and CT datasets. For the ROI analyses, a minimum of 3 regions per tissue per animal were collected and the average %ID/g and standard deviation determined. The average %ID/g tissue per animal was used to determine an average %ID/g per tissue per group and the standard deviation within the group values was calculated. Standards of each injected formulation were counted to quantify the %ID/g. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were performed to assess temporal differences of tissue activity. Prism software (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses and plotting data. TEM image analysis was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, <a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>). AFM image analysis was carried-out using Nanoscope II software from Digital Instruments.</p>


<h4>Biodistribution Data</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>Animals were sacrificed at 24 h post-injection and the kidneys, liver and spleens were harvested according to approved IACUC institutional protocols. Tissue samples were weighed and counted in a Packard Cobra γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co., Inc., Meriden, CT) using a 315–435 KeV window. Standards of each injected formulation were counted to determine the %ID/g.</p>


<h4>Blood Clearance and Excretion of <sup>111</sup>In-CNT</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>In another biodistribution study, 0.007 mg of <strong>5</strong> (specific activity 37 GBq/g (1Ci/g)) were injected i.v., <em>via</em> the retroorbital sinus, per BALB/c mouse (female, 8–12 weeks old, Taconic Farms, NY) and the mice were divided into 5 groups of n = 3 per group. One group of mice was sacrificed at each of the following time points 1, 24, 96, 216 and 360 hours and tissue samples including blood, brain, lung, heart, adipose tissue, liver, kidney, spleen and femur were harvested, weighed and counted using a Packard Cobra Gamma counter using the 15–550 KeV window. The %ID/g was determined by measuring the activity of an aliquot of each construct injectate. Urine samples were collected from mice 1 hour post injection. Activity was detected and the urine samples were analyzed using the ITLC method described above.</p>

<h4>The synthesis, radiolabeling, and characterization of the CNT constructs</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Pristine CNT were purified and shortened by digestion in dilute nitric acid and sonication. The product of this process, <strong>1</strong>, was carboxy-functionalized CNT. The Raman spectrum of this product is shown in <a href="#pone-0000907-g002">Figure 2a</a>. The radial breathing mode (RBM) feature at 200 cm<sup>−1</sup> yields a CNT diameter of 1.1 nm and further confirmation of the product identity is provided by the 1340 cm<sup>−1</sup> disorder band (D band) and the sharp 1556 and 1584 cm<sup>−1 </sup>tangential mode (G band) resonances <a href="#pone.0000907-Yu1">[16]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000907-Itkis1">[17]</a>. These CNT (compound <strong>1</strong>) were functionalized and solubilized by the covalent sidewall attachment of pendant primary amines to yield compound <strong>2</strong>. The Raman spectrum of <strong>2</strong> (<a href="#pone-0000907-g002">Figure 2b</a>) was characterized by the loss of the RBM feature and a rising baseline due to increasing luminescence resulting from the enhanced dispersion of this product in solution <a href="#pone.0000907-Lin1">[18]</a>. The amine content of the construct was quantified using the Sarin assay <a href="#pone.0000907-Sarin1">[12]</a>, which yielded a value of 1.76 mmol amine/g CNT. Subsequently, these amines were reacted with DOTA-NCS to yield the CNT-DOTA construct (compound <strong>3</strong>). Raman characterization of <strong>3</strong> (<a href="#pone-0000907-g002">Figure 2c</a>) confirmed the enhanced solubility (~10 g/L) of this construct by the rising baseline <a href="#pone.0000907-Lin1">[18]</a>, which partially masks the D and G bands. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images (<a href="#pone-0000907-g003">Figure 3</a>) of <strong>3</strong> are presented to demonstrate the composition, identity and purity of the DOTA-functionalized CNT product. <a href="#pone-0000907-g003">Figure 3a</a> displays the results of an image analysis of the TEM data of a sampling of 22 ‘unbundled’ <strong>3</strong> in <a href="#pone-0000907-g003">Figure 3b</a>. This data shows that the mean±standard deviation CNT length distribution of <strong>3</strong> was 42±17 nm (<em>n</em> = 22). The AFM and TEM images of <strong>3</strong> in <a href="#pone-0000907-g003">Figures 3c and d</a>, respectively, show bundles of <strong>3</strong> with varying thickness (approximately 1–20 nm) and lengths and the absence of carbonaceous or nanoparticulate contaminants. A gel permeation HPLC chromatograph of <strong>3</strong> is shown in <a href="#pone-0000907-g004">Figure 4</a> with a major absorbance peak at 11.7 min and the corresponding UV-Vis absorbance spectrum of that peak demonstrating the characteristic CNT spectral feature. This gel permeation chromatograph further demonstrates the purity of <strong>3</strong>, notably by the absence of the later eluting amorphous carbon and nanoparticulate species <a href="#pone.0000907-Zhao1">[19]</a>, which are highly fluorescent species <a href="#pone.0000907-Lin1">[18]</a> and that were not detected using the in-line fluorescence detector. The DOTA content of <strong>3</strong> was determined using a lead arsenazo assay <a href="#pone.0000907-Dadachova1">[13]</a>, which yielded a value of 0.30 mmol DOTA/g CNT; in addition <strong>3</strong> still contained some unreacted amines assayed to be 0.27 mmol amine/g CNT. Construct <strong>3</strong> was labeled with “no carrier added” <sup>86</sup>Y chloride <a href="#pone.0000907-Finn1">[14]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000907-Lovqvist1">[15]</a> and purified by size exclusion chromatography. The radiochemical purity of compound <strong>4</strong> was determined to be 90% by ITLC methods and had a specific activity of 555 GBq/g (15 Ci/g). The control construct was a mixture of <sup>86</sup>Y-DOTA+<strong>2</strong>. The <sup>86</sup>Y-DOTA was 95% radiochemicaly pure as determined by ITLC-SG.</p>
