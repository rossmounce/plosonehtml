                Figure 2.  Raman spectra measured with a 488 nm laser.(a) acid-oxidized and purified CNT, compound 1; (b) sidewall amine-functionalized CNT, compound 2; (c) DOTA-functionalized CNT, compound 3. The spectra for 1 and 2 are plotted on the left axis (0-120,000), and 3 on the right axis (0â€“450,000).
