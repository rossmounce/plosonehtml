                Figure 3.  Microscopic images of 3 provide data to evaluate the (a) size distribution of 22 individual DOTA-CNT obtained from (b) a representative TEM image of solubilized 3 (scale bar = 100 nm); (c) AFM image of the height (scale bar = 0â€“60 nm) and (d) TEM image (scale bar = 100 nm) of representative DOTA-CNT bundles.
