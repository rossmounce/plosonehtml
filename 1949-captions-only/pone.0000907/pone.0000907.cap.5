<h4>The biodistribution of the radiolabeled construct and the control construct</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The ten mice were separated into three groups, each mouse in groups I and II received 0.012 mg of <strong>4</strong> labeled with 6.7 MBq of <sup>86</sup>Y, administered i.v. or i.p., respectively. Animals in group III (control group) each received a physical mixture of 13.3 MBq of <sup>86</sup>Y-DOTA and 0.015 mg of <strong>2</strong> <em>via</em> i.v. injection. We evaluated the biodistribution of <strong>4</strong> <em>in vivo</em> by serial PET and then performed anatomic imaging using a dedicated small-animal CT scanner. Software fusion of the resulting PET and CT images was carried out to combine the images. The imaging results were confirmed by sacrificing the animals and harvesting, weighing, and counting the activity in the organs.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2"></a><p>PET images of animals in groups I and II at 3 hours post-injection clearly demonstrated accumulation of activity in the kidneys, spleen and liver (<a href="#pone-0000907-g006">Figure 6</a>). The kidney images showed uptake primarily in the renal cortex, while the renal medulla was devoid of activity. There was no blood-pool activity observed in these images. In group I, the <sup>86</sup>Y-CNT construct appeared to avidly localize in the spleen and liver. In group II, spleen and liver uptake was significantly lower and a diffuse activity was evident from the i.p. cavity suggesting a relatively slow egress from the i.p. compartment into the vascular compartment. After 24 hours there was no significant difference in the accumulated activity in the spleen and liver within each group compared to the 3 hour time-point. Additionally, the kidneys of the animals in groups I and II had begun to clear the constructs. These data indicate that the clearance from the spleen and liver is slower than from the kidneys. The radioactivity in the liver of the group I animals was still significantly higher than the group II animals at both time-points evaluated. As expected for a stably chelated metal-ion species with a relatively small molecular weight, the control mixture cleared completely from group III within 3 hours. The imaged radioactivity was located primarily in the bladder (~1 %ID/g at 3 hours) and was consistent with urinary excretion of small molecules (data not included).</p>
