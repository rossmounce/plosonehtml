Three regions per tissue per animal were collected and the average %ID/g and standard deviation determined. The average %ID/g tissue per animal was then used to determine an average %ID/g per tissue per group and the standard deviation within the group values was also calculated. (b) Plot of the 24 hour biodistribution data obtained from tissue harvest, weighing and counting of organs from group I, II, and III mice.</p>
