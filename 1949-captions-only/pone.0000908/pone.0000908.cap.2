                Figure 2.  Effect of habitat fragmentation on pollination systems, floral sizes and floral rewards.Percentage of tree individuals within categories of pollination systems (A; N = 137 spp.), floral sizes (B; N = 105 spp.), and floral rewards (C; N = 124 spp.) at 10 fragments and 10 control plots of an Atlantic forest landscape, northeastern Brazil. Frequencies represented by boxes that are significantly different are indicated with asterisks: *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01; ***P&lt;0.001.
