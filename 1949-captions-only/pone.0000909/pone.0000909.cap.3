                Figure 3.  Global field power (GFP) changes as a function of the task.(A) Grand average GFP of electrical activity as a function of time vs. width of the noise gap (‘n.m.’ stands for ‘no masker’). Results of paired t-test comparisons between the conditions demonstrate the largest effects around the N100 peak latency and the similarity of the two Attend conditions. (B) Global Field Power amplitudes (±standard error of the mean) at N100 peak latency show the non-multiplicative suppression in amplitude with narrower notches during selective attention (Attended conditions vs. ignore sounds: * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, *** P&lt;0.001)
