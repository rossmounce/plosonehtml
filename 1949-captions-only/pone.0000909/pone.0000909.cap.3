Results of paired t-test comparisons between the conditions demonstrate the largest effects around the N100 peak latency and the similarity of the two Attend conditions. (B) Global Field Power amplitudes (±standard error of the mean) at N100 peak latency show the non-multiplicative suppression in amplitude with narrower notches during selective attention (Attended conditions <em>vs.</em> ignore sounds: * <em>P</em>&lt;0.05, ** <em>P</em>&lt;0.01, *** <em>P</em>&lt;0.001)</p>
