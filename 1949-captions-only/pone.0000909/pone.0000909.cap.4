                Figure 4.  Grand average ERPs to the standard tone across all conditions and stimuli show the typical attention effect: N100 amplitude increase at ~100 ms from stimulus onset during attention.Notably, the difference between attended and the ignore condition N100 amplitude is largest with narrow notch widths (e.g., ±150, ±80). The ERPs also demonstrate how the latency of N100 peak is delayed as frequency notch is narrower.
