This was done across all subjects in order to obtain prediction of GFP amplitude for the in-between stimulus types. Positive value means that the observed value was bigger than the prediction. The vertical grey bars denote subject-wise differences, sorted by size, while the horizontal black bar is the average GFP difference (n = 10 for each stimulus type). The values during Ignore task are used only as a reference, as they are zero-mean due to the comparison algorithm.</p>
