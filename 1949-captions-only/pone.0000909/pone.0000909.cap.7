                Figure 7.  Due to frequency masking, the auditory responses to both standard and target tones decrease with narrower notches (responses to standard tone shown in Figures 4 and 5).Concordantly, the detection of target tones becomes more difficult, as shown by (A) hit rate decrease and conversely by (B) reaction time increase (‘n.m.’ stands for ‘no masker’). (C) The false alarm rate did not change as a function of the stimulus.
