                Figure 1.  Var2csa is essential for IE cytoadhesion to hyaluronic acid.A. Adhesion profiles of P. falciparum infected-erythrocytes during selection on bHA. Trophozoite-stage P. falciparum FCR3-CD36 and FCR3Δvar2csa 1F1 were subjected to four rounds of selection on plastic Petri dishes coated with bHA. Mean numbers (±SD) of IE adhering per mm2 for four different fields are shown. B. FCR3-HA IE cytoadhere to CSA and HA coated to plastic. Erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum FCR3-CSA, 3D7-CSA, FCR3-CD36, FCR3Δvar2csa 1F1 and the parasites selected on HA FCR3-HA and 1F1-HA were analyzed for cytoadhesion to CSA (white bars), bHA (dark gray bars) or CD36 (light gray bars). Data are the mean number (±SEM) of IE per mm2 adhering to receptor-coated plastic Petri dishes, as determined in two independent assays in duplicate spots. C. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from ring (R) and trophozoite stage parasites (T) FCR3-CD36, FCR3-CSA BeWo DMSO, FCR3-CSA BeWo Forskolin, FCR3-HA and the HA-selected FCR3Δvar2csa clone 1F1-HA. The membrane was hybridized with a probe specific for var2csa DBL1-X. The 1F1-HA gene disruption parasite constitutively expresses a truncated, non-functional var2csa transcript [10], which explains the lower molecular weight product in these lanes.
