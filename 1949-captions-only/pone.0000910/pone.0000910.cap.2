                Figure 2.  Binding of the FCR3-HA selected parasites to HA and CSA is inhibited by soluble bovine HA and soluble CSA, but not by Streptococcus HA.A. Evaluation of the HA binding specificity of the FCR3-CD36 IE selected on HA was determined without (control) or with 200 µg/ml of different HA preparations sonicated or not in the binding medium. HA from bovine vitreous humor (bHA) and different HA from Streptococcus (sHA) were tested for their ability to inhibit IE binding to bHA. Data are the mean number (±SEM) of IE per mm2 adhering to receptor-coated plastic Petri dishes, as determined in three independent assays in duplicate spots. B. Soluble bHA and CSA cross-inhibit cytoadhesion of FCR3-HA IE to bHA as well as CSA. FCR3-HA IE were pre-incubated with 200 µg/ml soluble CSA as well as untreated or treated bHA prior to the binding assay. The ability to inhibit IE cytoadhesion to bHA (left panel) and CSA (right panel) was examined. Data are the mean number (±SEM) of IE per mm2 adhering to receptor-coated plastic Petri dishes, as determined in three (A) or two (B) independent assays in duplicate spots.
