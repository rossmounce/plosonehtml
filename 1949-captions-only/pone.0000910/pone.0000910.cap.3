Cytoadhesion of IE to BeWo cells was compared for the FCR3Δvar2csa clone 1F1 selected on BeWo cells (1F1-BeWo), the 1F1 control parasites selected on recombinant human CD36 (1F1-CD36) and the wild-type FCR3-CSA parasites. Data are the mean number (±SEM) of IE per mm<sup>2</sup> adhering to BeWo cells as determined in at least two independent assays in duplicate. B. Erythrocytes infected with <em>P. falciparum</em> 1F1-CD36 (white bars) and 1F1-BeWo (gray bars) were analyzed for cytoadhesion to CSA, CD36 (left panel), recombinant human ICAM-1 (rhICAM-1) and ICAM-1 Fc (right panel). Data are the mean number (±SEM) of IE per mm<sup>2</sup> adhering to receptor-coated plastic Petri dishes as determined in at least two independent assays in duplicate.</p>
