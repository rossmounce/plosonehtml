                Figure 4.  Anti-ICAM-1 antibody inhibits 1F1-BeWo IE binding to BeWo cells.A. and B. Binding specificity of FCR3-CSA (white bars) and 1F1-BeWo IE (gray bars) to BeWo cells was determined using various inhibitors. BeWo cells were either pre-incubated with adhesion blocking anti-ICAM-1 or anti-CD36 antibodies at 5 µg/ml (A) or pre-treated with Streptomyces hyaluronlyticus hyaluronidase (25 units/ml) or chondroitinase ABC (0.5 units/ml) for 1 h at 37°C (B). Data are the mean percentage (±SEM) of IE binding compared to the appropriate control as determined in three independent experiments.
