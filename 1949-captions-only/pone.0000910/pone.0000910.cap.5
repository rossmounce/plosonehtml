                Figure 5.  Transcriptional analysis of var genes in 1F1-CD36 and 1F1-BeWo parasite lines.Prior to selection, the FCR3Δvar2csa clonal line 1F1 bound CD36. The 1F1 parasite line was reselected on either human recombinant CD36 (top panel) or six times on BeWo cell lines (bottom panel) before var transcriptional analysis. Both 1F1-derived parasite lines express a partial, non-functional var2csa transcript as a result of the gene integration event [10]. The partial var2csa transcript is detected by primers to the 5′ part of the gene, but not to the 3′ end of the gene. The 1F1-CD36 parasite line expresses one dominant var gene, var34, and a second gene at lower level (var47). The var34 and var47 transcripts are also present in the 1F1-BeWo parasite line, plus four additional var genes (var5, var6, var7, and var51).
