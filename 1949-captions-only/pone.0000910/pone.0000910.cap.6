                Figure 6.  No specific cytoadhesion of 1F1-BeWo IE to placental syncytiotrophoblasts and no parity dependent sera recognition.A. Binding of late stage IE to syncytiotrophoblasts of normal human placenta cryosections under flow conditions at a shear stress of 0.05 Pa. Data shown are the percentage (±SD) of IE bound to the syncytiotrophoblasts versus IE bound in total as determined in three independent experiments on cryosections of two different placentas in duplicate. B and C. Recognition of IE with different binding phenotypes by sera pools of Malawian malaria exposed males (white bars), primigravid (light gray bars) and multigravid women (dark gray bars). Analysis was performed using flow cytometry (B) and fluorescence microscopy (C). Flow cytometry data shown are the mean values of the geometric mean fluorescence intensities (FI) (±SD) for the samples.
