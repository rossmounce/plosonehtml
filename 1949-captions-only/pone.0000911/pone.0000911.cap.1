                Figure 1.  A schematic diagram illustrating the role that network position can play in propagation of noise through the network.The circles in the diagram represent genes while the lines represent bi-directional interactions (like protein-protein interactions). The diagram shows how a focal node, shown in red, can affect noise produced by a perturbed node, shown in blue. The noise produced by the blue gene is represented by the blue oscillating arrows, and is dampened after passing through the red gene. Because the red gene lies on pathways between many other genes it has a large potential to buffer genetic noise.
