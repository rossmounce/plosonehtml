                Figure 2.  The relationship between environmental expression robustness and two forms of genetic robustness.The data were separated into 15 bins based on ranked environmental robustness. For each bin the mean and standard error of each form of robustness was calculated. Filled squares indicate robustness to knockouts while open squares indicate robustness to background genotype. All statistical analyses were carried out on the un-binned data.
