                Figure 3.  Correlation between residual GR and residual BR.We independently fit GR and BR to ER and performed a linear regression. Residual values of GR and BR were calculated and are shown here. The measures are significantly correlated with Spearman's œÅ of 0.15 and a Pearson's r of 0.16.
