                Figure 1.  Generation of retroviral vectors encoding E2F family members.A. Schematic representation of MINR1 retroviral vectors encoding E2F genes. B. Analysis of E2F family member expression in transiently-transfected 293T cells. 293T cells were individually transfected with empty (lane 1) or E2F1–6 retroviral plasmids (lanes 2–7), and extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed for individual E2F1–6 (top six panels) or actin (bottom panel).
