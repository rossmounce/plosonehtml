                Figure 2.  Effect of forced E2F expression on exponential growth of NIH-3T3 cells.A. NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral constructs encoding individual E2F1–6, and stained for surface expression of human mutant NGFR. B. Serial 3-fold extracts of stable empty MINR1 (lanes 4–6) or MINR1-E2F1–6 (lanes 1–3) 3T3 transductants were analyzed for E2F expression as in Figure 1. C. 2×105 of each transductant (E2F1–3, left panel; E2F4–6, right panel) was seeded and cultured in full medium with 10% serum. Cultures were counted every 24 hours, and are in thousands. Data are representative of 2 separate experiments.
