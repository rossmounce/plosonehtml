                Figure 3.  Capacity of individual E2F family members to support serum-independent growth.2Ã—105 asynchronous 3T3 transductants from exponential cultures were seeded overnight with 10% serum, then cultured in 0.1% serum for the indicated periods, and E2F protein levels (A) and live cell counts (B) were measured. The data depicted are representative of 2 separate experiments.
