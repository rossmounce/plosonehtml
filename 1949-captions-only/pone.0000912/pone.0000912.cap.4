Representative 4× fields of N54 (Ras-transformed positive control), empty vector, and E2F1–6 transductant cultures at 30 days are shown in A. The mean colony number per field (+/− SD) from 10 random fields is plotted in B. The largest colony from each transductant culture at days 3, 7 and 26 is depicted (20×) in C. The data depicted in A–C are representative of 4 separate experiments.</p>
