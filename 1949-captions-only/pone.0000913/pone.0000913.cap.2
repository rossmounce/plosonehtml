B) Distribution of Initial Slopes for HuEx [red boxplot] and U133Plus2 [blue boxplot] spiked probes. C) Local slopes as a function of concentration for HuEx [median red line and inter-quartile range shaded red] vs U133Plus2 [median blue line and inter-quartile range shaded blue]. Local slopes represent the fitted log2 fold-change for probes with true log2 fold-change of 1 as a function of the nominal concentration. D) Distribution of detection threshold for HuEx 1.0 [red boxplot] and U133Plus2 [blue boxplot] spiked probes. Detection threshold is referred to probe concentration where signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 3.</p>
