                Figure 1.  Prokaryotic taxa identified in Km3 3,000 m-deep plankton inferred from fosmid-ends and 16S rRNA detection in environmental and metagenomic libraries.Relative abundances of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes in environmental libraries are from Ref.4. For bacteria in the Km3 metagenomic library (central panel), only 16S rRNA genes whose adjacent ITS can be distinguished in size from that of E. coli were detected.
