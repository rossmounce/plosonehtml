                Figure 2.  Taxonomy of archaeal fosmids.A, Phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA genes amplified from the metagenomic library Km3. The tree was constructed by maximum likelihood using PhyML and a total of 704 non ambiguously aligned positions. Non-parametric bootstrapping was performed upon 1,000 replicates. Only bootstrap values above 50 are shown. Km3 and ALOHA water column sequences are indicated in red and blue, respectively. B, Comparative taxonomic distribution obtained by best BLAST hit (see methods) of archaeal fosmid-ends in KM3 and ALOHA deep-sea libraries [14]. Marine group I and environmental samples are non-taxonomic designations as used in databases.
