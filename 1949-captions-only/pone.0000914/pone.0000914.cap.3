                Figure 3.  Taxonomy of bacterial fosmids.A, Phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA genes amplified from the metagenomic library Km3 whose adjacent intergenic spacers differ in size from those of Escherichia coli. The tree was constructed by maximum likelihood using PhyML and a total of 1128 non ambiguously aligned positions. Non-parametric bootstrapping was performed upon 1,000 replicates. Only bootstrap values above 50 are shown. Km3 and ALOHA water column sequences are indicated in red and blue, respectively. Unc., uncultured. [*], AA0D00000000 genome sequence underway. B, Comparative taxonomic distribution of bacterial fosmid-ends by best BLAST hits in KM3 and ALOHA deep-sea libraries [14].
