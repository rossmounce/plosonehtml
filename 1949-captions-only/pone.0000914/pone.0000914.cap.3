The tree was constructed by maximum likelihood using PhyML and a total of 1128 non ambiguously aligned positions. Non-parametric bootstrapping was performed upon 1,000 replicates. Only bootstrap values above 50 are shown. Km3 and ALOHA water column sequences are indicated in red and blue, respectively. Unc., uncultured. [*], AA0D00000000 genome sequence underway.
