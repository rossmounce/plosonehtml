                Figure 1.  Schematic overview of Connector Inversion Probe (CIPer) technology.A) Synthetic oligonucleotide containing regions i) AS and ES (anchor site and extension sites): approximately 20 base pair fragments homologous to regions flanking target of interest, ii) R: restriction site for probe linearization, iii) U1 and U2: universal primer regions for inverted probe amplification. B) Target rescue through complete gap filling by a DNA polymerase and ligation-based probe circularization. C) Circular DNA enrichment through degradation of linear DNA by enzymes Exonuclease I and III, which are deactivated prior to the next step. D) Probe linearization by restriction site cleavage. E) Inverted probes are amplified with universal primers; one is biotinylated for subsequent amplicon validation. F) Amplicon validation using multiple sequencing primers.
