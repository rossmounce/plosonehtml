B) Target rescue through complete gap filling by a DNA polymerase and ligation-based probe circularization. C) Circular DNA enrichment through degradation of linear DNA by enzymes Exonuclease I and III, which are deactivated prior to the next step. D) Probe linearization by restriction site cleavage. E) Inverted probes are amplified with universal primers; one is biotinylated for subsequent amplicon validation. F) Amplicon validation using multiple sequencing primers.</p>
