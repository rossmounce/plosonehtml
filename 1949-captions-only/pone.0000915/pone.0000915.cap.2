                Figure 2.  Sequence alignments (WebLogos, http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi) of the positive strand containing conserved sequence primer regions for GP5+/6+.The height of a DNA-base height represents the relative abundance of that particular base at the position of interest; multiple bases at the same position indicate a variable site. Alignment was performed for 40 genotypes detected with the CSP-CIPer or GP5+/6+ PCR (Table 1 and Figure S3). The target region between the two primers varies between 90-100 base pairs, depending on genotype characteristics. The positive strand of the GP6+ region is the complementary sequence of the established primer, and is therefore denoted cGP6+.
