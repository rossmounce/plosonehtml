Alignment was performed for 40 genotypes detected with the CSP-CIPer or GP5+/6+ PCR (<a href="#pone-0000915-t001">Table 1</a> and <a href="#pone.0000915.s003">Figure S3</a>). The target region between the two primers varies between 90-100 base pairs, depending on genotype characteristics. The positive strand of the GP6+ region is the complementary sequence of the established primer, and is therefore denoted cGP6+.</p>
