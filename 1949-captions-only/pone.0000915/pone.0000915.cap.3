Codons marked in red are known to be subject to mutations, which are strongly correlated with ciprofloxacin resistance <a href="#pone.0000915-Lindbck1">[21]</a>â€“<a href="#pone.0000915-Unemo1">[23]</a>. The <em>gyrA</em> and <em>parC</em> mutant sequences are compared with the respective wild type sequences. The displayed pyrograms show two common mutations (S91P and D95G) in <em>gyrA</em>, and one mutation (E91G) in <em>parC</em>.</p>
