                Figure 3.  Pyrograms of Connector Inversion Probes (CIPer) used for screening of mutations conferring antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains.Amino acid codons are marked alternating blue and orange, and their positions in the coded amino acid sequence of the target enzymes (GyrA and ParC) are placed on top of the traces. Codons marked in red are known to be subject to mutations, which are strongly correlated with ciprofloxacin resistance [21]â€“[23]. The gyrA and parC mutant sequences are compared with the respective wild type sequences. The displayed pyrograms show two common mutations (S91P and D95G) in gyrA, and one mutation (E91G) in parC.
