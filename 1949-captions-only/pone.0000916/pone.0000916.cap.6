                Figure 6.  Simultaneous introduction of a cis-regulatory region in the R3-R5 cassette and an ORF in the RfA cassette.A) Experimental scheme. B) Comparison of the activity by electroporation of the indicated constructs. The weaker fluorescence observed in C is not representative. Due to mosaic expression of the transgene, only some cells express the fluorescent marker.
