The Y-axis shows the percentage of activity (% of LacZ positive cells) of tested Gateway-cloned enhancers relative to a control CMV-lacZ construct. The left most two columns were obtained in independent experiments from the other columns, restricted to Hela cells. B-D) Transient transgenesis by microinjection into <em>zebrafish</em> eggs of the indicated constructs. Left panel, lateral view, right panel, dorsal view, of 30 hour post-fertilization stage <em>zebrafish</em> embryos. No change in the intensity or localisation is observed when Gateway expression constructs are used (B, D) instead of pCS2+-based constructs (C). The numbers indicate the proportion of embryos with the shown lacZ or GFP staining.</p>
