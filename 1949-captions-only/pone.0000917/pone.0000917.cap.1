                Figure 1.  DNA fragments representing the CTV genome amplified by RT-PCR.Total RNA prepared from FS2-2-infected sweet orange leaves was used as the template for RT-PCR. Lanes 1-3, DNA amplified by 3′ primer CTV5427R and three 5′ primers: CTV5endFT36, CTV5endFVT, and FT30CTV5end, respectively; lane 4, DNA amplified by primers CTV5403F and CTV09997R; lane 5, DNA amplified by primers CTV09262F and CTV14630R; and lane 6, DNA amplified by primers CTV14469F and CTV19395R.
