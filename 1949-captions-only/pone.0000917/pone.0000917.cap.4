                Figure 4.  Schematic of CTV recombinants in the p33 ORF.The different parental sequences are represented by specific colored lines; blue (VT), red (T36) and green (T30). Recombinants with identical crossover sites are connected by brackets. Asterisks between the paired recombinants denote locations of diverged nucleotides.
