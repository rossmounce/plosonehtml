                Figure 1.  Predicted ranks of epitopes from different HIV-1 proteins.HLA-binding epitopes were predicted for HLA alleles with a low RH (HLA-B5701, HLA-B5801 and HLA-B2705) and HLA alleles with a high RH (HLA-B3503 and B5301), and their rank among all other HIV-1 epitopes was plotted. Low ranks correspond to good binding peptides. The analyses were limited to the three best-binding epitopes from each HIV-1 protein. HLA alleles with a low RH were found to have a significantly higher preference for peptides from p24 than HLA alleles with a high RH (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), while HLA alleles with a high RH had a significantly higher preference for Nef (p = 0.02). A significant difference between low and high RH HLA molecules was also observed for peptides from Vpu (p = 0.01), p17 (p = 0.02), Vif (p = 0.02), and Rev (p = 0.01), but the median ranks of the best-binding peptides from these proteins are so high that these differences are probably not physiologically important. Epitopes for HLA-B2705 are depicted as shaded circles. All predictions were based on a neural-network based predictor (NetMHC); the use of matrix methods gave similar results (results not shown). The number of amino acids in each of the HIV proteins is: p24 231, Nef 206, Env 856, Pol 947, Vpr 96, Vpu 82, Tat 101, p17 132, Vif 192, and Rev 116 amino acids.
