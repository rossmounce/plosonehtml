Low ranks correspond to good binding peptides. The analyses were limited to the three best-binding epitopes from each HIV-1 protein. HLA alleles with a low RH were found to have a significantly higher preference for peptides from p24 than HLA alleles with a high RH (<em>p</em> = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), while HLA alleles with a high RH had a significantly higher preference for Nef (<em>p</em> = 0.02). A significant difference between low and high RH HLA molecules was also observed for peptides from Vpu (<em>p</em> = 0.01), p17 (<em>p</em> = 0.02), Vif (<em>p</em> = 0.02), and Rev (<em>p</em> = 0.01), but the median ranks of the best-binding peptides from these proteins are so high that these differences are probably not physiologically important. Epitopes for HLA-B2705 are depicted as shaded circles. All predictions were based on a neural-network based predictor (NetMHC); the use of matrix methods gave similar results (results not shown). The number of amino acids in each of the HIV proteins is: p24 231, Nef 206, Env 856, Pol 947, Vpr 96, Vpu 82, Tat 101, p17 132, Vif 192, and Rev 116 amino acids.</p>
