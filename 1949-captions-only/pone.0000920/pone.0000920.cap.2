The graphs show the normalized predicted affinity of the three best-binding p24 epitopes for each HLA allele. Data were based on (A) the Caucasian RH of 27 different HLA alleles <a href="#pone.0000920-Gao1">[13]</a> and 59 individual HIV-1 clade B sequences downloaded from the Los Alamos database, (B) the Caucasian RH of 27 different HLA alleles <a href="#pone.0000920-Gao1">[13]</a> and the consensus HIV-1 clade B sequence, and (C) the African RH of 24 different HLA alleles for which non-trivial RH have been determined <a href="#pone.0000920-Gao1">[13]</a> and the consensus HIV-1 clade C sequence. The RH values represent the relative hazard of the 2-digit HLA serotype (except for HLA-B3503 and B3501 for which separate RH are known <a href="#pone.0000920-Gao1">[13]</a>), while the predicted affinities were based on prediction tools for the 4-digit HLA allele that dominates the 2-digit HLA serotype (except for HLA-A0205 and HLA-B5802, which dominate the HLA serotypes HLA-A02 and HLA-B58 in Africans, but for which no high quality prediction tools are available; when they were omitted from the analysis in panel (C), the correlation remained significant (<em>p</em> = 0.014)). Because binding motifs of HLA molecules are not always independent, we repeated the analysis by randomly selecting only one peptide, when a peptide binds more than one allele. In all cases the analysis for HIV-1 clade B and clade C remained significant (<em>p</em>&lt;0.02). All HLA-peptide binding predictions were based on matrix methods; very similar results were obtained when using NetMHC, or when we confined our analyses to the best-binding p24 peptide for each HLA type.</p>
