Experimentally verified good-binding peptides for HLA-B5701 and B5801 were used to make the low RH logo (A), while the good binders of HLA-B3501 and B5301 were used for the high RH logo (B, data from <a href="http://www.immuneepitope.org">www.immuneepitope.org</a>). These sequence logos visualize i) to what extent a position in a sequence is conserved (given by the height of a bar, i.e. the information content) and ii) which amino acids are most frequently found at a particular position (the height of each amino acid in the logo is proportional to the frequency of occurrence at that position). The information content may vary between log <sub>2</sub> 20 = 4.3, which is obtained if the same amino acid is always observed at a particular position, and zero, which is obtained if all amino acids occur at the same frequency at a position. Amino acids are colour coded according to their physicochemical characteristics. Neutral and polar, green; basic, blue; acidic, red; neutral and hydrophobic, black.</p>
