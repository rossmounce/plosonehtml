                Figure 4.  Crystal structure of a p24 dimer.Entry 1AFV from the protein data bank is shown (PDB, www.rcsb.org/pdb) [44], [45]. (A) One monomer is shown in combined cartoon and surface representation to show the extent of the surface exposed part of the epitopes. For clarity, the other monomer is shown only in cartoon representation. The epitopes located in the dimer interface are highlighted in red (IW9), yellow (TW10) and green (DV9), and are also shown in stick representation. (B) A close-up of the dimer interface. The two monomers are shown in dark blue and cyan, and the TW10 epitopes are shown in green and magenta stick representations. The hydrophobic contact between T110 from one monomer to T110 in the other monomer is indicated by a dashed line.
