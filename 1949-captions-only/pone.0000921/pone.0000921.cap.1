                Figure 1.  Expression of SMN complex components in the spinal cord of severe SMA mice.Western blot analysis of equal amounts of total proteins from the spinal cord of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3. All mice harbored two copies of human SMN2 gene together with two, one or no copies of the mouse mSmn gene. Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against the proteins indicated on the left.
