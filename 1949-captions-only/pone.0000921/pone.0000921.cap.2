                Figure 2.  Analysis of SMN levels in different tissues of severe SMA mice.(A) Western blot analysis of total proteins from spinal cord, brain or kidney of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3. Extracts normalized per cell number (equal amounts of core histones) were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against the proteins indicated on the left. (B) Western blot analysis of equal amounts of whole tissue extracts (25 µg) from spinal cord, brain or kidney of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3. Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against SMN and tubulin. (C) Analysis of SMN decrease in the spinal cord of severe SMA mice. Western blot analysis of the indicated serial dilutions (100 equals 50 µg of proteins) of whole tissue extracts from the spinal cord of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3. Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against SMN and tubulin.
