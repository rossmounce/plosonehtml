Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against the proteins indicated on the left. (B) Representative snRNP assembly reactions carried out using <em>in vitro</em> transcribed radioactive U1 snRNA and 25 µg of whole spinal cord extracts as in (A) followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Sm (Y12) antibodies. Immunoprecipitated U1 snRNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. (C) Quantification of snRNP assembly activity in spinal cord extracts from control and SMA mice of different severity. Spinal cord extracts from at least five mice for each of the indicated genotypes were analyzed by snRNP assembly and immunoprecipitation experiments as in (B). The amount of immunoprecipitated U1 snRNA was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). The values are presented as mean±SEM. <em>SMN2 high</em> refers to <em>SMN2(566)</em>.</p>
