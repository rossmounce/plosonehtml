Western blot analysis of equal amounts of whole cell extracts (25 µg) from human fibroblast cell lines of a normal individual (GM03814) and four type I SMA patients (GM00232, GM09677, GM03813 and GM03815). Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against SMN and tubulin. (B) <em>In vivo</em> snRNP synthesis in type I SMA fibroblast cell lines. The human fibroblast cell lines in (A) were pulse-labeled <em>in vivo</em> for 6 h with [<sup>32</sup>P] phosphoric acid and equal amounts of extracts from these cells (200 µg) were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Sm (Y12) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated snRNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. Known snRNAs are indicated on the left.</p>
