Immunoprecipitated snRNAs were labeled at the 3′-end with [<sup>32</sup>P] pCp and analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. Known snRNAs are indicated on the left. Note that the intensity of signal is not proportional to the abundance of individual snRNAs but reflects the efficiency with which they are labeled by T4 RNA ligase <a href="#pone.0000921-Montzka1">[52]</a>.</p>
