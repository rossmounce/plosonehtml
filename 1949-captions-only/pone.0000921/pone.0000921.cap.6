                Figure 6.  Analysis of endogenous snRNP levels in the spinal cord of severe SMA mice.Equal amounts of whole tissue extracts (200 µg) from the spinal cord of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+; mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sm (Y12) antibodies. Immunoprecipitated snRNAs were labeled at the 3′-end with [32P] pCp and analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. Known snRNAs are indicated on the left. Note that the intensity of signal is not proportional to the abundance of individual snRNAs but reflects the efficiency with which they are labeled by T4 RNA ligase [52].
