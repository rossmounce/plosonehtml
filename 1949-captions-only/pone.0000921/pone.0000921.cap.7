The relative amount of individual snRNAs immunoprecipitated from each tissue was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and expressed as a percentage of that in normal mice, which is set arbitrarily as 100%. The values from four independent experiments are presented as mean±SEM (*p&lt;0.05). Normal (black bars); carrier (dark grey bars); severe SMA (light grey bars).</p>
