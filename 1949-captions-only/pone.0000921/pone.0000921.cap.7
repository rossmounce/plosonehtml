                Figure 7.  Quantification of endogenous snRNP levels in tissues of severe SMA mice.Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Sm (Y12) antibodies from whole tissue extracts (200 µg) from either spinal cord, brain or kidney extracts of normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+), carrier (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/−) and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3 were carried out as in Figure 6. The relative amount of individual snRNAs immunoprecipitated from each tissue was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and expressed as a percentage of that in normal mice, which is set arbitrarily as 100%. The values from four independent experiments are presented as mean±SEM (*p&lt;0.05). Normal (black bars); carrier (dark grey bars); severe SMA (light grey bars).
