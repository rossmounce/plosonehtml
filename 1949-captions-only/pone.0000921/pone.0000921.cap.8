                Figure 8.  Analysis of endogenous U1 and U11 snRNA levels in the spinal cord of severe SMA mice.(A) Northern blot analysis of four increasing concentrations (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 µg) of total RNA from whole spinal cord extracts of five normal (SMN2+/+;mSmn+/+) and five severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn−/−) mice at postnatal day 3 with probes specific for the RNAs indicated on the left. (B) The intensity of signal of individual RNAs at each concentration was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and values in the severe SMA mice were expressed as a percentage of the corresponding ones in normal mice, which are set arbitrarily as 100%. The values are presented as mean±SEM. Normal (black bars); severe SMA (light grey bars).
