(B) The intensity of signal of individual RNAs at each concentration was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and values in the severe SMA mice were expressed as a percentage of the corresponding ones in normal mice, which are set arbitrarily as 100%. The values are presented as mean±SEM. Normal (black bars); severe SMA (light grey bars).</p>
