Left column, shifted forward; middle column no shift, right column, Shifted back. Gray Shading, normal night; blue shading, forward shifted night; red shading, backward shifted night. On the clock, each dot represents one birth of the mice in that group, the vector emanating from the radius in each clock represents by direction the average time of birth and by magnitude, the strength of that average. Below each circadian clock is a linear timeline of births, with each dot representing a single labor from mice in that group. Each segment represents one hour. For each clock, the P value indicates the likelihood of the observed clustering of births if the births are randomly distributed.</p>
