Transferrin conjugated to Alexa 594 (red) was used as marker of the early endosomes (B and E). While the plasmid DNA is colocalized with transferrin within 15 minutes (C, yellow, arrows), after 30 minutes, the plasmid DNA not was colocalized with these vesicles (F, arrow). (Gâ€“H): J774 cells were incubated with fluorescent DNA for 5 minutes (G) and 15 minutes (H); and cells immunostained for Rab5 (red), another marker of early endosomes. Plasmid DNA not was colocalized with Rab 5. Confocal images.</p>
