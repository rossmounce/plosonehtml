LysoTracker Red was used as a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes (B, E and H). Plasmid DNA was not colocalized with LysoTracker Red which had a very weak signal (C, F and I). DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize nuclei (I and J). Note that the inhibition of acidification observed was not the result of fluorocrome interference, since we use plasmid DNA without labeling and there was no labeling with LysoTracker Red (J). (J): Unlabeled plasmid DNA plus LysoTracker Green. (K): Lysotracker Red without DNA.</p>
