                Figure 3.  Intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA.Confocal images of J774 cells (A–I) and peritoneal macrophages (J–L) incubated with DNA-Alexa 488 (green, A, D, G and J) for 72 h (A–C; J–L), 96 h (D–F) and 120 h (G–I). The LysoTracker Red was used as a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes (B, E, H and K). Plasmid DNA did not colocalize with LysoTracker Red's weak signal (C, F, I and L), and after 96 h and 120 h, fluorescent DNA was concentrated around the nuclei (F and I). DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize nuclei (C, F, I and L). In I cells are also seen in the Z axis.
