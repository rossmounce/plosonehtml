The LysoTracker Red was used as a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes (B, E, H and K). Plasmid DNA did not colocalize with LysoTracker Red's weak signal (C, F, I and L), and after 96 h and 120 h, fluorescent DNA was concentrated around the nuclei (F and I). DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize nuclei (C, F, I and L). In I cells are also seen in the Z axis.</p>
