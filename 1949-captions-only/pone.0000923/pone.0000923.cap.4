Texas Red dextran was used as lysosomal marker (B). Plasmid DNA was incubated with dextran and significant colocalization was observed (C, arrow 1). (Dâ€“F): J774 cells were incubated with DNA-Alexa 488 for 24 hours and the cells immunostained for LAMP I (red, lysosomal marker-E). Plasmid DNA did not colocalize with LAMP I (F, arrow 2).</p>
