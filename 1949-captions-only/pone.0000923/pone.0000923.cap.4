                Figure 4.  Intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA.Confocal images of peritoneal macrophages incubated with DNA-Alexa 488 (green, A) for 24 hours. Texas Red dextran was used as lysosomal marker (B). Plasmid DNA was incubated with dextran and significant colocalization was observed (C, arrow 1). (Dâ€“F): J774 cells were incubated with DNA-Alexa 488 for 24 hours and the cells immunostained for LAMP I (red, lysosomal marker-E). Plasmid DNA did not colocalize with LAMP I (F, arrow 2).
