                Figure 5.  Visualization of the intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA.Confocal images of spleen-derived dendritic cells (SDCs) incubated with DNA-Alexa 488 (green) for 1 hour (A–B). LysoTracker Red was used as marker for late endosomes and lysosomes. After the uptake the majority of the vesicles with plasmideal DNA were not colocalized with LysoTracker Red (A and B, -red, arrows 1). However, some colocalization was detected (B, yellow, arrows 2). (C–E): Visualization of the inhibition of the acidification of late endosomes/lysosomes by the plasmid DNA. Confocal images of spleen-derived dendritic cells (SDCs) incubated with DNA-Alexa 594 (red) and DQ Ovalbumin simultaneously (C: 1 min; D: 24 h and E: 72 h). DQ Ovalbumin is a self-quenched conjugate of ovalbumin that exhibits bright green fluorescence upon proteolytic degradation. It's was used as tool to determined inhibition of the acidification of late endosomes/lysosomes by the plasmid DNA. At 1 minute DQ Ovalbumin was degraded (green color) and the plasmid not was captured yet (not red color). After 24 h several colocalization points was observed (D-arrow 1) and after 72 h only some colocalization was detected (E-arrow 1), suggesting that DNA (red color, E-arrow 2) inhibited the acidification of the vesicles, prejudicing the OVA proteolytic degradation.
