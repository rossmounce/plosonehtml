                Figure 6.  DNA treatment impairs KLH antigen presentation.Peritoneal macrophages were incubated with DNA (20 µg) 72 h, 48 h, 24 h or 0 h prior to the treatment with KLH (100 µg). After KLH treatment (24 h), the peritoneal macrophages were fixed and CD4 T cells specific for KLH were added to the culture. Proliferation was measured after 72 h. Concanavalin A (40 µg/ml) was used as positive control. * p&lt;0.05 (OneWayANOVA).
