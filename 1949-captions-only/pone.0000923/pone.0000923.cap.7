                Figure 7.  Uptake of DNA was independent of TLR9 receptor and recruitment of Myd88 was not affected.TLR9 KO cells were incubated with DNA-Alexa 594 (red-A and B) for 1 hour. The DNA was internalized by these cells. Raw cells (C–E) expressing GFP-tagged MyD88, were incubated with DNA-Alexa 594 (red-D) for 1 hour. Colocalization of GFP-Myd88 and fluorescent DNA was observed in vesicles (Arrows, yellow fluorescence–E).
