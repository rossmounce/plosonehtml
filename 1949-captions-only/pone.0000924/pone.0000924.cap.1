                Figure 1.  Strategy for amplification and labeling of pathogen-specific target.The one-tube RT-PCR reaction includes three stages: A) Reverse transcription reaction to produce first strand cDNA for viral targets (vRNA); B) Low temperature (56°C), exponential amplification of target and C) High temperature (68°C), linear amplification to product single-strand, biotin-labeled target. Target is labeled by incorporation of biotin-14-dCTP during amplification or by the use of biotinylated reverse primers.
