                Figure 5.  Comparison of assay sensitivity with primer pools 1A, 1B, and 1C.Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.p.) DNA, at 1 ng/ul, was serially diluted and amplified with primer pools 1A (3 M.p. amplicons), 1B (2 M.p. amplicons), and 1C (1 M.p. amplicon). Panels in (A) illustrate the sensitivity obtained with the 3 pools at M.p. DNA dilutions of 1:1,000 (left) and 1:10,000 (right). Average signal intensities in picoamps for each set of amplicon probes (vertical bars) are shown at the left. The horizontal bar within graphs indicates the assay cutoff (mean 3Â±SDM). The PCR amplicons analyzed for each pathogen are listed in panel (B) and the three M.p. amplicons are indicated by thick underline.
