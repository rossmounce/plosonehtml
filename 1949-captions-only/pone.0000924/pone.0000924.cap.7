                Figure 7.  Example of sensitivity and specificity tests for multiple-organism assays.Ten genotypes of interest (adenovirus 4, B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, coronavirus 229E, influenza A, influenza B, M. pneumoniae, parainfluenza Type 1, respiratory syncytial virus, and S. pyogenes) were simultaneous amplified in two PCR reactions (5 DNA and 5 RNA targets) that were combined and hybridized on the same chip. Assays were run with pathogen nucleic acid dilutions of: (A) 1 to 20 (1:20), (B) 1 to 200 (1:200), and (C) 1 to 2,000 (1:2000) that were based on the sample concentrations listed in Table 2. Vertical bars indicate average genotype probe signals in picoamps and horizontal bars indicate the assay cutoff (mean of negative control probes plus three standard deviations of the mean). Asterisks indicate the 10 target genomes that were amplified.
