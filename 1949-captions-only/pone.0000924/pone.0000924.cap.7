Assays were run with pathogen nucleic acid dilutions of: (A) 1 to 20 (1:20), (B) 1 to 200 (1:200), and (C) 1 to 2,000 (1:2000) that were based on the sample concentrations listed in <a href="#pone-0000924-t002">Table 2</a>. Vertical bars indicate average genotype probe signals in picoamps and horizontal bars indicate the assay cutoff (mean of negative control probes plus three standard deviations of the mean). Asterisks indicate the 10 target genomes that were amplified.</p>
