                Figure 8.  Hybridization and detection of viral and bacterial targets on microarrays.Biotinylated, single-strand target is hybridized to complementary probes on the microarray (A, B and C) and labeled by the addition of streptavidin (SA)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (for electrochemical detection) or streptavidin-Cy3/Cy5 (for fluorescent detection).
