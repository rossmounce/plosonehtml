The scanned area (left images, red squares) is shown on a bright field microscopy view of the freeze dried cell. Iron is located within the cytosol in vesicles of 200 nm size or more (Control). In cells exposed to iron alone Fe, and to AMT+Fe, a larger number of iron-rich structures are observed in cell bodies. In cell bodies of cells exposed to AMT alone, only a basal level of diffused iron is observed and almost no iron-rich structures. Min-max range bar units are arbitrary for potassium and zinc distributions. For iron distribution the maximum threshold values in micrograms per squared centimeter are shown for each color scale. Scale bars = 1 µm.</p>
