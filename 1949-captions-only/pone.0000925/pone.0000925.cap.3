                Figure 3.  Nano-imaging of potassium, iron, and zinc in neurite outgrowths.Each series of images are representative of the entire cell population for each condition (control, 1mM AMT and/or 300 µM FeSO4). The scanned area (left images, red squares) is shown on a bright field microscopy view of the freeze dried cell. Iron is located within dopamine vesicles of 200 nm size or more in control cells with a large number of Fe-dopamine structures in Fe exposed cells. Iron concentration is close to the limit of detection in neurites of AMT cells. Min-max range bar units are arbitrary for potassium and zinc distributions. For iron distribution the maximum threshold values in micrograms per squared centimeter are shown for each color scale. Scale bars = 1 µm.
