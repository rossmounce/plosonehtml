                Figure 4.  Nano-imaging of potassium, iron, and zinc in distal ends.Each series of images are representative of the entire cell population for each condition (control, 1mM AMT and/or 300 µM FeSO4). The scanned area (left images, red squares) is shown on a bright field microscopy view of the freeze dried cell. Iron is located within dopamine vesicles of 200 nm size or more (Control, and Fe conditions). Iron concentration is close to the limit of detection in distal ends of AMT, and AMT+Fe cells; only a basal level of Fe is observed. Min-max range bar units are arbitrary for potassium and zinc distributions. For iron distribution the maximum threshold values in micrograms per squared centimeter are shown for each color scale. Scale bars = 1 µm.
