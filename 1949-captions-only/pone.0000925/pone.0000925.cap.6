                Figure 6.  Cellular iron and zinc concentrations (µg/g dry mass; mean±SD; n = 6), obtained by PIXE quantitative micro-analysis.The data are the mean of six independent analyses performed on areas containing several hundred of cells for each condition of culture. The inhibition of dopamine synthesis (AMT, and AMT+Fe) results in a decrease of total iron concentration, while zinc concentration is not changed, suggesting a specific role of dopamine in iron homeostasis.
