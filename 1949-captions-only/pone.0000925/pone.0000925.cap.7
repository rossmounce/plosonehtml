                Figure 7.  Sub-cellular iron quantitative distribution in cell bodies, neurite outgrowths, and distal ends(ng/cm2 ; meanÂ±SD; n = 4 to 6), obtained through synchrotron X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe analysis shows that iron content is decreased particularly in neurite outgrowths and distal ends after AMT exposure (AMT and AMT+Fe), indicating that the decrease of total iron concentration is related to the reduction of the number of iron-dopamine neurovesicles.
