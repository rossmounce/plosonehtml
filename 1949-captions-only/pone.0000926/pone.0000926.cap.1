PBMC were <em>in vitro</em> stimulated with different antigens, PPD (A), ESAT-6 (C) and HBHA (E) and the IFN-γ concentrations were measured in 96 h cell culture supernatants. The horizontal dotted lines represent the cut-off for positive values as determined by ROC curves analysis, whereas the horizontal filled lines represent the medians of the results. ROC curves established for each antigen are represented on the right panels (PPD, B; ESAT-6, D; HBHA, F). The filled lines represent the curve established for LTBI compared to CTRL, whereas the dotted lines are those established for TB compared to CTRL. *, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; ***, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
