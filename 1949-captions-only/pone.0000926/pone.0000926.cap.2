                Figure 2.  Comparison between the HBHA-induced IFN-γ concentrations in recently and in remote M. tuberculosis infected LTBI subjects.Blood samples were collected from LTBI subjects during the first two years (recent) or after two years (remote) of their TST conversion. Their PBMC were in vitro stimulated with HBHA, and the IFN-γ concentrations were measured in 96 h cell culture supernatants. No significant difference in the IFN-γ concentrations measured in the two groups was noted. The horizontal dotted line indicates the positivity cut-off of the test, and the horizontal filled lines indicate the medians.
