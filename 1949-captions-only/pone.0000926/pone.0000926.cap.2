Their PBMC were <em>in vitro</em> stimulated with HBHA, and the IFN-γ concentrations were measured in 96 h cell culture supernatants. No significant difference in the IFN-γ concentrations measured in the two groups was noted. The horizontal dotted line indicates the positivity cut-off of the test, and the horizontal filled lines indicate the medians.</p>
