                Figure 3.  Correlations between the IFN-γ concentrations induced by different mycobacterial antigens.Results obtained for LTBI are represented on the left panels (A, C), and those obtained for TB are on the right panels (B, D). The degree of correlation between the in vitro-induced IFN-γ concentrations by the different mycobacterial antigens is represented for PPD and HBHA (A and B) and for ESAT-6 and HBHA (C and D). The dotted lines indicate the positivity cut-off for each test.
