                Figure 1.  Time-course of VO2 (L/min) while exercising at 62% for 90 minutes followed by exercise to exhaustion at 86% of VO2max during three CytoMax (C) trials and two G trials.The three C trials and two G trials were randomly ordered. Because no differences existed between trials, the data from the three C trials and two G trials were averaged. Data are means±SE. No difference existed between drinks. * significantly different from rest (p&lt;0.01). † significantly different from steady state exercise (p&lt;0.01). ‡ significantly different from VO2 during HI (p&lt;0.05).
