                Figure 2.  Time-course of respiratory exchange ratio (RER = VCO2/VO2) while exercising at 62% for 90 minutes followed by exercise to exhaustion at 86% of VO2max during three C trials and two G trials.The three C trials and two G trials were randomly ordered. Because no differences existed between trials, the data from the three C trials and two G trials were averaged. Data are means±SE. No difference existed between drinks. * significantly different from rest (p&lt;0.05). † significantly different from steady state exercise with the exception of minutes 5 and 10 (p&lt;0.05). ‡ significantly different from HI (p&lt;0.05).
