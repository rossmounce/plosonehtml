                Figure 4.  Time-course of blood lactate while exercising at 62% for 90 minutes followed by exercise to exhaustion at 86% of VO2max during three C trials and two G trials.The three C trials and two G trials were randomly ordered. Because no differences existed between trials, the data from the three C trials and two G trials were averaged. Data are means±SE. No difference existed between drinks. * significantly different from rest. For beverage G, only 5, 10, &amp; 15 min time points significantly different from rest. For C, all time points indicated are different from rest. † significantly different from steady state exercise (p&lt;0.05). ‡ significantly different from blood lactate during HI (p&lt;0.05).
