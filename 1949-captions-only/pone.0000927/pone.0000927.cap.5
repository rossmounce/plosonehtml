                Figure 5.  Time-course of CO2 production (13CO2 appearance in expired air) while exercising at 62% for 90 minutes followed by exercise to exhaustion at 86% of VO2max during three C trials and two G trials.The three C trials and two G trials were randomly ordered. * significantly different from G-glu (p&lt;0.05). † significantly different from all other substrates (p&lt;0.05). ‡ G-glucose significantly different from C-lac (p&lt;0.05). Data are means. SE were omitted for the sake of clarity.
