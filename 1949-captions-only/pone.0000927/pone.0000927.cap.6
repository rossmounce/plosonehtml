                Figure 6.  Time-course of the cumulative recovery of 13CO2 in expired air while exercising at 62% for 90 minutes followed by exercise to exhaustion at 86% of VO2max during three C trials and two G trials.The three C trials and two G trials were randomly ordered. § cumulative recovery of lactate different from cumulative recovery from G-glu (p&lt;0.05). ¥ cumulative recovery lactate different from cumulative recovery from glucose from both drinks (p&lt;0.01). * cumulative recovery different from cumulative recovery from glucose from both drinks and fructose from G (p&lt;0.01). † cumulative recovery different from cumulative recovery from glucose and fructose from both drinks (p&lt;0.05). ‡ time point different from all other time points (p&lt;0.01). Data are means±SE.
