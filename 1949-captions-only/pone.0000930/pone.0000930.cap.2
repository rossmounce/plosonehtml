                Figure 2.  Stoichiometry of p65/p50 and IKKβ/p65 proteins (A), and RELA/NFKB1 and IKKβ/RELA mRNAs (B).Results are presented for the PFC of alcoholics (n = 15) and control subjects (n = 15) as mean±SD. Significance of differences between groups was evaluated by Mann Whitney U-test (A, p65/p50), covariance by multiple regression analysis (A, IKKβ/p65, covariate age; age×group interaction), or Student's t-test (B). * P&lt;0.05.
