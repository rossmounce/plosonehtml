Latent factors were activated for binding to DNA by treatment with 0.6% DOC (DOC+) that dissociated IκB inhibitory protein from complexes with NF-κB, thus allowing to measure the total DNA-binding. Total NF-κB activity consisted of the constitutively active and DOC-activated DNA binding activities. The specificity of DNA-protein complexes was assessed by competition with wild type-κB (wt) or mutant-κB (m) oligonucleotides. Upper sequence-specific complexes I and II consisted of NF-κB and p50 homodimer, respectively, as demonstrated previously <a href="#pone.0000930-Bakalkin1">[24]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000930-Bakalkin2">[47]</a>. The lower complex III showed no DNA-binding sequence specificity and was probably formed by Ku protein <a href="#pone.0000930-Bakalkin3">[48]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000930-Bakalkin4">[49]</a>. For the upper image, film was exposured with a gel for longer time than for the lower one. (B) Representative picture of the constitutively active (DOC-) and total (DOC+) κB–binding activities in the PFC of control subjects and alcoholics. Lanes 3 (subject 13C) and 15 (subject 3A), only weak or no complexes were formed (see <a href="#pone-0000930-t001">Table 1</a> for the description of subjects).</p>
