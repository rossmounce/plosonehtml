                Figure 3.  κB–binding factors in the PFC identified by EMSA.(A) The constitutively active κB-DNA binding activity was determined by incubation of tissue extracts with labeled κB-oligonucleotide followed by treatment with 0.03% DOC solution (DOC-) that did not affect DNA-protein complex formation and was used as a control. Latent factors were activated for binding to DNA by treatment with 0.6% DOC (DOC+) that dissociated IκB inhibitory protein from complexes with NF-κB, thus allowing to measure the total DNA-binding. Total NF-κB activity consisted of the constitutively active and DOC-activated DNA binding activities. The specificity of DNA-protein complexes was assessed by competition with wild type-κB (wt) or mutant-κB (m) oligonucleotides. Upper sequence-specific complexes I and II consisted of NF-κB and p50 homodimer, respectively, as demonstrated previously [24], [47]. The lower complex III showed no DNA-binding sequence specificity and was probably formed by Ku protein [48], [49]. For the upper image, film was exposured with a gel for longer time than for the lower one. (B) Representative picture of the constitutively active (DOC-) and total (DOC+) κB–binding activities in the PFC of control subjects and alcoholics. Lanes 3 (subject 13C) and 15 (subject 3A), only weak or no complexes were formed (see Table 1 for the description of subjects).
