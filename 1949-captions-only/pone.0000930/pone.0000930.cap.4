No significant difference was found between slopes in the alcohol and control group. (B) p65 and p50 protein levels (15 control subjects: P = 0.01; 15 alcoholics: P = 0.06) and (C) <em>RELA</em> and <em>NFKB1</em> mRNA levels (15 control subjects: P&lt;0.0001; 15 alcoholics: P&lt;0.0002) correlate in the PFC.</p>
