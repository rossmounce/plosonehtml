                Figure 4.  Correlations between DNA-binding activity, protein and mRNA levels.(A) Constitutively active NF-κB DNA binding correlates with IKKβ protein levels in the PFC of alcoholics (n = 13; P = 0.002) and control subjects (n = 11; P = 0.007). No significant difference was found between slopes in the alcohol and control group. (B) p65 and p50 protein levels (15 control subjects: P = 0.01; 15 alcoholics: P = 0.06) and (C) RELA and NFKB1 mRNA levels (15 control subjects: P&lt;0.0001; 15 alcoholics: P&lt;0.0002) correlate in the PFC.
