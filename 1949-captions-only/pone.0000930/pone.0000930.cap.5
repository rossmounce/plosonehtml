                Figure 5.  κB elements in genes differentially expressed in alcoholics.Frequencies of occurrence of the “NF-κB”- and “p50 homodimer”-subtypes of κB binding sites in 270 and 209 genes downregulated and upregulated in alcoholics, respectively, and 1164 control genes (Table S1). (A,B) Matrices from the JASPAR database (http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/jaspar20​05/jaspar_db.pl) used to identify “NF-κB” (A) and “p50 homodimer” (B) subtypes of κB binding sites. Both NF-κB and p50 homodimer bind to the “NF-κB” subtype of κB elements with high affinity and specificity whereas p50 homodimer has higher affinity for more symmetric “p50 homodimer”-subtype of κB binding sites [51], [52]. The matrix logos provide visual representation profiles of nucleotide conservation in κB elements. The maximal conservation amounts are 2 bits for each position. Higher conservation indicates increased biological importance for a base. (C, D). Frequencies of occurrence of the “NF-κB”- (C) and “p50 homodimer”- (D) subtypes of κB binding sites in 270 and 209 genes downregulated and upregulated in alcoholics, respectively, and in 1164 control genes (Table S1). Significance of differences between upregulated, downregulated and control genes in the frequency of occurrence of genes with κB elements were evaluated with Chi-square test (df = 2). Pairwise comparison of the up- with downregulated genes, the upregulated with control genes, and the downregulated with control genes was performed with Chi Square test (df = 1). ** P&lt;0.01, * P&lt;0.05.
