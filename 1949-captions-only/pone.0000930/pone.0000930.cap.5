(A,B) Matrices from the JASPAR database (<a href="http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/jaspar2005/jaspar_db.pl">http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/jaspar20​05/jaspar_db.pl</a>) used to identify “NF-κB” (A) and “p50 homodimer” (B) subtypes of κB binding sites. Both NF-κB and p50 homodimer bind to the “NF-κB” subtype of κB elements with high affinity and specificity whereas p50 homodimer has higher affinity for more symmetric “p50 homodimer”-subtype of κB binding sites <a href="#pone.0000930-Chen1">[51]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000930-ChenPark1">[52]</a>. The matrix logos provide visual representation profiles of nucleotide conservation in κB elements. The maximal conservation amounts are 2 bits for each position. Higher conservation indicates increased biological importance for a base. (C, D). Frequencies of occurrence of the “NF-κB”- (C) and “p50 homodimer”- (D) subtypes of κB binding sites in 270 and 209 genes downregulated and upregulated in alcoholics, respectively, and in 1164 control genes (<a href="#pone.0000930.s001">Table S1</a>). Significance of differences between upregulated, downregulated and control genes in the frequency of occurrence of genes with κB elements were evaluated with Chi-square test (df = 2). Pairwise comparison of the up- with downregulated genes, the upregulated with control genes, and the downregulated with control genes was performed with Chi Square test (df = 1). ** P&lt;0.01, * P&lt;0.05.</p>
