In cells with dominant NF-κB this adaptation results in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription. (B) Alcohol acts upstream of an unidentified protein kinase that modulates DNA-binding of the p50 homodimer. This results in hypophosphorylation of p50 and downregulation of p50 homodimer DNA-binding. In control individuals the p50 homodimer inhibits gene transcription acting through κB binding sites in cells in which it prevails over NF-κB. In alcoholics, downregulation of the p50 homodimer eliminates transcriptional repression leading to upregulation of κB-mediated transcription. Dysregulation of the NF-κB/p50 homodimer-dependent gene transcription contributes to cellular neuroplastic adaptations and neurodegeneration.</p>
