                Figure 6.  Model for the molecular adaptations in the NF-κB system in the PFC in alcoholics.(A) Chronic alcohol intake inhibits RELA gene transcription and induces alterations in stoichiometry of RELA/NFKB1 mRNAs and p65/p50 proteins, resulting in downregulation of NF-κB DNA-binding. In cells with dominant NF-κB this adaptation results in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription. (B) Alcohol acts upstream of an unidentified protein kinase that modulates DNA-binding of the p50 homodimer. This results in hypophosphorylation of p50 and downregulation of p50 homodimer DNA-binding. In control individuals the p50 homodimer inhibits gene transcription acting through κB binding sites in cells in which it prevails over NF-κB. In alcoholics, downregulation of the p50 homodimer eliminates transcriptional repression leading to upregulation of κB-mediated transcription. Dysregulation of the NF-κB/p50 homodimer-dependent gene transcription contributes to cellular neuroplastic adaptations and neurodegeneration.
