Raw fluorescence (RF) is an inverse index of cAMP levels. The change in cAMP production was assessed using the fractional decrease in RF (FDRF) = (No Forskolin−Forskolin)/(No Forskolin). (a) Mouse platelet RF is comparable in the absence of forskolin [t(6) = 0.99; p = 0.36] but significantly different between groups (GroupxStimulus:[F(1,12) = 7.56;p = 0.018]) in the presence of forskolin [t(6) = −2.62; p = 0.040]. (b) Mouse platelet FDRF shows reduced cAMP induction in FX platelets [t(6) =  3.46; p = 0.014]. (c) Mouse cortex RF is comparable between groups in the absence [t(4) = 1.22;p = 0.29] or presence [t(4) = −1.92;p = 0.13] of forskolin. (d) Mouse cortex FDRF shows reduced FX cAMP induction [t(4) = 3.01; p = 0.04]. Error bars are SEM.</p>
