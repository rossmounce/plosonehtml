                Figure 2.  cAMP production is decreased in FX fly.Head membranes from wildtype, FX, FXR+, FXR++ flies were stimulated with forskolin and levels of cAMP were measured. Raw fluorescence (RF) is an inverse index of cAMP levels. The change in cAMP production was assessed using the fractional decrease in RF (FDRF) = (No Forskolin−Forskolin)/(No Forskolin). (a) RF-based cAMP measures in the fly head (Control n = 10, FX n = 3, FXR+ n = 6; FXR++ n = 6 sets of 20 heads) are comparable between groups in the absence of forskolin [F(3,21) = 1.96; p = 0.15], but not its presence [F(3,21) = 6.23;p = 0.003], since RF intensity in FX flies is larger than the others [t(21) = −4.10;p = 0.000]. (b) Fly head FDRF shows reduced FX cAMP induction relative to control membranes [FDRF:t(21) = 3.85;p = 0.001] and to the FX flies rescued with a single or multiple transgenes [FXR+FDRF:t(21) = 3.23;p = 0.004; FXR++FDRF:t(21) = 4.13;p = 0.000]. Error bars are SEM.
