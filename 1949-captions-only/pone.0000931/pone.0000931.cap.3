Raw fluorescence (RF) is an inverse index of cAMP levels. The change in cAMP production was assessed using the fractional decrease in RF (FDRF) = (No Forskolin−Forskolin)/(No Forskolin). (a) Neurons (MAP2, green) are present among cells (Hoechst stain, nuclei in blue) in 9 week FX cultures. (b) Extracts of human neural cells were immunoblotted with antibodies to FMRP and actin. FX cells (FX) have reduced levels of FMRP compared to 3 controls (control 1, 2, 3). Similar levels of actin are detected in each sample. (c) Human neural cell RF (2 Controls, each with n = 3; FX, n = 3) is comparable between groups in forskolin's absence [t(6) = 0.82; p = 0.44] but FX cAMP production is lower than controls in the presence of forskolin [RF: t(6) = −3.40; p = 0.015]. (d) Human neural cell FDRF was reduced in FX [t(6) = 3.43; p = 0.01]. Error bars are SEM for FX and pooled SEM for controls.
