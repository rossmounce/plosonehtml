                Figure 1.  Mean distance of the sites of bites in relation to the position of the heated wire.Test: the wire was presented at 36°C and the background at 33°C. Control: both, the wire and the background were kept at 33°C. Each bar represents the mean value plus the standard error of the number of bites perfomed over the wire (green bar) and at different distances from it by 14 insects along a period of 10 min after the first bite occurred.
