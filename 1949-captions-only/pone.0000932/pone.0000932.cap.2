                Figure 2.  Sample records of the distance from an initial sequence of bites to the linear thermal source, performed by insects in an assay in which the linear source was 3Â°C warmer than the background.a, Sample record corresponding to a single insect; black circles represent direct contacts with the heated wire. b, The distribution of bites performed by several insects, showing the location of the spots contacted in consecutive biting attempts. Each sequence represents approximately one minute.
