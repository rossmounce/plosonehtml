The green channel shows staining for HERG-<em>myc</em>, the red channel shows staining for FLAG-KCNE; the merged photos show the combination. Scale bar, 10 Î¼m, fluorescence micrographs were exposed for equal amount of time within each wavelength. The left side photomicrograph shows the visible light phase pictures with lines drawn across a cell to indicate the plane of analysis for B. (B) Densitometry of KCNE and HERG signals across diameter of the cell as indicated by the arrows from A-Phase pictures performed with ImageJ software. The X-axis is the scanned cellular distance of each cell in pixels, and Y-axis indicates the relative fluorescence intensity for each channel in arbitrary units. Abbreviations used are as follows: PM, plasma membrane; G, Golgi apparatus; NE, nuclear envelope; N, nucleus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
