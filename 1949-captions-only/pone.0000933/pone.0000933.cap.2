                Figure 2.  Subcellular distribution of KCNE1 and KCNE2 relative to HERG.(A) Immunofluorescence micrographs of HEK293 cells co-transfected with indicated KCNE proteins and HERG. The green channel shows staining for HERG-myc, the red channel shows staining for FLAG-KCNE; the merged photos show the combination. Scale bar, 10 μm, fluorescence micrographs were exposed for equal amount of time within each wavelength. The left side photomicrograph shows the visible light phase pictures with lines drawn across a cell to indicate the plane of analysis for B. (B) Densitometry of KCNE and HERG signals across diameter of the cell as indicated by the arrows from A-Phase pictures performed with ImageJ software. The X-axis is the scanned cellular distance of each cell in pixels, and Y-axis indicates the relative fluorescence intensity for each channel in arbitrary units. Abbreviations used are as follows: PM, plasma membrane; G, Golgi apparatus; NE, nuclear envelope; N, nucleus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
