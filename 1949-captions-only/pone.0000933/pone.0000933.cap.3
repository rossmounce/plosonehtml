Upper 2 rows show cells stained after permeabilization (KCNE1 micrographs exposed at 1.5× higher gain than KCNE2). Lower 2 rows show cells stained without permeabilization. (KCNE1 micrographs exposed at 3.3× higher gain than KCNE2). Animation of 3-D reconstruction of KCNE distribution relative to ER staining may be seen in supporting animation files <a href="#pone.0000933.s001">Animation S1</a> (KCNE1-calnexin) and <a href="#pone.0000933.s002">Animation S2</a> (KCNE2-calnexin). (B) Densitometry of KCNE and calnexin (ER) signals across diameter of the cell as indicated by the arrows from panel A-Phase pictures (permeabilized) performed with ImageJ software. The X-axis is the scanned cellular distance of each cell in pixels, and Y-axis indicates the relative fluorescence intensity for each channel in arbitrary units. (C) Lower magnification of HEK-HERG cells transfected with KCNE1 or KCNE2 (left panels permeabilized and right panels non-permeabilized: micrographs exposed at the same gain and exposure time for quantitative comparison). (D) Immunoblots of total KCNE and tubulin loading control from cell lysates (top gels) and surface proteins isolated by NHS-biotin labeling and precipitation (lower gel). Tubulin serves as negative control for surface labeling and NaKATPase as positive control for surface labeling in lower panels. (E) Densitometry analysis of the efficiency of surface presentation of KCNE proteins expressed as the amount of surface KCNE divided by the total cellular KCNE normalized for loading with tubulin [surface KCNE/(input KCNE/tubulin)] (comparison across groups normalized to the value of KCNE2-WT).
