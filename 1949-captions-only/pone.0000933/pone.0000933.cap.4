                Figure 4.  Brefeldin A trafficking block enhances KCNE2 association with HERG.(A) Immunoblots of HERG and KCNE proteins from total cell lysates (top gels, Input) and from HERG-myc co-immunoprecipitation (lower gels, IP HERG-myc). Untreated, control cells on the left and BFA-treated (36 hours) cells on the right. (B) Densitometry analyses of results. Left panel shows the relative change in KCNE abundance after BFA treatment normalized to control values. Middle panel shows the degree of KCNE association with HERG (KCNE co-IP/[total cellular KCNE/tubulin]). Right panel shows the relative change in KCNE association with HERG after BFA treatment normalized to control values. Filled columns represent untreated control values and hatched columns represent values after BFA treatment. Densities in left and middle plots are normalized to tubulin and in right plot normalized to co-immunoprecipitated HERG. (asterisks indicate significant difference from KCNE2-WT: *: p&lt;0.05; **: p&lt;0.005; and ***: p&lt;0.001).
