Gels show results from cells transfected with KCNE1 (top), KCNE2 (middle), and GFP as control (bottom). Lane 1 shows proteins from whole cell lysates. Media was subjected to FLAG-KCNE immunoprecipitation prior to immunoblot either before (pre-ultra, lane 2) or after (post-ultra, lane 3) ultracentrifugation. Lane 4 shows material from the ultracentrifuge pellet. (B) Similar analysis as in A, but for KCNE2 only, with lane showing cell lysate proteins, and lane 2 showing ultracentrifuge pellet fraction. The post-ultracentrifugation supernatant was subjected to FLAG-KCNE immunoprecipitation and loaded directly (lane 3) or after boiling for 5 minutes in sample-loading buffer (lane 4). (C) Endoglycosidases analysis of cellular (top gel) and extracellular (bottom gel) KCNE2 proteins is shown in immunoblots. Lane 1 shows cell proteins untreated; lane 2 proteins incubated in enzyme buffer without enzyme; lane 3 proteins treated with PNGase F; lane 4 proteins sequentially treated with PNGase F then Endo H (PE); lane 5 proteins treated with Endo H, and lane 6 proteins sequentially treated with Endo H then PNGase F (EP).</p>
