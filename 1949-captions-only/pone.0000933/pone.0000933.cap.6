On the top, the peptide sequence shows the location of the individual ions that are labeled in the spectrum. The bottom of the figure shows the whole sequence of KCNE2 with detected peptide underlined and transmembrane region in blue. Abbreviations used are as follows: m/z = (MW+nH<sup>+</sup>)/n where m/z = the mass-to-charge ratio marked on the abscissa of the spectrum; MW = the molecular mass of the sample, n = the integer number of charges on the ions, H = the mass of a proton = 1.008 Da. Ions labeled <em>b</em> in green color are fragment ions for each amino acid residue having the charge retained on the N-terminal fragment at the CO-NH bonds cleaved, and the ions labeled <em>y</em> in black color having the charge on the C-terminal fragment. The mass difference between two adjacent b ions, or y ions, is indicative of a particular amino acid residue.</p>
