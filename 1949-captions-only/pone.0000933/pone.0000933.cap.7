KCNE1 and HERG exhibit slower trafficking rates (represented as a thin yellow arrow) with more prolonged times in the ER and Golgi thereby allowing for greater opportunity to co-assemble. Rapid transport of KCNE2 to the cell surface is accompanied by exosomes export and appearance of extracellular proteins that may exist as monomers or oligomers. (B) An illustration of possible differences in transmembrane segment length between KCNE1 and KCNE2 with more favorable energetic environment for KCNE2 in thicker cholesterol-rich plasma membrane.</p>
