                Figure 3.  Development of the urban growth simulation, shown here on a small lattice of L = 32.a) At time t = 0 there is some population n(0) in each cell. b) Time t = 4. c) Time t = 8. d) By time t = 16, intermittent spikes of large population are clustered together in an otherwise sparsely-populated lattice.
