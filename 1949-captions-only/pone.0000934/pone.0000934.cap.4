                Figure 4.  Rank-size distributions and lognormal fits (dashed blue lines) for all ‘counties’ (2 administrative levels below the nation) of the world, all populated places of the USA, and all municipalities of Switzerland.All three samples are fit well by a lognormal over four orders of magnitude in population, particularly in the bodies of the distributions. Key indicates sample sizes.
