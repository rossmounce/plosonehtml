                Figure 5.  Cumulative probability distributions of nighttime light clusters for continental and sub-continental regions.Key indicates number of clusters in each region (total N = 68,530). The body of each distribution is fit well by a lognormal (not shown). The tails (largest clusters) are fit well by power laws (not shown). Slopes of the scaling regions are all significantly different from the Zipf's law expectation of âˆ’1.
