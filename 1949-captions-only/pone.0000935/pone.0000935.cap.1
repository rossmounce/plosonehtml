                Figure 1.  Binary expression pattern of IL-2 in human Th cells.Histogram overlay of IL-2 expression in peripheral human CD4+ T cells after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin for 5 h, anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or peptide-loaded APC for 14 h. IL-2 expression was detected by intracellular (ic) staining. (a) Constant PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 ng/ml were used. The color codes for ionomycin concentrations are: 100 ng/ml dark blue; 200 ng/ml light blue; 300 ng/ml red; 500 ng/ml green; 1 µg/ml dark red. (b) Constant PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin concentrations (1000 ng/ml) were used in the presence of 2–10 nM CsA. The color codes for CsA concentrations are: no CsA dark red; 2 nM green; 3 nM light blue; 5 nM red; 10 nM dark blue. (c) Anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies coated Facs-tubes were used for stimulation of memory T cells in presence of 2–50 nM CsA. The color codes for CsA concentrations are: no CsA dark red; 2 nM green; 5 nM red; 10 nM blue; 50 nM black. (d) Facs tubes were coated with the following concentrations of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies (ratio 1:4): 0.075 and 0.3 µg/ml dark blue; 0.15 and 0.6 µg/ml red; 0.3 and 1.2 µg/ml green; 0.5 and 2.0 µg/ml dark red. (e) CMV-peptide-loaded APC were used in the presence of 2–50 nM CsA. The color codes for CsA concentrations are: no CsA dark red; 2 nM green; 5 nM red; 10 nM dark blue; 50 nM black. APC loaded with an unspecific CMV-peptide were used as a stimulation control (grey-filled). Results are representative for at least two independent experiments.
