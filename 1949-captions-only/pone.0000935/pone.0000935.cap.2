                Figure 2.  Sorted IL-2 secreting and non-secreting Th cells differ in their IL-2 mRNA level.Human Th cells were sorted for IL-2 secretion 2 h after activation with PMA/ionomycin. The IL-2 mRNA levels were analyzed in IL-2 secreting and non-secreting cell populations using qRT-PCR. The results were normalized to unstimulated control cells. One representative experiment with three parallel samples is shown.
