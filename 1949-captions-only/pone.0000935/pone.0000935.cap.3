                Figure 3.  Nuclear translocation of NFATc2 but not NF-κB is binary.(a) The amounts of NF-κB (p65) and NFATc2 were measured in isolated nuclei of memory Th cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA-) using flow cytometry. Before preparation of the nuclei, cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin or left unstimulated in the presence or absence of 4 nM CsA for 2 h. One representative experiment out of three is shown. (b) Nuclei of sorted IL2 secreting cells were stained for NFATc2 after pre-incubation of memory Th cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA-) with either DMSO (control), 2 nM or 4 nM CsA and subsequent stimulation with PMA/ionomycin for 2 h. The diagram shows a similar MFI in the histogram overlay of the three samples for one representative experiment out of two.
