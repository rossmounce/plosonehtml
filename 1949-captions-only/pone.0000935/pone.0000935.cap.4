                Figure 4.  Either all-or-no NFATc2 is dephosphorylated per cell.(a) Immunodetection of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated NFATc2 after activation of human memory Th cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA-) for 1 h with either constant concentration of PMA (10 ng/ml) and increasing concentration of ionomycin (50–1000 ng/ml) or PMA/ionomycin (10 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml) in presence of the depicted CsA concentrations (3–50 nM). (b) Immunodetection of NFATc2 in cell populations after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in the presence of 4 nM CsA for 2 h and subsequent sorting for IL-2 secreting and non-secreting cells. Unsorted cells served as controls.
