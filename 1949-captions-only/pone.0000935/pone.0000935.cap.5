IFN-γ expression was detected by intracellular (ic) and CD69 by surface staining. (a) Constant PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 ng/ml were used. The color codes for ionomycin concentrations are: no ionomycin black; 100 ng/ml dark blue; 200 ng/ml light blue; 300 ng/ml red; 500 ng/ml green; 1000 ng/ml dark red. (b) Constant PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin concentrations (1000 ng/ml) were used in the presence of 2–50 nM CsA. The color codes for CsA concentrations are: no CsA dark red; 2 nM green; 3 nM light blue; 4 nM brown; 5 nM red; 10 nM dark blue; 50 nM black. The unstimulated control samples are shown as light grey areas. One representative experiment out of two is shown.</p>
