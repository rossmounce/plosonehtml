                Figure 6.  Mathematical modeling of cytokine expression.(a) Response curves of transcription factor activity versus activating signal (ionomycin), are shown modeled as a Hill function (see Methods). Regulation of NFAT activity by a single phosphorylation site would result in a hyperbolic response (Hill coefficient n = 1), while cooperative dephosphorylation of multiple sites would give rise to sigmoid responses (n&gt;1). (b) Simulated patterns of cytokine expression. The ionomycin stimulus increases from blue to red in steps of 0.125, running from 0.125 to 0.75 for n = 1, and steps of 0.5, running from 0.5 to 3.0 for n&gt;1. With increasing steepness of the response curve, cytokine induction changes from gradual to binary.
