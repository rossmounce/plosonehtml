First, at the molecular level, the dephosphorylation of 13 Serine residues of NFATc2 by calcineurin (CaN) leads to a conformational switch of an NFATc2 molecule from an inactive to an active conformation that exposes a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and allows NFATc2 to enter the nucleus <a href="#pone.0000935-Okamura1">[24]</a>. Second, at the cellular level, the nature of cooperativity of a minimum of 7 dephosphorylation sites (Hill coefficient n = 6) can account for a steep response curve and, consequently, a quantitative translocation of all the NFATc2 per cell by stimulation above a threshold with ionomycin. Third, at the population level, there are only cells with all-or-none NFATc2 in the nuclei.</p>
