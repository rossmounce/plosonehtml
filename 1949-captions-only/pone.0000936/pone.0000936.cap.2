(C–D) for “out-sample fit”. (A) Comparison of the model time course and experimental time course of Smad2 phosphorylation with 24 hours TGF-β treatment. The experimental data is normalized from <a href="#pone-0000936-g001">Figure 1A</a> in Lin <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0000936-Lin1">[4]</a>. (B) Effect of type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542. Cells were treated with TGF-β for 30 minutes, then were washed out TGF-β at 30th minute and added SB431542 to prevent rephosphorylation of Smad2. The experimental data is normalized from <a href="#pone-0000936-g001">Figure 1C</a> in Lin <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0000936-Lin1">[4]</a>. (C) Comparison of the model time course with an experimental time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 after TGF-β treatment (80 pM, 2 ng/ml). The western-blot data reported by Inman <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#pone-0000936-g001">Fig. 1A</a>, top panel) is quantified with Scion Image software <a href="#pone.0000936-Inman1">[29]</a>. (D) Subcellular location of Smad2 after TGF-β treatment (80 pM). The concentrations shown here refer to the local concentrations in cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>
