                Figure 2.  Comparison of experimental analysis and simulation results from the model obtained by constraint-based modeling method.(A–B) for “in-sample fit”. (C–D) for “out-sample fit”. (A) Comparison of the model time course and experimental time course of Smad2 phosphorylation with 24 hours TGF-β treatment. The experimental data is normalized from Figure 1A in Lin et al. [4]. (B) Effect of type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542. Cells were treated with TGF-β for 30 minutes, then were washed out TGF-β at 30th minute and added SB431542 to prevent rephosphorylation of Smad2. The experimental data is normalized from Figure 1C in Lin et al. [4]. (C) Comparison of the model time course with an experimental time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 after TGF-β treatment (80 pM, 2 ng/ml). The western-blot data reported by Inman et al. (Fig. 1A, top panel) is quantified with Scion Image software [29]. (D) Subcellular location of Smad2 after TGF-β treatment (80 pM). The concentrations shown here refer to the local concentrations in cytoplasm and nucleus.
