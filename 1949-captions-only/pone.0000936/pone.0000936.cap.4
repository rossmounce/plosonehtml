(C) The model has a bad prediction for “out-sample fit”. (A) Comparison of the model time course and experimental time course of Smad2 phosphorylation with 24 hours TGF-β treatment. Experimental data is the same as described in <a href="#pone-0000936-g002">Figure 2A</a>. (B) Effect of type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542. Experimental data is the same as described in <a href="#pone-0000936-g002">Figure 2B</a>. (C) Effects on Smad2 phosphorylation by different doses of TGF-β.</p>
