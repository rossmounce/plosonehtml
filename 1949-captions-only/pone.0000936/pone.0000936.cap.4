                Figure 4.  Comparison of experimental analysis and simulation results from the model obtained by only fitting the time course data.(A–B) The model has been over-fitted for “in-sample fit”. (C) The model has a bad prediction for “out-sample fit”. (A) Comparison of the model time course and experimental time course of Smad2 phosphorylation with 24 hours TGF-β treatment. Experimental data is the same as described in Figure 2A. (B) Effect of type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542. Experimental data is the same as described in Figure 2B. (C) Effects on Smad2 phosphorylation by different doses of TGF-β.
