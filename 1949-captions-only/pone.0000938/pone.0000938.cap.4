                Figure 4.  (a) Relationship between the local species abundance (populations of each species within each plot at the time considered) in 1966 and 1996.Data shown are for one set of estimated actual abundances, a range of r2 values for 100 estimates are reported [r2 = 0.037â€“0.058, p&lt;0.001]. (b) Relationship between the meta-community spread (number of plots where a species is present) in 1966 and in 1996. (c) Relationship between the meta-community species abundance (total number of individuals for each species across all sites) in 1966 and 1996; The plots b and c are shown on a logarithmic scale.
