(b) Relationship between the meta-community spread (number of plots where a species is present) in 1966 and in 1996. (c) Relationship between the meta-community species abundance (total number of individuals for each species across all sites) in 1966 and 1996; The plots b and c are shown on a logarithmic scale.</p>
