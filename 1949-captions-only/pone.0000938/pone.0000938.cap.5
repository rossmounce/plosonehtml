                Figure 5.  Relative (a and b, wpi) and absolute weights of evidence (c and d, Î”wpi) of five derived predictors [dispersal model (Disp), regeneration type (Reg), growth form (Gf) and meta-community spread (Spread) and meta-community species abundance (Abundance) for explaining frequency of extinction (a and c) and frequency of colonisation (b and d).Wpi are considered as relative, not absolute because they will be &gt;0 even if the predictor has no explanatory importance due to random factors [49], [53]. Absolute weight of evidence from random permutation gives an unbiased estimation of the weight of evidence after accounting for random artefacts.
