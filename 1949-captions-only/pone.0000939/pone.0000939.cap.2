                Figure 2.  The relationship between female preference and relative average male gamete mutation load, controlling for relative average male somatic quality (A, B) or male quality, controlling for relative average male gamete mutation load (C, D) for different mutation rates.Mutation probability increased either as a linear (A, C) or as a cubic (B, D) function of male age. Relationships based on eight replicate simulations of 320,000 cycles across all ten age classes (N = 80). Based on partial correlation analyses, all relationships are significant except when the maximum mutation rate was 0.01. For clarity, individual data points were ranked by the independent variable and placed in bins of ten. The data points on the graphs represent the averages of the individual data points with each bin. The regression lines are based on all 80 data points for a given mutation rate. Constant (solid line), max = 0.01 (dotted line), max = 0.05 (dashed line), max = 0.1 (dashed and dotted line).
