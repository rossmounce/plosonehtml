                Figure 3.  Effect of female preference on male gamete mutation load across all age classes for linear (A) and cubic (B) mutation probability functions.Mutation load represents the meanÂ±1 standard error among eight replicate simulations after 320,000 cycles. Mutation load is significantly lower when females exhibit a preference in all cases.
