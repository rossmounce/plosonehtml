<h4>The Data and Sample</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>We used secondary data from the 2002 National Survey of American Families (NSAF) data set (a survey of the economic, health, and social characteristics of children and adults under the age of 65, and their families). Given that our study involved secondary analysis of survey data, institutional ethics review was not required. The sample for the NSAF is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized population under age 65 in 13 states and the rest of the nation. The 13 states account for over half of the U.S. population and represent a broad array of government programs, fiscal capacity, and demographic characteristics <a href="#pone.0000940-AbiHabib1">[57]</a>. The sample consisted of a random-digit dial survey of households with telephones (main frame), and a supplemental area probability sample of households without telephones, and an oversample of low-income households with children. All households screened as low-income and as having children were administered an extended interview. Higher-income households with children and all household without children but with a resident under the age of 65 were subsampled at varying rates prior to in-depth questioning.</p>
<h5>Data collection.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec1.p1"></a><p>Data collection was conducted from February 2002 through October 2002. Interviewing was conducted in two stages: first, a five-minute screening interview was conducted to determine household eligibility for extended interview, followed by a 27- to 50-minute extended interview. Households selected for an extended interview were sent a brochure describing the study, and received a telephone call at which time they gave their oral consent to participate in the study. If initial contact with a household was not successful, that household was sent another letter reminding them to expect a phone call, and a contact number to call if they preferred to set up an appointment. Telephone interviewers conducted all interviews using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. For households without telephones, in-person interviewers provided cellular telephones to connect them with interviewing centers <a href="#pone.0000940-AbiHabib1">[57]</a>. In households with children under the age of 18, up to two children were sampled for in-depth study; one under the age of 6 and another between the age of 6 and 17. Interviews were conducted with the most knowledgeable adultâ€”in a majority of cases this adult was a mother, and hereafter referred to as the parent. For this study, data on 9,645 6-to-11 year-olds were used. Children who were reported to have pre-existing developmental health problems were excluded from the final sample to prevent confounding. Descriptive statistics of the sample and measures are reported in <a href="#pone-0000940-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
