                Figure 1.  Infusion of MSC lysate provides a survival trend in an animal model of FHF.Sprague-Dawley rats were administered lethal intraperitoneal injections of a hepatotoxin. Animals were treated with i.v. injections of MSCs, or MSC lysates from the same cell mass (2Ã—106 cells). Controls received vehicle or NIH 3T3-J2 fibroblast components. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Gal-N administered rats treated with cell transplants or lysates. Time points of interventions are stated above survival plots. Results are cumulative data of two independent experiments (N = 8 per each group) using different batches of MSCs. P-value determined by Log Rank Test.
