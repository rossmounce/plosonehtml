(B) Dose response of animal survival 72 hours after liver failure induction as a function of MSC mass from which MSC-CM was derived. Controls received vehicle or fibroblast conditioned medium (fibroblast-CM). Time points of interventions are stated above survival plots. Results for both panels are cumulative data of two independent experiments using different batches of MSC-CM (N = 8 per each group). <em>P</em>-value determined by Log Rank Test.</p>
