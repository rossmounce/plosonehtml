                Figure 2.  MSC-CM reverses FHF in a cell mass-dependent manner.(A) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Gal-N administered rats treated with concentrated MSC-CM. (B) Dose response of animal survival 72 hours after liver failure induction as a function of MSC mass from which MSC-CM was derived. Controls received vehicle or fibroblast conditioned medium (fibroblast-CM). Time points of interventions are stated above survival plots. Results for both panels are cumulative data of two independent experiments using different batches of MSC-CM (N = 8 per each group). P-value determined by Log Rank Test.
