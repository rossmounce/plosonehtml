(A) Serum biomarkers of liver injury, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase preceding and 24 hours after treatment with a MSC-EB (n = 5) or an acellular-EB (n = 3). Due to mortality, n = 1 in the acellular group after treatment. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Gal-N administered rats treated with EBs. Time points of interventions are stated above survival plots. Each result for (B) was an independent experiment using different batches of MSCs. <em>P</em>-value determined by student's t-test analysis for panel (A). <em>P</em>-value determined by Log Rank Test for panel (B).</p>
