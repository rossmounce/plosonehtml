(A) Densiometry of spotted antibody array results. Data are presented as spot intensity relative to the negative control and normalized to positive control. (B) Pie chart showing cluster analysis of MSC secreted proteins based on reported function. MSC-CM was fractionated over a heparin-agarose column into heparin bound and unbound fractions. (C) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Gal-N administered rats treated with the (+) heparin MSC-CM and (âˆ’) heparin MSC-CM. Time points of interventions are stated above survival plots. Results for (C) are cumulative data of two independent experiments using different batches of MSC-CM (N = 8 per each group). <em>P</em>-value determined by Log Rank Test.</p>
