Variant A4136G creates an <em>Nla III</em> site and after digestion results in two bands of 43 bp and 107 bp. The heteroplasmic mutation has three bands (43 bp, 107 bp and 150 bp) as shown. Similarly other variants e.g. A9194G (creates <em>Hha I</em> site), A10149T (creates <em>Dde I</em> site) and T11916A (creates <em>Rsa I</em> site) and all result in 3 bands after digestion and separation on 12% PAGE. The homoplasmic mutations should yield only 2 bands lacking the wildtype band after separation on PAGE.</p>
