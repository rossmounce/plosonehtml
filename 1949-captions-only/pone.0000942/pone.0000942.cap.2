                Figure 2.  Kyte-Doolittle Hydropathy Plot of wild type and mutated NADH Dehydrogenase Subunits (ND1).Mutation T3866C (Isoleucine-Valine) showing a significant decrease in hydrophobicity at amino acid position 187 in the ND1 protein. SPLIT 4.0 plots predicting Tran membrane regions and alterations in them due to mutation T3866C. Black line is indicative of wild type whereas red line indicates the mutated polypeptide.
