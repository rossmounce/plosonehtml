The amino acid sequences were aligned by Clustal√óprogramme. Accession numbers for the mtDNA sequences used for alignment are: Human (NC_001807), Gorilla (NC_001645), Chimpanzee (NC_001643), Orangutan (NC_001646), Bovine (NC_006853), Dog (NC_002008), Pig (NC_000845), Rat (NC_001665), and Mouse (NC_005089).</p>
