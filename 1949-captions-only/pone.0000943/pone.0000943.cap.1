In this case the visually perceived position <em>x<sub>V</sub></em> will be the common position <em>s</em> perturbed by visual noise with width <em>σ<sub>V</sub></em> and the auditory perceived position will be the common position perturbed by auditory noise with width <em>σ<sub>A</sub></em>. Right: Alternatively, two distinct causes may be relevant, decoupling the problem into two independent estimation problems. The causal inference model infers the probability of a causal structure with a common cause (left, <em>C</em> = 1) versus the causal structure with two independent causes (right, <em>C</em> = 2) and then derives optimal predictions from this. We introduce a single variable <em>C</em> which determines which sub-model generates the data.</p>
