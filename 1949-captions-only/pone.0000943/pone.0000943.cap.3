                Figure 3.  Reports of causal inference.a) The relative frequency of subjects reporting one cause (black) is shown (reprinted with permission from [15]) with the prediction of the causal inference model (red). b) The bias, i.e. the influence of vision on the perceived auditory position is shown (gray and black). The predictions of the model are shown in red. c) A schematic illustration explaining the finding of negative biases. Blue and black dots represent the perceived visual and auditory stimuli, respectively. In the pink area people perceive a common cause.
