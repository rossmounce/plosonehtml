B: Comparison of gene amplification, mRNA expression and protein expression in 6 head and neck cancer cell lines. Gene amplification and mRNA expression were previously examined (9). Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Cul1 expression was used as a loading control. C: Accumulation of Aur-A protein by proteasome inhibitor, ZLLL. Cancer cells were treated with or without 25 ÂµM ZLLL for 6 h. Expression of Aur-A was examined by Western blot analysis. Cul1 expression was used as a loading control. D: Half-life of Aur-A in cancer cells. Cancer cells were treated with CHX for indicated time. Expression of Aur-A was examined by Western blot analysis. Time zeros were normalized for equal amounts of Aur-A rather than equal amount of protein extracts to directly compare the two half-lives. Cul1 expression was used as a loading control.</p>
