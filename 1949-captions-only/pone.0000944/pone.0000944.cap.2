B: Schematic domain structure of Aur-A wild type (wt) and two deletion mutants (ΔN and ΔC) are shown. The position of two degradation motifs, A-box and D-box, are indicated. C: Aur-A-ΔN or -ΔC mutant was co-transfected with Cdh1 in 293T cell. D: A-box mutated (<sup>46</sup>RVL<sup>48</sup> -&gt;AVA) or D-box mutant (<sup>371</sup>RPML<sup>374</sup> -&gt;APMA) Aur-A was co-transfected with or without Cdh1. E: Ser51 was replaced by alanine (S51A) or aspartic acid (S51D). Each wt, S51A and S51D mutant Aur-A was co-transfected with or without Cdh1 or Cdc20. F: Sensitivity of ubiquitylation of Aur-A wt and S51 mutants were assayed <em>in vitro</em>. APC immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc27 antibody from the HeLa cell lysates was subjected to the <em>in vitro</em> ubiquitylation assay as described in Materials and methods. The reaction was terminated at 60 min. IVT-Aur-A (arrow) was used as a substrate. “Aur-A<sup>Ub</sup>” indicates ubiquitylated Aur-A.</p>
