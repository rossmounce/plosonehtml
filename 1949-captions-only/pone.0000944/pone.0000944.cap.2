                Figure 2.  Phosphorylation on Ser51 inhibits APCCdh1-mediated degradation.A: FLAG-tagged Aur-A and Xpress-tagged Aur-B were co-transfected with or without HA-tagged Cdc20 or Cdh1 in 293T cell. B: Schematic domain structure of Aur-A wild type (wt) and two deletion mutants (ΔN and ΔC) are shown. The position of two degradation motifs, A-box and D-box, are indicated. C: Aur-A-ΔN or -ΔC mutant was co-transfected with Cdh1 in 293T cell. D: A-box mutated (46RVL48 -&gt;AVA) or D-box mutant (371RPML374 -&gt;APMA) Aur-A was co-transfected with or without Cdh1. E: Ser51 was replaced by alanine (S51A) or aspartic acid (S51D). Each wt, S51A and S51D mutant Aur-A was co-transfected with or without Cdh1 or Cdc20. F: Sensitivity of ubiquitylation of Aur-A wt and S51 mutants were assayed in vitro. APC immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc27 antibody from the HeLa cell lysates was subjected to the in vitro ubiquitylation assay as described in Materials and methods. The reaction was terminated at 60 min. IVT-Aur-A (arrow) was used as a substrate. “Aur-AUb” indicates ubiquitylated Aur-A.
