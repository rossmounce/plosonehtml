Aur-B has several degradation motifs similarly to Aur-A. B: Corresponding amino acid sequence of A-box between Aur-A and -B is shown. C: Aur-B with mutated amino acids in A-box (<sup>31</sup>KEP<sup>33</sup> -&gt;PSN, ASN, PSA, KSP, KAP and PEN) was co-transfected with or without Cdh1. D: Summary of mutated sites and their results are shown.</p>
