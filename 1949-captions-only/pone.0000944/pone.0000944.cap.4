Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a phosopho-specific antibody against Ser51 of Aur-A followed by immunoblottoing (IB) analysis with a monoclonal antibody to Aur-A in wt and S51 mutants of Aur-A transfected 293T cells. B: Phosphorylation of Ser51 in HeLa cells with or without Noc treatment. C: Phosphorylation on Ser51 in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were released from Noc-induced prometaphase arrest and collected at the indicated times. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with phospho-S51 Aur-A, Aur-A, phospho-T288 Aur-A, phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) and Cul1 antibodies (upper panel). Graph shows expression level of Aur-A, phospho-S51 Aur-A, phospho-T288 Aur-A and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (lower panel). D: Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by western blot analysis in S51D and K/R (kinase inactive) mutants transfected 293T cells. Phosphorylation on Thr288 was examined to demonstrate that K/R affected as a dominant negative. E: Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by western blot analysis in wt and K/R mutant transfected 293T cells with nocodazole (noc) and okadaic acid (OA).</p>
