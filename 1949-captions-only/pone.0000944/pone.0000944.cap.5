Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a phosopho-specific antibody against Ser51 of Aur-A followed by immunoblottoing (IB) analysis with a monoclonal antibody to Aur-A in head and neck cancer cells. Gene amplification and mRNA expression were previously examined <a href="#pone.0000944-Tatsuka1">[9]</a>. B: Constitutive phosphorylation on Ser 51 in head and neck cancer cells. Indicated cancer cell lines were released from noc-induced prometaphase arrest and collected in 4 h. Cells had almost completely exited from mitosis. Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a phosopho-specific antibody against Ser51 of Aur-A followed by immunoblottoing (IB) analysis with a monoclonal antibody to Aur-A. Cul1 was used as a loading control and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) was used as a marker for mitosis. C: Expression of Ser51 phosphorylated Aur-A protein is examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a phosopho-specific antibody against Ser51 of Aur-A followed by immunoblottoing (IB) analysis with a monoclonal antibody to Aur-A in cells in normal oral mucosal tissue and 9 head and neck cancer tissues. ÃŸ-Actin expession was used as a loading control.</p>
