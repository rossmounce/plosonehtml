HeLa cells were transiently transfected with wt and S51D Aur-A. After 48 h of transfection, cells were synchronized by noc arrest and mitotic shake-off, released into fresh medium, harvested at the indicated times. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with FLAG, cyclin-A, p27, phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) and Cul1 antibodies. B: Half-life of wt and mutants (S51A, S51D and KR) of Aur-A transfected 293T cells (left panel). Cells were treated with CHX for indicated time. Right panel shows Aur-A/Cul1 ratio measured by densitometry. C: Effect of S51D mutant Aur-A expression on cell transformation in BALB/<em>c</em> 3T3 A31-1-1 cells. FLAG-tagged wt, S51A and S51D mutants Aur-A were transfected with or without H-Ras (G12V). Expression of wt, S51A and S51D mutants Aurora-A and H-Ras are confirmed by Western blot analysis (left panel). After 2 weeks of culture, the dishes were fixed with ethanol and stained with Giemsa solution (middle panel). Quantification of the number of transformed foci as determined using standard criteria (right panel). Error bars represent the s.d.</p>
