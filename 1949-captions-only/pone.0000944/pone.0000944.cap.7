                Figure 7.  Schematic model of Aur-A overexpression in cancer.During mitosis, Aur-A is phosphorylated on Ser51 in normal cells. At mitotic exit, Aur-A is de-phosphorylated by PP2A and ubiquitylated by APCCdh1. On the other hand, Aur-A is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser51 in cancer cells. Therefore, Aur-A can not be ubiquitylated and consequently accumulated in cancer cells.
