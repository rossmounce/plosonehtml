In this display, each row represents a specific gene, and each column a sample from the Wnt-treatment time course experiment. A red color indicates an increase in transcript levels of a given gene relative to the pre-treatment (time zero) level and green indicates decreased transcript levels relative to time zero. Grey represents missing or excluded data. The legend bar maps color versus magnitude of changes in transcript levels relative to the pre-treatment level. A version of this figure with every row labeled by gene name is available as Supplemental <a href="#pone.0000945.s001">Figure S1</a>. B) Shows expression patterns of Wnt-responsive genes encoding DNA binding proteins/transcription factors and transcriptional cofactors. C) Shows expression patterns of Wnt-responsive genes encoding proteins with direct roles in the Wnt signaling system. D) Shows expression patterns of Wnt-responsive genes encoding extracellular signaling molecules. E) Shows expression of Wnt-responsive genes encoding cell surface molecules and receptors.</p>
