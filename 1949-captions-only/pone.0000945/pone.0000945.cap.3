                Figure 3.  A possible dual role for Wnt in the maintenance of stem cell niches.We hypothesize that Wnt may promote self-renewal directly by raising nuclear ÃŸ-Catenin levels in stem cells and indirectly by activating the BMP inhibitor Gremlin 2 in nearby fibroblasts, thereby blocking target BMPs from promoting differentiation and loss of self-renewal capacity.
