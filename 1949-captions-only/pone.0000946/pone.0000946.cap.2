                Figure 2.  pre-miRNAs display a characteristic conservation profile.Typically, pre-miRNAs are highly conserved, but the conservation drops off rapidly at their borders and is often lower in the middle region, which corresponds to the loop. (A) Conservation profile of known pre-miRNA hsa-mir-1-1 in the UCSC Genome browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/). (B) Cumulative conservation profile of known mouse pre-miRNAs (from miRBase 8.2) conserved in human. Pre-miRNA regions were extended by 50 bp on each end and length-normalized to the range [-50,50]. The y-axis shows the fraction of analyzed sequences that are conserved at the position indicated on the x-axis.
