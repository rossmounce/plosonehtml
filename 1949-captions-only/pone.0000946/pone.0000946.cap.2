(A) Conservation profile of known pre-miRNA <em>hsa-mir-1-1</em> in the UCSC Genome browser (<a href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/</a>). (B) Cumulative conservation profile of known mouse pre-miRNAs (from miRBase 8.2) conserved in human. Pre-miRNA regions were extended by 50 bp on each end and length-normalized to the range [-50,50]. The y-axis shows the fraction of analyzed sequences that are conserved at the position indicated on the x-axis.</p>
