Black bars indicate which regions of conservation profiles that correspond to predicted hairpins. Secondary structures of candidate pre-miRNAs were predicted by MFOLD v3.1 <a href="#pone.0000946-Mathews1">[63]</a>. Conservation profiles were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (<a href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/</a>). The candidates show canonical secondary structures and conservation profiles.</p>
