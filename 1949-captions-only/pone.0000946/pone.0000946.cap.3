                Figure 3.  Predicted secondary structures and conservation profiles of five candidate pre-miRNA genes.The figure shows five examples from our predictions. Black bars indicate which regions of conservation profiles that correspond to predicted hairpins. Secondary structures of candidate pre-miRNAs were predicted by MFOLD v3.1 [63]. Conservation profiles were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/). The candidates show canonical secondary structures and conservation profiles.
