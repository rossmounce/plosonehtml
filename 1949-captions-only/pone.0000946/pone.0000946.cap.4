Bars indicate what fraction of a particular set of regions that are conserved at a given distance. For each region, we only noted the most evolutionary distant species/clade at which we found it to be conserved. E.g. the leftmost gray bar spans 4%, indicating that 4% of known mouse miRNAs were found to be conserved in opossum, but not in chicken, frog or fish. The requirement for conservation was that regions should align over at least 37 nt and their predicted secondary structures have an RNAdistance score â‰¤48 (see <a href="#s3">Methods</a>).</p>
