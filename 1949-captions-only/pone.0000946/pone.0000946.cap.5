Each sequence was searched for putative transcription factor binding sites using the familial binding profile for homeobox transcription factors from the JASPAR database <a href="#pone.0000946-Vlieghe1">[72]</a> at a score threshold of 80%. (A) Sequences were partitioned into four non-overlapping sets (I-IV) as indicated in the Venn diagram. (B) Cumulative distributions of number of predicted binding sites per 100 bp for sequence sets I-IV. The distributions for candidate pre-miRNAs (blue, green) are more similar to the distribution for known pre-miRNAs (red) than to the distribution for HCNEs not predicted to be pre-miRNAs (gray). (C) Solid bars show the average number of predicted sites per 100 bp over each of sequence sets I-IV. Shaded bars show results for corresponding control sets: controls for dinucleotide composition generated by, for each sequence, constructing a first-order Markov chain and using it to generate a new sequence (diagonal shading lines), and controls for single nucleotide composition generated by randomly shuffling the bases in each sequence (vertical shading lines). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.</p>
