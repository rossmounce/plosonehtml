                Figure 6.  CAGE expression data supports miRNA predictions.Cumulative distribution of number of CAGE tags mapping to known intergenic pre-miRNA genes or within 500 bp upstream (red), and corresponding distributions for predicted intergenic pre-miRNAs (blue), randomly selected intergenic genomic regions of the same size (green) and intergenic regions from the CRS (black). Known and predicted pre-miRNAs tend to have more overlapping or upstream CAGE tags than either of the control sets. The inset shows a magnification for tags counts of 0–40.
