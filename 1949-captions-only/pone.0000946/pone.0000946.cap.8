Ideally, sensitivity should be maximized while 1-specificity should be minimized. From the figure, we can see that 1-specificity increases in three stages. At the beginning of the second increasing stage, sensitivity has already entered into a slowly increasing stage. We therefore chose this point (x = 50%, vertical line) as the proportion of positive entries to use in the training set.</p>
