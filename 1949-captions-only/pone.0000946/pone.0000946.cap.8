                Figure 8.  Effects of varying the proportion of positive entries in the training set for SVM1.Proportions of positive examples that were correctly classified (sensitivity, red line) and negative examples that were incorrectly classified (1-specificity, black line), as functions of the proportion of positive entries in the training set. Ideally, sensitivity should be maximized while 1-specificity should be minimized. From the figure, we can see that 1-specificity increases in three stages. At the beginning of the second increasing stage, sensitivity has already entered into a slowly increasing stage. We therefore chose this point (x = 50%, vertical line) as the proportion of positive entries to use in the training set.
