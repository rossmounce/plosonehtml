The SNP positions are relative to the Schu S4 genome (<a href="#pone.0000947.s002">Table S2</a>), and are classified as synonymous (sSNP), non-synonymous (nSNP) and intergenic (iSNP), ribosomal (rSNP), and tRNA (tSNP). SNPs in duplicated regions (<a href="#pone.0000947.s005">Table S5</a>) are not shown here, but in <a href="#pone-0000947-g004">Figure 4</a>.
