                Figure 1.  Circular genome diagram of the Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis WY96 genome.The layers beginning with the outermost layer depict: the location and types of SNPs found between WY96 and Schu S4, a line graph depicting AT and GC skew throughout the genome, the locations of start and stop codons in the forward three reading frames, ORF locations in the forward three reading frames, ORF locations in the reverse three reading frames, start and stop codons in the reverse three reading frames, and a line graph depicting AT and GC content throughout the genome. The SNP positions are relative to the Schu S4 genome (Table S2), and are classified as synonymous (sSNP), non-synonymous (nSNP) and intergenic (iSNP), ribosomal (rSNP), and tRNA (tSNP). SNPs in duplicated regions (Table S5) are not shown here, but in Figure 4. Figure created using CGView [43].
