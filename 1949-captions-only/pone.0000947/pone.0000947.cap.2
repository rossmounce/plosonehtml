                Figure 2.  Mauve comparison of the WY96 (top) and Schu S4 (top) (bottom) genomes.Locally collinear blocks (LCBs) are the same color and size between genomes. Labeled blocks contain groups of genes. Blocks are labeled as forwards (F) and inversions (I) and the numbers correspond to names in the supplementary table (Table S3).
