                Figure 4.  Diagram of the 33,911 bp duplicated region containing the predicted pathogenicity island.SNPs are classified as synonymous (sSNP – light blue), non-synonymous (nSNP - gold), ribosomal (rSNP – green), and intergenic (iSNP - violet). The IglABCD operon is shown in red. SNPs in putative and hypothetical genes are classified as intergenic because their effect is unknown (Table S5).
