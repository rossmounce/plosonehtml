                Figure 3.  Stable (top row) and locally stable (bottom row) axisymmetric surfaces given by numerical minimization of W.The top row shows a one-parameter scan through a range of fixed T/B values, with the constraints ti = 0, Vnet = 4π/3 = 4.19 µm3, L = 4 µm and r = 0.1 µm. The values of T/B are, from left to right, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200, and 600 µm−2. These T/B values are within the expected physical range, since they are at least an order of magnitude smaller than that required for membrane rupture, assuming that B ~4×10−19 J [26] and the membrane ruptures at T ~2 mN/m [20]. The bottom row shows a one-parameter scan through the same range of T/B values as above, with the constraints ti = 0, Vnet = 4π/3 = 4.19 µm3, L = 7 µm, and r = 0.05 µm. Top row, left to right: A = 14.44, 14.06, 14.07, 13.96, 13.88, 13.81, 13.79,13.76, 13.75, and 13.74 µm2; P/B = 33.15, 51.80, 70.47, 89.28, 108.15, 146.07, 183.98, 278.71, 373.49, and 1131.32 µm−3. Bottom row, left to right: A = 17.33, 16.43, 16.04, 15.70, 15.45, 15.09, 14.84, 14.46, 14.23, and 14.11 µm2; P/B = 34.37, 53.10, 71.64, 90.51, 109.48, 147.62, 185.96, 282.39, 379.30, and 1158.77 µm−3. The two-tether surfaces are calculated without imposing mirror symmetry about the plane bisecting the n-MTB.
