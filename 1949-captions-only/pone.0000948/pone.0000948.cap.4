                Figure 4.  (a) Electron micrograph of thin section of an abnormally shaped nucleus (dotted outline) with a n-MTB due to overexpression of the ned1 gene [6].The n-MTB extends across the nucleus but is only partially visible in this section. Based on this and the other sections (not shown), we estimate that the bulge dimensions are approximately 1.6 µm×3.0 µm and the n-MTB radius is approximately 0.05 µm. Bar: 0.2 µm. (b) Predicted stable axisymmetric surface S with the same scale as above, obtained by adjusting T/B and Vnet so that its bulge dimensions match the actual ones, with the constraints ti = 0.016 µm, L = 4 µm, and r = 0.05 µm. Its size measures are A = 11.43 µm2 and Vnet = 2.90 µm3, corresponding to T/B = 65 µm−2 and P/B = 134.28 µm3, respectively.
