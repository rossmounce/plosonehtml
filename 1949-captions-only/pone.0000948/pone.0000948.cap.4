Based on this and the other sections (not shown), we estimate that the bulge dimensions are approximately 1.6 µm×3.0 µm and the n-MTB radius is approximately 0.05 µm. Bar: 0.2 µm. (b) Predicted stable axisymmetric surface <em>S</em> with the same scale as above, obtained by adjusting <em>T/B</em> and <em>V</em><sub>net</sub> so that its bulge dimensions match the actual ones, with the constraints <em>t</em><sub>i</sub> = 0.016 µm, <em>L</em> = 4 µm, and <em>r</em> = 0.05 µm. Its size measures are <em>A</em> = 11.43 µm<sup>2</sup> and <em>V</em><sub>net</sub> = 2.90 µm<sup>3</sup>, corresponding to <em>T/B</em> = 65 µm<sup>−2</sup> and <em>P/B</em> = 134.28 µm<sup>3</sup>, respectively.</p>
