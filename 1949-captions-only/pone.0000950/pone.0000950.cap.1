                Figure 1.  Maximum likelihood trees of HIV-1 V1-V3 sequences from post mortem tissues and PBMCs of different subjects.Branch lengths were estimated with the HKY+Î“ model and were drawn in scale with the bar at the bottom indicating 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site. The position of the root was inferred by maximum likelihood enforcing the molecular clock constraint. One * along a branch represent significant statistical support for the clade subtending that branch (zero-branch-length test p&lt;0.001 and a bootstrap value &gt;70%). Colored boxes and circles represent different tissues according to the color table in the figure. Monophyletic clades of PBMCs with R5 sequences are highlighted within solid circles. Broken circles highlight monophyletic clades of X4 sequences. a. Subject S1. b. Subject S2. c. Subject S3. d Subject S4.
