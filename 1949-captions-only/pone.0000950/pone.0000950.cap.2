The bootscanning plots (middle and bottom panel) were obtained for representative HIV-1 V1-V3 recombinant sequences (query sequences). Horizontal axis indicates the nucleotide position along a query sequence; vertical axis gives the bootstrap support for the clustering of the query sequence and the parental sequence (or clade) with a matching color in the cladogram. Vertical dotted lines localize potential recombination breakpoints. a Subject S2. Middle panel: bootscanning plot of an R5 recombinant sequence from early PBMC (PBMC_1t). Bottom panel: bootscanning plot of an X4 recombinant sequence from early PBMC (PBMC_1t). b. Subject S4. Middle panel: bootscanning plot of an R5 recombinant sequence from late PBMC (PBMC_3t). Bottom panel: bootscanning plot of an X4 recombinant sequence from thymus.</p>
