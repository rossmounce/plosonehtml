The trees were rooted by maximum likelihood enforcing a molecular clock and taking into account different sampling dates. One * along a branch represent significant statistical support for the clade subtending that branch (zero-branch-length test <em>p</em>&lt;0.001; Bayesian posterior &gt;0.75, and/or bootstrap value &gt;70%). Colored boxes and circles represent different tissues according to the color table to the left of each tree. Internal thick edges indicate population bottlenecks a. Patient S2. PBMC 1t and 2t were sampled 15 and 22 months after birth, respectively. Other tissues were sampled <em>post mortem</em> 26 months after birth. The main statistically supported clades, designated A, B, and C are highlighted within broken boxes. The solid box within clade C highlights X4 sequences. b. Patient S4. PBMC 1t, 2t, and 3t were sampled 3, 22, and 77 months after birth, respectively. The other tissues were sampled <em>post mortem</em> 77 months after birth. The main statistically supported clades, designated A, B, and C are highlighted by broken boxes. The solid box within clade C highlights X4 sequences.</p>
