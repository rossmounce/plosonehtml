Branch lengths were drawn in scale with the bar at the bottom indicating 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site. Triangles represent clades for which statistically unsupported internal branches were collapsed. Ancestral (Anc) sequences were reconstructed by maximum likelihood. Internal branches under significant positive (dN/dS&gt;2) or negative (dN/dS&lt;0.05) selection are drawn in thick red and black lines, respectively. Open circles emphasize the parent (ancestral sequence before the bottleneck) and child (ancestral sequence following the bottleneck) nodes. Specific amino acid positions (according to the HXB2 HIV-1 reference sequence) under positive selection within ancestral sequences are given in the tables at the bottom of each tree. Sequences with predicted X4 coreceptor use are indicated. a. Subject S2. Longitudinal PBMC and <em>post mortem</em> tissue samples were the same used for the tree in <a href="#pone-0000950-g002">Figure 2a</a>. b. Subject S4. Longitudinal PBMC and <em>post mortem</em> tissue samples were the same, with the exclusion of sequences from brain, used for the tree in <a href="#pone-0000950-g002">Figure 2b</a>.</p>
