For accurate relative affinity evaluations and cross-domain comparison, the slopes of individual ELISA kinetics were determined and normalized by the highest slope value in each of the six sets shown. The 96<sup>th</sup> well in each set was loaded with a library aliquot to indicate background. Axis X indicates identification (i.d.) numbers of individual artificial ligands (see individual ligand sequences together with their i.d. numbers in <a href="#pone.0000953.s004">Table S1</a>). Axis Y indicates the normalized relative affinity. The domain organization of the PSD95 and SAP97 proteins is shown above histograms.</p>
