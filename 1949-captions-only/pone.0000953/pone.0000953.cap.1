                Figure 1.  Binding of 95 artificial phage-displayed ligands to six PDZ domains of PSD95 and SAP97.Binding histograms were obtained by individual phage ELISA performed on purified GST fusions of the indicated domains immobilized in micro-titer plate wells [40]. For accurate relative affinity evaluations and cross-domain comparison, the slopes of individual ELISA kinetics were determined and normalized by the highest slope value in each of the six sets shown. The 96th well in each set was loaded with a library aliquot to indicate background. Axis X indicates identification (i.d.) numbers of individual artificial ligands (see individual ligand sequences together with their i.d. numbers in Table S1). Axis Y indicates the normalized relative affinity. The domain organization of the PSD95 and SAP97 proteins is shown above histograms.
