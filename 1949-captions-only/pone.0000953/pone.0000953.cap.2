For both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>: axis Y indicates the observed-to-expected frequency ratio values. The dotted line corresponds to the expected frequency value. Statistically significant overrepresentation is indicated by star symbols. <em>n</em> is sample size, <em>p</em> indicates the chi-square (A) or binomial (B) tests <em>P</em>-values. <em>C</em>, The aligned sequences of artificial peptide ligands are arranged in four groups based on their relative affinities to the PSD95-PDZ1. The numbers in parentheses indicate the range of normalized phage ELISA values within a given affinity group. The ligand positions from “−4” to “−7” are boxed to indicate the area of relative concentration of positively charged residues. Arginines and lysines are highlighted green, while aspartic and glutamic acids are red. The unique i.d. numbers of artificial ligands are indicated on the left from their sequences. The digits above columns indicate the C-terminal position numbering of ligand residues. Analogous arrangements of ligands for other five PDZ domains are shown in <a href="#pone.0000953.s001">Fig. S1A</a>, <a href="#pone.0000953.s002">Fig. S1B</a> and <a href="#pone.0000953.s003">Fig. S1C</a>.</p>
