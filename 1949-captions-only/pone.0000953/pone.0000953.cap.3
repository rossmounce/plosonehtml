                Figure 3.  Binding of 126 proteomic fragments (natural ligands) to six PDZ domains of PSD95 and SAP97.Binding histograms were obtained by peptide ELISA performed on purified GST fusions of the indicated domains immobilized in micro-titer plate wells as described previously [31]. The X axis indicates the i.d. numbers of natural ligands (see Table S2). The Y axis indicates the peptide ELISA kinetics slope value in arbitrary units (a.u.). The 127th and 128th wells in each of the six sets were loaded with irrelevant peptides to indicate background signal. To illustrate internal consistency of the affinity evaluations obtained by peptide ELISA and their external consistency with the previously published affinity measurements, the reported affinities of the five PDZ domain-ligand pairs obtained by three different research groups using fluorescence polarization [17], [18], [32] are shown. The previously reported affinities provide calibration, suggesting that the individual signals that are higher than 200 a.u. roughly correspond to the interaction affinities of 15 ÂµM KD or stronger.
