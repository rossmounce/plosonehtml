                Figure 4.  Analysis of amino acid frequency biases within the positional window “−4 to −7” in artificial and natural binders of the PSD95-PDZ1 domain.A, The observed-to-expected ratios of individual (top) and grouped (bottom) amino acid frequencies within the positional window “−4 to −7” in the 32 best artificial (open bars) and 32 best natural (filled bars) peptide ligands. B, The observed-to-expected ratios of individual (top) and grouped (bottom) amino acid frequencies within the positional window “−4 to −7” in the 32 worst natural peptide ligands. Grouping of twenty natural amino acids into eleven conserved physicochemical classes [41] is shown below histograms. Statistically significant over-(under)representation is indicated by star symbols. n is sample size, p indicates the binomial test P-values. C, Comparison of the best (on the left) and worst (on the right) natural binders of the PSD95-PDZ1 domain. The i.d. numbers of natural ligands are indicated on the left from their sequences. Arginines and lysines are highlighted green, while aspartates and glutamates are red. Notice how the relative abundance of negatively charged residues at the “−1” position in the best binders mirrors the relative abundance of positively charged residues at the “−1” position in the worst binders.
