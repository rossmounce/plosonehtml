Grouping of twenty natural amino acids into eleven conserved physicochemical classes <a href="#pone.0000953-Taylor1">[41]</a> is shown below histograms. Statistically significant over-(under)representation is indicated by star symbols. <em>n</em> is sample size, <em>p</em> indicates the binomial test <em>P</em>-values. <em>C</em>, Comparison of the best (on the left) and worst (on the right) natural binders of the PSD95-PDZ1 domain. The i.d. numbers of natural ligands are indicated on the left from their sequences. Arginines and lysines are highlighted green, while aspartates and glutamates are red. Notice how the relative abundance of negatively charged residues at the “−1” position in the best binders mirrors the relative abundance of positively charged residues at the “−1” position in the worst binders.</p>
