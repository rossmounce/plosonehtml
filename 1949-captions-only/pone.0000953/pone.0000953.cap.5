                Figure 5.  Pattern recognition differences between individual PDZ domains of PSD95.A, Comparison of the sequences that exhibited the highest differential ratios in their relative affinities to PDZ2 domain versus PDZ3 domain (on the left) to the sequences of the best PDZ3 binders (on the right). B, Comparison of the sequences that showed the highest differential ratios in their relative affinities to PDZ2 domain versus PDZ1 domain (on the left) to the sequences of best PDZ1 binders (on the right). Arginines and lysines are shown green, aspartates and glutamates are red.
