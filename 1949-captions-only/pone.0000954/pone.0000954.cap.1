Cells normally express the α-factor receptor Ste2p – Frizzled receptors are introduced by ectopic expression. Ste2p activation through its ligand α-factor leads to GDP-GTP exchange in the Gα protein Gpa1p, and dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein. The resulting free βγ subunits trigger activation of a MAP kinase cascade leading to the transcription of pheromone-responsive genes such as <em>FUS1</em>, as well as to G1 growth arrest via inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <em>FAR1</em> gene product. A mating pathway activation growth assay using wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1da) is shown bottom left. The strain was spotted in serial dilutions (~1E4, 1E3, 1E2, 1E1 cells in duplicate) onto complete minimal medium, and treated with 1 µg α-factor spotted directly onto the yeast patches as indicated.</p>
