Corresponding receptor schemes are shown in <a href="#pone-0000954-g002">Fig. 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0000954-g005">Fig. 5</a>. Yeast strains transformed with plasmid constructs as indicated were pre-cultured in glucose-containing minimal medium (repressed), and spotted in serial dilutions (~1E4, 1E3, 1E2, 1E1 cells) onto glucose- or galactose- (induced) containing minimal medium agar plates selective for the presence of the plasmid. Growth effects were recorded after 4 and 7 days. Controls were the empty expression vector and Ste2 and Edg2 receptors. The α-factor - mediated growth arrest assay (right panel) was done using wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1da), as well as isogenic <em>ste2</em> cells, treated with 1 µg α-factor spotted directly onto the yeast patches as indicated.</p>
