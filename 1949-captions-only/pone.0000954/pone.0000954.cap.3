                Figure 3.  Growth modulation assay of wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1a) overexpressing human Frizzled receptors and receptor chimeras.s-Fz1 and s-Fz2 (panel A) as well as receptor chimeras with the Ste2 receptor (B and C) were expressed in a galactose-inducible system, and effects were compared to α-factor mediated growth arrest. Corresponding receptor schemes are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5. Yeast strains transformed with plasmid constructs as indicated were pre-cultured in glucose-containing minimal medium (repressed), and spotted in serial dilutions (~1E4, 1E3, 1E2, 1E1 cells) onto glucose- or galactose- (induced) containing minimal medium agar plates selective for the presence of the plasmid. Growth effects were recorded after 4 and 7 days. Controls were the empty expression vector and Ste2 and Edg2 receptors. The α-factor - mediated growth arrest assay (right panel) was done using wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1da), as well as isogenic ste2 cells, treated with 1 µg α-factor spotted directly onto the yeast patches as indicated.
