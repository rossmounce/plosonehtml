                Figure 4.  Effect of galactose-inducible overexpression of human Frizzled receptors (s-Fz1 and s-Fz2) in the PFUS1-luciferase- based reporter system.Basal activities of s-Fz1 and s-Fz2 in absence of added ligand were determined. Schemes for receptor constructs used are shown in Fig. 2. Yeast strain MC18 ste2 sst2 expressing plasmid-encoded Gpa1p was employed. Crude extracts from glucose-repressed or galactose-induced yeast strains were assayed in duplicates for luciferase activity. Normalization was done based on total protein concentration. Signals are expressed relative to the receptor-deficient “OFF”-strain grown under induced conditions. Ste2p- (treated and untreated with 1 µM α-factor), Edg2-overexpressing strains, as well as the GPA1-deficient “ON”-strain were included as further controls. Bars represent average+/−range.
