Schemes for receptor constructs used are shown in <a href="#pone-0000954-g002">Fig. 2</a>. Yeast strain MC18 <em>ste2 sst2</em> expressing plasmid-encoded Gpa1p was employed. Crude extracts from glucose-repressed or galactose-induced yeast strains were assayed in duplicates for luciferase activity. Normalization was done based on total protein concentration. Signals are expressed relative to the receptor-deficient “OFF”-strain grown under induced conditions. Ste2p- (treated and untreated with 1 µM α-factor), Edg2-overexpressing strains, as well as the <em>GPA1</em>-deficient “ON”-strain were included as further controls. Bars represent average+/−range.</p>
