                Figure 5.  Construction schemes and subcellular localization of chimeras between the human Frizzled and S. cerevisiae Ste2 receptors.Receptor homology modeling was used to predict the transmembrane segments (see Fig. 6). A. This chimera type replaces the predicted intracellular portions of Ste2p with the corresponding ones of either Fz1 or Fz2, resulting in chimeras termed Ste2-Fz1(i) and Ste2-Fz2(i), respectively, with “(i)” designating intracellular portions. B. The second chimera type replaces the predicted intracellular portions of the human Frizzled receptors with respective ones of Ste2p, and uses the signal sequence of Ste2p (“s”) upstream of the cysteine-rich-domain (CRD) to give rise to s-Fz1-Ste2(i) and s-Fz2-Ste2(i). The fully synthetic gene sequences and respective amino acid sequences are given in the Supporting Information section of this article (Text S1). The subcellular localization of constructs tagged C-terminally with GFP is shown in the confocal micrographs.
