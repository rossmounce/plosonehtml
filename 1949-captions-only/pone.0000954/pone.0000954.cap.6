                Figure 6.  Transmembrane segment predictions for human Fz1, Fz2, and S. cerevisiae Ste2 receptors.The helices one to seven are shown as amino-acid sequences with indicated position numbers of the full sequence. The predictions were derived by receptor modeling. The transmembrane region assignment was based on a hydrophobicity analysis followed by manual adjustment of the overlap of some key amino acids (e.g., W and P in TM4, TM5, and TM6) with those found in rhodopsin and other reference receptors.
