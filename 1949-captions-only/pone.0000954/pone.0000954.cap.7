Detection of the myc-tagged receptors was performed using chromogenic indirect anti-c-myc monoclonal detection. Equal loading was monitored using a polyclonal anti-Kss1p antibody. The control extract was derived from a yeast strain transformed with the empty expression vector. The asterisks indicate the specific signals. Molecular weight standards in kDa are indicated.</p>
