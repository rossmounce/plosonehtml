                Figure 8.  Effect of galactose-inducible overexpression of the receptor chimeras between human Frizzled receptors (Fz1 and Fz2) and the S. cerevisiae Ste2 receptor in the PFUS1-luciferase- based reporter system.Yeast strain MC18 ste2 sst2 expressing plasmid-encoded Gpa1p was employed. Schemes for receptor constructs used are shown in Fig. 5. A. and B. Basal activities of Ste2-Fz1(i) and s-Fz1-Ste2(i) receptors in absence of added ligand, and comparison to the s-Fz1 overexpressing strain. Crude extracts from glucose-repressed or galactose-induced yeast strains were assayed in duplicates for luciferase activity after 6 h (A.) or 24 h (B). Normalization was done based on total protein concentration. Signals are expressed relative to the receptor-deficient “OFF”-strain grown under induced conditions. Bars represent means+/−range. C. α-factor concentration - response in the MC18 ste2 sst2 strain expressing plasmid-encoded Gpa1p and Ste2-Fz1/2(i) receptor chimeras or Ste2p. The galactose-induced yeast strains were incubated for 4 hours with indicated concentrations of α-factor, and crude extracts were subsequently assayed in quadruplets for luciferase activity. As negative control served a strain transformed with empty vector (“OFF”-strain). Responses are expressed as treated/control values; error bars indicate S.E.M. (N = 4).
