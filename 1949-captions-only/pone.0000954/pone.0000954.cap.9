                Figure 9.  Growth behaviour and morphologies of wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1da) overexpressing galactose-inducible s-Fz1 or receptor chimeras between Fz1 and Ste2p in liquid culture.Schemes for receptor constructs used are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5. As control served a strain transformed with empty vector. Growth curves in glucose- (repressed; (A)), or galactose-containing (induced; (B.)) minimal medium, following washout of glucose, as determined using optical density measurement, or microscopic counting in a hemocytometer slide at the indicated timepoints, respectively. C. Budding indices (ratio of budded to total yeast cells) of the induced cultures were determined using microscopic counting in a hemocytometer slide.
