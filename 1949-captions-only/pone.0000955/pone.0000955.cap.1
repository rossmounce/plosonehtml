                Figure 1.  Radiation resistance and genome structure of D. geothermalis and D. radiodurans. A, IR (60Co, 5.5 kGy/h).B, UV (254 nm) (3 J/m2 s−1). Open circle, D. radiodurans (32°C); open triangle, D. geothermalis (50°C); and open square, D. geothermalis (32°C). Values are from three independent trials with standard deviations shown. At near-optimal growth temperatures, the 10% survival values (D10) following IR for D. radiodurans (32°C) and D. geothermalis (50°C) are 15 kGy; for E. coli, 0.7 kGy (37°C) [5]; and for T. thermophilus (HB27) 0.8 kGy (65°C) [27]. C, PFGE of genomic DNA prepared from irradiated (0.2 kGy) D. radiodurans (DR+IR) and D. geothermalis (DG+IR); and genomic DNA from non-irradiated D. geothermalis digested with SpeI (DG+SpeI). (M) PFGE DNA size markers. PFGE was as described previously [77].
