                Figure 2.  Whole genome evolutionary reconstructions for D. radiodurans, D. geothermalis, T. thermophilus (HB8) and T. thermophilus (HB27).For each internal node of tree (open boxes), the inferred number of tdCOGs is shown. For each tree branch the inferred number of tdCOGs lost (minus sign) and gained (plus sign) is shown. For the deep ancestor of the Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus group (shaded box), the inferred number of COGs is shown. For the extant species, the number of tdCOGs, the number of proteins in tdCOGs (in parentheses), and the number of “free” (not assigned to tdCOGs) proteins (plus sign) are shown.
