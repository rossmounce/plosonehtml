For each tree branch the inferred number of tdCOGs lost (minus sign) and gained (plus sign) is shown. For the deep ancestor of the <em>Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Deinococcus-Thermus</em> group (shaded box), the inferred number of COGs is shown. For the extant species, the number of tdCOGs, the number of proteins in tdCOGs (in parentheses), and the number of “free” (not assigned to tdCOGs) proteins (plus sign) are shown.</p>
