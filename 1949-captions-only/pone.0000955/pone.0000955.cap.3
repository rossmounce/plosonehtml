                Figure 3.  Gene-gain and gene-loss for different functional groups for D. radiodurans and D. geothermalis.Designations of functional groups (from the COG database): J–Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; K–Transcription; L–DNA replication, recombination and repair; D–Cell division and chromosome partitioning; O–Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; M–Cell envelope and outer membrane biogenesis; N–Cell motility and secretion; P–Inorganic ion transport and metabolism; T–Signal transduction mechanisms; C–Energy production and conversion; G–Carbohydrate transport and metabolism; E–Amino acid transport and metabolism; F–Nucleotide transport and metabolism; H–Coenzyme metabolism; I–Lipid metabolism; Q–Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; V–genes involved in stress response and microbial defense.
