Where necessary, alignments were modified manually on the basis of PSI-BLAST outputs <a href="#pone.0000955-Altschul1">[94]</a>. The positions of the first and the last residue of the aligned region in the corresponding protein are indicated for each sequence. The numbers within the alignment refer to the length of inserts that are poorly conserved between all the families. Secondary structure elements are denoted as follows: E-β-strand; and H-α-helix. The coloring scheme is as follows: predominantly hydrophobic residues are high-lighted in yellow; positions with small residues are in green; positions with turn-promoting residues are in cyan; positions with polar residues are in red; hydroxyl-group containing residues are in blue; aromatic residues are in magenta; and invariant, highly conserved groups are in boldface. A, DR0644-Dgeo_0284 conserved pair of orthologs belong to the copper/Zinc superoxide dismutase family; shaded letters refer to amino acids that play an important role in the Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination environment and in the active site region. The bottom line shows the correspondence between the most conserved regions corresponding to the β-stand structural core and conserved in most family members as denoted in Bordo et al <a href="#pone.0000955-Bordo1">[157]</a>. B, Dgeo_0137-DR0449 are highly specific for the <em>Deinococcus</em> lineage proteins that have an RNAse H-related domain. Catalytic residues conserved in the RNAse H family are shaded. Secondary structure elements are shown for <em>E. coli</em> RNase HI (PDB:2rn2). C, DR0041-Dgeo_0188 is another conserved pair (DdrA-related) of proteins belonging to the Rad52 family of DNA single-strand annealing proteins <a href="#pone.0000955-Iyer1">[97]</a>. Secondary structure elements are shown for human RAD52 (PDB:1KN0) <a href="#pone.0000955-Singleton1">[158]</a>. <em>sak</em> is a phage gene described previously <a href="#pone.0000955-Bouchard1">[159]</a>; D, DR0381-Dgeo_0373 are diverged homologs of NADPH-dependent nitrile reductase (GTP cyclohydrolase I family) that might be involved in nucleotide metabolism. The conserved Cys and Glu found in the substrate binding pocket of both protein families and specific zinc-binding and catalytic residues in the FolE family are shaded. The QueF family motif is boxed. Other catalytic residues in FolE not found in QueF are in yellow. Genbank Identifier (gi) numbers are listed on the right.</p>
