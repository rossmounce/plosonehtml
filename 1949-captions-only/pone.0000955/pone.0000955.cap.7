                Figure 7.  X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microprobe element distribution maps [142].A, D. geothermalis (diplococcus). B, D. radiodurans (tetracocus). Cells were harvested from mid-logarithmic cultures in undefined rich medium, imaged, and quantified as described previously [17]. The element distribution images are plotted to different scales designated by a single color-box, where red represents the highest concentration and black the lowest. ppm values in parentheses next to the element symbol correspond to red. XRF microprobe analysis measurements were made at beamline 2ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory as described recently [17].
