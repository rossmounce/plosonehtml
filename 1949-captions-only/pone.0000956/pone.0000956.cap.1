                Figure 1.  ESCRT-I components mediate degradation of the cell surface protein GFP:CAV-1 after its internalization.(A) Table listing the known subunits of ESCRT-I in S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens and C. elegans. (B) Schematic of the reproductive system of the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite. Oocytes (blue) aligned in a row are fertilized in a sequential conveyor belt-like fashion with one ovulation event occurring ~every 20 minutes [25]. Pre-fertilization oocytes are numbered -1, -2, etc. with respect to their position relative to the spermatheca. Similarly, fertilized embryos (green), which are at progressively later stages in development as their distance from the spermatheca increases, are numbered +1, +2, +3, etc. (C) Spinning disk confocal optics were used to image anesthetized control (n = 14), tsg-101(RNAi) (n = 15), vps-28(RNAi) (n = 11), and vps-37(RNAi) (n = 10) adult hermaphrodites expressing GFP:CAV-1. Both differential interference contrast (DIC, left) and fluorescence (right) images are shown. Schematics in the center column are traces of the DIC images in which the location of the spermatheca (red), the unfertilized oocytes (blue) and the embryos (green) are highlighted. Boxes indicate the presence of embryos at or beyond the two-cell stage, where GFP:CAV-1 is normally absent. Scale bar is 25 Âµm.
