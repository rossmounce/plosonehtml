(B) Schematic of the reproductive system of the adult <em>C. elegans</em> hermaphrodite. Oocytes (<em>blue</em>) aligned in a row are fertilized in a sequential conveyor belt-like fashion with one ovulation event occurring ~every 20 minutes <a href="#pone.0000956-McCarter1">[25]</a>. Pre-fertilization oocytes are numbered -1, -2, etc. with respect to their position relative to the spermatheca. Similarly, fertilized embryos (<em>green</em>), which are at progressively later stages in development as their distance from the spermatheca increases, are numbered +1, +2, +3, etc. (C) Spinning disk confocal optics were used to image anesthetized control (n = 14), <em>tsg-101(RNAi)</em> (n = 15), <em>vps-28(RNAi)</em> (n = 11), and <em>vps-37(RNAi)</em> (n = 10) adult hermaphrodites expressing GFP:CAV-1. Both differential interference contrast (DIC, <em>left</em>) and fluorescence (<em>right</em>) images are shown. Schematics in the center column are traces of the DIC images in which the location of the spermatheca (<em>red</em>), the unfertilized oocytes (<em>blue</em>) and the embryos (<em>green</em>) are highlighted. Boxes indicate the presence of embryos at or beyond the two-cell stage, where GFP:CAV-1 is normally absent. Scale bar is 25 Âµm.</p>
