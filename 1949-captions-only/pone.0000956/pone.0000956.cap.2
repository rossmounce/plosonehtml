A silver stained gel of the eluted proteins is shown. Arrowheads indicate the predicted mobility of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry. (B) Table summarizing the percent sequence coverage, predicted molecular weight, and RNAi phenotype for each of the four specific proteins in the eluate identified by solution mass spectrometry. For VPS-37, the predicted size including the additional mass of the affinity purification tag is shown in parentheses. In addition to the four proteins shown, a common contaminant (LEV-11) was also identified by mass spectrometry, but is not included in the table. (C) Western blots of extracts prepared from wild type worms or worms specifically depleted of MVB-12 by RNAi. Serial dilutions of extract prepared from untreated worms were loaded to quantify depletion levels. (D) Spinning disk confocal optics were used to image GFP:MVB-12 in control (n = 15), <em>vps-4(RNAi)</em> (n = 13), and <em>vps-4, tsg-101(RNAi)</em> (n = 15) embryos <em>in utero</em>. Schematic illustrates the effect of depleting VPS-4, the AAA-ATPase required to recycle endosome-associated ESCRT-I, returning it to the cytoplasm (<em>lower right</em>). Scale bar is 10 µm. (E) Spinning disk confocal optics were used to image GFP:VPS-37 in control (n = 10), <em>vps-4(RNAi)</em> (n = 8), <em>vps-4, tsg-101(RNAi)</em> (n = 9), and <em>vps-4, mvb-12(RNAi)</em> (n = 9) embryos <em>in utero</em>. Scale bar is 10 µm.</p>
