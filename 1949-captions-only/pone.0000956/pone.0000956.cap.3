A Coomassie stained gel of the peak elution fractions after fractionation of the recombinant complex on a Superose 6 gel filtration column is shown. The intensities of each band were measured to identify the peak, and a Stokes radius was calculated for each protein based on comparison with the elution profiles of known standards. The asterisk highlights a breakdown product of TSG-101. (B) The recombinant complex described in A, was fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient. A western blot of the fractions for TSG-101 is shown. The asterisk highlights a breakdown product of TSG-101. The intensities of each band were measured to identify the peak, and S-values were calculated for each protein based on the location of known standards run on a parallel gradient. (C) TSG-101:6×HIS, VPS-28, VPS-37 and MVB-12 were co-expressed and purified from <em>E. coli</em> extracts using nickel resin. A Coomassie stained gel of the peak elution fractions after fractionation of the recombinant complex on a Superose 6 gel filtration column is shown. The Stokes radius of the complex, calculated as described for A, is indicated. (D) The recombinant complex described in C, was fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient. A western blot of the fractions for MVB-12 is shown. The S-value of the complex, calculated as described in B is indicated. (E) Western blots of embryo extracts fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column. The peaks corresponding to TSG-101 and MVB-12 are largely overlapping. The Stokes radius of the complex, calculated as described for A, is indicated. (F) Western blots of embryo extracts after fractionation on a 5–20% sucrose density gradient. TSG-101 and MVB-12 co-fractionate, both migrating with an S-value close to 5.0. The S-value of the complex, calculated as described in B is shown.</p>
