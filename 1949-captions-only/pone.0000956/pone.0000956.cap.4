Representative sections are shown. Times are in minutes relative to oocyte ovulation. Arrowheads highlight the transient accumulation of RME-2:GFP on the cell surface at the 10 min timepoint. Scale bar is 10 µm. (B) Higher magnification (2x) views of a portion of the control images acquired in (A). At early timepoints after RME-2:GFP internalization, the GFP signal co-localizes with RFP:RAB-5. At later timepoints, both the extent to which the localization of RME-2:GFP is co-incident with that of RFP:RAB-5 and the overall intensity of the RME-2:GFP signal are reduced. Scale bar is 5 µm. (C) The distribution of the time (in minutes after ovulation) when the RME-2:GFP signal was no longer detectable at the cell surface is shown for control, <em>mvb-12(RNAi)</em>, and <em>tsg-101(RNAi)</em> embryos. (D) The distribution of the time (in minutes after ovulation) when &gt;90% of RME-2:GFP containing endosomes were no longer positive for RFP:RAB-5 is shown for control, <em>mvb-12(RNAi)</em>, and <em>tsg-101(RNAi)</em> embryos. GFP-positive and RFP-positive endosomes with signals above the cytoplasmic background were identified using individual thresholds. At 1 min intervals, each GFP-labeled endosome was examined for RFP signal. The center of the first 5 min time interval over which less than 10% of the total GFP-positive endosomes also had a detectable RFP signal is plotted for each embryo. (E) The distribution of the time (in minutes after ovulation) when &gt;90% of the RME-2:GFP fluorescence present 10 minutes post ovulation had been lost is shown for control, <em>mvb-12(RNAi)</em>, and <em>tsg-101(RNAi)</em> embryos. The total integrated RME-2:GFP fluorescence intensity was measured in a 10 µm×10 µm box for each timepoint and the time when this value fell below 10% of the total fluorescence in an identical box at the 10 min timepoint in the same embryo is plotted. Background integrated fluorescence intensity measured in an identical box in older (&gt;50 cell stage) control embryos was subtracted before calculating the percentage of fluorescence remaining.</p>
