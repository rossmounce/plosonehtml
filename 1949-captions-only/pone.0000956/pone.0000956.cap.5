                Figure 5.  The human MVB-12 homologs, MVB12A and MVB12B, are new components of human ESCRT-I.(A) Sequence alignment of the C. elegans protein with MVB12A and MVB12B was performed using ClustalW. Amino acids that are identical between two of the three sequences are highlighted in light blue and between all three sequences in dark blue. (B) HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP:MVB12B were detergent extracted, fixed and stained with antibodies to GFP and human TSG101 (n = 23). A single section from a representative 3D computationally deconvolved data set is shown. A color overlay of GFP:MVB12B (red) and TSG101 (green) and a higher magnification (8x) view of the indicated boxed region are also shown. Scale bar is 10 µm. (C) HeLa cells transiently transfected with RFP:MVB12B and either wild type hVPS4B:GFP (n = 13) or mutant hVPS4BE235Q:GFP (n = 21) were imaged using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Representative color overlays of RFP:MVB12B (red) and hVPS4:GFP (green) are also shown. Scale bar is 10 µm. (D) Immunoprecipitations with antibodies to GFP, or GST as a control, were performed on extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected with either GFP:MVB12A or GFP:MVB12B. Western blots of the starting extracts (load, 10% of total) and the control (10% of total) and GFP (10% of total) immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies to TSG101.
