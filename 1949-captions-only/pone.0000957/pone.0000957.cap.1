IFN-Î³ production was detected by ELISPOT. Linear regression analysis was used to determine that there was no statistically significant difference between adult and neonatal DC in presentation of peptide to HLA-2-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (p = 0.9882). Monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) were used as antigen presenting cells in all experiments and were derived as described in <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a>.</p>
