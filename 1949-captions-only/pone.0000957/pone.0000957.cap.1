                Figure 1.  Equivalent peptide presentation of the HCMV pp65 nonamer NLVPMVATV by DC from adult and neonatal blood to HLA-A2- restricted clone CD8+ T cell clone D2-1-D2.The peptide NLVPMVATV was added in 10-fold dilutions (final concentration 10,000 pg/ml to 10 pg/ml) to HLA-A2+ monocyte-derived DC (20,000 cells/well) from adult (n = 4) and neonatal (n = 7) blood and incubated overnight with D2-1-D2 CD8+ T cell clones (10,000 cells/well). IFN-Î³ production was detected by ELISPOT. Linear regression analysis was used to determine that there was no statistically significant difference between adult and neonatal DC in presentation of peptide to HLA-2-restricted CD8+ T cells (p = 0.9882). Monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) were used as antigen presenting cells in all experiments and were derived as described in materials and methods.
