                Figure 2.  DC from adults and neonates are comparable in their ability to present the M. tuberculosis antigen pronase-digested cell wall to HLA-E-restricted clone D160-1-23.DC from adult (n = 5) and neonatal (n = 6) blood were incubated overnight with or without the pronase-treated cell wall fraction from M.tuberculosis. The DC were diluted over a range of concentrations (90,000 to 1100 cells/well), and incubated with the cognate CD8+ HLA-E-restricted clone D160-1-23 (10,000 cells/well) overnight. IFN-Î³ was detected by ELISPOT. There was no statistically significant difference between adult and neonatal DC in presentation of pronase-digested cell wall to HLA-E-restricted CD8+ T cells (p = 0.7943).
