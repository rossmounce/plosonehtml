The DC were diluted over a range of concentrations (90,000 to 1100 cells/well), and incubated with the cognate CD8<sup>+</sup> HLA-E-restricted clone D160-1-23 (10,000 cells/well) overnight. IFN-Î³ was detected by ELISPOT. There was no statistically significant difference between adult and neonatal DC in presentation of pronase-digested cell wall to HLA-E-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (p = 0.7943).</p>
