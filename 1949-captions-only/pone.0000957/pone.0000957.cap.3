                Figure 3.  DC from adult and neonatal blood are similar in their ability to process and directly present the HLA-A2 restricted antigen HCMV pp65 epitope NVLPMVATV following recombinant vaccinia infection.HLA-A2+ DC from adults (n = 11) and neonates (n = 7) were infected with vvpp65 (moi = 1.5) overnight. Infected and uninfected DC were titrated over a range (10,000 to 1,100 cells/well) and incubated overnight with pp65-specific CD8+ T cell clone D2-1-D2 (10,000 cells/well). IFN-γ production was detected by ELISPOT. HLA-A2− DC from both adults and neonates did not induce any IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cell clone D2-1-D2. There was no statistically significant difference between adult and neonatal DC in processing and directly presenting antigen following recombinant vaccinia infection (p = 0.6489).
