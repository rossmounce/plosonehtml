                Figure 4.  DC from adults and neonates are equivalent in their ability to cross present cell-associated antigen.4A. To confirm inactivation of vaccinia virus, HLA-A2+ LCL (30,000 cells/well) were co-incubated for 24 hrs with vvpp65-infected HLA-A2− LCL (60,000 cells/well) prior to (left well) or after (right well) heat-inactivation (30 minutes at 56C) and UV-treatment (200mJ2). Direct presentation was then detected by IFN-γ ELISPOT after an overnight incubation with CD8+ T cell clones D2 1-D2 (10,000/well), specific for the HLA-A2-restricted antigen HCMV pp65.
4B. Representative ELISPOT wells of the cross presentation assay are shown. DC (30,000/well) from five individual adult (top row) or neonatal donors (bottom row) were incubated overnight with cell-associated antigen, namely, vvpp65-infected LCL (60,000/well) that were heat (30 minutes at 56C) and UV-treated (200 mJ2). CD8+ T cell clones D2 1-D2, specific for the pp65 antigen, were added (10,000 cells/well) and IFN-γ was detected the following day by ELISPOT. Only HLA-A2+ DC cross presented the pp65 antigen (right 4 columns) and HLA-A2− DC (left column) never cross presented the antigen. HLA-A2+ DC incubated with uninfected HLA-A2− LCL never elicited a response by CD8+ T cell clone D2-1-D2 (not shown). In addition, vvpp65-infected HLA-A2− LCL alone in the absence of HLA-A2+ DC never elicited a response by CD8+ T cell clone D2-1-D2 (not shown).
4C. Combined data from 3 separate cross presentation experiments using adult (n = 18) and neonatal (n = 14) HLA-A2+ DC. No significant differences were observed (p = 0.8587).
