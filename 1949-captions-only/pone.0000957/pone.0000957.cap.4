To confirm inactivation of vaccinia virus, HLA-A2<sup>+ </sup>LCL (30,000 cells/well) were co-incubated for 24 hrs with vvpp65-infected HLA-A2<sup>−</sup> LCL (60,000 cells/well) prior to (left well) or after (right well) heat-inactivation (30 minutes at 56C) and UV-treatment (200mJ<sup>2</sup>). Direct presentation was then detected by IFN-γ ELISPOT after an overnight incubation with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones D2 1-D2 (10,000/well), specific for the HLA-A2-restricted antigen HCMV pp65.</p>

DC (30,000/well) from five individual adult (top row) or neonatal donors (bottom row) were incubated overnight with cell-associated antigen, namely, vvpp65-infected LCL (60,000/well) that were heat (30 minutes at 56C) and UV-treated (200 mJ<sup>2</sup>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones D2 1-D2, specific for the pp65 antigen, were added (10,000 cells/well) and IFN-γ was detected the following day by ELISPOT. Only HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> DC cross presented the pp65 antigen (right 4 columns) and HLA-A2<sup>−</sup> DC (left column) never cross presented the antigen. HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> DC incubated with uninfected HLA-A2<sup>−</sup> LCL never elicited a response by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone D2-1-D2 (not shown). In addition, vvpp65-infected HLA-A2<sup>−</sup> LCL alone in the absence of HLA-A2+ DC never elicited a response by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone D2-1-D2 (not shown).</p>
