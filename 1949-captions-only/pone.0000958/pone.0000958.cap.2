                Figure 2.  Distribution of p-values computed by GLM1 and GLM2 SNP selection methods.The figure is shown in logarithmic scale for convenience. The vertical line is the Bonferroni adjusted Î±-level (0.05/10,009). While there are SNPs that are significant according to GLM1 method, no SNP is significant by GLM2. The distribution of p-values for GLM2 is uniform, however the distribution for GLM1 is not.
