(B) <em>int6</em> morphant melanocytes are less darkly pigmented. (C–F) Int6 is required for pigment cell placement in the tail, as <em>int6</em> morphants and <em>int6<sup>hi2470</sup></em> mutants have misplaced pigment cells in the tail fin (D, arrow). Ambient light illuminates the iridophore ‘star-light’ pattern seen in the <em>int6<sup>hi2470</sup></em> embryos (F, arrow). (G–H) By 5 dpf, embryos injected with a con MO have clearly visible certobranical arches, while <em>int6</em> morphants do not have visible certobranical arches, in addition to other abnormalities, including unconsumed yolk sac, heart and eye development. (I–N). Alcian blue staining of 5 dpf embryos shows loss of ceratobrancial arches 1 through 5. M, Meckel's; PQ, palatoquadrate; CH, ceratohyal; CB, ceratobrancial.</p>
