Osteosarcoma U2-OS cells untransfected (U), or transfected with siRNA targeted against the <em>INT6</em> mRNA (si) or the reverse sequence (R), show reduced levels of INT6 and MEK1 protein specifically after transfection with <em>INT6-</em>siRNA, but no reduction in BAX, tubulin or actin protein levels. (B) Semi-quantitative-PCR shows <em>MEK1</em> mRNA is unaffected in reverse sequence and <em>INT6</em>-siRNA treated cells, coupled with the expected reduced levels of the <em>INT6</em> message in the <em>INT6</em>-siRNA transfected cells. c, PCR control without DNA. (C) Phospho-Erk levels are reduced in <em>int6</em> morphants, while ponceau stain detects equal loading of protein on the gel.</p>
