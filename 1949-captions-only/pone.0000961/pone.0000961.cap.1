The chicken β-actin promoter was used to drive transcription of the chimeric mRNAs. The promoter harbors an intron of about 900 bp (hatched box). The various ID elements are represented by black rectangular boxes, with short A-rich tails (white boxes). ID1 corresponds to the 5′domain of BC1 RNA and the other ID elements differ from ID1 by mutations indicated by white lines within the black boxes, 1DI corresponds to ID1 in the reverse orientation. BC1-FL (full length BC1 RNA) is indicated by a black rectangular box (5′ ID domain) fused to two open boxes (representing the central A-rich region and 3′ non-repetitive region). The 3′ UTR of α-CaMKII mRNA, used as a positive control, is represented by a long rectangular open box and part of the ORF by a striped box (not drawn to scale). The labels to the right refer the respective plasmids.</p>
