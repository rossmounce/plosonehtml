                Figure 2.  ID elements do not mark EGFP reporter mRNA for dendritic transport.In situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense (AS) EGFP probe on coronal brain sections from the various transgenic mice. A–D, There are intense hybridization signals in the cell bodies of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex for the ID1, ID2, ID4 and 1DI chimeric RNAs; however, there is no staining observed in the corresponding dendritic fields. E–H, Higher magnifications of the CA1 regions of hippocampus reveal intense staining in the cell bodies (arrowheads) but only weak staining, if at all, in only the very proximal-most regions of dendrites (arrows) and none in the distal dendritic fields (asterisks). I, An example of dendritic staining; brain sections from wild type mice were hybridized with a unique probe for BC1 RNA. J, Control hybridizations with the EGFP sense (S) probe did not produce any signals. Boxes in A–D represent the areas shown at higher magnification in E–H, respectively.
