                Figure 3.  The 3′ UTR of α-CaMKII targets EGFP reporter mRNA to dendrites, whereas full-length BC1 RNA does not.In situ hybridization with a DIG-riboprobe against EGFP in coronal brain sections through the hippocampus of transgenic mice harboring chimeric RNAs with EGFP plus full length BC1 RNA or the 3′ UTR of α-CaMKII mRNA (positive control). A, EGFP-BC1 RNA was restricted to neuronal cell bodies in the hippocampus and cortex (arrowheads), and no significant labeling was observed in the dendritic regions of these cells. B, Higher magnification revealed dendritic labeling only in the very proximal-most region of the CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites (arrows), if at all. C, The EGFP- α-CaMKII 3′ UTR chimeric RNA was detected both in cell bodies and dendrites of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. D, Higher magnification revealed somatic staining (arrowheads) and labeling up to the distal ends of CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites in the hippocampus (arrows). E-F, There were no specific hybridization signals from AS probes in wild type mice, or from sense probes in the transgenic mice (data not shown). Boxes in A and C represent the areas shown at higher magnification in B and D, respectively.
