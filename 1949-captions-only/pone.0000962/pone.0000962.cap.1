                Figure 1.  Distribution of individual fly total abundance (TA) values for wild-type males.(A) LD and (B) DD. Mean, LD = 2.27 µg/ fly (N = 277), DD = 2.30 µg/fly (N = 348.); no significant difference. The standard deviation in DD is 23% higher than in LD (F347,276 = 1.518, p = .00015).
