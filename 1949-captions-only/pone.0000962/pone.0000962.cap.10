                Figure 10.  Abundance Variability versus time of day for monoenes.AV values were fitted to 1-hour intervals for flies in (a) LD, (b) DD. A peak of AV at CT 4 and a low at CT 6 occur in both LD and DD, but pentacosene LD peaks are higher than in DD. Note the prominent LD peak at CT 13 for all monoenes, which is absent in DD. Surface shown is hourly data points plus intermediates produced by bicubic interpolation.
