                Figure 11.  Effect of LD AV variation at CT13.(A) n-alkanes versus monoenes (B) Desaturation Index DI versus monoenes. (A) Sum of n-alkanes versus sum of C23–C25 monoenes, in LD. Non-normalized data is used. Red, CT 13; blue, CT14. Slope for CT13 differs significantly from CT 14 and other hours (p&lt;2e-5) (CT 13, slope −0.12±0.04; CT 14 slope 0.27±0.05; other hours, 0.19±0.01). Compare with Figure 10 (a), AV by hour in LD, where a peak in monoene AV occurs at CT 13 and a minimum at CT 14. (B) The Desaturation Index (DI[33]) calculated for the same flies. Slope for DI versus total monoenes – CT 13: 0.374±.0295; CT 14: 0.122±.0468; other hours: 0.113±.00828. CT 13 slope differs from other hours (p = 5e-06).
