                Figure 12.  Desaturation Index DI versus total hydrocarbon abundance TA over 24 hours in LD and DD.Line is prediction from fitted multivariate linear model for the compounds used in DI calculations [33]. Predicted and actual DI values are significantly correlated (LD: Pearson's r = 0.643, p&lt;2e-16, df = 275; DD: r = 0.529, p&lt;2e-16, df = 346).
