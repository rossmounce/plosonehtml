                Figure 13.  Temporal variation for representative compounds in LD and DD.Curves represent all significant frequencies in a stepwise regression of Fourier components on the raw (unsmoothed) data. Points shown are means from a central moving average filter, Â±1 s.e.m. Filter bandwidth is 3, except for curves with significant 3 hour periodicity, where bandwidth of 2 was used (top row). Note 3-hour oscillations centered around peak at lights off (ZT 12) for the three short-chain compounds in LD (significance of 3-hour component for cVA, p3&lt;2.3e-10; 9-C23:1 p3&lt;3.3e-05; for C23, p3&lt;3.3e-04). In DD, only 9-C23:1 retains a 3-hour component (p3&lt;3.1e-03). For the three C27 compounds in LD the 24 hour period was most significant in LD (7-C27:1, p24&lt;1.0e-07; C27, p24&lt;4.7e-05; C27Br, p24&lt;4.6e-05) and in DD (7-C27:1, p24&lt;4.5e-07; C27, p24&lt;1.2e-05; C27Br, p24&lt;2.6e-05). Both the alkene and methyl-alkanes C27 compounds also had significant 6 hour components in LD, but not in DD. All p values derived from F2,272 ratios from regression in LD, F2,341 in DD (see Methods).
