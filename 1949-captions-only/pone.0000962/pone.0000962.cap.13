Points shown are means from a central moving average filter, Â±1 s.e.m. Filter bandwidth is 3, except for curves with significant 3 hour periodicity, where bandwidth of 2 was used (top row). Note 3-hour oscillations centered around peak at lights off (ZT 12) for the three short-chain compounds in LD (significance of 3-hour component for cVA, p<sub>3</sub>&lt;2.3e-10; 9-C23:1 p<sub>3</sub>&lt;3.3e-05; for C23, p<sub>3</sub>&lt;3.3e-04). In DD, only 9-C23:1 retains a 3-hour component (p<sub>3</sub>&lt;3.1e-03). For the three C27 compounds in LD the 24 hour period was most significant in LD (7-C27:1, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;1.0e-07; C27, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;4.7e-05; C27Br, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;4.6e-05) and in DD (7-C27:1, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;4.5e-07; C27, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;1.2e-05; C27Br, p<sub>24</sub>&lt;2.6e-05). Both the alkene and methyl-alkanes C27 compounds also had significant 6 hour components in LD, but not in DD. All p values derived from F<sub>2,272</sub> ratios from regression in LD, F<sub>2,341</sub> in DD (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>).</p>
