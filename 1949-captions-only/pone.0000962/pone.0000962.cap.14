Vertical axis shows log<sub>2</sub>(y<sub>t</sub>/y<sub>n</sub>), where y<sub>t</sub> is concentration at time t in perfumed flies and y<sub>n</sub> is daily mean concentration in non-perfumed flies. R<sup>2</sup> = .9837, slope = .0716, implied loss rate per day is 329%. Proportional loss rate is constant over time.</p>
