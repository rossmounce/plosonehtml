                Figure 14.  Loss rate of applied 9-C25:1 in LD.Compound was applied at time 0 (see Methods) and measured on groups of 5 flies at times 1, 6, 11 and 24. Vertical axis shows log2(yt/yn), where yt is concentration at time t in perfumed flies and yn is daily mean concentration in non-perfumed flies. R2 = .9837, slope = .0716, implied loss rate per day is 329%. Proportional loss rate is constant over time.
