                Figure 2.  Test of RA model assumptions.(a) Plot of scaled abundance y′i,j versus scaled total abundance T′i for monoene 9-C23:1 (solid line) and n-alkane C25 (dashed line) in DD. Fitted slopes β′j are different from 1: slope β′j = 1.254 for 9-C23:1 (s.e. = 0.0345, t = 7.37, df = 346, p&lt;1e-12) and β′j = 0.483 for C25 (s.e. = 0.0365, t = −13.6, df = 345, p&lt;1e-16). Each point is mean±1 s.e. of 20–22 observations over 24 hours. Abscissa and ordinate are dimensionless.(b) Plot of RA versus TA over 24 hours. RA is dimensionless, TA is µg/fly. 9-C23:1 – filled circles, solid line; C25 open circles, dashed line. RA for C25 is less in flies with high total hydrocarbons, while RA for 9-C23:1 is higher in such flies.
