                Figure 3.  Abundance Variability AVj for 21 compounds in wild-type flies in DD.p(AVj&gt;0)&lt;10−7 in all cases. Methyl-alkanes and n-alkanes have significantly lower AV than monoenes at each chain length (p&lt;10−6 in all cases), while longer chain compounds have lower AV than short chain compounds (e.g. AVC27 = 0.30&lt;AVC23 = 0.74, p&lt;10−11). Fitted to response for hours 0–23 using FA latent variable (see Methods). Asterisks indicate significant difference from the null hypothesis of AV = 100%. *** = p&lt;0.001; ** = p&lt;0.01.
