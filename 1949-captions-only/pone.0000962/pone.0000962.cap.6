                Figure 6.  Compound TA-mean abundance ratio, LD/DD.Short chain methyl-alkanes increased in LD, n-alkanes decreased or did not change. Among monoenes, 7-C23:1 and 9-C25:1 decreased slightly but significantly in LD (p&lt;0.003), while 5-C23:1,9-C24:1,5-C24:1, and 7-C27:1 decreased more (p&lt;5e-6). Error bars show 99% confidence intervals. Averages of 24 hours of data were compared for the two treatments.
