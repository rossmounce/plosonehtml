                Figure 7.  Significance of differences between subjective day and subjective night FA-normalized mean compound abundance in LD (solid line) and DD (dashed line).Y axis gives Student t test value for comparison (df = 275 in LD and 346 in DD for each compound). Error bars, ±1 s.e. Critical values of t for a two-sided test are given for p = .05 and .01. Compounds ordered by cluster membership – see Figure 4 (low abundance compounds are omitted). C21 and shorter chain methyl-alkanes have highly significantly higher mean in day than at night, while long chain n-alkanes (cluster 1) and clusters 2 and 3 (longer chain monoenes) highly significantly higher mean at night. For most compounds, mean day-night difference is not effected by presence of light in day (LD) or its absence (DD). However, cluster 4 members (tricosenes and C21) do show a significant increase in the day-night mean difference in LD.
