                Figure 1.  Gankyrin protein and mRNA levels are increased in cells lacking A-type lamins.(A) Western analysis comparing relative gankyrin protein levels in cell lines lacking A-type lamins, Lmna–/– fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells infected with siRNAs targeted to LMNA (siLmna) to the control cells, Lmna+/+ fibroblasts or NIH3T3 cells infected with siRNAs targeted to enhanced GFP (siEGFP). Actin levels indicate equivalent protein loading here and throughout the manuscript. (B) QPCR analysis comparing the relative mRNA's of gankyrin in cells lacking A-type lamins to the control cells. Data represent averages of triplicate experiments performed and mRNAs were normalized against Gapdh.
