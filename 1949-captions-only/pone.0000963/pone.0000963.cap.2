                Figure 2.  Reintroduction of human lamin A restores pRB and gankyrin expression.NIH3T3 siLmna cells were stably transduced with human lamin A (lamin A-res) that was designed to contain several silent codon changes at the target site of the siRNA, thereby rendering it resistant to the siRNA. (A) Western analysis comparing gankyrin and pRB protein levels in siLmna expressing lamin A-res (siLmna-lamin A resist) to siLmna infected with the control vector (siLmna-Cont). (B) QPCR analysis comparing the relative mRNA's of gankyrin in siLmna-lamin A resist cells to siLmna-Cont cells. Data represent averages of triplicate experiments performed and mRNAs were normalized against Gapdh.
