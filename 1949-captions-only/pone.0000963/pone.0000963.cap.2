(A) Western analysis comparing gankyrin and pRB protein levels in siLmna expressing lamin A-res (siLmna-lamin A resist) to siLmna infected with the control vector (siLmna-Cont). (B) QPCR analysis comparing the relative mRNA's of gankyrin in siLmna-lamin A resist cells to siLmna-Cont cells. Data represent averages of triplicate experiments performed and mRNAs were normalized against <em>Gapdh</em>.</p>
