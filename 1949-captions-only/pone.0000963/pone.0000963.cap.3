                Figure 3.  Overexpression of gankyrin reduces pRB levels and makes Lmna+/+ cells refractory to p16ink4a-induced arrest.(A) Western analysis of Lmna+/+ infected with a control plasmid, Lmna+/+-Cont, or gankyrin, Lmna+/+-Gank, and uninfected Lmna−/− fibroblasts. Rb−/− fibroblasts were included as a control for pRB levels. (B) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16ink4a or GFP-p21cip1 and GFP-positive cells were scored; S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified. Results are shown with standard deviations from triplicate samples; 150 cells were counted per sample. (C) Flow cytometry was conducted on Lmna+/+-Cont and Lmna+/+-Gank cells transfected with GFP or GFP-p16ink4a.
