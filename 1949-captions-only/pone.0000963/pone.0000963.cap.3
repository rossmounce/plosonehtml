(B) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16<sup>ink4a</sup> or GFP-p21<sup>cip1</sup> and GFP-positive cells were scored; S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified. Results are shown with standard deviations from triplicate samples; 150 cells were counted per sample. (C) Flow cytometry was conducted on <em>Lmna</em><sup>+/+</sup>-Cont and <em>Lmna</em><sup>+/+</sup>-Gank cells transfected with GFP or GFP-p16<sup>ink4a</sup>.</p>
