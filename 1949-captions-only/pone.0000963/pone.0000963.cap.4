(A) Western blot analysis comparing cells lacking lamin A/C and gankyrin (<em>Lmna</em><sup>−/−</sup>-siGank and siLmna/siGank) to cells only lacking lamin A/C. (B) Indirect immunofluorescence of <em>Lmna</em><sup>−/−</sup>-siGank, <em>Lmna</em><sup>−/−</sup>-siEGFP cells, and litter-mate control <em>Lmna</em><sup>+/+</sup> cells. Images comparing the cells were collected using equal exposure times and image processing. (C) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16<sup>ink4a</sup> or GFP-p21<sup>cip1</sup> and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified.</p>
