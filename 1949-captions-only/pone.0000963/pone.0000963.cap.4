                Figure 4.  Reduction of gankyrin in cells lacking lamin A/C does not restore pRB or p16ink4a sensitivity.Cells lacking lamin A/C (Lmna−/− and NIH3T3 siLmna cells) were infected with siRNAs targeted to gankyrin (siGank) or siRNAs targeted to a control gene, enhanced GFP (siEGFP). (A) Western blot analysis comparing cells lacking lamin A/C and gankyrin (Lmna−/−-siGank and siLmna/siGank) to cells only lacking lamin A/C. (B) Indirect immunofluorescence of Lmna−/−-siGank, Lmna−/−-siEGFP cells, and litter-mate control Lmna+/+ cells. Images comparing the cells were collected using equal exposure times and image processing. (C) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16ink4a or GFP-p21cip1 and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified.
