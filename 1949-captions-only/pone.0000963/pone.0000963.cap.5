(A) Western blot analysis comparing pRB levels in siEGFP cells, siLmna-Cont, and siLmna-p14. (B) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16ink4a or GFP-p21cip1 and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified. (C) siEGFP and siLmna cells were transfected with GFP-p14arf and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. (D) siEGFP and siLmna cells were transfected with GFP-p14arf and the GFP positive cells were sorted using FACS analysis.</p>
