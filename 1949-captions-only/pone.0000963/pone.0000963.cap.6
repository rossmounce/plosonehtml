                Figure 6.  Expression of p14arf in siLmna/siGank cells does not restore pRB levels or p16ink4a sensitivity.NIH3T3 cells were infected with siRNAs targeted to Lmna and Gankyrin and then stably transduced with a V5 tagged p14arf (siLmna/siGank-p14). (A) Western blot analysis comparing pRB levels in siEGFP cells, siLmna, siLmna/siGank, and siLmna/siGank-p14. (B) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16ink4a or GFP-p21cip1 and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified.
