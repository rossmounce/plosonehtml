(A) Western blot analysis comparing pRB levels in siEGFP cells, siLmna, siLmna/siGank, and siLmna/siGank-p14. (B) Cells were transfected with GFP-p16<sup>ink4a</sup> or GFP-p21<sup>cip1</sup> and the S-phase cells were identified by BrdU incorporation. The percentage of cells positive for GFP and BrdU incorporation were quantified.</p>
