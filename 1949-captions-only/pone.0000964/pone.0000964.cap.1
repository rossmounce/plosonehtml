                Figure 1.  Schematic diagram of experimental approach.A bacterial recombinant expression system produced various gluthathione-S-transferase decapeptide fusion proteins which were bound to gluthatione and labeled with 32P utilizing protein kinase A. After washing, the labeled decapeptides were recovered after thrombin digestion and incubated at various times with several different cell lines.
