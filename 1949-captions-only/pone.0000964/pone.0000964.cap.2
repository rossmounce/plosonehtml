Seven cell lines demonstrated avid binding of MA5 and are shown as bar graphs of the mean and one standard deviation in triplicate wells. The remaining eleven cell lines, along with one blank well averaged only 365 cpm. These values are so small as to not be visible at the scale used in this figure. Further information on the individual cell lines is provided in the Supplemental Information.</p>
