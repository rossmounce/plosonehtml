                Figure 3.  Relative levels of binding of nine 32P-labeled decapeptide variants.(A) Nine 32P-labeled different decapeptides, varying from one another by only one to three amino acids, were incubated with Caco-2 cells for two hours, the cells washed three times, and counts remaining bound to the cells are shown as a percentage of the total amount of counts for each decapeptide used. Amino acid substitutions for each variant (relative to MA1) are underlined and bolded. (B) The variants, MA1, MA4, and MA5 were incubated with Caco-2 cells for intervals varying from five minutes to two hours, washed, the adherent cells dissolved in gel loading buffer and an aliquot run on a 10%–20% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The three lanes marked “24h” (lanes 5, 10, and 15) were incubated with the respective labeled decapeptides (MA1, MA4, MA5) for two hours, washed, and the cells incubated with complete medium for 24 hours. The cells were treated as described for the other lanes of this figure.
