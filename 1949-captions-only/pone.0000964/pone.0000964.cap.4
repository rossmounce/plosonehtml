Following a 24 hour incubation, the number of counts per minute released into the medium (R) as well as the number of counts remaining bound to the cells (B) were determined. Each bar shows the mean and one standard deviation of triplicates wells. (B) Time course for the release and retention of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled decapeptide MA5. MA5 was incubated for two hours with Caco-2 cells, the cells washed, and the cpm released (dashed line) as well as remaining bound (solid line) to the cells determined for time intervals post-washing. Each point shows the mean plus/minus one standard deviation of triplicate determinations. C) Radioactive well contents described as bound (solid line) in <a href="#pone-0000964-g004">Figure 4B</a> were run on a 16.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and exposed to film. Immediately after washing (<em>i.e.,</em> at 0 hours), the majority of the counts were visualized as <sup>32</sup>P-peptide. Over the next 48 hours, the peptide counts greatly diminished, with the majority of bound radioactivity incorporated into cellular proteins. (D) Aliquots of medium containing the released (dotted line) <sup>32</sup>P-peptide MA5 were assayed at time intervals after washing, as described in <a href="#pone-0000964-g004">Figure 4B</a>. As time progressed, more of the <sup>32</sup>P-peptide was released, reaching a plateau by 24 hours after washing.</p>
