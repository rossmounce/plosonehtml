                Figure 1.  Structure and position of the Ds element in strain ET500.(A) Sequence of the Ds element and adjacent sequences showing the important elements. The insert is flanked by 7 bp target site duplication (boxed). DNA outside the duplicated target sequences are identical to the surrounding plant DNA sequence. Sequence of the 598 bp inverted repeat is identical to a fragment of the T-DNA containing 3′-octopine synthase promoter (3′OCS) and the right border (RB) element. Black circle within the boxed sequence shows the site of sequence inversion. (B) Structure of the Ds element. The Ds element contains a promoter-less bacterial GUS gene just inside the leftward TIR, and a bacterial NPTII gene with its own promoter. A plant-specific promoter-enhancer element (stippled oval) 5′ to the Ds insertion site confers constitutive GUS expression. (C) Map of the chromosomal region containing Ds. Numbers denote the first base on chromosome 4 (counting from the top) for the respective site. Roman numerals denote the two genetic intervals assayed for crossover. The transposase source, Ac, was unlinked to chromosome 4, and was present only in the experimental cross. Superscripts identify La-er (L) and No-0 (N) alleles.
