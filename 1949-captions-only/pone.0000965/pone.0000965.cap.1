The insert is flanked by 7 bp target site duplication (boxed). DNA outside the duplicated target sequences are identical to the surrounding plant DNA sequence. Sequence of the 598 bp inverted repeat is identical to a fragment of the T-DNA containing 3′-octopine synthase promoter (3′OCS) and the right border (RB) element. Black circle within the boxed sequence shows the site of sequence inversion. (B) Structure of the <em>Ds</em> element. The <em>Ds</em> element contains a promoter-less bacterial <em>GUS</em> gene just inside the leftward TIR, and a bacterial <em>NPTII</em> gene with its own promoter. A plant-specific promoter-enhancer element (stippled oval) 5′ to the <em>Ds</em> insertion site confers constitutive <em>GUS</em> expression. (C) Map of the chromosomal region containing <em>Ds</em>. Numbers denote the first base on chromosome 4 (counting from the top) for the respective site. Roman numerals denote the two genetic intervals assayed for crossover. The transposase source, <em>Ac</em>, was unlinked to chromosome 4, and was present only in the experimental cross. Superscripts identify La-er (L) and No-0 (N) alleles.</p>
