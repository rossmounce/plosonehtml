                Figure 2.  Excision of Ds.(A) A leaf of a parental Ds strain homozygous for Ds (ET500), showing uniform GUS+ staining. (B) GUS− somatic sectors due to Ds excision in F1 of ET500×NaeAc. (C) Southern blot analysis showing the excision of Ds. Upper panel was probed with GUS; lower panel represents the same blot cut off between 2kb and 3kb markers, and probed with DCL1 cDNA sequences as a loading control [19]. Lane 1, ET500 parental (before Ds excision). Lanes 2-3, DNA from two independent F2 derivatives of ET500×NaeAc showing Ds excision, and lane 4, DNA from an F2 plant showing excision and reinsertion of Ds to another location. (D) Amplification of molecular markers: Landsberg erecta (L); Nossen (N); heterozygous (L/N) Left hand panel, nga8; middle panel, Ga1.1/BsaB1; right hand panel, nga1111.
