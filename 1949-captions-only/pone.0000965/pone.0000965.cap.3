Boxed bases are the 7bp duplicated target sequence. Thin straight arrows show putative transposase nick sites, curved arrows depict <em>trans</em>-esterification reaction between the 3′ OH group of one strand and the 5′ phosphate of the other, and arrowheads show the points of ligation. Gap repair synthesis bases are in bold and direction of synthesis is shown by an arrow; deleted bases are underlined. Note the absence of symmetrical targets flanking the excision site. (D) Model explaining the formation of a less common footprint.</p>
