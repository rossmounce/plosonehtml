The 598bp inverted repeat is immediately 3′ of the <em>Ds</em> 3′ TIR. The duplicated target half sites (gray boxes) flank the 5′ TIR (typical) and the 598bp inverted repeat (atypical). (B) Excision of <em>Ds</em> yields broken ends that are adjacent to the leftward duplicated target at the 5′ end of <em>Ds</em> and to the 598bp inverted repeat at the 3′ end of <em>Ds</em>, and is predicted to destroy a <em>Sac</em>I site. (C) Southern blot analysis of plant DNA digested with <em>Sac</em>I, confirming <em>Ds</em> excision. Upper panel (labelled GUS) was probed with GUS sequences, stripped and reprobed with one-half of the 598bp inverted repeat sequence (middle panel, labelled 598bp). Lower portion of blot was cut out and probed with <em>DCL1</em> cDNA sequences as a loading control (lower panel, labelled DCL1). Lanes 1–5 contained DNA from F2 lines with empty donor sites; lane 6, ET500 parent. The up-shift in band size between ET500 parent and F2 progeny plants in the middle panel is because of destruction of a <em>Sac</em>1 site due to excision. Lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5; F2 progeny had lost <em>Ds</em> from the genome, but retained the 598bp fragment. Lane 3; F2 progeny had a reinsertion of <em>Ds</em> but retained the 598bp fragment at the original locus. (D) Southern blot analysis of <em>Sac</em>I digested DNA showing movement of the 598bp segment. Lanes 1 and 2 had F2 DNA from two independent F1 lines, and lane 3 had ET500 parental DNA. Probes were as labelled for panel (C). Lane 1 shows an F1 line in which the <em>Ds</em> and the 598bp inverted repeat had a change of position. Lane 2 shows a line that had lost <em>Ds</em> but not the 598bp inverted repeat sequence from the original location. Hybridization signals expected from the original location are identified with triangles; signals due to sequence alteration are identified with circles (loss of <em>Sac</em>I site adjacent to 598 bp repeat), asterisks denote movement of GUS and the 598bp repeat to another location.</p>
