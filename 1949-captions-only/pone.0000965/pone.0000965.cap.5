                Figure 5.  Excision of Ds with atypical flanking DNA.(A) Configuration of Ds in ET500 parental Ds element with NPTII, GUS, 5′ and 3′ TIRs. The 598bp inverted repeat is immediately 3′ of the Ds 3′ TIR. The duplicated target half sites (gray boxes) flank the 5′ TIR (typical) and the 598bp inverted repeat (atypical). (B) Excision of Ds yields broken ends that are adjacent to the leftward duplicated target at the 5′ end of Ds and to the 598bp inverted repeat at the 3′ end of Ds, and is predicted to destroy a SacI site. (C) Southern blot analysis of plant DNA digested with SacI, confirming Ds excision. Upper panel (labelled GUS) was probed with GUS sequences, stripped and reprobed with one-half of the 598bp inverted repeat sequence (middle panel, labelled 598bp). Lower portion of blot was cut out and probed with DCL1 cDNA sequences as a loading control (lower panel, labelled DCL1). Lanes 1–5 contained DNA from F2 lines with empty donor sites; lane 6, ET500 parent. The up-shift in band size between ET500 parent and F2 progeny plants in the middle panel is because of destruction of a Sac1 site due to excision. Lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5; F2 progeny had lost Ds from the genome, but retained the 598bp fragment. Lane 3; F2 progeny had a reinsertion of Ds but retained the 598bp fragment at the original locus. (D) Southern blot analysis of SacI digested DNA showing movement of the 598bp segment. Lanes 1 and 2 had F2 DNA from two independent F1 lines, and lane 3 had ET500 parental DNA. Probes were as labelled for panel (C). Lane 1 shows an F1 line in which the Ds and the 598bp inverted repeat had a change of position. Lane 2 shows a line that had lost Ds but not the 598bp inverted repeat sequence from the original location. Hybridization signals expected from the original location are identified with triangles; signals due to sequence alteration are identified with circles (loss of SacI site adjacent to 598 bp repeat), asterisks denote movement of GUS and the 598bp repeat to another location.
