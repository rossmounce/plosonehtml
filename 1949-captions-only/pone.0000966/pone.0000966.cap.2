                Figure 2.  Distribution of pairwise nucleotide divergence values between 101 HRV serotypes.The horizontal axis shows the value of divergence (%) in pairwise comparisons and the column height indicates the frequency of observations. Divergence values were calculated as distance value√ó100%.
