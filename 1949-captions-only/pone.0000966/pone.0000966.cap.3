                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic tree depicting the relationships among all 101 HRV serotypes in the P1-P2 region of 5'NCR.This tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method according to the distances (divergences) between all pairs of sequences in a multiple alignment. The confidence of sequence clustering was evaluated by bootstrapping (1000 replicates). Only significant bootstrap values (&gt;500) were shown. The scale bar (top left) represents the genetic distance (nucleotide substitutions per site). The 101 HRV serotypes (R) clustered into 2 previously defined groups: HRVA and HRVB with a perfect bootstrap value (1000). HRVA group had 76 serotypes and HRVB, 25 serotypes.
