                Figure 4.  Phylogenetic tree depicting the relationships among 101 HRV serotypes (R) and 26 new strains (W) in the P1-P2 region of 5'NCR.This tree was generated as described in Figure 3. None of the new strains clustered with HRVB viruses. Seventeen new strains (blue) belonged to HRVA group, and 9 strains (red) cluster into a new group (“C”) that is separate from groups A and B.
