                Figure 5.  Phylogenetic tree depicting the relationships between 9 HRVC strains (W in red) and all known HEV (n = 74) in the P1-P2 region of 5'NCR. HEV include polioviruses (PV), coxsackieviruses A (CA), coxsackieviruses B (CB), echoviruses (E) and the newer numbered EVs.For 5 serotypes (CA16, CA24, CB4, CB5 and EV71), 2 different P1-P2 sequences were found in GenBank. This tree was generated as described in Figure 3. HRVC and HEV clustered into 2 different groups.
