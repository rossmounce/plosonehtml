                Figure 1.  Overview of SLiMFinder.An input dataset is first clustered into unrelated protein clusters (UPC) using a treatment of BLAST results to identify evolutionary relationships. The dataset is also masked according to user choices, masking out predicted ordered regions, selected UniProt features, low complexity regions and/or N-terminal methionines. This (masked) dataset is then processed by the SLiMBuild algorithm to identify motifs that are shared by unrelated proteins. A TEIRESIAS-style output of all motifs can be produced at this point. Amino acid frequencies are calculated for each cluster of unrelated proteins, either before or after masking, and may be retained as cluster-specific frequencies or averaged over all clusters. Alternatively, amino acid frequencies may be given from an external source. These frequencies are combined with data from SLiMBuild on the motif composition of the dataset and processed by the SLiMChance algorithm, which identifies significantly over-represented motifs. These motifs and additional dataset information are then output into results files.
