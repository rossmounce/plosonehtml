Dimer construction. For each position in a sequence, each possible wildcard length x is used to find possible “i-x-j” dimers. Dimers containing masked (“X”) residues are ignored (greyed dimers). Note that the n-terminal “̂” marker is treated as any other amino acid. B. Motif extension. Longer SLiMs are constructed during the SLiMBuild process by matching the occurrences of shorter SLiMs with the relevant i-x-j dimers. At each stage, only SLiMs with sufficient unrelated protein support are retained, making the algorithm very efficient.</p>
