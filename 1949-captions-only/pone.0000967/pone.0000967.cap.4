Cumulative frequency of the most significant motifs returned by SLiMFinder for random datasets. Very little difference is observed between datasets produced using human amino acid frequencies and datasets of actual human protein sequences, implying that there is little or no bias introduced by regional compositional biases within real protein sequences. B. Box plots of most significant results returned by all random datasets for different dataset sizes (UPC). Although there is a slight trend for larger datasets to return smaller p-values, the difference is primarily restricted to the non-significant motifs. Variation between datasets of the same size is considerably greater than variation between different sized datasets.</p>
