                Figure 1.  Confirmation of the genetic signatures of MIP (A) PCR with ITS region sequences showing a ~350 bp amplicon, M-100 bp marker (B) MIP strain confirmation PCR with hsp65 gene region, M-100 bp marker.This 441 bp amplicon was having all the 4 unique substitutions known for MIP (C) Sequence alignment of ITS sequence of MIP with MAIC organism (D) IS900 PCR to rule out MAPC lineage-M: marker, Lane 1: M. paratuberculosis control PCR, lanes 2 and 3: MIP.
