B. Phylogenetic tree constructed based on consensus multigene alignment which involved concatenation of individual gene sequences corresponding to <em>rpo</em>B, <em>rec</em>A, <em>sod</em>A, <em>rrn</em>16 and <em>hsp</em>65. Bootstrap values conveying significance of the internal branch topology are clearly marked near each branch. Values above 50 were deemed to be significant to convey correct topology of the internal branches.</p>
