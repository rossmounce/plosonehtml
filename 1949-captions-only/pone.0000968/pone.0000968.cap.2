                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic trees based on FAFLP and multigene sequence analyses. A. Polymorphic fragments were subjected to allele calling in Genotyper (Applied Biosystems, USA) and allele scoring was recorded in a binary format.This binary data were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (please see methods). B. Phylogenetic tree constructed based on consensus multigene alignment which involved concatenation of individual gene sequences corresponding to rpoB, recA, sodA, rrn16 and hsp65. Bootstrap values conveying significance of the internal branch topology are clearly marked near each branch. Values above 50 were deemed to be significant to convey correct topology of the internal branches.
