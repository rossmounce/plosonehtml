ERIC based fingerprinting. B. Phylogenetic analysis. Polymorphic ERIC fragments were subjected to allele calling in Quantity 1 software (Biorad, USA) and scoring was recorded in a binary format. These binary data were used to construct a phylogenetic tree developed using bootstrapping methods in MEGA software. Bootstrap values for the internal branch topology are clearly marked near each branch. Values above 50 were assumed as significant to convey acceptable topology of the internal branches.</p>
