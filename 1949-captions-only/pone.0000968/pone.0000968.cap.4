Divergence of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> W-Beijing was deduced based on the RD105 <a href="#pone.0000968-Kong1">[41]</a>. The inferred time points of some important lineage divergences mentioned as years-before-present (years BP) on the basis of the conventions established earlier <a href="#pone.0000968-Sreevatsan1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000968-Brosch1">[24]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000968-Gutierrez1">[42]</a>.
