                Figure 4.  Landscape of genome evolution across the ‘generalist’ and ‘specialist’ mycobacterial lineages.Various RDs refer to genomic deletion points as discussed elsewhere [24]. Divergence of M. tuberculosis W-Beijing was deduced based on the RD105 [41]. The inferred time points of some important lineage divergences mentioned as years-before-present (years BP) on the basis of the conventions established earlier [15], [24], [42].
