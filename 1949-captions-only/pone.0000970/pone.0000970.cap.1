                Figure 1.  Synopsis of vosA.(A) Colonies of WT (RNIW5) and multi-copy vosA (MvosA) strains grown on solid MM at 37Â°C for 3 d together with the close-up views (lower panel). (B) A phylogenetic tree of proteins similar to VosA generated by MegAlign in Lasergene v7.0 (DNASTAR). ClustalV method was used for protein alignment. An: A. nidulans, Af: A. fumigatus, Ao: A. oryzae, Ap: A. parasiticus, Ci: Coccidioides immitis, Mg: Magnaporthe grisea; Cg: Chaetomium globosum; Nc: Neurospora crassa; Um: Ustilago maydis; Cn: Cryptococcus neoformans; Gz: Gibberella zeae. (C) Levels of vosA mRNA throughout the lifecycle of WT. Numbers indicate the time (h) of incubation in liquid MM (Veg) and post-asexual (Asex) or sexual (Sex) developmental induction. C and Ac represent conidia and ascospores. Last lane shows elevated vosA mRNA level in the MvosA colony grown on solid MM for 3 d. (D) Levels of the VosA protein throughout the lifecycle of a vosA(p)::VosA::FLAG strain (TNI10.34.1). Arrows indicate two protein bands. (E) Levels of AfvosA mRNA during the lifecycle of A. fumigatus WT.
