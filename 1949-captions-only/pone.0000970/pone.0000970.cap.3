                Figure 3.  Requirement of VosA for trehalose accumulation and stress tolerance.(A) The amount of trehalose (pg) per conidium in the freshly collected 2 d old conidia of WT (FGSC4, veA+ and FGSC26, veA1) and ΔvosA (RNI14.1, ΔvosA; veA+ and RNI10.2, ΔvosA; veA1) strains (triplicate). No trehalase treatment served as a negative control. (B) Levels of tpsA, tpsC, orlA, treA and treB transcripts in WT (FGSC26) and ΔvosA (RNI10.2) strains. (C–D) Tolerance of WT (filled bar) and the ΔvosA mutant (open bar) to heat (C) or oxidative (D) stress.
