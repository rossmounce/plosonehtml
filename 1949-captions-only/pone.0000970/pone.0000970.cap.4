                Figure 4.  VosA is a negative regulator of development.(A) Hyperactive conidiation caused by ΔvosA (photographed at 24 h in liquid MM). The arrows indicate conidiophores. (B) Levels of vosA, brlA, rodA, abaA, yA, wetA and wA transcripts in WT (FGSC26) and ΔvosA (RNI10.2) strains in liquid MM (Veg) and post developmental induction (Asex). A dot between the ΔvosA Veg 18 and 24 lanes in abaA hybridization is an artifact. (C) Photographs of the colonies of WT (FGSC26) and vosA overexpression (TNI9.1) strains grown on non-inducing (MMG) and inducing (MMT + YE) medium at 37°C for 3 d. (D) Northern blot for levels of vosA and brlA mRNA in control (TJA53.1) and alcA(p)::vosA (TNI9.1) strains.
