                Figure 5.  VosA is a potential TF and localizes in the nucleus of mature conidia.(A) Designated transformants were spotted in serial dilutions on Ura- MM (u-) and Ura-His- MM (u-h-) with various concentrations of 3AT. Yeast colonies were photographed after incubation at 30°C for 48 h. Mean LacZ activity (+/−SD; triplicate) is shown. (B) A simplified diagram of a conidiophore. (C) Control (gpdA[p]::RFP; TNI20.1) and vosA(p)::VosA::RFP (TNI13.3) strains were incubated on solid MM at 37°C for 24 and 48 h. Conidiophores were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33258 and images of DIC, RFP, Hoechst and the merge of RFP and Hoechst are shown. Yellow arrow indicates newly formed conidia and white arrow indicates mature conidia. Note that VosA mainly localizes in the nucleus of mature conidia.
