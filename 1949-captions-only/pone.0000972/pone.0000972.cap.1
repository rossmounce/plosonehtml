                Figure 1.  Inhibition of the charging of valine by analog N15.The intensity of the d15-Val-AMP in the absence (A) or presence (B) of analog N15 (50 mM) is shown. Valine was present in both assays at 50 ÂµM. The difference in the ratio of Val-AMP and d15-Val-AMP in the assays was used for the inhibition calculation. As expected for a ValRS substrate, a peak corresponding to the d15-N15-AMP was also observed in the analog-containing assay. This peak was not used in the determination of inhibition.
