Valine was present in both assays at 50 ÂµM. The difference in the ratio of Val-AMP and <em>d</em><sub>15</sub>-Val-AMP in the assays was used for the inhibition calculation. As expected for a ValRS substrate, a peak corresponding to the <em>d</em><sub>15</sub>-N15-AMP was also observed in the analog-containing assay. This peak was not used in the determination of inhibition.</p>
