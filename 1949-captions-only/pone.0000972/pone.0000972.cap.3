<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3"></a><p>We have confirmed the efficient translation of the Lys analog, <em>S</em>-2-aminoethyl cysteine (C7) <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Levengood1">[19]</a>, and observed that another Lys analog, trans-dehydro lysine (C8), was translated with high efficiency. C8 is incorporated into collagen in a chick embryo system <a href="#pone.0000972-Christner1">[20]</a>; both C7 and C8 exhibit antibacterial activity due to their ability to bind and inhibit bacterial riboswitches involved in lysine biosynthesis <a href="#pone.0000972-Blount1">[21]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4"></a><p>The positively charged Leu analog aza-leucine (C9) was a strong competitive inhibitor of LeuRS, and was also translated efficiently. Incorporation of this analog into protein is consistent with several reports, including upregulation of heat-shock genes when <em>E. coli</em> is challenged with aza-leucine <a href="#pone.0000972-Lemeignan1">[22]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Sabina1">[23]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5"></a><p>Of the four arginine analogs found to be AARS substrates, <span class="small-caps">l-</span>canavanine (C10) <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Hortin1">[24]</a> was translated efficiently, while <span class="small-caps">l-</span>NMMA (N<sup>G</sup>-methyl arginine) (C11) was translated with somewhat lower efficiency (65% peptide yield relative to Arg). N<sup>G</sup>-hydroxy arginine (C12) and vinyl-L-NIO (C13) did not yield any detectable peptide, and were also poor competitors in the AARS assay.</p>


<h4>Polar, uncharged</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Two polar but uncharged amino acid analogs are excellent translation substrates (<a href="#pone-0000972-g003">Figure 3</a>). Of these, we and others had previously observed <span class="small-caps">dl-</span><em>β</em>-hydroxy norvaline (P5) to be an excellent threonine surrogate in translation reactions <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Hortin1">[24]</a>. Remarkably, the <span class="small-caps">l-</span>Glu γ-methyl ester (P7) efficiently substituted for methionine in all steps of translation; fully formylated peptides containing the expected double incorporation of P7 were observed in experiments with template <em>e</em>. This analog is found in the microviridins, peptides produced by certain cyanobacteria, which were initially isolated as elastase inhibitors <a href="#pone.0000972-Murakami2">[25]</a>. In contrast, the <span class="small-caps">l-</span>Asp <em>β</em>-methyl ester (P6) led to the translation of a heterogeneous mixture of peptides, including the non-formylated peptide and peptides that initiated at codons other than methionine, suggesting that the initiation complex does not tolerate this analog.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>Of the three analogs previously found to be GlnRS substrates (P1–P3), <span class="small-caps">l-</span>glutamic acid γ-hydrazide <a href="#pone.0000972-Lea1">[18]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Neal1">[26]</a>, <span class="small-caps">l-</span>albizziine <a href="#pone.0000972-Lea1">[18]</a>, and <span class="small-caps">l-</span>theanine<a href="#pone.0000972-Lea1">[18]</a>, only the hydrazide was tolerated by the translation apparatus. Acivicin (P4), the cyclic anti-cancer agent and γ-glutamanyl transpeptidase inhibitor <a href="#pone.0000972-Ahluwalia1">[27]</a> was not translated efficiently, consistent with its poor activity in the IleRS competition assay.</p>


<h4>Aromatic Analogs</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>We examined two histidine analogs, <em>β</em>-2-thiazolyl-alanine (A1) and <em>β</em>-(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl-alanine) (A2) <a href="#pone.0000972-Ikeda1">[28]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000972-Beiboer1">[30]</a>; A2 allowed efficient peptide synthesis as described <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, but we could not detect any peptide product containing A1 (<a href="#pone-0000972-g004">Figure 4</a>). A1 also showed poorer competitive inhibition of HisRS (<a href="#pone-0000972-t001">Table 1</a>). Our observations are entirely consistent with earlier in vivo experiments in which a His-auxotrophic <em>E. coli</em> strain was used to show that A2, but not A1, could be incorporated into a specific protein <a href="#pone.0000972-Ikeda1">[28]</a>.</p>
