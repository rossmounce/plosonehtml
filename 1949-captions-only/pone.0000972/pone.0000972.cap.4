Use of the PheRS A294G mutant allowed several previously described <em>p</em>-substituted analogs (A9–A13) <a href="#pone.0000972-Kirshenbaum1">[32]</a> chloro, bromo, iodo, ethynyl, and azido, to be introduced into peptides in good yields. However, <em>p</em>-nitrophenylalanine (A14) was poorly translated in the presence of this synthetase. Each of the poorly translated Phe analogs were also poor competitors in the AARS assay (all showed less than 25% inhibition).</p>

<h4>Nonpolar</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>A wide variety of nonpolar substrates were translated efficiently (<a href="#pone-0000972-g005">Figure 5</a>). We examined a large number of Met analogs using template e, <sup>3</sup>H-His for labeling, and the His<sub>6</sub> tag for peptide purification. We confirmed the translatability of many previously reported methionine analogs <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Spizek1">[38]</a>–<a href="#pone.0000972-Kiick1">[40]</a> in our assay including 2-amino hex-5-ynoic acid, crotylglycine, <span class="small-caps">l-</span>norleucine,<span class="small-caps"> l-</span>norvaline, <span class="small-caps">l-</span>ethionine, and <span class="small-caps">l-</span>β-azidohomoalanine, and (N1-N6). On the other hand, four other MetRS substrates, 6,6,6-trifluoronorleucine (N7), 2-amino-4,4,4-trifluorobutyric acid (N8), <span class="small-caps">l-</span>C-propargyl glycine (N9) <a href="#pone.0000972-Kiick2">[41]</a>, and <span class="small-caps">l-</span>allyl glycine (N10) <a href="#pone.0000972-Kiick2">[41]</a> resulted in poor translation initiation and/or elongation without any evidence for misincorporation. Analog N10 (as well as N6) <a href="#pone.0000972-Josephson1">[1]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Tang1">[42]</a> could, however, be charged and incorporated using the editing deficient LeuRS D345A <a href="#pone.0000972-Lincecum1">[43]</a>. β-Cyclopropyl alanine (N11) was efficiently translated, but the resulting peptide was a mixture of full length peptide and peptide lacking the N-terminal residue, suggesting initiation with N11 was difficult. The photoactive diazirine bearing Met analog (N26) <a href="#pone.0000972-Suchanek1">[44]</a> was efficiently incorporated into peptide. This analog, also known as photo-Met, should be a useful probe for studying the binding sites of in vitro translated peptides on protein targets.</p>
