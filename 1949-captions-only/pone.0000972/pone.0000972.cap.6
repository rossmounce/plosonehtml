<h4>β-amino acids</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>Although one β<sub>2</sub> (β10) and eleven β<sub>3</sub> (β1–β9, β11) amino acids are known to be AARS substrates <a href="#pone.0000972-Hartman1">[11]</a>, none were incorporated into peptides by the translation apparatus (<a href="#pone-0000972-g006">Figure 6</a>). Although this is a disappointing result, it is consistent with previous reports of poor to undetectable incorporation of β-amino acids in translation experiments <a href="#pone.0000972-Bain1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Tan1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Roesser1">[50]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Ellman1">[51]</a>. Literature reports do suggest that β-amino acids can act as peptide donors at the ribosome P site <a href="#pone.0000972-Heckler2">[52]</a>. This is consistent with our finding that β9 is able to serve as an initiator amino acid, albeit inefficiently. Very recently, Sando and coworkers have found that β−hydroxy acids are competent translation substrates and have suggested that the elevated pKa of the amine in β−amino acids prevents deprotonation and peptidyl transfer <a href="#pone.0000972-Sando1">[53]</a>. If this interpretation is correct, ribosome engineering may be required to enable the efficient incorporation of β-amino acids into peptides.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2"></a><p>One difficulty with our studies of the aminoacylation of the β-amino acids is that some of them have an identical mass to their natural analogs (β2, β4–β6, and β11). Since it is impossible to rule out natural amino acid contamination using our MALDI-MS assay for tRNA aminoacylation, it was possible that these analogs were not actually charged. However, the observation that they are not translated confirms that they are charged onto tRNA, since tRNA charging with contaminating natural amino acid would have led to efficient peptide translation.</p>


<h4><em>N</em>-methyl amino acids</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>The <em>N</em>-methyl amino acids are of particular interest since they are very common in the natural product non-ribosomal peptides, to which they are thought to contribute protease resistance and membrane permeability. Of the six <em>N-</em>methyl amino acids that were AARS substrates (M1–M6, <a href="#pone-0000972-g006">Figure 6</a>) only <em>N-</em>methyl Asp (M3) and <em>N-</em>methyl His (M4) resulted in even moderate yields of translated peptide. One of the difficulties in testing the translation of these compounds was that many of them were contaminated with very small amounts of the unmethylated, natural amino acid. In order to remove this contamination an excess of the <em>N-</em>methyl amino acid was put into an AARS reaction. Since the contaminating natural amino acid is a more efficient substrate than the <em>N-</em>methyl analog and is at a much lower concentration, most of the natural amino acid became attached to the tRNA and was removed by EtOH precipitation <a href="#pone.0000972-Soutourina1">[54]</a>. The <em>N-</em>methyl AA containing EtOH layer was kept and evaporated. After repeating this procedure twice, formation of the natural amino acid-containing peptides was greatly suppressed. Unfortunately, the yields of <em>N</em>-methyl amino acid containing peptides remained low for M1, M2, M5 and M6, possibly due to the synthesis of limiting amounts of aminoacylated tRNA by the synthetase enzymes as evidenced by the poor ability of all of the <em>N</em>-methyl AAs to serve as competitors in our AARS assay.</p>


<h4>α-hydroxy carboxylic acids</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1"></a><p>Alpha-hydroxy acids are another interesting class of backbone analogs that are also the defining component of the depsipeptides, a subset of the natural product non-ribosomal peptides. Every substitution of an amide linkage for an ester linkage in a depsipeptide removes one hydrogen bond donor from the molecule, which may contribute significantly to membrane permeability <a href="#pone.0000972-Veber1">[55]</a>. The incorporation of α-hydroxy acids into peptides by ribosomal translation has generally been accomplished by chemical transformation of aminoacyl-tRNA after enzymatic charging <a href="#pone.0000972-Fahnestock1">[56]</a> or by chemical tRNA acylation <a href="#pone.0000972-Tan1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Bain2">[37]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Koh1">[57]</a>. Since the α-hydroxy acids lack an α-amino group, their potential activity as AARS substrates cannot be determined by our MALDI-MS assay. We therefore studied their ability to be translated directly, by replacing one amino acid at a time with the corresponding α-hydroxy acid using the appropriate templates (<em>a–e</em>). Of the 13 commercially available α-hydroxy analogs (Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Ser, Val, Trp, Tyr), only one, α-hydroxy methionine (OM), was competent in translation. Interestingly, the peptide products of translation with OM using template e (<a href="#pone-0000972-g002">Figure 2</a>) showed defects in initiation including lack of formylation and initiation at internal codons (<a href="#pone-0000972-g007">Figure 7</a>). Since α-hydroxy methionine differs in mass from methionine by only +1, we desired corroborating chemical evidence for its incorporation. When incorporated into peptides, α-hydroxy acids introduce alkali-labile ester linkages <a href="#pone.0000972-Fahnestock1">[56]</a>. We examined the sensitivity to partial alkaline hydrolysis (<a href="#pone-0000972-g007">Figure 7</a>) of peptides designed to incorporate methionine between two His<sub>6</sub> tags (template f). Mild hydrolysis led to cleavage of the ester-containing peptides <a href="#pone.0000972-Fahnestock1">[56]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000972-Millward1">[58]</a> and gave peptide fragments of the expected masses. As expected, treatment of the methionine containing peptide showed no cleavage.</p>
