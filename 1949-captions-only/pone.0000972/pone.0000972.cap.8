                Figure 8.  Analog incorporation efficiency and fidelity in the presence of the other 19 natural amino acids and their AARSs.Reactions used templates h and i and each reaction tested one unnatural amino acid analog. Analogs that yielded non-homogeneous peptide products at 0.1 mM, were tested again at 1 mM.
