Incorporation of multiple unnatural AAs into a single peptide.(A) Mass spectrum of the peptides produced by in vitro translation of template g with all 15 natural amino acids. (B) Mass spectrum of the peptides produced from in vitro translation of template g with 13 unnatural and 2 natural amino acids. (C) Structure of the unnatural peptide that is the major product of in vitro translation of template g with unnatural amino acids.
