                Figure 2.  Median-joining networks of (a) mtDNA hypervariable region 1 sequences and (b) NRY microsatellites in the Ngogo (grey circles), Sonso (black circles), Kanyawara (white circles), and Mugiri (thatched circles) chimpanzee communities.Circle size is proportional to haplotype frequency. Small squares separating haplotypes represent mutations.
