<h4>Population sampling and laboratory methods</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>We examined mtDNA and NRY variation in four communities of chimpanzees (number of mtDNA/NRY-chromosomes sampled in parentheses): the Sonso (28/16) community of Budongo Forest Reserve, the Ngogo (94/41) and Kanyawara (20/10) communities of Kibale National Park, and the Mugiri (7/6) community of Semliki National Park. We also analyzed previously published data from five patrilocal Dravidian tribes from India (Vanne (32/23), Pokanati (59/25), Panta (37/21), Kapu (22/16) and Akhutota (32/21)), five patrilocal Mundari tribes from India (Santhal (39/38), Munda (23/23), Kharia (21/13), Bhumij (40/39) and Asur (30/28)), three patrilocal Hill tribes from Thailand (Akha (91/21), Chiang Rae Lisu (53/9) and Mae Hong Son Lisu (42/22)), four patrilocal tribes from the lowlands of Western New Guinea (Awyu (12/10), Citak (40/28), Mappi (18/10) and Muyu (10/6)), and three patrilocal tribes from the highlands of Western New Guinea (Dani (21/12), Ketengeban (22/19) and Una (51/46). Subjects were sequenced at the first hypervariable control region of the mtDNA and genotyped at microsatellite loci on the NRY. The chimpanzees were sequenced at 473 bases and genotyped at 9 microsatellite loci following procedures described elsewhere <a href="#pone.0000973-Eriksson1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000973-Eriksson2">[22]</a>. The Genbank (http://<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) accession numbers for the chimpanzee mtDNA sequences are EU077270-EU077418. Supplementary <a href="#pone.0000973.s001">Table S1</a> shows the chimpanzee NRY microsatellite haplotypes and their occurrences in the four communities. The Dravidian and Mundari tribes were sequenced at up to 350 mtDNA bases and 6 NRY microsatellite loci, the Thai Hill tribes at up to 360 bases and 9 loci, and the Western New Guinea tribes at up to 350 bases and 7 loci, as described in the original publications <a href="#pone.0000973-Oota1">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000973-Kumar1">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000973-Kayser1">[17]</a>.</p>


<h4>Analytical procedures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>We used Arlequin 3.10 <a href="#pone.0000973-Excoffier1">[23]</a> to estimate haplotype diversity <a href="#pone.0000973-Nei1">[24]</a> for mtDNA and NRY within groups and genetic differentiation between groups. We conducted Mann-Whitney <em>U</em> tests to compare average mtDNA haplotype diversity, NRY haplotype diversity, and the ratio of NRY/mtDNA haplotype diversity between the chimpanzee communities (<em>N</em> = 4) and the patrilocal human tribes (<em>N</em> = 20).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2"></a><p>Unstandardized genetic differentiation was calculated in an AMOVA framework, with the number of different alleles used as the distance metric for both mtDNA and NRY. We examined the overlap in the 95% confidence limits generated by bootstrapping genetic differentiation values in a locus-by-locus AMOVA to evaluate whether (a) genetic differentiation between the chimpanzees and each of the five patrilocal human tribal groups were significantly different and (b) genetic differentiation of NRY and mtDNA were significantly different within chimpanzees and patrilocal human tribal groups.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p3"></a><p>To calculate standardized genetic differentiation, we first transformed the data such that each population had its own set of unique alleles (e.g., when there were two populations with alleles <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> at a locus, in one of the populations these alleles were recoded as <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>), and calculated an AMOVA F<sub>ST</sub> for this transformed data set (mtDNA/NRY chimpanzees: 0.85/0.86; Dravidian: 0.93/0.33; Mundari 0.93/0.49; Western New Guinea highland: 0.88/0.75; Western New Guinea lowland: 0.86/0.53; Thai Hill: 0.91/0.55). This transformation does not affect within-population variation, but maximizes between-population variation. We then calculated standardized genetic differentiation by dividing the original unstandardized AMOVA F<sub>ST</sub> by the AMOVA F<sub>ST</sub> obtained for this transformed dataset. We included only variable loci when calculating both unstandardized and standardized genetic differentiation. The inclusion or exclusion of non-variable loci does not affect the unstandardized AMOVA, but including non-variable loci when calculating the AMOVA for the transformed data set results in AMOVA values that are determined more by the ratio of variable to non-variable sites, and less by the levels of variability of the variable loci. This would push maximum genetic differentiation possible towards 1, and result in standardized genetic differentiation values that are nearly identical to their unstandardized counterparts. To determine 95% confidence intervals for the standardized genetic differentiation, we divided the lower 95% confidence limit of the original unstandardized genetic differentiation value by the upper 95% confidence limit of the transformed genetic differentiation, and divided the upper 95% confidence limit of the original unstandardized genetic differentiation by the lower 95% confidence limit of the transformed genetic differentiation. For all tests, loci had to have less than 5% missing data to be included in calculations.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p4"></a><p>To estimate variance in lifetime reproductive success, we calculated the variance in the number of offspring divided by the square of the mean number of offspring, for both males (I<sub>M</sub>) and females (I<sub>F</sub>). I<sub>M </sub>and I<sub>F </sub>are commonly used to estimate variance in lifetime reproductive success when the sampling of male and female reproductive output is incomplete and the data indicate the sexes have different mean lifetime reproductive success, when in reality they must be equal <a href="#pone.0000973-CluttonBrock1">[25]</a>. For traditional human societies, mean and variance in offspring numbers were collected from published data sets (Yomut Turks: <a href="#pone.0000973-Irons1">[26]</a>; Dogon: <a href="#pone.0000973-Strassmann1">[27]</a>; !Kung: <a href="#pone.0000973-Howell1">[28]</a>; Kipsigis: <a href="#pone.0000973-BorgerhoffMulder1">[29]</a>; Ache: <a href="#pone.0000973-Hill1">[30]</a>). The data sets differed in how offspring number was measured, e.g., number of offspring produced in a lifetime versus number of offspring currently living, and in other methodological details, as described in the original publications. For the chimpanzees, we conducted maternity and paternity analyses of the Sonso and Ngogo communities using 9–44 autosomal microsatellite loci. Our sample included 26 adult females and 18 adult males from the Sonso community, and 41 adult females and 27 adult males from the Ngogo community. As very few of the chimpanzees had completed their reproductive careers, our estimates reflect short-term variance in reproductive success rather than true variance in LRS. Studies of primates and other mammals typically show that for females, short-term estimates of variance in reproductive success underestimate lifetime variance in reproductive success <a href="#pone.0000973-CluttonBrock1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000973-Rhine1">[31]</a>. This occurs because longevity is a key component of variance in LRS for females <a href="#pone.0000973-CluttonBrock1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000973-Rhine1">[31]</a>. In contrast, short-term estimates of variance in reproductive success for males typically overestimate variance in LRS, as most of a male's reproduction occurs during a narrow period of life when he can successfully compete with other males for fertilizations <a href="#pone.0000973-Altmann1">[32]</a>. Although estimates of variance in LRS are currently unavailable for male chimpanzees, long-term observations from the Mahale chimpanzee study site indicate that variance in LRS for females is approximately twice as large as our short-term estimates from Sonso and Ngogo <a href="#pone.0000973-Nishida1">[33]</a>. Thus, our estimates for chimpanzees are likely to substantially overestimate the extent to which variance in male LRS exceeds that of females.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p5"></a><p>We calculated the average ages of mothers and fathers at the time of birth of 19 Sonso offspring to compute female and male average generation lengths in chimpanzees. We did not include the Ngogo data, as ages of adult males and females are less well-known in this community. Human values are from <a href="#pone.0000973-Fenner1">[34]</a>.</p>
