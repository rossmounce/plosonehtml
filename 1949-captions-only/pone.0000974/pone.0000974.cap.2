Traces represent 1500 s of data (1 s integration) obtained in the (i) temporal cortex of a horizontal brain slice from a 2 day old mouse and (ii) somatosensory cortex of a coronal slice from a 1 day old mouse. (B) Epileptiform activity induced by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> in an acute coronal slice from a 10 day old mouse brain. Recording was undertaken in the somatosensory cortex. (B (i)) Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> induced oscillations are blocked completely by TTX (500 nM, <em>n</em> = 3) and are absent in the presence of normal ACSF containing 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Data in the trace is plotted with 1 s integrals. (B (ii) &amp; (iii)) Expanded time scales at the times indicated in B (i) &amp; B (ii), respectively. Data is plotted with 50 ms integrals. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients are blocked by (C) piericidin A (2 µM) and (D) FCCP (2 µM).</p>
