                Figure 2.  Large-scale mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling oscillations in acute brain slices from neonates.(A) Acute brain slices were prepared from newborn mice and prolonged recordings of bioluminescence activity was detected by microscopy in large scale areas (600 µm2) of the cortex. Traces represent 1500 s of data (1 s integration) obtained in the (i) temporal cortex of a horizontal brain slice from a 2 day old mouse and (ii) somatosensory cortex of a coronal slice from a 1 day old mouse. (B) Epileptiform activity induced by low Mg2+ in an acute coronal slice from a 10 day old mouse brain. Recording was undertaken in the somatosensory cortex. (B (i)) Low Mg2+ induced oscillations are blocked completely by TTX (500 nM, n = 3) and are absent in the presence of normal ACSF containing 1.3 mM MgCl2. Data in the trace is plotted with 1 s integrals. (B (ii) &amp; (iii)) Expanded time scales at the times indicated in B (i) &amp; B (ii), respectively. Data is plotted with 50 ms integrals. Low Mg2+-induced mitochondrial Ca2+-transients are blocked by (C) piericidin A (2 µM) and (D) FCCP (2 µM).
