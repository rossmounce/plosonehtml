Each frame represents 1 s of light accumulation superimposed with the video image taken before the acquisition of bioluminescence. The FOV was 16×12 cm. Smoothing has been applied to the bioluminescent image overlay to a resolution of 1 mm. Color scale is in photons/pixel/s. (B) Mice were injected (i.v) with native coelenterazine (4 mg/kg) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced light emission was recorded immediately after in the hindlimb muscles in response to tetanic stimulations applied every 2 minutes over more than 1.5 hours. The plot shows the increasing amplitude of the light response (photons/s) as a function of time. (C (i) &amp; (ii)) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced light emission was investigated in mice previously injected with CLZN by tail-vein and then stimulated (as described above) every 30 s for up to 1 hour, (i) Graph showing the light emission (photons/s) during repetitive nerve stimulations and contraction/relaxation cycles of the hind-limb muscle in a single mouse, (ii) The average light emission (photons/s) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients shown in Figure C (i) (<em>n = </em>104). The grey horizontal bar shows the time of the stimulus. (D (i) &amp; (ii)) Trains of pulses (0.4 ms pulse duration at 70 Hz, train duration = 600 ms) were applied every 30 seconds to the sciatic nerve. Total light intensity (photons/s) was plotted over time. The graphs show the amplitude of the response (i) before, and (ii) after an intramuscular injection of Ru360 (500 µM).</p>
