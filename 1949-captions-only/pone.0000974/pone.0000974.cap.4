(A) Graphs showing light emission detected from the muscle after trains of stimuli (10 s duration) were applied to the sciatic nerve at 1, 5 and 10 Hz. The data at each time point on the graph represents 40 ms integrals. (B) The average light emission of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients plotted with 40 ms integration during single-twitch muscle contractions (1 Hz stimulation) (<em>n</em> = 35, 4 mice). Error bars show±s.e.m. (C) Plot of the variation of the peak amplitude electromyogram <em>versus</em> the maximum light intensity when varying the stimulation voltage. (D) Bioluminescence superimposed with the video image of a transgenic mouse hindlimb after stimulation of the sciatic nerve at (i) 1 Hz, (ii) 5 Hz, (iii) 10 Hz and (iv) 50 Hz. The FOV was 16×12 cm. Smoothing has been applied to the bioluminescent image overlay to a resolution of 1 mm. Color scale is in photons/pixel/s.</p>
