                Figure 5.  Distinct mitochondrial Ca2+ responses in newborn mice are linked to different behavioral states.A newborn mouse (P1) was injected (i.p.) with coelenterazine and whole animal bioluminescence was co-registered with the video image with an acquisition rate of 25 Hz using the Video Imager. (A) Graph shown in black is the total light intensity (photons/s) detected during more than 700 s of recording. The thin grey line running through the graph shows the minimum threshold set for scoring Ca2+-responses whose amplitudes reach or go above this limit. The upper blue graph shows the cycling between motion and rest, which was determined by visual analysis of the video frames. Closed black arrow heads show where fast Ca2+-transients (&lt;1 s duration) are correlated to muscular twitches or whole body startles. Sustained Ca2+-responses (&gt;1 s duration) are associated with coordinated movements. The lower grey bar shows periods of baseline Ca2+ activity (below the threshold line set) together with black bars that represent the Ca2+-responses and their durations. (B) Examples of the three behavioral states visually characterized; including (i) whole body startle, (ii) co-ordinated movement and (iii) atonia. Data for each state represents the video image superimposed with the bioluminescence image at the times indicated on each frame and in Figure 5A. (i). Frames represent 40 ms integration of the bioluminescence superimposed to the corresponding video image. Color scale is 0.000725–0.00145 photons/pixel (5 mm smoothing has been applied). (ii &amp; iii) represents 160 ms integration of the bioluminescence superimposed to the corresponding video frame. Color scale is 0.00174–0.00377 photons/pixel (3.5 mm smoothing). The FOV used in these studies was 8×6 cm.
