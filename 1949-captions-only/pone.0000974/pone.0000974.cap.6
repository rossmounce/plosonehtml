                Figure 6.  Variations in mitochondrial [Ca2+] are related to behavior in newborn mice.Newborn mice expressing mtGA were injected (i.p.) with native coelenterazine and bioluminescence activity was recorded in un-restrained and freely moving newborns. (A) Recording traces showing whole body Ca2+-transients in newborn animals over 1000 s. (P0) Newborn mouse (&lt;12 hours old, P0) and (P1) a 1 to 2 day old mouse pup. The grey bar below plots shows periods of baseline Ca2+ activity together with the Ca2+-responses in black (as for Figure 5). (B (i), (ii) and (iii)), expanded time base of the different Ca2+ responses indicated in (A), including sustained Ca2+ responses (i) &amp; (iii) and Ca2+ transients of short durations (ii). (C) Sequence of consecutive images (video image superimposed with the bioluminescence image). A video image was taken at the beginning and at the end of a short recording period during which a sustained and coordinated increase in Ca2+-induced light emission was detected across the entire body. Each frame represents 2 s of light accumulation. Smoothing has been applied to the bioluminescent image overlay to a resolution of 1 mm. Color scale is in photons/pixel. (D) Corresponding graph showing the time course of the Ca2+-responses in regions of interest shown in the first frame in Figure 6C. (E–G) Histograms comparing data from animals less than 1 day old (P0–1; n = 9; dotted columns) and animals between 1 and 3 days old (P1–3; n = 8; light grey columns). (E) Histogram showing the mean time interval between fast Ca2+-transients and sustained Ca2+ responses. (F) Histogram showing the mean duration of sustained responses. (G) Histogram showing the total percentage of time in the absence of sustained activity. The FOV used in these studies was 8×6 cm.
