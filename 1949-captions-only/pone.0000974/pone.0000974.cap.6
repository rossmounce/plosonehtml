(A) Recording traces showing whole body Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients in newborn animals over 1000 s. (P0) Newborn mouse (&lt;12 hours old, P0) and (P1) a 1 to 2 day old mouse pup. The grey bar below plots shows periods of baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity together with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses in black (as for <a href="#pone-0000974-g005">Figure 5</a>). (B (i), (ii) and (iii)), expanded time base of the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses indicated in (A), including sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (i) &amp; (iii) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of short durations (ii). (C) Sequence of consecutive images (video image superimposed with the bioluminescence image). A video image was taken at the beginning and at the end of a short recording period during which a sustained and coordinated increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced light emission was detected across the entire body. Each frame represents 2 s of light accumulation. Smoothing has been applied to the bioluminescent image overlay to a resolution of 1 mm. Color scale is in photons/pixel. (D) Corresponding graph showing the time course of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses in regions of interest shown in the first frame in <a href="#pone-0000974-g006">Figure 6C</a>. (E–G) Histograms comparing data from animals less than 1 day old (P0–1; <em>n</em> = 9; dotted columns) and animals between 1 and 3 days old (P1–3; <em>n</em> = 8; light grey columns). (E) Histogram showing the mean time interval between fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients and sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. (F) Histogram showing the mean duration of sustained responses. (G) Histogram showing the total percentage of time in the absence of sustained activity. The FOV used in these studies was 8×6 cm.</p>
