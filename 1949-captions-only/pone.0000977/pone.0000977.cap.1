The scaffold protein is a reactor where the kinases are correctly oriented in order to facilitate the reactions. 1b: Constraints in the reactor model and in the simple membrane recruitment. A cascade of 4 kinases is represented: K0, K1, K2 and K3. K0 is assumed to be membrane bound (like Ste20 in the case of the MAPK pathway studied in the text). The arrows represent the activation of a kinase by another one (* indicates that the kinase is active). In the reactor model, the successive kinases, K1, K2 and K3, bind, meet and interact onto a scaffold protein (noted “Scaffold”). This model requires many geometrical and energetic constraints. It also implies that the binding sites for the various kinases on the scaffold protein must be blocked in the cytosol to prevent the scaffolding process to happen in volume. In the simple membrane recruitment, the scaffold protein binds independently the three kinases: when in the cytosol, it does not affect the signal transduction; when recruited to the membrane, it creates a source of active molecules at the membrane. The only constraint in this description is that the binding site between two successive kinases has to remain accessible when the kinase to be activated is bound to the scaffold protein.</p>
