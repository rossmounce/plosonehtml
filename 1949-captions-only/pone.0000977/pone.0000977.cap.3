                Figure 3.  The elongated cell.When a cell receives a signal on a small fraction of its surface, we will consider it as an object that is stimulated on a flat area, S, (where the signal is received). The cell is self similar along the x axis. The volume of the cell is equal to S.l.The shape of S is not important, the only requirement to obtain a cell where the system can be solved in one dimension is that the shape of the cell is self similar by translation along an axis normal to S (the simplest shapes are a cylinder or a parallelepiped shape).
