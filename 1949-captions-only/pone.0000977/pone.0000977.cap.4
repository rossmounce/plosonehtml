For Ste7, it is supposed that the effective affinity of Ste11 for Ste5 is 1 µM. Similarly, for Fus3, it is supposed that the effective affinities of both Ste11 and Ste7 are 1 µM. (a) Example of an elongated cell that receives a signal on a 2.7 µm<sup>2</sup> surface area representing about 5% of the overall surface of the cell. (b) Example of a spherical cell that receives a uniform signal over its entire surface.</p>
