                Figure 5.  Influence of the number of Ste5 recruited to the membrane.The relative number of active Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3 is plotted with the number of Ste5 recruited at the membrane for a 100 nM affinity between the scaffold proteins and any of the three kinases. When there is no Ste5 these relative numbers are taken equal to 1. The same curves would be obtained for any affinity provided that the effective affinity is kept constant. For instance, the curves for a 1 ÂµM affinity are obtained with an increase by a factor 10 of the fraction of Ste5 recruited to the membrane. Only the case of elongated cells is presented.
