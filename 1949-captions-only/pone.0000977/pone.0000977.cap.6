                Figure 6.  Signal specificity.This curve is a plot of the ratio of the number of active Fus3 over the number of active Kss1 as a function of the effective affinity between the kinases and Ste5 for elongated and a spherical cells. It is assumed that the effective affinities are the same for the three kinases Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3.
