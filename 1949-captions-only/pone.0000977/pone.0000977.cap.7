                Figure 7.  Signal localization.The figure represents the ratio of the concentration of active kinase normalized by the concentration close to the surface that receives the signal as a function of the distance from the membrane. When Ste5 is recruited to the membrane, the polarization of the cell is significantly increased. It is assumed that the effective affinities between the kinases and Ste5 are 1 ÂµM for the three kinases Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3. The localization is not as relevant in the case of a spherical cell since the only polarization that can be achieved is between the vicinity of the membrane and the center of the cell.
