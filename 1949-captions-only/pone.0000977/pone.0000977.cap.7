When Ste5 is recruited to the membrane, the polarization of the cell is significantly increased. It is assumed that the effective affinities between the kinases and Ste5 are 1 ÂµM for the three kinases Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3. The localization is not as relevant in the case of a spherical cell since the only polarization that can be achieved is between the vicinity of the membrane and the center of the cell.</p>
