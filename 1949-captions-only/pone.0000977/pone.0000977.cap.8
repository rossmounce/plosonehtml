                Figure 8.  Cell response when mutated Ste5 are recruited to the membrane.Comparison of the total activation of Fus3 with the two mutated Ste5 used in reference [53], [54]. Ste5* (respectively Ste5**) is a scaffold protein where the docking site for Ste11 (respectively Ste7) has been disrupted. For the four effective affinities presented here (10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM and 300 µM) the concentration of active Fus3 is significantly decreased which could lead to a non functional response to mating pheromones.
