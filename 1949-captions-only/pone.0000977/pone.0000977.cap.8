Ste5* (respectively Ste5**) is a scaffold protein where the docking site for Ste11 (respectively Ste7) has been disrupted. For the four effective affinities presented here (10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM and 300 µM) the concentration of active Fus3 is significantly decreased which could lead to a non functional response to mating pheromones.</p>
