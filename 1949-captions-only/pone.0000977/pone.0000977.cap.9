The curves were obtained by solving equations (7) to (11) assuming a 10 nM concentration of kinase and using the parameters that allow deducing a k<sub>on</sub> close to the ones used in the rest of text: k<sub>1</sub> = 0.1 nM<sup>−1</sup>.s<sup>−1</sup>, k<sub>−1</sub> = k<sub>−3</sub> = 1s<sup>−1</sup>, k<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>4</sub> = 10 s<sup>−1</sup>, k<sub>3</sub> = 1 nM<sup>−1</sup>.s<sup>−1</sup>. The lifetime of an active molecule should not be less than 1 s for it to be efficient and therefore: k<sub>off</sub>&gt;1 s<sup>−1</sup>. We chose k<sub>off</sub> = 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup> in order to obtain a characteristic reaction time larger than reality.</p>
