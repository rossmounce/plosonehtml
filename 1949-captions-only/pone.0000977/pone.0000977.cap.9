                Figure 9.  Establishment of the chemical equilibrium.Variation of the concentration of the intermediate states during the phosphorylation process. The curves were obtained by solving equations (7) to (11) assuming a 10 nM concentration of kinase and using the parameters that allow deducing a kon close to the ones used in the rest of text: k1 = 0.1 nM−1.s−1, k−1 = k−3 = 1s−1, k2 = k4 = 10 s−1, k3 = 1 nM−1.s−1. The lifetime of an active molecule should not be less than 1 s for it to be efficient and therefore: koff&gt;1 s−1. We chose koff = 0.5 s−1 in order to obtain a characteristic reaction time larger than reality.
