<h4>Serological reactivities to <em>P. falciparum</em> antigens and parasite schizont extract</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>Prevalence and levels of antibodies tested against all antigens was consistently higher in the villages due to higher exposure to malaria of the rural subset despite the relatively younger age (<a href="#pone-0000978-t002">Table 2</a>, <a href="#pone-0000978-t003">Table 3</a>). Within the urban samples higher levels of total IgG amongst genotypes containing at least one adaptive haemoglobin allele compared to HbAA were observed for most of the <em>P. falciparum</em> antigens tested by ELISA, with some degree of statistical significance as measured by Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise T-test (<a href="#pone-0000978-t002">Table 2</a>, <a href="#pone-0000978-g002">Figure 2</a>). Remarkably, the same observation of higher levels of IgG in all genotypes including HbC and HbS alleles was confirmed by CSP and schizont extract, both considered markers of exposure (<a href="#pone-0000978-t002">Table 2</a>, <a href="#pone-0000978-g002">Figure 2</a>). However, significantly higher levels of total IgG against <em>P. falciparum</em> antigens were observed in the rural samples only against EBA-175 in the overall comparisons, and against AMA1 in the comparisons between HbAA versus HbAC, and HbAA versus HbCC (<a href="#pone-0000978-t002">Table 2</a>). Differences observed in the primary analysis were tested by logistic regression including Hb genotype, age categories (1/9, 10/max years), gender and parasite status confirming the role of adaptive genotypes for most of the tested antigens (<a href="#pone-0000978-t003">Table 3</a>). Finally, a non malaria antigen, tetanus toxoid, was tested revealing no differences in any of the subsets (data not shown).</p>
