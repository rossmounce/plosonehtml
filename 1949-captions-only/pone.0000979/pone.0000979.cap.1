Schematic drawing of the human EWSR1 protein structure. Break point: breakpoint of Ewing sarcoma (type I), QSY: QSY rich domain, IQ: IQ domain, RGG: RGG box, RRM: RNA Recognition Motif, Zn: Zn finger domain and C-NLS: C-terminus nuclear localization signal. B. Predicted protein sequence of human EWSR1 and zebrafish Ewsr1a and Ewsr1b. The identical amino acids between human (Hu), and zebrafish (ZF) proteins are boxed, domains are underlined and the RGG repeats are marked with asterisks (*).</p>
