(a) uninjected, (b) control morpholino (MO), (c) <em>ewsr1a</em> MO , (d) <em>ewsr1a</em> MO with <em>ewsr1a</em> mRNA , (e) <em>ewsr1b</em> MO, and (f) <em>ewsr1b</em> MO and <em>ewsr1b</em> mRNA co-injected embryo. Both <em>ewsr1a</em> and <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryos show dark cells (c and e) in the brain. The asterisk (*) indicates increased apoptosis and abnormal MHB. Co-injection of MO and mRNA rescued normal brain morphology (d and f). All of the images are lateral views of 24hpf zebrafish embryos. B. No increase of apoptosis in the bud stage (aâ€“d), increased apoptosis in the CNS of <em>ewsr1a</em> and <em>ewsr1b</em> -MO injected embryos at 24hpf (g and h compared to e and f). Lateral views of wild type (a and e), control MO injected embryo (b and f), <em>ewsr1a</em> MO injected embryo (c and j) and <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryo (d and h), after TUNEL staining.</p>
