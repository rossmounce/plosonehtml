                Figure 3.  MO-Induced Knockdown of Zebrafish ewsr1a and ewsr1b Results in Morphologic Abnormalities in the CNS Accompanied by Apoptosis.A. (a) uninjected, (b) control morpholino (MO), (c) ewsr1a MO , (d) ewsr1a MO with ewsr1a mRNA , (e) ewsr1b MO, and (f) ewsr1b MO and ewsr1b mRNA co-injected embryo. Both ewsr1a and ewsr1b MO injected embryos show dark cells (c and e) in the brain. The asterisk (*) indicates increased apoptosis and abnormal MHB. Co-injection of MO and mRNA rescued normal brain morphology (d and f). All of the images are lateral views of 24hpf zebrafish embryos. B. No increase of apoptosis in the bud stage (aâ€“d), increased apoptosis in the CNS of ewsr1a and ewsr1b -MO injected embryos at 24hpf (g and h compared to e and f). Lateral views of wild type (a and e), control MO injected embryo (b and f), ewsr1a MO injected embryo (c and j) and ewsr1b MO injected embryo (d and h), after TUNEL staining.
