                Figure 6.   ewsr1 MO Injected Zebrafish Embryos Display Genomic Instability.A. Representative images of mitotic spindles from (a) uninjected, (b) control MO, (c and c') ewsr1a MO and (d and d') ewsr1b MO injected embryo. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Asterisks (*) identify chromosome bridges. (c) The cell appears to be the result of aberrant chromosomal segregation. ({) points to missegregated chromosomes and arrowhead (&lt;) to a possible additional chromosome set. B. Percentage of chromosome bridges per hundred anaphase chromosomes of uninjected, control MO, ewsr1a MO and ewsr1b MO injected embryos at the 12 somite stage (12sm).
