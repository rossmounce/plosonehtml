Representative images of mitotic spindles from (a) uninjected, (b) control MO, (c and c') <em>ewsr1a</em> MO and (d and d') <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryo. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Asterisks (*) identify chromosome bridges. (c) The cell appears to be the result of aberrant chromosomal segregation. ({) points to missegregated chromosomes and arrowhead (&lt;) to a possible additional chromosome set. B. Percentage of chromosome bridges per hundred anaphase chromosomes of uninjected, control MO, <em>ewsr1a</em> MO and <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryos at the 12 somite stage (12sm).</p>
