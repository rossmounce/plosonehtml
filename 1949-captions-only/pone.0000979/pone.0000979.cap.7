Representative images of mitotic spindles from (a) uninjected, (b) control MO, (c) <em>ewsr1a</em> MO and (d) <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryos. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue) and the spindles were visualized by α-tubulin staining (red). B. Score of abnormal mitotic spindles of uninjected, control MO, <em>ewsr1a</em> MO and <em>ewsr1b</em> MO injected embryos at the bud and the 12 somite stages (12sm). Approximately two hundred mitotic spindles (N = 193–234) were examined for each group.</p>
