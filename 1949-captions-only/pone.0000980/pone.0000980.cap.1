                Figure 1.  Workers are more attracted to MDI than SDI queens in observation hives.Following insemination, the retinue response to SDI and MDI queens was monitored in observation hives, twice a day for 5 days. MDI queens attracted significantly more worker bees in their retinue than the SDI queens did (F = 6.73, p = 0.02). (SDI: 7 queens; MDI: 5 queens).
