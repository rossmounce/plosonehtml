                Figure 2.  Workers are more attracted to the mandibular gland extracts of MDI than SDI queens.Caged workers were exposed to mandibular gland extract of two different queens simultaneously, and the retinue response to each extract was monitored. Workers were significantly more attracted to the extracts of inseminated versus virgin queens, and significantly more attracted to the extracts of MDI versus SDI queens (0.05 queen equivalents: Virgin vs SDI queens (n = 19); Virgin vs MDI (n = 20). MDI vs SDI (n = 21); all comparison with t-test: t&lt;2.7, p&lt;0.01). ** p&lt;0.01 and *** p&lt;0.001
