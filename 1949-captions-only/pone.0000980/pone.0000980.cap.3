                Figure 3.  Insemination quantity significantly alters the chemical profile of mandibular glands.Chemical composition of the mandibular gland extracts of Virgin, SDI and MDI queens were analysed using gas-chromatography. Discriminant analysis of mandibular extract of virgin, SDI, and MDI queens was based on the relative proportion of the chemical compounds (F(33, 36) = 9.33. p&lt;10âˆ’4; All group distances &lt;0.005). Ellipses have been drawn to emphasize the categories, but have no specific statistical meaning
