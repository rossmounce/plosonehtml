Discriminant analysis of mandibular extract of virgin, SDI, and MDI queens was based on the relative proportion of the chemical compounds (F(33, 36) = 9.33. p&lt;10<sup>âˆ’4</sup>; All group distances &lt;0.005). Ellipses have been drawn to emphasize the categories, but have no specific statistical meaning</p>
