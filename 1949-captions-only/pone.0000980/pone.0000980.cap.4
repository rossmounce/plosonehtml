                Figure 4.  Brain gene expression levels are affected by insemination quantity.Expression levels of Amfor were monitored using quantitative real-time PCR using individual brains (SDI: N = 9; MDI: N = 9). SDI queens have significantly higher levels of Amfor than MDI queens (U = 10, p = 0.022). Data represent mean values, −/+ standard error (converted to the same arbitrary scale as the mean), relative to the SDI brains.
