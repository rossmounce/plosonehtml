Cross-section of small intestine of AL312. The muscularis propria is converted into amyloid masses (Am). The mucosa is indicated by arrows. B. Section from the stomach of AL Es305 showing large amounts of amyloid between glands (Gl). C. Section of the spleen of AL90. Amyloid (Am) is seen distributed mainly in follicles. D. Section of the tongue of AL Es305 showing large amounts of amyloid. Residual striated muscle fibers (arrows) are seen. E. Kidney section of AL90. The glomeruli (arrow) are virtually free of amyloid. There is a tubular amyloid cast in the middle of the figure. F. Kidney section of AL Es305. The glomeruli (arrows) are free of amyloid.</p>
