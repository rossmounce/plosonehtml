                Figure 1.  The structure of protein kinase A (PKA).PKA is shown in its active conformation with ATP in green sticks and Mn2+ as black spheres. Î²-strands, helices and loops are labeled as in Knighton et al. [45]. The active site is situated between the small and large lobes, located above and below ATP respectively. CL: catalytic loop; MPL: magnesium-positioning loop.
