Red indicates full conservation of a particular amino acid in all fifteen kinase structures; orange, conservation in thirteen or fourteen structures; and yellow, conservation in eleven or twelve structures. Blue spheres indicate full conservation of an amino-acid category. The ATP molecule of protein kinase A is shown in green sticks. (A) The consensus structure consisting of the forty-four points listed in <a href="#pone-0000982-t002">Table 2</a>. (B) The consensus structure overlaid on the multiple alignment.</p>
