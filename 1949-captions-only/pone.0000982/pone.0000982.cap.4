<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>We highlight these two kinases for the additional reason that they demonstrate structural variation within the bounds of certain functional constraints. An interesting case of this is lysine/arginine 26. In almost all serine/threonine kinases there is a lysine residue located two positions downstream of the catalytic aspartic acid (consensus residue 24). This lysine aids in orientating the γ-phosphate of ATP and it is thought may also act to neutralize the negative charge on this phosphate during catalysis. The position and orientation of these two residues with respect to ATP is shown in protein kinase A (PKA) in <a href="#pone-0000982-g005"><strong>Figure 5A</strong></a>. Tyrosine kinases, like activated CDC42 kinase (ACK1), do not have this lysine but instead have an arginine four positions downstream from the catalytic residue (<a href="#pone-0000982-g005"><strong>Figure 5B</strong></a>). This residue is orientated perpendicular to the lysine but occupies the same location, and since both are positively charged basic residues, both can fulfill the same function. ChaK, a serine/threonine kinase like PKA, utilizes a lysine for this function, which again occupies the same geometric position (<a href="#pone-0000982-g005"><strong>Figure 5C</strong></a>). However, this residue is not located two or four positions downstream, but thirty-eight positions upstream on a β-strand running adjacent to the catalytic loop. This is a good demonstration of the value behind a sequence-order independent alignment algorithm that ignores fold and residue connectivity. This lysine is located on part of a novel fold not found in any of the other kinases examined. Rio2 presents a fourth variation. Our alignment did not reveal Rio2 as having a basic residue at consensus point 26, as it did for all of the other kinases. Further examination led us to the conclusion that the function of this residue is conserved in Rio2 but the location of the residue accomplishing it is not (see also <a href="#pone.0000982-LaRondeLeBlanc2">[14]</a>). This is known as functional residue hopping <a href="#pone.0000982-Grishin1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000982-Todd1">[16]</a>. The function of consensus residue 26 is performed by a histidine located in the small lobe (<a href="#pone-0000982-g005"><strong>Figure 5D</strong></a>). This histidine is largely unique to the <em>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</em> Rio2 ortholog, from which the structure was derived – in most other species it is substituted by an arginine. As <em>A. fulgidus</em> is a hyperthermophile, the preference for histidine may be due to the extreme temperature environments in which it is found.</p>
