                Figure 5.  Residue variability in positioning the γ-phosphate of ATP.In each kinase the catalytic aspartic acid is shown in red and the positively-charged residue that interacts with the γ-phosphate of ATP is shown in yellow with nitrogen atoms colored blue. ATP is shown in green sticks. (A) Protein kinase A, (B) activated CDC42 kinase 1, (C) channel kinase, and (D) Rio2 kinase.
