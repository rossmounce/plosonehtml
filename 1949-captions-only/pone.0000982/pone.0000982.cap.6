This lysine is required for catalytic activity and has been termed the catalytic lysine. (B) In channel kinase (ChaK), the homologous lysine interacts with the α-phosphate and the adenine ring of ATP. An unique arginine residue located on β-strand 2 instead interacts with the α- and β-phosphates. (C) In protein kinase with no lysine 1 (WNK1, PDB code: 1T4H <a href="#pone.0000982-Min1">[22]</a>), the catalytic lysine is present but originates from β-strand 2, much like the arginine from ChaK. ATP is shown in green sticks. Potential hydrogen bonds between the positively charged residues and ATP are shown as dashed lines, and nitrogen atoms are colored blue. The WNK structure has no ATP or ATP analog.</p>
