Bound substrate peptides are shown in red sticks. Atoms belonging to non-conserved residues within 10 Å of the substrate peptide are shown as colored spheres. Red: atoms within 2 Å of a conserved residue; orange: atoms between 2 and 4 Å of a conserved residue; yellow: atoms between 4 and 6 Å of a conserved residue; green: atoms between 6 and 8 Å of a conserved residue; cyan: atoms between 8 and 10 Å of a conserved residue; and blue: atoms more than 10 Å from a conserved residue.</p>
