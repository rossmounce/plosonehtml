(A) The best model is in blue and the actual structure in red (PDB code: 1H1W). Structures are shown aligned based on C<sub>α</sub> RMSD. (B) Residues 201–225, comprising the floor of the active site, are highlighted as aligned on side chains. (C) Residues from the non-conserved regions of the substrate binding groove (residues 166–175 and 278–305) are shown as aligned on side chains. ATP from the true structure of PDK1 is shown in green sticks.</p>
