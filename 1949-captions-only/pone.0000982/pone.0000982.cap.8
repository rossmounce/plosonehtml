                Figure 8.  Modeling a typical kinase.PDK1 was modeled using the consensus guided approach outlined in the Results and Methods sections. (A) The best model is in blue and the actual structure in red (PDB code: 1H1W). Structures are shown aligned based on Cα RMSD. (B) Residues 201–225, comprising the floor of the active site, are highlighted as aligned on side chains. (C) Residues from the non-conserved regions of the substrate binding groove (residues 166–175 and 278–305) are shown as aligned on side chains. ATP from the true structure of PDK1 is shown in green sticks.
