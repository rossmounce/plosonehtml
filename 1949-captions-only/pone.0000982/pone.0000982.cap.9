                Figure 9.  Modeling an atypical kinase, Rio2.(A) The best model is in blue and the actual structure in red (PDB code: 1ZAO). Structures are shown aligned based on Cα RMSD. Residues 128–142 from the model are hidden because they are disordered in the actual structure. (B) Residues 214–237 are highlighted as aligned on side-chains. ATP is shown in green sticks.
