                Figure 3.  The HCP clusters are more robust against perturbations to its architecture than the SCP clusters.At normal coupling strength of gc = 200 pS (left columns), both cluster types are robust against up to 50% β-cell loss in the cluster. When the coupling is compromised with reduced gc values (middle and right columns), the SCP clusters are more affected by β-cell loss. Dashed lines are the mean and the 2 standard deviations (SD) of completely uncoupled β cells.
