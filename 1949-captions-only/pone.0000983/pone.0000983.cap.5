                Figure 5.  Function of a β-cell cluster versus its size nβ.Left and middle columns: at normal coupling strength and no loss of β cells, no significant dependence is observed in the HCP β-cell clusters (solid lines). This is true even when the intercellular coupling is impaired to a very low value of 25 pS. Right column: when there is extensive β-cell loss at 70%, marginal functional gain is observed in fb and [Ca].
