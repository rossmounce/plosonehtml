The alteration sometimes could be merely a reduction in islet size <em>n</em><sub>β</sub>, but more often more profound changes to the islet cytoarchitecture occur. For example, in type 1 diabetes the infiltrating immune cells spread from peripheral islet vessels to the centre of a given islet, causing β-cell apoptosis across the islet <a href="#pone.0000983-Foulis1">[50]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Linn1">[51]</a>. In this situation both <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> are reduced, more significantly so for <em>n</em><sub>c</sub>. For this reason we have examined the impact to the cluster bursting pattern when there is random β-cell loss across the cluster. Both <em>f</em><sub>b</sub> and λ fall with increasing loss of β cells (data not shown). The results are similar to that presented in <a href="#pone-0000983-g003">figure 3</a>, where we compared the SCP and HCP cluster at 0% of non-β cells. We are specifically interested in the threshold loss of β-cell mass that would lead to functional failure. As the coordination and synchronization of the β-cell bursting within an islet is fundamental to regulated, glucose dose-dependent insulin release, we investigated this problem from the perspective of β-cell bursting synchronization. We first simulated and determined the degree of synchronization that would be expected by chance for a cluster of uncoupled β cells. We then assumed that a β-cell cluster would not be able to function normally if its λ falls below 2 SD of this basal level. Using this criterion, we investigated the threshold loss of β-cell mass that would result in functional failure, under varying values of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. Around physiological values of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> (150–250 pS), at 30% non-β cells, we found that HCP β-cell clusters can function with majority, up to 70%, of its β-cell mass lost. The result of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> = 200 pS is given in <a href="#pone-0000983-g008">figure 8</a>. This is consistent with the laboratory and clinical findings. Laboratory studies have shown that islets are tolerant of substantial β-cell loss, and can function normally with majority of β cells either dead or non-functioning <a href="#pone.0000983-Rocheleau1">[48]</a>. Clinically it is believed that in type 1 diabetes disease onset occurs with up to 70–90% of β cells are destroyed <a href="#pone.0000983-Gepts1">[52]</a>. In contrast, the SCP clusters do not have such robustness, the threshold loss is only 40% at <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> = 200 pS (<a href="#pone-0000983-g008">figure 8</a>). If the intercellular coupling is impaired with a low <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> value, the function of the β-cell cluster is much less robust against β-cell damages. At <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>~25 pS, a 30% of β-cell loss would completely disrupt the bursting coordination of a HCP β-cell cluster.</p>
