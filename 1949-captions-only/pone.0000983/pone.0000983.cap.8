<div id="section3" class="section"><a id="s3" name="s3" toc="s3" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.p1"></a><p>In this first effort to quantitatively investigate the role of islet cytoarchitecture with respect to its pulsatile bursting, we examined three structural parameters of β-cell clusters: cluster size <em>n</em><sub>β</sub>, the number of intercellular couplings each β cell has <em>n</em><sub>c</sub>, and the intercellular coupling strength <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. To enable a more realistic mathematical investigation of islet architecture, we introduced a new β-cell packing model, based on the HCP lattice structure, to replace the SCP model that is conventionally used. The HCP cluster is a much closer approximation of the β-cell arrangement in real islets <a href="#pone.0000983-Hellman1">[38]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Gylfe1">[39]</a>, and more accurately captures the degree of intercellular coupling <em>n</em><sub>c</sub>. We found that the HCP β-cell clusters are functionally more desirable than the SCP clusters, as evidenced from the higher fractions of burster cells (<em>f</em><sub>b</sub>), better synchronization (λ), and longer bursting periods (<em>T</em><sub>b</sub>). In addition, the HCP clusters are significantly more robust against architectural perturbations, including presence of non-β cells, β-cell damage and impaired gap junctional couplings. Further, the proposed HCP architecture is able to explain why islets can function with majority of β cells lost. In contrast, the SCP model would require majority of its β cells to be intact for the β-cell cluster to burst regularly. Therefore we believe that the HCP model is a better one to study the islet bursting phenomenon. In this study, we utilized our HCP model to investigate quantitatively the dependence of islet bursting on its architecture. We have found that the functional measures, including <em>f</em><sub>b</sub>, λ, <em>T</em><sub>b</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>f</sub>, and [<em>Ca</em>], depend exquisitely on the three architectural parameters <em>n</em><sub>β</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> and <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. As the ability to reach synchronized bursting is fundamental to the regulation of islet insulin release, and its role in islet function is much better understood than the other three parameters (<em>T</em><sub>b</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>f</sub>, [<em>Ca</em>]), our investigation focused more on the evaluation of <em>f</em><sub>b</sub> and λ.</p>

<h4>Is there an optimal islet size?</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>When judged by the fraction of burster β cells <em>f</em><sub>b</sub> and the degree of their synchronization λ, our simulation results suggest that the very small β-cell clusters (<em>n</em><sub>β</sub>&lt;50) are not functionally stable (<a href="#pone-0000983-g002">figure 2</a>, large standard deviations). They are also very sensitive to structural perturbations including β-cell damage and intercellular coupling impairment. When the size increases, initially there is functional gain with increasing cluster size (<a href="#pone-0000983-g002">figure 2</a>). This is manifested in improved <em>f</em><sub>b</sub> and λ values, and robustness against β-cell death. However the functional gain plateaus when the β-cell number reaches above ~100–200 cells (<a href="#pone-0000983-g005">figure 5</a>), suggesting that very large β-cell clusters are not necessarily more desirable.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>In reality the islet size is also limited by other factors. In our present modeling and simulation, we did not consider the non-uniform distribution of external stimuli such as the intra-islet glucose concentration. In rodent islets, it is believed the blood vessel goes to the center of the islet and blood flows from the center out. The architecture and microcirculation of human islets are believed to be more complex <a href="#pone.0000983-Brissova1">[35]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Cabrera1">[36]</a>, and may contain several sub-compartments of β-cell clusters organized around the micro vascularization within the islet. This would lead to more complicated pattern of non-uniformity in intra-islet glucose concentration, serving as a confounding factor on top of the heterogeneous biophysical properties of β cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that such a glucose gradient can result in an attenuating propagation wave of intra-islet calcium, resulting in the inactivity of β cells that are far from the center. Several other problems that may be a concern in large islets include the oxygen supply, the microvascular circulation that are needed to support cell metabolism, and the paracrine relationship between cells, etc.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3"></a><p>In vitro functional studies of both human and animal islets have revealed that larger islets are less efficient at insulin release than smaller islets under basal and stimulatory glucose levels <a href="#pone.0000983-MacGregor1">[53]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Lehmann1">[54]</a>. In the work by Lehmann et al <a href="#pone.0000983-Lehmann1">[54]</a>, human islets were separated into two groups according to their diameter: small islets, 50–150 um; and large islets, 150–300 um. When normalized with islet volume (termed IEQ, islet equivalent), basal and stimulated insulin secretion was twice as high in small islets compared with large islets. Similar findings were observed in <a href="#pone.0000983-MacGregor1">[53]</a> for rat islets. In these studies, the large islets contain ~10<sup>3</sup> cells and the small islets ~10<sup>2</sup> cells. These studies also examined the transplantation outcome and clear superiority of the small islet group was observed <a href="#pone.0000983-MacGregor1">[53]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Lehmann1">[54]</a>. These indicate that there could be a functional compromise when the islet size gets too big <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p4"></a><p>Mammalian species span several orders of magnitude in terms of body weight, with commensurate demand on insulin and hence total endocrine pancreatic mass. Interestingly, the increased endocrine mass in larger mammals is manifested in the form of increased number of islets, rather than significantly larger islets. For example, the body weight of an average human being is around 1,000 fold of rodents, and the total endocrine β-cell mass is roughly in the same proportion. On average, humans have ~10<sup>6</sup> islets, whilst rodents ~10<sup>3</sup>, a 1,000 fold difference. In contrast their islet sizes are within the same order of magnitude at ~10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup>. This phenomenon also indicates a possible functional optimal range for islet size at <em>n</em><sub>β</sub>~10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup>, and different species may have all arrived at values within this range through evolution.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p5"></a><p>It is known that under certain physiological or pathological conditions, such as during pregnancy and obesity, expansion of islet size (<em>n</em><sub>β</sub>) has been observed <a href="#pone.0000983-Rhodes1">[46]</a>. It is still not clear if the expansion, assumed to have occurred in order to compensate for the increased demand, is really able to adequately address the need, and if it has played a role in the increased risk for diabetes that these individuals experience. These together with our modeling findings suggest that the quantitative relationship between islet function and its size deserves more attention.</p>


<h4>The importance of team work</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>In a real islet the effective number of inter-β cell coupling <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> that each β cell has is less than the number of its nearest neighbors. Further the value <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> is readily influenced by physiological or pathological changes such as presence of non-β cells, or β-cell damage. In this study, the role of <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> in islet function was, <em>for the first time</em>, quantitatively investigated. We found that at normal coupling strength (<em>g</em><sub>c</sub>~200 pS), each β cells on average needs to be coupled to at least 3 (<em>n</em><sub>c</sub>&gt;2.4, <a href="#pone-0000983-g006">figure 6</a>) other β cells in order to coordinate their bursting throughout the whole cluster. If the intercellular coupling strength is weak, then this number needs to be even higher.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p2"></a><p>The investigation of <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> as an islet architectural parameter is also important to translational research. Much of our past understanding of islet function and structure was obtained from rodent models, where most β cells are clustered around a center core, surrounded by a layer of α and δ cells. Recent studies have revealed a cytoarchitectural difference between human and rodent islets <a href="#pone.0000983-Brissova1">[35]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Cabrera1">[36]</a>. It was found that human islets on average contained proportionally fewer β cells, ~55% versus 70–80% in rodents <a href="#pone.0000983-Brissova1">[35]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Cabrera1">[36]</a>. In addition, throughout human islets β cells are more intermingled with the other islet cell types (mainly α and δ cells). It was estimated that about 70% of the β cells exclusively associate with β cells in rodent islets (corresponding to a <em>n</em><sub>c</sub>~8.4 HCP cluster), whilst in human islets, this number can be as low as 30% <a href="#pone.0000983-Brissova1">[35]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Cabrera1">[36]</a> (<em>n</em><sub>c</sub>~3.6). These reports suggest that rodent islets may have much higher <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> than human ones. It might still be arguable if the apparent cytoarchitectural difference is fundamental to function. Concerns that have been raised include the fact that human islets were usually obtained under different pathological conditions, and that human islets may be of a composite compartmental structure with each compartment organized in the same architectural principle of a single rodent islet (private communication with experts in the field). Measurements with human islets did show subregions of β cells synchronization, but not across the whole islet <a href="#pone.0000983-Quesada1">[55]</a>. More studies are obviously needed to settle these issues. However, we would like to point out that a quantitative investigation of islet function versus its structural parameters will provide insights to the cytoarchitectural organization principle of β-cell mass, and whether there are fundamental differences across different species. Understanding these issues will be highly valuable to translational studies using animal islets.</p>


<h4>The strength of bond</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>The strength of the intercellular coupling is another important islet architectural parameter. Inhibition of gap junctions led to loss of glucose sensitivity in intact rodent islets <a href="#pone.0000983-Rocheleau1">[48]</a>. In this study our simulation results suggest that there is an optimal value range for function around 100–200 pS, beyond which there is little functional gain with increasing values of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. Similar results have been previously observed by others in their simulation studies of islet oscillation <a href="#pone.0000983-Sherman2">[14]</a>. This range is around the values observed in normal rodent islets (213+/−113 pS) <a href="#pone.0000983-PerezArmendariz1">[41]</a>. Very few human islet measurements are available at this time.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2"></a><p>The intercellular couplings are mediated through channels located at gap junctions. Gap junctions are specific membrane structures consisting of aggregates of intercellular channels that enable the direct exchange of ions and small metabolites (&lt;1 kD) <a href="#pone.0000983-Sohl1">[56]</a>. Such intercellular channels result from the association of two hemichannels, named connexons, which are separately contributed by two adjacent cells. Each connexon is an assembly of six transmembrane connexins, encoded by a family of genes with more than 20 members. The coupling strength depends on the number of gap junctions, as well as the number and the physiological state of their constituting subunit connexons. Extra energy (to make connexons) is required to increase the value of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. It is therefore not surprising that normal islets function at a <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> value beyond which little functional gain can be achieved. Further it has been found that glycemic condition directly affects the transcription level of connexins <a href="#pone.0000983-Allagnat1">[42]</a> and hence the value of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub>. Diabetes therapeutic drugs that were designed to target at intercellular cAMP levels or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, are often found to also modulate the value of <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> <a href="#pone.0000983-Santos1">[57]</a>. These all indicate the importance of the β-cell gap junctional coupling in normal islet function, and more work is needed in this area.</p>


<h4>Pathological alterations to β-cell mass and islet morphology</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1"></a><p>Under pathological conditions of glycemic control, alterations to β-cell mass usually occur. Another important finding of our study is the fact that alterations (especially loss) to β-cell mass can affect only <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> (a mere islet size growth or β-cell death at islet peripheral, for example), or both <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> (β-cell death across the whole islet, for example), which are independent cytoarchitectural parameters that are both important to function. Though different types of mass changes may result in the same total β-cell mass, they could nonetheless lead to distinct bursting characteristics alterations. Our simulation results indicate that a reduction in <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> that also affects <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> will modify the islet function more markedly than a reduction only in <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> (<a href="#pone-0000983-g005">figures 5</a>–<a href="#pone-0000983-g006">6</a>). To investigate the β-cell mass alterations and the consequent compromise in β-cell function, we therefore must first determine whether only <em>n</em><sub>β</sub>, or both <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> are affected.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p2"></a><p>During the prediabetic development of type 2 diabetes, a transient expansion of islet size (<em>n</em><sub>β</sub>↑) is often observed before β-cell mass reduction ensues <a href="#pone.0000983-Rhodes1">[46]</a>. Whether and how the transient change contributes to disease pathogenesis is not yet understood. During the development of type 1 diabetes, β-cell mass is gradually destroyed by infiltrating immune-cells <a href="#pone.0000983-Gepts1">[52]</a>, which results in a gradual reduction in both <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>c</sub> for each islet. These specific characteristics in β-cell mass alteration need to be considered and differentiated when investigating each pathological condition.</p>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1"></a><p>A quantitative understanding of the functional role of islet cytoarchitecture is much needed, but has not been investigated comprehensively till now. It is central to many important issues in the study of glycemic control and the related metabolic syndromes. Examples include the relationship between β-cell mass and β-cell function, alterations in β-cell mass under pathological conditions, the translational studies of animal islets, and the tissue engineering of islets and islet allotransplantation <a href="#pone.0000983-MacGregor1">[53]</a>. Specifically for a successful allotransplantation, islet preparation quality control is essential. Several commonly used parameters include the number of islets, percent of β-cell content and of non-apoptotic β cells, etc. Very recently, it has been pointed out that the morphostructural integrity of the islets, namely, the right interactions and the three-dimensional architecture among various cell populations in islets, is also critical and predictive of in vivo function and clinical outcome in islet allotransplantation <a href="#pone.0000983-Bertuzzi1">[58]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p2"></a><p>Our study represents a very first step toward this goal. Much work is still needed. In an intact islet there are other islet cell types, and numerous paracrine, hormonal, and nervous signals that fine-tune the insulin secretion under different physiological conditions. The non-β cell types secrete a few other types of hormones additional to insulin. Some of the hormones, glucagon and somatostatin are clearly involved in the regulation of insulin secretion <a href="#pone.0000983-Samols1">[59]</a>. To fully understand the phenomenon of plasma insulin pulsatility, several additional levels of regulation also need to be investigated, which include but not limited to: the coupling of the β cell membrane electrical burst with glycolysis oscillation <a href="#pone.0000983-Bertram2">[60]</a>, and the inter-islet coordination and possible existence of a pace-making mechanism provided by the central nerves system (CNS) <a href="#pone.0000983-Yarimizu1">[61]</a> or the intrapancreatic ganglia <a href="#pone.0000983-Stagner1">[62]</a>. Our study reported here serve as a basis for these future works.</p>

<h4>Mathematical model of the electrical excitability of individual β cells</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>Pancreatic islet β cells are electrically excitable cells. At basal level of glucose cell membranes are hyperpolarized with a resting potential around −70 mV <a href="#pone.0000983-Meissner1">[63]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-Matthews2">[64]</a>. In presence of elevated plasma glucose concentration, the glucose metabolism at mitochondria results in net generation of ATP; the increased ATP:ADP ratio will close the ATP-dependent K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, which will drive the membrane potential to more positive values; the membrane depolarization will trigger action potential firing and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels; the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> will raise its intracellular concentration from a basal of 0.05–0.1 µM to stimulatory values &gt;0.15–0.2 µM that will trigger exocytosis of membrane-docked insulin granules <a href="#pone.0000983-Atwater2">[65]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-MacDonald1">[66]</a>. During this process, voltage–dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels will open in response to membrane depolarization, and will mediate outwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> current that serves to re-polarize cell membrane <a href="#pone.0000983-Atwater2">[65]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000983-MacDonald2">[67]</a>. Consequently, the electrical potential across β-cell membrane oscillates between depolarized plateaus, on which bursts of action potentials are superimposed, separated by repolarized electrically silent intervals. The bursting oscillations of membrane action potential give rise to oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration and in the secretion of insulin into blood stream. The duration and the periodicity of the bursts depend on glucose concentration. The rate of insulin release is believed to be roughly proportional to the “plateau fraction”, which is defined to be the relative time spent in the active phase divided by the total burst interval <a href="#pone.0000983-Atwater1">[37]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2"></a><p>Mathematically, β-cell electrical oscillation can be explained by the Hodgkin-Huxley theory of ion channel gating <a href="#pone.0000983-Hodgkin1">[68]</a>, with cell membrane electrical potential V described by a ordinary differential equation (essentially the Kirchhoff's voltage law of a RC circuit): <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000983.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>, where <em>C<sub>m</sub></em> is cell membrane capacitance.
