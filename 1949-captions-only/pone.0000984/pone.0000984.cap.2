                Figure 2.  HIVCONSV protein expression in human cells and basic immunogenicity.A histochemical and DAPI staining of 293T cells transiently transfected with pTH.HIVCONSV DNA (A), or infected with MVA.HIVCONSV (B) or AdHu5.HIVCONSV (C and D). HIVCONSV protein expression was detected using mAb tag Pk at the C-terminus of the immunogen and a primary anti-Pk mAb followed by secondary FITC- (A and B) or AlexaFluor584- (C and D) conjugated detection antibodies. The AdHu5.HIVCONSV vaccine also expressed GFP, which co-localized with the HIVCONSV expression (D). (E) BALB/c mice were immunized using the regimen indicated below, and the HIVCONSV-induced T cell responses were assessed in an ELISPOT assay using the H epitope. Results are shown as a mean±SD (n = 4). U–unimmunized; D–pTH.HIVCONSV DNA; A–AdHu5.HIVCONSV; and M–MVA.HIVCONSV. For doses and timing, see Methods.
