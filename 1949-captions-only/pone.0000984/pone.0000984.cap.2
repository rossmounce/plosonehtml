HIV<sub>CONSV</sub> protein expression was detected using mAb tag Pk at the C-terminus of the immunogen and a primary anti-Pk mAb followed by secondary FITC- (A and B) or AlexaFluor584- (C and D) conjugated detection antibodies. The AdHu5.HIV<sub>CONSV </sub>vaccine also expressed GFP, which co-localized with the HIV<sub>CONSV</sub> expression (D). (E) BALB/c mice were immunized using the regimen indicated below, and the HIV<sub>CONSV</sub>-induced T cell responses were assessed in an ELISPOT assay using the H epitope. Results are shown as a mean±SD (n = 4). U–unimmunized; D–pTH.HIV<sub>CONSV</sub> DNA; A–AdHu5.HIV<sub>CONSV</sub>; and M–MVA.HIV<sub>CONSV</sub>.
