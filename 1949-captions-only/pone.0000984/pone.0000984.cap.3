                Figure 3.  Breadth of HIVCONSV-induced T cell responses in BALB/c mice.Mice were immunized using the regimen and immunogen indicated above (A, B and C) or below (D) the graphs and the HIVCONSV-specific responses were determined in ex vivo ELISPOT (A and E) or ICS (B and D) assays detecting the indicated cytokines and using for restimulation overlapping peptide pools schematically shown in Fig. 1D (A and B) or individual epitope peptides (D and E). (C) Identified peptides or epitope sequences and their origin, name and T cell reactivity. In (D): white–IFN-γ; black–IL-2; stripy-IFN-γ+IL-2; and grey–TNF-α; *-responses significantly above the no-peptide background (p&lt;0.05). In (E): white–no peptide followed from left to right by epitopes H, G1, G2, P1, P2 and P3. Results are shown as a mean±SD (n = 4). For doses and timing, see Methods.
