(C) Identified peptides or epitope sequences and their origin, name and T cell reactivity. In (D): white–IFN-γ; black–IL-2; stripy-IFN-γ+IL-2; and grey–TNF-α; *-responses significantly above the no-peptide background (p&lt;0.05). In (E): white–no peptide followed from left to right by epitopes H, G1, G2, P1, P2 and P3. Results are shown as a mean±SD (n = 4). For doses and timing, see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>.</p>
