                Figure 4.  HIVCONSV-induced T cell responses in HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice, strain HHD.(A) Mice were immunized using the DAM regimen and the vaccine-induced responses were detected in an ex vivo ELISPOT assay. Results are shown as a meanÂ±SD (n = 4). For doses and timing, see Methods. (B) Identified epitope peptides and their origin. (C) Killing of murine EL4 A2-Kd (top) and human JK A2-Kd (bottom) target cells sensitized with the shown peptides in a 51Cr-release assay after a 5-day in vitro peptide re-stimulation. Black, grey and white bars indicated effector to target ratios of 100, 50 and 25 to 1, respectively.
