(A) Summed frequencies of HIV<sub>CONSV</sub>-specific cells detected in healthy (n = 9) and HIV-1-infected (n = 13) subjects. The bars show the group medians of 578 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> and 8,092 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells for the healthy and infected subjects, respectively. (B) In five subjects indicated below, cultured PBMC were left undepleted (grey) or depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (black) prior to the ELISPOT assay. The difference between undepleted (median = 8,092 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells) and CD8-depleted samples (median = 550 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells) was statistically significant (<em>p</em> = 0.0313). (C) Responses to individual HIV<sub>CONSV</sub>-derived peptide pools as shown in Fig. 1D determined for the HIV-1-infected (grey) and healthy (black) subjects shown as medians. (D) Responses to individual peptides pools for each HIV-1-infected patient indicated below. Bars show a mean±SD of three assay wells and ‘*’ indicates a positive response according to criteria set in <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. Due to sample shortage, subject 021 was not tested.</p>
