                Figure 5.  Recognition of HIVCONSV-derived peptides by PBMC from HIV-1-infected patients.The HIVCONSV-specific memory T cells were assessed in healthy and HIV-1-infected subjects using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay after a 10-day peptide and cytokine culture. (A) Summed frequencies of HIVCONSV-specific cells detected in healthy (n = 9) and HIV-1-infected (n = 13) subjects. The bars show the group medians of 578 SFU/106 and 8,092 SFU/106 cells for the healthy and infected subjects, respectively. (B) In five subjects indicated below, cultured PBMC were left undepleted (grey) or depleted of CD8+ cells (black) prior to the ELISPOT assay. The difference between undepleted (median = 8,092 SFU/106 cells) and CD8-depleted samples (median = 550 SFU/106 cells) was statistically significant (p = 0.0313). (C) Responses to individual HIVCONSV-derived peptide pools as shown in Fig. 1D determined for the HIV-1-infected (grey) and healthy (black) subjects shown as medians. (D) Responses to individual peptides pools for each HIV-1-infected patient indicated below. Bars show a mean±SD of three assay wells and ‘*’ indicates a positive response according to criteria set in Methods. Due to sample shortage, subject 021 was not tested.
