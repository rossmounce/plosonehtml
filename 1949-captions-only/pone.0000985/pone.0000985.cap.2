Leaves or inflorescence tissue were infiltrated with X-gluc at the time points indicated. Pictures at 1 dpi (Panel A) and 2 dpi (Panel B) are photomicrographs at 200× magnification (with 20× objective and WH10 eyepiece). Panel C is leaves from 3 dpi. In case of 8 dpi (Panel D) and 16 dpi (Panel E), leaves were bleached following color development. Panels F and G are floral clusters from mock inoculated plant and TEV-GUS inoculated plant, respectively (18 dpi).</p>
