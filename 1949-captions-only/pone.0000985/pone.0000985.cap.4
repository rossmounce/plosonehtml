                Figure 4.  Rate of cell-cell movement of TEV-GUS in inoculated leaves of B149 and C24.Leaves from plants inoculated with TEV-GUS were harvested at time points indicated and infiltrated with the colorimetric substrate X-gluc. Foci diameter were measured microscopically at time points indicated and represented as mean (Â±SD). Data at 24 h represent mean of 17 foci, other points represent mean of 39 foci.
