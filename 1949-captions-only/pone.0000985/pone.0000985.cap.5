                Figure 5.  Systemic movement of TEV-GUS in C24, B149 and Col plants.GUS activity, at time point indicated. Data for both time points are from the same set of 10 plants. All plants were confirmed to be successfully inoculated by detection of infection foci in inoculated leaves by infiltration of the colorimetric substrate X-gluc. Since data points overlap, the number of independent points represented (out of ten) are indicated in the graph.
