<h4>Experimental design</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>In our experiments we used three different water solutions, each representing one of the three phases in the conventional sewage treatment process outlined in the previous paragraph: (1) raw sewage water, (2) water from combined mechanical/chemical treatment, and (3) water from activated sludge treatment. All three water solutions were collected in one liter bottles as grab samples during two days in June 2006 at Umeå Sewage Treatment Plant, (for a detailed description of the plant, see references <a href="#pone.0000986-Lindberg1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000986-Lindberg2">[8]</a>. During the two days of collecting water, normal conditions were reported for water treatment, with some minor rainfall during the second day. To avoid misinterpretation of the results, quantification of OC in all the raw sewage water samples was made and additional batch experiments (3 ½ h) conducted using tap water to assess possible OC degradation or adsorption to glass walls.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>All batch experiments started within 1 hour of water collection and were conducted as follows: 200 ng of OC, was added to 200 mL of each type of water and gently stirred in an open 500 mL flask at 20°C. The duration of each experiment was determined by the hydraulic retention time in the plant: (1) raw sewage water, 2 ½ h (the assumed time the water spends in the sewage line upon reaching the sewage treatment plant); (2) water from mechanical/chemical treatment, 1 ½ h; and (3) water from activated sludge treatment, 3 ½ h. This approach has been used previously with relevant and reproducible results <a href="#pone.0000986-Ternes1">[9]</a>. When the hydraulic retention time was reached, the sample was immediately subjected to solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Each experiment was conducted in triplicate for each water solution type to assess day-to-day variation of the sewage water treatment process and experiments: (day 1) n = 1; and (day 2) n = 2. The amount of suspended solids (SS) and pH of the various water samples included in the batch experiments can be seen in <a href="#pone-0000986-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
