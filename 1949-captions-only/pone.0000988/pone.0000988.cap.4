Gene pairs in each set were ranked by LLS scores, then cumulative precision and recall were calculated for each successive bin of 1,000 gene pairs (each symbol indicates a bin). The confidence measures for each individual data type can be seen to rank the gene pairs effectively. YeastNet v. 2 shows high overall performance, with the integration of the heterogeneous genomics data improving both reliability and completeness of the overall model.</p>
