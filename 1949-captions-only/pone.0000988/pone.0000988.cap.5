For both reference sets, we observe significantly improved recall by YeastNet v. 2 for both yeast genes and reference linkages. The effect of the annotation “protein synthesis” is revealed by a significant drop of precision in YeastNet v. 1 but not v. 2 after masking the term during benchmarking. The higher fraction of linkages derived from “protein synthesis” in KOG (~17% of total linkages) than MIPS (~4% of total MIPS linkages) explains the apparently higher precision of v. 1 than v. 2 when including the term in (B), resulting in a correspondingly larger drop in precision of v. 1 when the term is masked. All analyses in (A) and (B) are for the 34,000 most confident linkages of each network.</p>
