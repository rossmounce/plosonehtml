(A) shows the trend for a high quality protein-protein physical interaction network derived from DIP <a href="#pone.0000988-Xenarios1">[30]</a> and bioGRID <a href="#pone.0000988-Reguly1">[29]</a>, (B) shows the trend for YeastNet version 1 (34,000 most confident linkages only), and (C) shows the trend for YeastNet version 2. For both functional networks, degree centrality is weighted by the interaction LLS scores (<em>i.e</em>., calculated as the sum of LLS scores for a gene, divided by the maximum sum of LLS scores observed in the network). The degree of correlation is measured as the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>).</p>
