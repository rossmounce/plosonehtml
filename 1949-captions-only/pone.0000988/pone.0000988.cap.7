Additional evidence for the participation of <em>PUF6</em> in 60S biogenesis can be seen (C) in the co-sedimentation of the TAP-tagged Puf6 protein <a href="#pone.0000988-Ghaemmaghami1">[40]</a> with the 60S ribosomal subunits, as measured by Western blotting of lysates separated by sucrose density gradient. <em>TDH1</em> encodes a cytoplasmic protein with no known association with ribosomal subunits, serving as a negative control. <em>NMD3</em> encodes a known 60S biogenesis factor <a href="#pone.0000988-Ho1">[38]</a>, serving as positive control. Puf6-TAP shows a similar sedimentation profile as Nmd3-TAP, supporting the role of <em>PUF6</em> in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.</p>
