                Figure 7.  Experimental validation of the participation of PUF6 in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.(A) A puf6Δ deletion strain [27] shows a marked conditional growth defect compared to wild-type (WT) cells when grown at 20 °C, accompanied by (B) a decrease in the ratio of 60S/40S ribosomal subunits and the formation of halfmer polysomes, as measured by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm of clarified yeast cell lysate separated on a 7 to 47 % sucrose density gradient. Additional evidence for the participation of PUF6 in 60S biogenesis can be seen (C) in the co-sedimentation of the TAP-tagged Puf6 protein [40] with the 60S ribosomal subunits, as measured by Western blotting of lysates separated by sucrose density gradient. TDH1 encodes a cytoplasmic protein with no known association with ribosomal subunits, serving as a negative control. NMD3 encodes a known 60S biogenesis factor [38], serving as positive control. Puf6-TAP shows a similar sedimentation profile as Nmd3-TAP, supporting the role of PUF6 in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.
