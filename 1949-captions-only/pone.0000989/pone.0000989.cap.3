                Figure 3.  Double strand breaks in pachytene spermatocytes detected using γH2AX immunohistochemistry on germ cell spreads.Immunodetection of SCP3 (red) and γH2AX (green) in TG-Ercc1 (A–C), Msh2 (E–G) and p53 (I–K) spermatocytes. The Sex body is highlighted with white arrows and foci are highlighted with arrowheads. Quantification of γH2AX foci per 50 pachytene spermatocytes per mouse in D) TG-Ercc1, H) Msh2 and L) p53 (n = 3–7). ** (P&lt;0.01) and *** (P&lt;0.001) indicates significant variation compared to wild type.
