                Figure 1.  Biphasic decline of the CML cell population as a function of time, for parameters l = 1, d = 1.5, α = 0.01, β = 0.2, I0 = 108 and J0 = 102.The solid line represents log10(x(t)+y(t)), and the dashed lines are log10(g+exp{λ+t}) and log10(g-exp{λ-t}) (See Text S1, Section 1.1 and 1.2 for details). The time of treatment in this case is Ttreat = 72.1 and the switching time is Tswitch = 5.1.
