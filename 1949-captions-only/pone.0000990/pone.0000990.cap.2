                Figure 2.  The relative amount of CML cells as a fuction of time, in patients treated with Imatinib.The circles represent experimental data replotted from (a) Michor et al [30] and (b) from Roeder et al [29]; they show the median values of BCR-ABL transcripts (relative to BCR transcripts in (a) and ABL transcripts in (b)). The vertical bars are the quartiles. The solid lines represent the fitted theoretical curves, formula (7) of Text S1, obtained by a mean-square procedure. The estimated parameter values are: (a) d-l = 0.0502 days−1, β = 0.0065 days−1, α = 10−5 days−1, J0 = 0.47; (b) d-l = 0.0278 days−1, β = 0.0067 days−1, α = 0.0004 days−1, J0 = 0.50. Here J0 denotes the initial percentage of quiescent CML cells.
