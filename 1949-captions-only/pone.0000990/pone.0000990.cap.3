<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p7"></a><p>In summary, whether or not CML can be cured by imatinib therapy in the absence of acquired resistance depends on the time it takes for the cancer cells to be driven extinct by the treatment, and this in turn depends on the rate constants. Eventual CML extinction is the only theoretically possible outcome in the presence of therapy, but it may be achieved after a period of time that is longer than the life-span of the patient. Variations in parameters that determine the kinetics of cellular quiescence can determine whether relapse is observed in patients that stop imatinib treatment after a certain period of time <a href="#pone.0000990-Rousselot1">[33]</a>. Note that our notion of treatment induced “cancer extinction” is a mathematical one, that is, in the model we analyze here, the cancer cell population goes extinct, which corresponds to a cure. In patients, however, other complicating factors not included in this model may render tumor extinction a difficult goal to achieve by treatment. Therefore, our mathematical notion of “tumor extinction” should be translated into “clinical remission” in a medical context.</p>


<h4>Quiescence and the generation of drug resistant mutants</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>In the next, more complete model, CML cells can mutate to give rise to acquired drug resistance. In particular, we assume that during cell division, a resistant mutant is generated with a probability <em>u</em>. We further assume that CML cells grow exponentially to a defined size <em>N</em>, after which the disease is detected and imatinib therapy is started. We calculate the probability that the cancer is driven extinct by therapy, i.e. the probability that no resistant mutants spread before the CML cells have gone extinct. We examine how this probability depends on the parameters that determine cellular growth, mutations, quiescence and death. When talking about tumor extinction in the model, we always imply extinction brought about by drug therapy. As noted before, this should be thought of as “clinical remission” in medical rather than mathematical terms.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>A previous model studied the probability of treatment failure as a result of drug resistance, but did not take into account cellular quiescence <a href="#pone.0000990-Komarova1">[41]</a>. There, the result was obtained that the treatment phase is largely irrelevant for the generation of resistance. That is, if treatment does fail because of drug resistant mutants, these mutants were generated in the growth phase before the start of therapy. Quiescence can significantly slow down the rate with which the tumor cell population declines during treatment, thus prolonging this phase. The argument has been made that the tumor might acquire resistance during this phase and that this could lead to a relapse of the tumor after a certain time, despite continued therapy. We have performed a similar analysis with the current model, and found that even in the presence of quiescence, the treatment phase is not relevant for the generation of drug resistant mutants, no matter how long treatment takes. Thus, if at the start of therapy no resistant mutants exist, treatment is likely to result in the extinction of the tumor, given enough time (see <a href="#pone.0000990.s001">Text S1</a> Section 2.2 for calculations).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>With this in mind, we calculate the probability of treatment success depending on the rate at which cells enter quiescence, <em>α</em>, and the rate at which cells exit the quiescent state, <em>β</em>. Several scenarios are considered. First we study resistance against a single drug (i.e. imatinib in CML treatment). We then also take into account resistance against 2 or more drugs used in combination. This is relevant because in addition to imatinib, further drugs are being developed that could be used in combination with imatinib to treat CML <a href="#pone.0000990-Shah1">[23]</a>, <a href="#pone.0000990-Jabbour1">[42]</a>. In the main body of the paper we only present intuitive arguments. The rigorous calculations are given in <a href="#pone.0000990.s001">Text S1</a> Section 2. Throughout the next few paragraphs we make the simplifying assumption that the cell death rate in the pre-treatment phase is zero. Also, the theoretical explanations will concentrate on one of the quiescence parameters, <em>α</em>, which is the rate of entering the state of quiescence. The rate of cell awakening, <em>β</em>, can be treated similarly (see e.g. <a href="#pone.0000990.s001">Text S1</a>, Section 3.4). <a href="#pone-0000990-g004">Figure 4</a> illustrates the <em>α</em>- and <em>β</em>- dependence of the probability of no resistance. It was created by numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations for the characteristics, see the theory of <a href="#pone.0000990.s001">Text S1</a>, Section 2.3. The calculations give rise to the following findings.</p>
