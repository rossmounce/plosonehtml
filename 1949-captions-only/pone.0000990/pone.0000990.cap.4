                Figure 4.  The probability of having no fully-resistant mutants at size N for different quiescence parameters.The numerical simulations are performed according to the theory described in Text S1, Section 2.3. Each figure (a)–(d) shows the probability of no resistant mutants as a function of β (the rate of cell awakening), for 10 different values of α (the rate at which cells become quiescent), α = 0.1, 0.2, … and 1.0. (a) Treatment with m = 1 drugs; all the curves corresponding to different values of α are the same. The parameters are N0 = 107 and u = 10−7. (b) Treatment with m = 2 drugs, N = 1011, u = 10−7. (c) m = 3 drugs, N = 1013, u = 10−6. (d) m = 4 drugs, N = 1013, u = 10−5. In all plots, we took M0 = 103, l = 1, d = 0. The reason we used different values of N and u for different values of m is because we chose the parameter regime corresponding to intermediate values of the probability of treatment success. When this probability is nearly 100% or nearly 0, then the dependence on α and β is less apparent and less meaningful.
