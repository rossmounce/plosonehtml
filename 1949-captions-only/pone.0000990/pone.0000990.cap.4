Each figure (a)–(d) shows the probability of no resistant mutants as a function of <em>β</em> (the rate of cell awakening), for 10 different values of <em>α</em> (the rate at which cells become quiescent), α = 0.1, 0.2, … and 1.0. (a) Treatment with <em>m = 1</em> drugs; all the curves corresponding to different values of α are the same. The parameters are <em>N<sub>0</sub> = 10<sup>7</sup></em> and <em>u = 10<sup>−7</sup></em>. (b) Treatment with <em>m = 2</em> drugs, <em>N = 10<sup>11</sup></em>, <em>u = 10<sup>−7</sup></em>. (c) <em>m = 3</em> drugs, <em>N = 10<sup>13</sup></em>, <em>u = 10<sup>−6</sup></em>. (d) <em>m = 4</em> drugs, <em>N = 10<sup>13</sup></em>, <em>u = 10<sup>−5</sup></em>. In all plots, we took <em>M<sub>0</sub> = 10<sup>3</sup></em>, <em>l = 1</em>, <em>d = 0</em>. The reason we used different values of <em>N</em> and <em>u</em> for different values of <em>m</em> is because we chose the parameter regime corresponding to intermediate values of the probability of treatment success. When this probability is nearly 100% or nearly 0, then the dependence on <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> is less apparent and less meaningful.</p>
