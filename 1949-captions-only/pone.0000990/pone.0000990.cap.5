Columns depict states of the colony in consecutive moments of time. The changes are marked by arrows. Two arrows stemming from one cell represent a cell division. A single arrow represents either a cell becoming quiescent or a quiescent cell waking up. (a) A colony without quiescence. (b) A colony with quiescence. In both cases we can see that it takes exactly N-1 = 5 cell divisions to expand to size <em>N</em>; however the process in (b) contains more “events”.</p>
