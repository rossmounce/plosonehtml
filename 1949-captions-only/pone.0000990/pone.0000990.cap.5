                Figure 5.  A schematic demonstrating the number of cell divisions that is needed for a colony of cells to expand from 1 cell to N cells (in the figure, N = 6).Empty circles represent cycling cells, and gray circles represent quiescent cells. Columns depict states of the colony in consecutive moments of time. The changes are marked by arrows. Two arrows stemming from one cell represent a cell division. A single arrow represents either a cell becoming quiescent or a quiescent cell waking up. (a) A colony without quiescence. (b) A colony with quiescence. In both cases we can see that it takes exactly N-1 = 5 cell divisions to expand to size N; however the process in (b) contains more “events”.
