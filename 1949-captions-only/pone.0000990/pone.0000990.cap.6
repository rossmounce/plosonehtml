The white triangles depict growing colonies of cells (cells with quiescence grow slower). The end size is the same in both cases. Dark triangles represent growing mutant clones inside the colonies. The total number of mutant colonies is the same in both cases (the same number of cell divisions). The mutant colonies in (b) have a longer time to grow, but at the same time they grow slower. Therefore the resulting frequency of mutants is the same in (a) and (b).</p>
