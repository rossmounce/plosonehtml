There are three moments of time shown, first we have <em>N = 24</em>, then <em>N = 48</em> and finally <em>N = 72</em>. Circles represent wild-type cells, and stars–one-hit mutants. Gray shading denotes the state of quiescence for wild-type and mutant cells. In (a) we assume no quiescence (<em>α = 0</em>), whereas in (b) there is a probability to become quiescent (with α = <em>1/3)</em>. The number of cycling 1-hit mutants (empty stars) is the same in (a) and (b ) for the same values of <em>N</em>. The number of quiescent wild-type cells is given by the fraction α of all wild-type cells (e.g. 1/3 in (b)). At each moment of time, one of the cycling cells is picked for reproduction. We can see that the probability to pick a 1-hit mutant is always higher in (b) than in (a), because the fraction of cycling one-hit mutants increases as the tumor grows. Therefore, the probability to create a 2-hit mutant is higher in (b).</p>
