                Figure 7.  A schematic illustrating the argument stating that the probability to produce 2-hit mutants increases with quiescence.Each rectangle represents a colony of cells. There are three moments of time shown, first we have N = 24, then N = 48 and finally N = 72. Circles represent wild-type cells, and stars–one-hit mutants. Gray shading denotes the state of quiescence for wild-type and mutant cells. In (a) we assume no quiescence (α = 0), whereas in (b) there is a probability to become quiescent (with α = 1/3). The number of cycling 1-hit mutants (empty stars) is the same in (a) and (b ) for the same values of N. The number of quiescent wild-type cells is given by the fraction α of all wild-type cells (e.g. 1/3 in (b)). At each moment of time, one of the cycling cells is picked for reproduction. We can see that the probability to pick a 1-hit mutant is always higher in (b) than in (a), because the fraction of cycling one-hit mutants increases as the tumor grows. Therefore, the probability to create a 2-hit mutant is higher in (b).
