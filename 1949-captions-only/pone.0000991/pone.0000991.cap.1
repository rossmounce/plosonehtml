<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>After completion of pre-training testing, subjects were then randomized to either a combination of CrM and CLA (CrM+CLA) (5 g CrM (Neotine®)+2 g dextrose/d, Palo Alta, CA); and 6 g of CLA (CLA-ONE® 45% c9, t11; 45% t10, c12, Pharmanutrients, Gurnee, IL) or placebo (PL) (7 g dextrose/d+6 g of safflower oil/d) for 24 weeks. The CrM+CLA group consisted of 11 men and 10 women, while the PL group consisted of 8 men and 10 women (<a href="#pone-0000991-t001">Table 1</a>). Randomization was done by having recruited men and women randomly draw from two blocks (one male and one female) each containing twenty-four shuffled/sealed envelopes with each block having equal allocation to treatment (N = 12/block) or placebo (N = 12/block). After six months of recruitment and a lack of drop-outs, we closed recruitment with a total of 19 men and 20 women randomized to the trial. The flavor and appearance of the supplements were indistinguishable by the subjects and investigators. Subjects were instructed to consume their supplements daily and return unused supplements every month to ensure compliance.</p>
