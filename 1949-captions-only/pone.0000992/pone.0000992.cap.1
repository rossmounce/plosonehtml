                Figure 1.  The deletion of PKBα leads to a reduced thymic size in mouse neonates.A: The weight of freshly dissected thymi was measured in PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− neonates (top panel) and expressed as ratio to body weight (bottom panel). The kidney was used as a control. Error bars represent standard error of the mean; n≥13. B: Western-blot analysis of 50 µg protein extracts from wild-type neonatal thymus using PKB isoform specific antibodies (top panel). Western-blot analysis of 50 µg protein extracts from PKBβ−/−, PKBβ+/+, PKBγ−/−, and PKBγ+/+ neonatal thymi using PKB isoform specific antibodies (bottom panel). Actin was used as a loading control. C: The weight of freshly dissected thymi was measured in PKBβ+/+, PKBβ−/−, PKBγ+/+, and PKBγ−/− neonates (top panels) and expressed as ratio to body weight (bottom panels). The kidney was used as a control. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. n≥7 (n = number of mice analyzed per genotype).
