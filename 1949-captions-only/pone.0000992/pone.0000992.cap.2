                Figure 2.  The deletion of PKBα leads to a reduced number of thymocytes in neonatal mice.A: Thymocytes were isolated from neonatal PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− littermates and their size compared by flow cytometry using the forward scatter (FSC) parameter. The histogram is representative of 3 litters. B: (left panel) Thymocytes were isolated and counted from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− neonatal mice. (right panel) Lymphocytes isolated from the spleen of PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− neonates were stained with anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 antibodies. The number of T cells (CD3+CD19−) is shown. n≥3. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. C: TUNEL assay on neonatal thymus sections from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− littermates. The graph represents the quantification of TUNEL-positive cells from 5 fields on 3 sections. The result shown is representative of 3 independent experiments. The bar shown on the pictures represents 200 µm. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. D: Thymocytes were isolated from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− neonates and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Histograms show results that are representative of 2 independent experiments; n≥3 (n = number of mice per genotype within the same experiment).
