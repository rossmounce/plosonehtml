                Figure 3.  The lack of PKBα leads to an accumulation of DN3 and ISP8 early thymocyte subsets.Flow cytometric analysis of early thymocytes at the transition from DN to DP. A: Density plots show thymocytes from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− mice that were stained with cell surface markers for identification of lineage-negative thymocytes DN1 (CD25−CD44+), DN2 (CD25+CD44+), DN3 (CD25+CD44−), and DN4 (CD25−CD44−). B: Histograms show the intracellular protein expression of TCRβ (iTCRβ) in DN3 thymocytes from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− mice. C: Histograms show the surface expression of CD25 on lineage-negative PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− thymocytes. MFI: mean fluorescence intensity. D: Density plots and histograms show thymocytes from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− mice that were labeled with cell surface markers for identification of ISP8 (CD4−CD8+CD3−) thymocytes. E: Histograms show the intracellular protein expression of TCRβ (iTCRβ) in ISP8 thymocytes from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− mice. The results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments on 4 to 6 week-old mice. n≥4 (n = number of mice per genotype within the same experiment).
