A: Density plots show thymocytes from <em>PKBα</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>PKBα</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice that were stained with cell surface markers for identification of lineage-negative thymocytes DN1 (CD25<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>), DN2 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>), DN3 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup>), and DN4 (CD25<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup>). B: Histograms show the intracellular protein expression of TCRβ (iTCRβ) in DN3 thymocytes from <em>PKBα</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>PKBα</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice. C: Histograms show the surface expression of CD25 on lineage-negative <em>PKBα</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>PKBα</em><sup>−/−</sup> thymocytes. MFI: mean fluorescence intensity. D: Density plots and histograms show thymocytes from <em>PKBα</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>PKBα</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice that were labeled with cell surface markers for identification of ISP8 (CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup>) thymocytes. E: Histograms show the intracellular protein expression of TCRβ (iTCRβ) in ISP8 thymocytes from <em>PKBα</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>PKBα</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments on 4 to 6 week-old mice. n≥4 (n = number of mice per genotype within the same experiment).</p>
