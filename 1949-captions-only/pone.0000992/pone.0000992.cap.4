                Figure 4.  The accumulation of early thymocytes is due to PKBα deficiency in the lymphoid compartment. A: Western-blot analysis of 50 µg protein extracts from PKBα+/+, PKBα+/−, and PKBα−/− isolated thymocytes using antibodies directed against either PKBα or phospho(Thr308)-PKB (PDK1 site). Actin was used as a loading control. B: Thymocytes were isolated from PKBα+/+ and PKBα−/− thymic grafts and counted 4 weeks post grafting (left panel). Lymphocytes were isolated from thymus and spleen of lethally irradiated congenic recipient mice injected with either PKBα+/+ or PKBα−/− fetal liver cells and counted 5 weeks post transplant (right panel). Error bars represent standard error of the mean; n≥5. C–D: Flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes. C: Host-derived thymocytes developed in the PKBα+/+ or PKBα−/− fetal thymi grafted under the kidney capsule of wild-type mice were isolated 4 weeks post-grafting and stained with cell surface markers for identification of early thymocyte subsets. D: Thymocytes developed from PKBα+/+ or PKBα−/− fetal liver-derived HSC in lethally-irradiated wild-type congenic mice were isolated 5 weeks after reconstitution and stained with cell surface markers for identification of early thymocyte subsets. Representative density plots and histograms are shown. n≥5 (n = number of mice per genotype within the same experiment).
