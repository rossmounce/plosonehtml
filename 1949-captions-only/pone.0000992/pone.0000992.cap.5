The expression data obtained following microarray analysis were corrected for GC-bias within oligos, allowing gene expression signals to be expressed on the same scale; this permits a semi-quantitative comparison of the expression of different genes. B: Proposed model of PKBα mediating PI3K signaling at the transition from DN to DP thymocyte subsets. iTCRβ and TCR refer to intracellular and surface expression of TCRβ, respectively.</p>
