The basic skeleton of an allyl phenylpropene is shown, along with the numbering of the carbon atoms used in this manuscript. The iso phenylpropenes differ in the position of the double bond (C7 = C8) in the propene side group. For eugenol (an allyl phenylpropene), the phenyl-ring substituents are 2 = H, 3 = OCH<sub>3</sub>, 4 = OH, and 5 = H. The possible methylenedioxy-bridge modifications are also shown. (B) Simplified reaction scheme for the biosynthesis of eugenol from L-phenylalanine and the monolignol alcohol, coniferyl alcohol (CFAT: coniferyl alcohol acetyl transferase; EGS: eugenol synthase).</p>
