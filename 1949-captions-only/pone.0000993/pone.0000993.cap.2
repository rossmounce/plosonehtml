The polypeptide chain of EGS is represented as a ribbon, with coloring varying from blue for the N-terminus to red for the C-terminus. The atoms of the NADP<sup>+</sup> cofactor are drawn as balls and sticks, and are colored coded according to element (carbon: gray; nitrogen: blue; oxygen: red; phosphorus: orange). (B) Superposition of the polypeptide-chain backbones of EGS and other PIP-family enzymes (color coding as shown in inset). The NADP<sup>+</sup> cofactor of EGS is also shown (the structures of the other PIP-family enzymes were determined in the absence of cofactor).</p>
