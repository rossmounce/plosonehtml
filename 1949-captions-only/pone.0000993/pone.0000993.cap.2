                Figure 2.  Structure of EGS and comparison with other PIP-family enzymes.(A) Orthogonal views of EGS/NADP+ monomer. The polypeptide chain of EGS is represented as a ribbon, with coloring varying from blue for the N-terminus to red for the C-terminus. The atoms of the NADP+ cofactor are drawn as balls and sticks, and are colored coded according to element (carbon: gray; nitrogen: blue; oxygen: red; phosphorus: orange). (B) Superposition of the polypeptide-chain backbones of EGS and other PIP-family enzymes (color coding as shown in inset). The NADP+ cofactor of EGS is also shown (the structures of the other PIP-family enzymes were determined in the absence of cofactor).
