Hydrogen-bond interactions formed by the cofactor are represented as magenta dashed lines. Atom coloring is the same as in <a href="#pone-0000993-g002">Figure 2A</a>, except that the carbon atoms of the polypeptide-chain segments are green. The blue-colored contours envelope regions greater than 3Ïƒ in the NADP-omit electron-density map.</p>
