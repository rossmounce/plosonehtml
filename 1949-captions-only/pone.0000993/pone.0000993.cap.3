                Figure 3.  Interactions between EGS and the NADP+ cofactor.Only the EGS polypeptide-chain segments that form direct interactions with the NADP+ cofactor are shown. Hydrogen-bond interactions formed by the cofactor are represented as magenta dashed lines. Atom coloring is the same as in Figure 2A, except that the carbon atoms of the polypeptide-chain segments are green. The blue-colored contours envelope regions greater than 3Ïƒ in the NADP-omit electron-density map.
