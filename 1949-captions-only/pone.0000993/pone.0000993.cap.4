For clarity, only the NADP<sup>+</sup> cofactor of EGS is shown. (B) Comparison of NAD(P)-cofactor conformation and substrate-analog binding in EGS and UDP-galactose epimerase. The binding of the EGS competitive inhibitor (7S,8S)-ethyl (7,8-methylene)-dihydroferulate (EMDF) is described in detail in the text and <a href="#pone-0000993-g005">Figure 5</a>. The coloring of the polypeptide-chain segments is the same as in (A). The inset shows the coloring used for the carbon atoms of the nicotinamide cofactors, EMDF bound to EGS, and UDP-glucose bound to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase.</p>
