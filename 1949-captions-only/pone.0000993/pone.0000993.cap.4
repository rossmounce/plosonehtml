                Figure 4.  Structural comparison of EGS and UDP-galactose epimerase.(A) Superposition of polypeptide-chain backbones of EGS and UDP-galactose epimerase (color coding as shown in inset). For clarity, only the NADP+ cofactor of EGS is shown. (B) Comparison of NAD(P)-cofactor conformation and substrate-analog binding in EGS and UDP-galactose epimerase. The binding of the EGS competitive inhibitor (7S,8S)-ethyl (7,8-methylene)-dihydroferulate (EMDF) is described in detail in the text and Figure 5. The coloring of the polypeptide-chain segments is the same as in (A). The inset shows the coloring used for the carbon atoms of the nicotinamide cofactors, EMDF bound to EGS, and UDP-glucose bound to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase.
