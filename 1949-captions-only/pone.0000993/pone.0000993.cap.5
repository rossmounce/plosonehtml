                Figure 5.  Binding of the competitive inhibitor EMDF by EGS.(A) Orthogonal views of the 7S,8S- stereoisomer of the competitive inhibitor EMDF bound to EGS. Hydrogen-bond interactions formed by the EMDF molecule (cyan colored carbons) are represented as magenta dashed lines. The blue-colored contours envelope regions greater than 2.5σ in the initial Fobs-Fcalc electron-density map. The direction of view used in the right panel (approximately perpendicular to the plane of the nicotinamide ring) is maintained roughly in figures 5B–D and 6B. The chemical structure of EMDF is shown in the inset. (B) Modeled binding of coniferyl acetate to EGS. The atom coloring is the same as in (A), with magenta carbon atoms for the coniferyl acetate. The chemical structures of coniferyl acetate and EMDF are compared in the inset. The close interaction between the EMDF C7-atom and the hydride donor of the nicotinamide (C4) is shown as a yellow dashed line. (C) Binding of EMDF to the Lys132Gln variant of EGS. Hydrogen-bond interactions formed by the EMDF molecule (cyan colored carbons) are represented as magenta dashed lines. Hydrogen bonds involving the side chain of Gln132 are shown as orange dashed lines. The blue-colored contours envelope regions greater than 2.0σ in the initial Fobs-Fcalc electron-density map. (D) Binding of EMDF to the Lys132Arg variant of EGS (stereo representation). The blue-colored contours envelope regions greater than 2σ in the initial Fobs-Fcalc electron-density map for the EGS-Arg132/EMDF complex (green). The altered positioning of the Arg132 side-chain and neighboring residues (most notably Phe85, Ile88, and Ile129) and the disordering of the C-terminal tail (residues 310–314) are apparent with respect to the holo-EGS-Arg132 structure (magenta). For comparison, the position of the wild-type Lys132 side chain and the key bridging water molecule shown in Figure 5A are also shown (yellow).
