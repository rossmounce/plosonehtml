                Figure 6.  Hydrogen-bonding interactions in the EGS active-site and proposed reaction mechanism of EGS.(A) Hydrogen-bonding network involving the Lys132 side-chain amino group, the 4-hydroxyl group of EMDF, and the bridging water molecule. Inferred hydrogen-atom positions are shown in blue. Hydrogen-bond interactions are represented as magenta dashed lines. (B) Comparison of the hydrogen-bond interactions made by the catalytic lysine residue in EGS (Lys132) and the SDR UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (Lys153). The inset shows the coloring used for the carbon atoms of EMDF bound to EGS, and UDP-glucose bound to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase. Hydrogen bonds are drawn as thin dashed lines. Water molecules are drawn as red spheres. Those outlined in the pale red form part of a postulated proton-relay network in UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, whereas the presumed catalytic water molecule in EGS is outlined in green and marked with an asterisk. (C) Proposed reaction mechanism of EGS (and IGS) involving a quinone-methide intermediate. The catalytic base (B:) that promotes deprotonation of the 4-hydroxyl group of the substrate is the hydroxide ion that is activated by the side-chain amino group of Lys132. The loss of acetate generates the quinone-methide intermediate. The attack at C7 of this intermediate by the NADPH-derived hydride yields the allyl phenylpropene eugenol, whereas hydride attack at C9 presumably yields the iso-phenylpropene isoeugenol.
