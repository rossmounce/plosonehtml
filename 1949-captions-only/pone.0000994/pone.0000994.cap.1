There were main effects of brood and worker species, and a brood-by-worker interaction. Means and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Filled symbols denote conspecific worker-brood combinations and open symbols denote heterospecific worker-brood combinations. Lines connect worker-brood combinations with the same brood species and the crossing of lines indicates the brood-by-worker interaction.</p>
