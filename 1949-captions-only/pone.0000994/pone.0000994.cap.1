                Figure 1.  Mass of workers produced when cross-fostered brood were reared to adulthood.The adult mass of focal individuals depended on their own genotype (i.e. brood species) as well as the genotype of care-giving workers (i.e. worker species). There were main effects of brood and worker species, and a brood-by-worker interaction. Means and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Filled symbols denote conspecific worker-brood combinations and open symbols denote heterospecific worker-brood combinations. Lines connect worker-brood combinations with the same brood species and the crossing of lines indicates the brood-by-worker interaction.
