The main effect of brood species and the worker-by-brood interaction remained significant, and the overall pattern for residual worker mass is very similar to the pattern for mass shown in <a href="#pone-0000994-g001">Figure 1</a>. Means and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Filled symbols denote conspecific worker-brood combinations and open symbols denote heterospecific worker-brood combinations. Lines connect worker-brood combinations with the same brood species and the crossing of lines indicates the brood-by-worker interaction.</p>
