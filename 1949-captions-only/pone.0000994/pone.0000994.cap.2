                Figure 2.  Residual mass of workers produced from cross-fostered brood after controlling for differences in colony productivity.After controlling for colony differences in the total number of individuals produced, the main effect of worker species became non-significant, suggesting that there was a tradeoff between the different worker species for the size and number of individuals reared. The main effect of brood species and the worker-by-brood interaction remained significant, and the overall pattern for residual worker mass is very similar to the pattern for mass shown in Figure 1. Means and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Filled symbols denote conspecific worker-brood combinations and open symbols denote heterospecific worker-brood combinations. Lines connect worker-brood combinations with the same brood species and the crossing of lines indicates the brood-by-worker interaction.
