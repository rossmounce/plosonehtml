This situation changed dramatically with appearance 272±25My of a mutant serine tRNA that acquired a 5′-CAG-3′anticodon (tRNA<sub>CAG</sub><sup>Ser</sup>). The latter competed with the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> for decoding of CUG codons, inserting both leucine and serine, at high level, at CUG positions, on a proteome wide scale. Such ambiguity decreased over time due to disappearance of the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> gene, however charging of the tRNA<sub>CAG</sub><sup>Ser</sup> with leucine and serine prevented complete change of identity of the CUG codon from leucine to serine. In order to elucidate why CUG ambiguity was preserved in <em>C. albicans</em> and clarify whether CUG identity could be partially reverted from serine back to leucine, we have reconstructed the early stages of CUG identity change (high level of ambiguity) in <em>C. albicans</em> using <em>S. cerevisiae</em> tRNAs that decode CUG codons as leucine.</p>
