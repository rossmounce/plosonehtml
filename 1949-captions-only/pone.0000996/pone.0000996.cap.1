                Figure 1.  Reconstruction model for the Candida genetic code alteration.The ancestor of Candida decoded the CUG codon as leucine using a single leucine tRNA (tRNALeu). This situation changed dramatically with appearance 272±25My of a mutant serine tRNA that acquired a 5′-CAG-3′anticodon (tRNACAGSer). The latter competed with the tRNALeu for decoding of CUG codons, inserting both leucine and serine, at high level, at CUG positions, on a proteome wide scale. Such ambiguity decreased over time due to disappearance of the tRNALeu gene, however charging of the tRNACAGSer with leucine and serine prevented complete change of identity of the CUG codon from leucine to serine. In order to elucidate why CUG ambiguity was preserved in C. albicans and clarify whether CUG identity could be partially reverted from serine back to leucine, we have reconstructed the early stages of CUG identity change (high level of ambiguity) in C. albicans using S. cerevisiae tRNAs that decode CUG codons as leucine.
