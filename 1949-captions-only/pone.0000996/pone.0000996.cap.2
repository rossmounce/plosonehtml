                Figure 2.  Transfer RNAs used in this study.In order to reconstruct the early stages of the CUG identity alteration in C. albicans, S. cerevisiae leucine tRNAs containing the anticodons UAG or CAG were expressed in C. albicans. A) The respective tRNA genes were cloned into plasmid pUA12, which is based on the C. albicans pRM1 vector. B) A leucine tRNA gene containing the near-cognate anticodon (5′-UAG-3′) for the CUG codon was used as a low decoding efficiency tRNA (pUA13). C) Two tRNACAGLeu genes, containing anticodons cognate for the CUG codon were used for higher CUG decoding efficiency, one contained G33 (pUA14; medium decoding efficiency) and the other contained U33 (pUA15; high decoding efficiency), in the anticodon-loop. D) The S. cerevisiae tRNAAGASer gene was used as negative control (pUA16).
