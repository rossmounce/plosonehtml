A) The respective tRNA genes were cloned into plasmid pUA12, which is based on the <em>C. albicans</em> pRM1 vector. B) A leucine tRNA gene containing the near-cognate anticodon (5′-UAG-3′) for the CUG codon was used as a low decoding efficiency tRNA (pUA13). C) Two tRNA<sub>CAG</sub><sup>Leu</sup> genes, containing anticodons cognate for the CUG codon were used for higher CUG decoding efficiency, one contained G<sub>33</sub> (pUA14; medium decoding efficiency) and the other contained U<sub>33</sub> (pUA15; high decoding efficiency), in the anticodon-loop. D) The <em>S. cerevisiae</em> tRNA<sub>AGA</sub><sup>Ser</sup> gene was used as negative control (pUA16).</p>
