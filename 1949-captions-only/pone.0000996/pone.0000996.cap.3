For this, total tRNAs were extracted under acidic conditions from pUA13, pUA14, pUA15, and pUA16 clones and fractionated on an acidic polyacrylamide gel, as described in <a href="#s4">materials and methods</a>. These gels separated deacylated (-AA) from aminoacylated tRNAs (+AA), which were detected using a tDNA<sub>Leu/Ser</sub> probe labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]. B) Transformation efficiencies of plasmids encoding tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>, which decoded the <em>C. albicans</em> serine CUG codons as leucine, was significantly lower that that of control plasmids (pUA12 and pUA16), indicating that the leucine tRNAs were slightly toxic. C) However, clones that survived the transformation procedure adapted readily to CUG ambiguity and showed growth rates similar to control clones (pUA12).</p>
