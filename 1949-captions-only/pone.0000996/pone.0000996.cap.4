B) Ambiguous pUA15 clones formed long hyphae, even in absence of external inducers, just growing in MM-uri agar plates at 30°C. Similar results were obtained for pUA13 and pUA14 ambiguous clones (data not shown). D). Expression of <em>S. cerevisiae</em> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> in <em>C. albicans</em> also induced phenotypic switching, which is characterized by transition between different cell-phase forms, namely white-opaque and myceliated-unmyceliated, giving rise to sectored colonies. D) Phenotypic switching was quantified by counting sectored colonies grown in MM-uri, after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. For each plasmid, up to 10 clones were plated and 3000 colonies were screened.</p>
