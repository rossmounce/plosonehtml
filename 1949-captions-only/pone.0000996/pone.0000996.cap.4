                Figure 4.  Ambiguous CUG decoding triggered morphogenesis and phenotypic switching.A) Smooth colony morphology of control clones growing on MM-uri-phloxin B (50µg/ml) agar plates. B) Ambiguous pUA15 clones formed long hyphae, even in absence of external inducers, just growing in MM-uri agar plates at 30°C. Similar results were obtained for pUA13 and pUA14 ambiguous clones (data not shown). D). Expression of S. cerevisiae tRNALeu in C. albicans also induced phenotypic switching, which is characterized by transition between different cell-phase forms, namely white-opaque and myceliated-unmyceliated, giving rise to sectored colonies. D) Phenotypic switching was quantified by counting sectored colonies grown in MM-uri, after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. For each plasmid, up to 10 clones were plated and 3000 colonies were screened.
