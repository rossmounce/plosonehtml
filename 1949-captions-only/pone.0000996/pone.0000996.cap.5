                Figure 5.  Increased CUG ambiguity resulted in higher hydrolytic activity and increased adhesion.A) Highly ambiguous cells (pUA15) exhibited strong adhesion phenotypes both in solid and liquid media. Adhesion to the solid agar surface resulted from cell-cell and cell-agar adhesion. In liquid media, cells showed a strong flocculation phenotype and sedimented even when grown with agitation (30°C for 2 days). B–C) Cells transformed with pUA13-14 (data not shown) and with pUA15 plasmids, had higher SAP and phospholipase activity than control cells, as determined by hydrolysis of BSA and egg yolk, respectively. Hydrolytic activity was quantified by measuring precipitation zones formed around the colonies, corrected by the colony diameter, in order to obtain Pz values.
