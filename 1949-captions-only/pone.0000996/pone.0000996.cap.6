Since <em>WOR1</em> increases the frequency of the white-opaque transition the very high percentage of opaque cells found in transformed clones may be a consequence of <em>WOR1</em> up-regulation. On the other hand, expression of the hypha-specific genes, <em>CaHWP1</em> and <em>CaHGC1,</em> supported the hypothesis that morphogenesis and hyphal growth triggered by CUG ambiguity resulted from expression of morphogenesis regulators. Induction of the <em>CaHWP1</em> gene was accompanied by repression of the <em>CaMCM1</em> (−1.84±0.44) gene, which controls cell morphology through the recruitment of other morphogenesis regulatory factors.</p>
