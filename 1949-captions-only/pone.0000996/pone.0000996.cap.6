                Figure 6.  Increased CUG ambiguity up-regulated morphogenesis genes.Cells of pUA15 clones showed significant up-regulation of the WOR1 (7.0±2.5) gene and hyphal-specific genes CaHWP1 (41.76±9.96) and HGC1 (2.64±1.12). Since WOR1 increases the frequency of the white-opaque transition the very high percentage of opaque cells found in transformed clones may be a consequence of WOR1 up-regulation. On the other hand, expression of the hypha-specific genes, CaHWP1 and CaHGC1, supported the hypothesis that morphogenesis and hyphal growth triggered by CUG ambiguity resulted from expression of morphogenesis regulators. Induction of the CaHWP1 gene was accompanied by repression of the CaMCM1 (−1.84±0.44) gene, which controls cell morphology through the recruitment of other morphogenesis regulatory factors.
