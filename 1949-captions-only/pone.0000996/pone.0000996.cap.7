This phenotype is most likely explained by up-regulation of the white-opaque master regulator <em>WOR1</em> gene (<a href="#pone-0000996-g006">Figure 6</a>). Since <em>C. albicans</em> white cells (most common form) are mating incompetent and opaque cells (rare cells) are mating competent, we have verified whether pUA15 opaque cells formed conjugation tubes and mating figures in liquid culture. Both were readily observed using optical microscopy (white arrows). B) In order to confirm that mating occurred, the DNA content of pUA15 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Since <em>C. albicans</em> is diploid, 4N cells were expected. Surprisingly, higher ploidies (6N, 8N) were also observed suggesting that the cultures had significant number of aneuploid and poliploid cells. C) White to opaque transition and mating induced by CUG ambiguity occurs due to MTL homozygosity. Since mating requires transition from the heterozygotic mating locus (MTL a/α) found in white cells, to the homozygotic configuration (MTLa/a or MTLα/α) found in opaque cells, detection of αα/αα cells supported the hypothesis that CUG ambiguity induced mating.</p>
