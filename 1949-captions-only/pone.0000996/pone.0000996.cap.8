                Figure 8.  Ambiguous CUG decoding induced karyotype rearrangements and ploidy-shift.A) In ambiguous cell lines (pUA15) polyploidy was predominant and very high ploidy was often detected (&gt;32N). Aneuploidy was also observed (6N). B) However, after plating cells several consecutive times on fresh agar chromosome numbers were reduced indicating that most cells returned to low ploidy (2N or 4N). Ploidy reduction after mating normally occurs by chromosome loss in C. albicans and it is likely that such mechanism also played a role in ploidy reduction in pUA15 transformed cells. C) CUG ambiguity also promoted extensive rearrangements of the R-chromosome (highlighted in white circles). Chromosomes were separated by PFGE on 0.6% agarose gels under the following conditions: 120–300 s for 24h at 80 V, then 420–900 s for 48 h at 80 V. The numbers 1–7 and R identify C. albicans chromosomes.
