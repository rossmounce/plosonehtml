                Figure 1.  Transcription of the Siglecg locus as determined by the expression of GFP which was used to replace the coding sequence of Siglecg.Red, WT; green heterozygous; blue, homozygous. A. Low levels of GFP expression among the hematopoeitic cells. The left panel shows the profiles of Lin−Flt2−Sca-1+C-Kit+ hematopoeitic stem cells (HSC), while the right panel depicts the GFP intensity of the gated HSC. B. Expression of the Siglecg locus in the pre-Pro/Pro B cells. As in A, except that the IgM−CD43+B220lo cells were depicted. C. Transcription of the Siglecg locus among splenic B cells (B220+), myeloid cells (CD11b+), dendritic cells (CD11c+) and T cells (CD3+). The top panel shows summary data, while the lower panels show representative FACS profiles. D. The Siglecg locus is actively transcribed at all stage/lineages of B cells, as in C. Data shown in this Figure represents 2 mice per group, and has been repeated twice.
