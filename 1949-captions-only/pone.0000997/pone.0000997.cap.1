A. Low levels of GFP expression among the hematopoeitic cells. The left panel shows the profiles of Lin<sup>−</sup>Flt2<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>C-Kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoeitic stem cells (HSC), while the right panel depicts the GFP intensity of the gated HSC. B. Expression of the <em>Siglecg</em> locus in the pre-Pro/Pro B cells. As in A, except that the IgM<sup>−</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>lo</sup> cells were depicted. C. Transcription of the <em>Siglecg</em> locus among splenic B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>), myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup>), dendritic cells (CD11c<sup>+</sup>) and T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>). The top panel shows summary data, while the lower panels show representative FACS profiles. D. The <em>Siglecg</em> locus is actively transcribed at all stage/lineages of B cells, as in C. Data shown in this Figure represents 2 mice per group, and has been repeated twice.</p>
