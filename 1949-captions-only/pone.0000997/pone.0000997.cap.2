                Figure 2.  Selective expansion of peritoneal cavity B1a cells in mice with targeted mutation of the Siglecg gene.A. Expansion of B1a, but not B1b subsets. The top panel shows the profile of B cells among peritoneal lavages of 10 weeks old mutant and age-matched WT controls, while the lower panel shows summary data involving 10 mice per group. This experiment has been repeated 5 times involving a total of 10–12 mice per group. C. Serum concentration of different isotypes of Ig, note substantial increase of IgM and decrease of IgG1 in the mutant mice. Data shown in the lower panels are Means+SEM, with 20 mice per group. D. Adaptive B cell response in WT and the Siglecg-deficient mice. The WT and Siglecg-deficient mice were immunized with 200 µg of OVA in complete Freunds' adjuvants (CFA) on day 0, boosted with the same amounts of OVA on day 7. Sera were collected on day 1, 7 and 14 for measurement of anti-OVA antibodies by ELISA using the OVA-coated plate. Data shown are means+SEM of optical density, n = 6. Sera were used at 1:500 dilutions for the ELISA.
