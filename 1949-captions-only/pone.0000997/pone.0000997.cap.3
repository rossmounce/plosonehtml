Progenitor cells from fetal liver. B. Progenitor cells from new born liver cells. C. Percentage of B1 (CD19<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>lo</sup>) and B2 (CD19<sup>âˆ’</sup>B220<sup>hi</sup>). Data shown in A involve 2 WT and 2 mutant mice per group. Data shown in B involve 3 WT and 4 mutant mice per group. Similar levels were found in 12 heterozygous littermates. C. As in A, except 10 week old bone marrow were analyzed. N = 7.</p>
