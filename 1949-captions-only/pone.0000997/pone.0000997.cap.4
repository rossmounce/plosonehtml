The bone marrow and peritoneal lavages were analyzed by flow cytometry for reconstitution by WT and mutant bone marrow cells. A. Summary data showing the contribution of WT (open bars) and mutant bone marrow cells (filled bars). The cell subsets in bone marrow include total B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>), Pre-pro/Pro B (CD43<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>lo</sup>sIgM<sup>−</sup>) and pre/new B (CD43<sup>−</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>low-high</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup>). The lower panel summarizes the total B cells and B1a B cells in the peritoneal lavages. Data shown are mean+SEM, N = 5. B. Representative profiles depicting the relative contribution of WT (CD45.1) and <em>Siglecg</em>-deficient (CD45.2) cells to the B1a compartment. C. Representative profiles depicting distinct profile of WT and Siglecg-deficient B1a cells.</p>
