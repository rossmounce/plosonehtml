                Figure 5.  Siglec−/− peritoneal cavity lavage cells have increased NFκB activity.A. Western blot analysis of cytosolic total and phorsphorylated IkBa (upper panels) and nuclear P65, using the amounts of SP1 as loading control (lower panels). B. EMSA analysis of nuclear NFκB activity. Nuclear lysates from WT (+/+) or knockout peritoneal lavages were prepared and tested for retardation of 32P NFkB probe. The specificity of the gel retardation was confirmed by super-shift with anti-P50 or P65 antibodies. C. Luciferase activity of peritoneal cells from WT and knockout mice. Data shown in this figure have been repeated twice.
