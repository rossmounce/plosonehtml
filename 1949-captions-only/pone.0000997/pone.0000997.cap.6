                Figure 6.  IKK inhibitor treatment decreased B-1a cells in peritoneal cavity but not spleen.(A). Efficacy of the treatment in reducing IKK activity among total spleen cells as revealed by IκBα phosphorylation in the cytosol (upper panel) P65 accumulation in the nuclei (lower panel) of spleen cells from treated or control mice. B. The impact of inhibiting the IKK on peritoneal B1a subsets. Data shown are means+SEM involving 5–6 mice per group.
