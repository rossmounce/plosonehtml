TEM micrographs. The core, skin and glyco layers are indicated. The inset shows the presence of a lipid layer detached from the rest of the fibre. Bar corresponds to 100 nm. Panel B. AFM micrographs. The arrows indicate some of the cavities. The core, skin, glyco layers and an artificial halo are indicated. Lack of symmetry in the latter indicates that the halo is caused by the sectioning procedure and reflects material compressed and displaced by the knife as it approaches the hard skin layer. The bar corresponds to 500 nm. The height colour coding bar extends bottom to top from 0 to 100 nm. Panel C. Attachment strength of silk layers. Untreated fibres were successively ether extracted, vigorously washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 detergent solution and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. After treatment cross-sections of fibres for each step were analyzed by TEM. The loss of layers from outside to inside is evident. The efficiencies for removal lipids, glycoproteins and the skin were 100%, 70% and 30%, respectively. The bar corresponds to 200 nm.</p>
