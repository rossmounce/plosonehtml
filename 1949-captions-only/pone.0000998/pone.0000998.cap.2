Oil red staining of fibres. Silk fibres were treated with water (upper filament) or ether extracted (lower filament) followed by oil red staining. Bar corresponds to 2000 nm. Panel B. Concavalin A (Con A) staining of fibres. Fibres gently washed in phosphate buffered saline or vigorously washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 were reacted with biotinylated Con A. The presence of α-methyl mannoside (α-MM), an inhibitor of Con A, is indicated by “I”. Bound Con A was visualised by gold conjugated streptavidin and SEM. The bar equals 500 nm.</p>
