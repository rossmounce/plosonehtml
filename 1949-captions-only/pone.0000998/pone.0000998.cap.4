                Figure 4.  Localization of components.Panel A. Fluorescence labelling of silk fibres. Reactivities of Concavalin A (ConA), pre-immune serum (PIS), S-pbs, S1Rx and S2Rx to lesions of vigorously washed silk filaments. Phase contrast (Ph), immunfluorescence (IF) and merged images are shown. The bar indicates 4000 nm. Panel B. Immunogold staining of silk fibre cross-sections. Shown are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of dragline cross sections reacted with Concavalin A (ConA) or the indicated antibodies. The bar equals 200 nm.
