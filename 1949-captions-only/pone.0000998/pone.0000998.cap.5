                Figure 5.  Treatment of fibres with chaotropic agents and acids.Panel A. Light Microscopy (LM) phase images of fibres treated with mixtures of different ratios between HAc and HCl. Bar corresponds to 4000 nm. Minor (mi, reinforcement) and major (ma, dragline) ampullate fibres are indicated. Panel B. Light Microscopy (LM) phase contrast images of dragline treated with LiSCN at the stated concentrations for 1 minute. Bar corresponds to 8000 nm. Panel C. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of dragline incubated for the indicated times with 99% Hfip. Bar corresponds to 1000 nm. Panel D. Video contrast images of draglines (left unstressed, right fractured by applying stress) soaked in 8 M urea and counterstained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bar equals 4000 nm.
