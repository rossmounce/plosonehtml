                Figure 7.  Solubilisation of polymerised spidroins.Dragline silk from N. clavipes was incubated with the indicated solvents and the soluble fraction was analysed by gel-electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining (A) and western blotting employing antibodies S1Rx and enhanced luminescence (ECL) for detection. The molecular weights of marker proteins are indicated in kilo Daltons (kDa).
