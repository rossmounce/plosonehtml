                Figure 2.  The ranking of journals across (sub-) disciplines.To improve clarity, journals with a very low number of publications between 1996 and 2005 in any of the three sub-disciplines were excluded. As in Figure 1, journals with black dots are classified as Multidsciplinary Sciences, journals with grey dots are classified under Evolutionary Biology, and journals classified under any other subject category are indicated with an open dot.
