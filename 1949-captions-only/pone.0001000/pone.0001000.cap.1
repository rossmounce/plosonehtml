Top illustrations are of intestine cross-sections and are not to scale. Distances between stages are also not to scale. In response to T3 the intestine changes from a simple structure with one luminal fold (stage 56) to one with multiple folds in the post-metamorphic froglet following stage 66. As intestine metamorphosis begins ECM remodeling in the connective tissue (C) results in cell death (open circles) and cell proliferation (closed circles) of overlying epithelial cells (E). Bottom illustrations represent tail lengths during metamorphosis. Tail regression due to cell death begins at stage 62/63 and is complete by stage 66. Solid line = cell death, dashed line = cell proliferation. C = connective tissue, E = epithelial, M = muscle</p>
