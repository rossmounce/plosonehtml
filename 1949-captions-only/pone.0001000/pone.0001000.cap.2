                Figure 2.  Patterns of MMP and TIMP RNA Levels Seen during X. laevis Intestine Metamorphosis Derived From RT-PCR Data.Levels of RNA found during intestine metamorphosis demonstrated that MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 shared similar RNA expression patterns, with peaks present at stages 58 and63. MT3-MMP and MMP-2 RNA expression patterns in the intestine did mirror each other, but were not similar to the three other genes. Changes in RNA levels are not quantitative, but instead illustrate patterns of expression.
