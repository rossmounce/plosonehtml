MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 transcription patterns mimic each other at all stages and conditions. In the intestine, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 transcripts are poorly detected at stage 56 prior to metamorphosis. Levels of both increase during stages 58, 61 and 63 and then drop to pre-metamorphic levels at stage 65. Conversely, in the tail, transcripts are detectable at stage 56, rise to stage 61, and then begin to drop at stage 63. T3 treatment induces a drop in levels after one day, but an increase after three days for both genes. EF1Î± RNA levels are shown for all comparable stages and treatments.</p>
