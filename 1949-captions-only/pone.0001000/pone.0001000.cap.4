                Figure 4.  Patterns of MMP and TIMP RNA Levels Seen During X. laevis Tail Metamorphosis Derived From RT-PCR Data.Levels of RNA found during tail metamorphosis demonstrated that MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and MMP-2 shared similar RNA expression patterns, peaking at stage 61 and staying elevated at stage 63. MT3-MMP and TIMP-3 expression patterns in the tail were not similar to the three other genes, nor to each other. Changes in RNA levels are not quantitative, but instead illustrate patterns of expression.
