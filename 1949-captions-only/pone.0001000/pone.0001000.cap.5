MMP-2 and MT3-MMP also shared similar RNA expression patterns, elevating after 1 day in both the intestine and tail. TIMP-3 expression patterns were not similar between the intestine and tail, nor were they similar to the four other genes. Changes in RNA levels are not quantitative, but instead illustrate patterns of expression.</p>
