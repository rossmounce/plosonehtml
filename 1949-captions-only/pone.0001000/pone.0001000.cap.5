                Figure 5.  Patterns of MMP and TIMP RNA Levels Seen During T3 Induced Metamorphosis in X. laevis Intestine and Tail as Derived From RT-PCR Data.Levels of RNA found during induced metamorphosis of the intestine and tail demonstrated that MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 shared similar RNA expression patterns, dipping after 1 day and elevating thereafter. MMP-2 and MT3-MMP also shared similar RNA expression patterns, elevating after 1 day in both the intestine and tail. TIMP-3 expression patterns were not similar between the intestine and tail, nor were they similar to the four other genes. Changes in RNA levels are not quantitative, but instead illustrate patterns of expression.
