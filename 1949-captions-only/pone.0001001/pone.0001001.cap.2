I-squared reflects the variation in summary OR attributable to heterogeneity among studies. ** Weighted linear regression method is used to test the linear trend of ORs by the study year (p&lt;0.05 indicates a significant trend). Each risk factor is listed by order of the study year. The size of the square is proportional to the weight of the respective OR. Different scales are used for HSV-2 studies</p>
