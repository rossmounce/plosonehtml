Data are from primates only and is the mean of all pairwise comparisons involving humans. The window size was 100 bp, the step size 20 bp; varying these parameters has some effect on the output, but all combinations of window and step size consistently indicated a K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S</sub> trough in the N-terminal Ca+ binding domain (bp 0 to 270) and prominent peaks in the C-terminal domain (bp 271 onwards) around bp 500, 900, and 1100. The location of two repeats common to all primates are indicated as R1 and R2/R4 (see <a href="#pone-0001003-g002">figure 2</a>).</p>
