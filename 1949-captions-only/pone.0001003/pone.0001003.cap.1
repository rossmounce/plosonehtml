                Figure 1.  KA/KS (solid line, left y-axis) varies greatly along the length of the SEP53 coding region based on a sliding window analysis.KS (dotted line, right y-axis) is also shown. Data are from primates only and is the mean of all pairwise comparisons involving humans. The window size was 100 bp, the step size 20 bp; varying these parameters has some effect on the output, but all combinations of window and step size consistently indicated a KA/KS trough in the N-terminal Ca+ binding domain (bp 0 to 270) and prominent peaks in the C-terminal domain (bp 271 onwards) around bp 500, 900, and 1100. The location of two repeats common to all primates are indicated as R1 and R2/R4 (see figure 2).
