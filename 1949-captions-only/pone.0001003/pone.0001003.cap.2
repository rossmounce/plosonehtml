                Figure 2.  The SEP53 gene contains repeat regions, the chimpanzee has four of these and the other primates only two.A neighbour joining tree indicated that copy 4 in the chimpanzee was orthologous with copy 2 in the other species. Chimpanzee copy 1 is probably orthologous with copy 1 in the other species, but this was less clear.
