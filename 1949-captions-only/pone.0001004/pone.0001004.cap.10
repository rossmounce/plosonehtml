Inhibition of FGF signals with XFD enhances <em>TSK</em> expression, whereas activation of FGF signals with V-ras or caFGFR reduces <em>TSK</em> expression levels. (B) Model of TSK function in <em>Xenopus</em> germ layer formation and patterning: dorsal-ventral mesoderm patterning. X-TSK in dorsal mesoderm (red) inhibits BMP signaling to promote dorsal mesoderm formation, as marked by <em>Gsc</em> expression. This is possibly also enhanced through activation of Xnr2 signals by TSK. MAPK activation inhibits <em>X-TSK</em> expression in ventrolateral mesoderm, where X-TSK inhibits expression of ventrolateral mesoderm markers such as <em>Xbra</em>, through inhibition of FGF signaling. This network of signaling may contribute to clear patterning of the mesoderm. (C) Model of TSK function in endoderm formation. X-TSK coordinates inhibition of FGF and BMP signals with activation of Xnr2 signaling to induce endoderm formation (green), as marked by <em>Sox17Î±.</em> Again, X-TSK inhibits expression of ventrolateral mesoderm (blue) markers such as <em>Xbra</em>, through inhibition of FGF signaling and may contribute to the distinction between endoderm and mesoderm specific gene expression.</p>
