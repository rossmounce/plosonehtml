                Figure 2.  X-TSK expression in Xenopus.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of X-TSK in Xenopus gastrula stage embryos, including sense control. Purple staining indicates X-TSK expression. Orientations and stages as indicated. X-TSK is expressed in dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) and ectoderm from stage 10, and endoderm from stage 10.5. (B) In situ hybridization of X-TSK in sectioned Xenopus embryos, including sense control. Orientation: animal top, vegetal bottom, dorsal right, stages as indicated. X-TSK is expressed maternally (stage 7) in the animal region, with light staining in the vegetal region. From stage 10.5, X-TSK expression is detected throughout the endoderm. (C) Expression levels of X-TSK (upper panel) measured by RT-PCR from egg to stage 41, including ODC expression (middle panel) and -RT control (lower panel). WOC = Water Only Control. X-TSK is expressed at highest levels during germ layer formation and gastrulation. (D) Comparative expression of Sox17Î± (marking endoderm), Gsc (dorsal mesoderm), and Xbra (pan-mesoderm) in sectioned stage 10 embryos. (E) Schematic of X-TSK expression (grey) in ectoderm, dorsal mesoderm and endoderm.
