Purple staining indicates <em>X-TSK</em> expression. Orientations and stages as indicated. <em>X-TSK</em> is expressed in dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) and ectoderm from stage 10, and endoderm from stage 10.5. (B) In situ hybridization of <em>X-TSK</em> in sectioned <em>Xenopus</em> embryos, including sense control. Orientation: animal top, vegetal bottom, dorsal right, stages as indicated. <em>X-TSK</em> is expressed maternally (stage 7) in the animal region, with light staining in the vegetal region. From stage 10.5, <em>X-TSK</em> expression is detected throughout the endoderm. (C) Expression levels of <em>X-TSK</em> (upper panel) measured by RT-PCR from egg to stage 41, including <em>ODC</em> expression (middle panel) and -RT control (lower panel). WOC = Water Only Control. <em>X-TSK</em> is expressed at highest levels during germ layer formation and gastrulation. (D) Comparative expression of <em>Sox17Î±</em> (marking endoderm), <em>Gsc</em> (dorsal mesoderm), and <em>Xbra</em> (pan-mesoderm) in sectioned stage 10 embryos. (E) Schematic of <em>X-TSK</em> expression (grey) in ectoderm, dorsal mesoderm and endoderm.</p>
