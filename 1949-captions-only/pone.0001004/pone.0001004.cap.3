                Figure 3.  Loss of X-TSK function.(A) In situ hybridization of endoderm markers, Sox17α (upper row), and GATA4 (lower row) in sectioned early gastrula (stage 10) embryos, purple staining indicates expression. Orientation: animal top, vegetal bottom. All embryos injected with 500 pg β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) to identify targeted area (blue staining), with 20 ng control morpholino (CMO) or 20 ng X-TSK morpholino (XMO). Endoderm marker staining is reduced in XMO injected embryos, as indicated by general loss of purple staining (Sox17α) and loss of punctate staining (GATA4), detailed in the zoomed panel. Rescues were performed with 1 ng H-TSK, or 50 pg Xnr2, restoring endoderm marker expression. Detailed analysis of GATA4 staining in sectioned embryos. Numbers of GATA4 foci were counted, as represented graphically, relative to uninjected control. XMO injection reduces GATA4 foci by 50% (p = &lt;0.001), partially rescued by 1 ng H-TSK and 50 pg Xnr2 to over 80% relative to control (p = &lt;0.001). (B) Whole mount in situ hybridization of dorsal mesoderm marker, Gsc in stage 10.5 embryos (dorsal orientation) and MyoD in stage 16 (anterior top, posterior bottom) in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal, with 20 ng CMO or 20 ng XMO. Gsc expression is reduced in XMO injected embryos, whereas MyoD expression is expanded by 30% (relative to control, p = &lt;0.001) on the injected side, as identified by blue β-Gal staining. (C) Gut morphology in stage 40 embryos injected with 20 ng CMO or 20 ng XMO. Gut width is reduced by 21% in XMO injected embryos, relative to uninjected embryos (p = &lt;0.001).
