Orientation: animal top, vegetal bottom. All embryos injected with 500 pg <em>β-Galactosidase (β-Gal)</em> to identify targeted area (blue staining), with 20 ng control morpholino (CMO) or 20 ng X-TSK morpholino (XMO). Endoderm marker staining is reduced in XMO injected embryos, as indicated by general loss of purple staining (<em>Sox17α</em>) and loss of punctate staining (<em>GATA4</em>), detailed in the zoomed panel. Rescues were performed with 1 ng <em>H-TSK</em>, or 50 pg <em>Xnr2</em>, restoring endoderm marker expression. Detailed analysis of <em>GATA4</em> staining in sectioned embryos. Numbers of <em>GATA4</em> foci were counted, as represented graphically, relative to uninjected control. XMO injection reduces <em>GATA4</em> foci by 50% (p = &lt;0.001), partially rescued by 1 ng <em>H-TSK</em> and 50 pg <em>Xnr2</em> to over 80% relative to control (p = &lt;0.001). (B) Whole mount in situ hybridization of dorsal mesoderm marker, <em>Gsc</em> in stage 10.5 embryos (dorsal orientation) and <em>MyoD</em> in stage 16 (anterior top, posterior bottom) in embryos injected with 500 pg <em>β-Gal,</em> with 20 ng CMO or 20 ng XMO. <em>Gsc</em> expression is reduced in XMO injected embryos, whereas <em>MyoD</em> expression is expanded by 30% (relative to control, p = &lt;0.001) on the injected side, as identified by blue <em>β-Gal</em> staining. (C) Gut morphology in stage 40 embryos injected with 20 ng CMO or 20 ng XMO. Gut width is reduced by 21% in XMO injected embryos, relative to uninjected embryos (p = &lt;0.001).</p>
