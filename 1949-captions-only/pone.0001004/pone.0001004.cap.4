                Figure 4.  Gain of X-TSK function.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of germ layer markers in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal and 1 ng X-TSK, with percentage occurrence of demonstrated phenotype and ‘n’ numbers indicated below images. Xbra (pan-mesoderm) expression is inhibited and Sox17α and GATA4 (endoderm) expression is expanded, stage 10.5, lateral orientation. Gsc (dorsal mesoderm) expression is expanded, stage 10.5, dorsal orientation. MyoD expression is inhibited on the injected side, as identified by blue β-Gal staining, stage 16, anterior top, posterior bottom. (B) Graphical representation of MyoD expression in (A). MyoD expression is reduced by 20% on the injected side (p = &lt;0.001).
