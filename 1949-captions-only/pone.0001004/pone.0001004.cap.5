                Figure 5.  Mechanism of X-TSK function: signal analysis.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of germ layer markers in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with 250 pg truncated BMP receptor (tBR) or 125 pg Chordin (Chd), with percentage occurance of demonstrated phenotype and ‘n’ numbers. Xbra and Sox17α phenotypes differ in comparison to X-TSK overexpression, whereas Gsc expression is commonly expanded. (B) Whole mount in situ hybridization of Gsc in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with 1 ng X-TSK, 500 pg caALK3 and X-TSK with caALK3, dorsal orientation. caALK3 blocks X-TSK mediated expansion of Gsc expression. (C) Western blotting of MAPK and Smad1 phosphorylation in animal caps and Smad2 phosphorylation in DMZ explants, with total MAPK, Smad2 and Smad1 controls in explants injected with X-TSK (125 pg-1 ng) (D) 125 pg Chd or 250 pg tBR. X-TSK inhibits MAPK and BMP phosphorylation in animal caps whilst activating Smad2 phosphorylation in DMZ. Chd and tBR similarly inhibit BMP phosphorylation, but contrast with X-TSK in MAPK and Smad2 phosphorylation status.
