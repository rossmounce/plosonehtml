(B) Whole mount in situ hybridization of <em>Gsc</em> in embryos injected with 500 pg <em>β-Gal</em> with 1 ng <em>X-TSK</em>, 500 pg <em>caALK3</em> and <em>X-TSK</em> with <em>caALK3</em>, dorsal orientation. caALK3 blocks X-TSK mediated expansion of <em>Gsc</em> expression. (C) Western blotting of MAPK and Smad1 phosphorylation in animal caps and Smad2 phosphorylation in DMZ explants, with total MAPK, Smad2 and Smad1 controls in explants injected with <em>X-TSK</em> (125 pg-1 ng) (D) 125 pg <em>Chd</em> or 250 pg <em>tBR</em>. X-TSK inhibits MAPK and BMP phosphorylation in animal caps whilst activating Smad2 phosphorylation in DMZ. Chd and tBR similarly inhibit BMP phosphorylation, but contrast with X-TSK in MAPK and Smad2 phosphorylation status.</p>
