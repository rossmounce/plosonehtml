Depletion of X-TSK with XMO activates MAPK phosphorylation. (B) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of <em>Xbra</em> expression in DMZ injected with 20 ng CMO, 20 ng XMO, 500 pg <em>XFD</em> and 500 pg <em>XFD</em> with 20 ng XMO. WE = Whole embryo, WOC = Water only control. Inhibition of FGF signals with XFD blocks <em>Xbra</em> expression activated upon depletion of X-TSK with XMO. (C) Whole mount in situ hybridization of <em>Xbra</em> in stage 10.5 embryos, lateral orientation. Embryos injected with 500 pg <em>β-Gal</em> with 1 ng <em>X-TSK</em>, 50 pg <em>V-ras</em> and <em>X-TSK</em> with <em>V-ras</em>. V-ras blocks X-TSK mediated inhibition of <em>Xbra</em> expression in 100% of embryos analyzed (p = &lt;0.01), represented graphically in (D). (E) Western blotting of MAPK phosphorylation in animal caps injected with <em>X-TSK</em> and <em>V-ras</em>. V-ras blocks X-TSK mediated inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation. (F) Western blotting of MAPK phosphorylation in animal caps injected with <em>X-TSK</em> and <em>iFGFR,</em> in the presence or absence of chemical dimerisation agent, AP20187. Induced dimerisation blocks the activity of X-TSK to inhibit MAPK phosphorylation. (G) Western blotting of MAPK phosphorylation in animal caps injected with <em>X-TSK</em> and <em>FGF8b</em>. X-TSK inhibits MAPK phosphorylation activated by FGF8b. (H) Western blotting of nickel bead pulldown of FGF8b-FLAG in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His. Top panel: detection of FGF8b-FLAG in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His (third lane). Second panel: detection of X-TSK-Myc-His pulled down. Third and bottom panels: detection of FGF8b-FLAG and X-TSK-Myc-His input into the pulldown reaction.</p>
