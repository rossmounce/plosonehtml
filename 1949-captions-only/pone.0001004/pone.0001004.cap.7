(B) Introduction of CerS blocks X-TSK expansion of <em>Sox17α</em> in 100% of embryos analyzed (p = &lt;0.001). (C) Western blotting of nickel bead pulldown of Xnr2-Myc in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His. Top panel: detection of Xnr2-Myc in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His (third lane). Second panel: detection of X-TSK-Myc-His pulled down. Third and bottom panels: detection of Xnr2-Myc and X-TSK-Myc-His input into the pulldown reaction. (D) Western blotting of Smad2 phosphorylation in animal caps injected with 1 ng <em>X-TSK</em>, 5 pg and 50 pg <em>Xnr2</em>. X-TSK enhances Smad2 phosphorylation, particularly evident with 5 pg Xnr2.</p>
