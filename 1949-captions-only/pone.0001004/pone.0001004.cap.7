                Figure 7.  X-TSK requires intact Xnr signaling for endoderm induction; X-TSK binds to and enhances Xnr2 Signaling.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of Sox17α in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with 1 ng X-TSK, 500 pg CerS and 500 pg CerS with 1 ng X-TSK, lateral orientation. (B) Introduction of CerS blocks X-TSK expansion of Sox17α in 100% of embryos analyzed (p = &lt;0.001). (C) Western blotting of nickel bead pulldown of Xnr2-Myc in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His. Top panel: detection of Xnr2-Myc in complex with X-TSK-Myc-His (third lane). Second panel: detection of X-TSK-Myc-His pulled down. Third and bottom panels: detection of Xnr2-Myc and X-TSK-Myc-His input into the pulldown reaction. (D) Western blotting of Smad2 phosphorylation in animal caps injected with 1 ng X-TSK, 5 pg and 50 pg Xnr2. X-TSK enhances Smad2 phosphorylation, particularly evident with 5 pg Xnr2.
