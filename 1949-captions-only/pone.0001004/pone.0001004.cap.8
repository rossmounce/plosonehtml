                Figure 8.  X-TSK changes local response to Xnr2.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of Xbra, Gsc (dorsal orientation) Sox17α and GATA4 in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with 50 pg Xnr2, and 50 pg Xnr2 with 1ng X-TSK and 500 pg X-TSK, lateral orientation. Xbra expression is not detected in Xnr2-X-TSK expressing cells, as identified by β-Gal staining. Xnr2 mediated expansion of Gsc expression is enhanced by X-TSK. Expression of endoderm markers Sox17α and GATA4 expanded by Xnr2 is enhanced by X-TSK, suggesting that X-TSK changes local cellular response to Xnr2.
