                Figure 9.  BMP and FGF signal activation blocks X-TSK mediated endoderm induction: triple signal regulation.(A) Whole mount in situ hybridization of Sox17α in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with 1 ng X-TSK, 500 pg caALK3, 50 pg V-ras and 500 pg caALK3, 50 pg V-ras with 1 ng X-TSK, lateral orientation. (B) Graphic representation of quantity of embryos demonstrating expanded Sox17α expression. Introduction of caALK3 and V-ras partially blocks X-TSK expansion of Sox17α (p = 0.01 and 0.05 respectively). (C) Whole mount in situ hybridization of GATA4 in embryos injected with 500 pg β-Gal with combinations of 1 ng XFD, 500 pg tBR, and 50 pg Xnr2, lateral orientation. Demonstrated phenotype frequencies with n-numbers in white text. A triple combination of 1 ng XFD, 500 pg tBR, and 50 pg Xnr2 produces the strongest expansion of GATA4 expression.
