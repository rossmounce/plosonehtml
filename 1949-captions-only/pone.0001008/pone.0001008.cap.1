                Figure 1.  Two main determinants of seed dispersal by Balearic lizards: the retention time of seeds in the lizard's gut (left axis) and lizard movement over time (right axis).Seed retention time shows the relative frequency of defecation of previously ingested seeds (curve derived from a cumulative log-normal fit). Maximum dispersal distance shows the distance between successive relocations of lizards by telemetry and the centre of the lizard's displacement kernel (exponential fit). Seed retention time peaks at the same time (48–72 hours) at which maximum dispersal distance of lizards saturates. For both variables, mean values (±s.e.) per day are also represented; however, note that the displayed curves were fitted across all measured values (not shown for clarity).
