For each plant, we calculated the combined recruitment kernel provided by the 10 studied lizards (see <a href="#pone-0001008-g002">Figure 2</a>) and subsequently fitted a one-dimensional curve to a sample of 5000 points randomly selected from the modelled recruitment kernel. For a complete list of regression results of 1D fits for the 38 study plants (including individuals 9, 13 and 2, shown here), see <a href="#pone.0001008.s011">Table S11</a>.</p>
