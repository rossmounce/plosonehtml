Coloured dots indicate the position and average probability of recruitment (per seed produced) of 38 reproductive adults present in the study area. The lower panels show the isotropic spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) of average plant recruitment. Since the data structure was strongly anisotropic, we also show anisotropic spatial autocorrelation at four directions from the centre of the recruitment kernel. Asterisks indicate distances at which Moran's I significantly departed from zero: * <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
