                Figure 1.  The macrophage mannose receptor recognizes P. pastoris-derived mannosylated antigens but not deglycosylated antigens.CHO-K1 and CHO-MMR cell lines were pulsed with OG-labeled antigens (each containing 2000 relative fluorescence units (RFU)) for 20 min in the absence or presence of YMs (1 mg/ml). Cells were harvested and analyzed for antigen binding on CHOK1 and CHO-MMR cells by flow cytometry. The CHO-MMR cells were gated on MMR+ cells by staining with PE-labeled antibodies to MMR. OG-labeled BSA served as a control for background uptake by endocytosis. Background staining of cells is indicated by the shaded histogram. Results are representative of 2 independent experiments.
