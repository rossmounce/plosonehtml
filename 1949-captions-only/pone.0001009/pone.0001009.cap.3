                Figure 3.  Recombinant OVA antigen uptake by DCs over time.Murine BMDCs were pulsed with OG-labeled antigens (each containing 2000 RFU) for 22.5, 45, or 90 min. Cells were washed, stained with CD11c-PE, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The MFI is represented by the geometric mean of the gated CD11c+ peak. Data represent the mean ± SEM of four independent experiments. Data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test (α = 0.05). A significant increase in cell-associated fluorescence for ppOVAST was observed when compared to ppOVAST dg at all time points.
