                Figure 5.  Effects of excess unlabeled recombinant OVA proteins on the uptake of fluorescent-labeled recombinant OVA proteins.Murine BMDCs were pulsed with OG-labeled antigens (each containing 2000 RFU) in the presence or absence of the same unlabeled antigen (1 mg/ml) for 45 min. Cells were washed, stained with CD11c-PE, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The plot labeled “Isotype control” represents cells treated with no antigen and stained with an isotype control antibody for CD11c-PE. Results are representative of 3 to 4 independent experiments.
