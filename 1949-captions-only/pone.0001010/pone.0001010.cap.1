The boxed area represents the protein coding region, including the C-terminal I-mfa domain. Full-length HIC cDNA is referred to as HIC(+). HIC(−) lacks all but the first 109 nt of the 2,821 nt HIC 3'UTR. (B) NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA3.1-FLAG-HIC vectors specified (2 µg), the HIV-1 LTR-firefly luciferase (100 ng) and CMV-Renilla luciferase (20 ng) reporter plasmids, pcDNA3.1-HA-Tat (5 ng) and pcDNA3.1-HA-cyclin T1 (T1; 100 ng) as indicated, and pcDNA3.1 empty vector to maintain a constant amount of DNA in each sample. Transactivation was measured at 24 hours post-transfection and expressed as fold Tat transactivation, calculated as the relative firefly:Renilla luciferase activity normalized to the value obtained without Tat, cyclin T1 or HIC. Data represent the average of three experiments with standard errors. (C) Expression of HIC protein. Extracts of cells (10 µg protein) transfected with Tat, cyclin T1 and the indicated HIC expression vectors were analyzed by western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. (D) Tat transactivation was measured in the presence of HIC cDNAs carrying or lacking the 3'UTR. Assays were conducted as in panel B. (E) Reduced amounts of HIC(−) vector were compared to 2 µg of HIC(+) and assayed as in panel B. Data represent the average of two experiments. Inset: HIC protein in cell extracts monitored as in panel C.</p>
