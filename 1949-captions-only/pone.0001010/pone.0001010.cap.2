Reduced amounts of HIC(−) vector were compared to 2 µg of HIC(+). Transactivation was measured at 24 hours post-transfection and expressed as fold Tat transactivation, calculated as the relative firefly:Renilla luciferase activity normalized to the value obtained without Tat and HIC. Data represent the average of two experiments. <em>Inset:</em> HIC protein in cell extracts monitored by western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. (B) HeLa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG-HIC vectors specified, HIV-1 LTR-firefly luciferase (100 ng), CMV-Renilla luciferase (20 ng) reporter plasmids, pcDNA3.1-HA-Tat (5 ng) and pcDNA3.1 empty vector to maintain a constant amount of DNA in each sample. Reduced amounts of HIC(−) vector were compared to 2 µg of HIC(+). Transactivation was measured at 24 hours post-transfection and expressed as fold Tat transactivation, calculated as the relative firefly:Renilla luciferase activity normalized to the value obtained without Tat and HIC.
