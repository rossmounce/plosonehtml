                Figure 3.  The HIC 3'UTR fragments are sufficient to increase gene expression.(A) NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-FLAG vectors indicated, together with other plasmids as in Fig. 1B. The pcDNA3.1-FLAG vectors expressed regions of the HIC protein and cDNA shown. Note that the HICΔ1(+) construct is identical to HIC(+) except for a point mutation that truncates the protein immediately before its I-mfa domain. Data represent the average of three experiments with standard errors and are presented as in Fig. 1B. (B) HIC protein expression was monitored as in Fig. 1C. (C) Deletions expressing the indicated regions of the 3'UTR were assayed as in panel A. Asterisks (*) indicate that the activities of the two shortest fragments were statistically different from the full-length 3'UTR (P = 0.0188 and 0.0181, respectively, in a Student's t-Test (two-tailed distribution, two-sample unequal variance)). (D) Total RNA was analyzed by relative quantitative RT-PCR using primers against the 3′ end of the HIC 3'UTR, and β-actin mRNA as an internal standard, producing fragments of 101 and 294 bp, respectively.
