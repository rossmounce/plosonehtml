The pcDNA3.1-FLAG vectors expressed regions of the HIC protein and cDNA shown. Note that the HICΔ1(+) construct is identical to HIC(+) except for a point mutation that truncates the protein immediately before its I-mfa domain. Data represent the average of three experiments with standard errors and are presented as in <a href="#pone-0001010-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. (B) HIC protein expression was monitored as in <a href="#pone-0001010-g001">Fig. 1C</a>. (C) Deletions expressing the indicated regions of the 3'UTR were assayed as in panel A. Asterisks (*) indicate that the activities of the two shortest fragments were statistically different from the full-length 3'UTR (P = 0.0188 and 0.0181, respectively, in a Student's t-Test (two-tailed distribution, two-sample unequal variance)). (D) Total RNA was analyzed by relative quantitative RT-PCR using primers against the 3′ end of the HIC 3'UTR, and β-actin mRNA as an internal standard, producing fragments of 101 and 294 bp, respectively.</p>
