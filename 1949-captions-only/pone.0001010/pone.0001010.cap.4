RNA was isolated from nuclear fractions 24 hours post-transfection, subjected to RNase protection assays <a href="#pone.0001010-Young1">[12]</a> and hybridized to probes for firefly luciferase RNA <em>(top),</em> or Renilla luciferase RNA to control for transfection efficiency <em>(bottom).</em> The control lacked cellular RNA but was digested with RNases A and T1. The probe lane contains 10% of the input probe RNA. Arrows indicate the position of protected luciferase probes. Bar graphs represent data averaged from two experiments calculated as relative firefly:Renilla RNA levels normalized to the sample with cyclin T1 but not Tat or HIC. Relative quantitative RT-PCR was performed as in <a href="#pone-0001010-g003">Fig. 3D</a> to examine HIC 3'UTR and β-actin mRNA levels. (B) HIC Activates Tat-mediated CAT expression. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmids HIV-1-CAT (100 ng) and CMV-Renilla luciferase (20 ng), and the plasmids pcDNA3.1-HA-Tat (5 ng), pcDNA3.1-HA-cyclin T1 (T1) (100 ng), 2 µg pcDNA3.1-HIC(+) expression vector, or pcDNA3.1 empty vector as indicated. Transactivation was measured at 24 hours post-transfection and expressed as fold Tat transactivation, calculated as the relative CAT:Renilla luciferase activity normalized to the value obtained without Tat, cyclin T1 and HIC. Data represent the average of three experiments with standard errors. (C) The PCNA promoter is only slightly responsive to HIC(+). NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with100 ng HIV-1 LTR-firefly luciferase (light bars) or PCNA-firefly luciferase (dark bars) and other vectors as in <a href="#pone-0001010-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. (D) Tat is dispensable in the tethering system. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with Gal4BD-HIV-1 LTR-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and Gal4BD-T1 expression vector (100 ng each), 20 ng CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 ng pcDNA3.1-HA-Tat expression vector, and 2 µg pcDNA3.1 vectors expressing FLAG-HIC(+), FLAG-HIC(−) or the HIC 3'UTR alone as indicated. Data represent the average of three experiments with standard errors, presented as fold activation by Gal4BD-T1 at 24 hours calculated as the relative firefly:Renilla luciferase activity normalized to the value obtained without Gal4BD-T1, HIC or Tat. The schematic diagrams the HIV-1 LTR-firefly luciferase construct furnished with five upstream Gal4 sites, and the Gal4BD-cyclin T1 fusion protein (Gal4BD-T1).</p>
