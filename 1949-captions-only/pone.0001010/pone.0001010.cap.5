                Figure 5.  The HIC 3'UTR releases 7SK RNA from P-TEFb complexes.(A) HEXIM1 antagonizes activation by the HIC 3'UTR. HeLa cells were co-transfected in the presence or absence of pFLAG-CMV2-HEXIM1 (2 µg). Other plasmids and experimental details were as in Fig. 1B. Data represent the average of five experiments with standard errors. (B) HIC 3'UTR is sufficient to release 7SK from P-TEFb. HeLa cells were transfected with 100 ng HIV-1 LTR firefly luciferase and 20 ng CMV Renilla luciferase, with or without 5 ng HIV-1 Tat and 2 µg pcDNA3.1 empty vector, HIC(+), HIC(−) or the 3'UTR alone as indicated. Cells were harvested 24 hours post-transfection and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity to verify activation by HIC(+) and the 3'UTR (data not shown). P-TEFb was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using antibody against CDK9. RNA was extracted from immunoprecipitates and subjected to RT-PCR using primers against 7SK RNA. The number of PCR cycles is specified for each experiment. (C) The 3'UTR of HIC specifically activates gene expression. HeLa cells were transfected as in panel A, and with 2 µg of vectors expressing the 3'UTR of cardiac actin (AC), tropomyosin (TM), or troponin (TP) as controls. Cells were harvested 24 hours post-transfection and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Data are represented as firefly/Renilla activity normalized to the sample without Tat. (D) Cell extracts were immunoblotted and probed with antibody to CDK9. (E) HIC 3'UTR specifically releases 7SK RNA from P-TEFb. Immunoprecipitated P-TEFb was assayed for 7SK RNA as in panel B. The number of PCR cycles is specified.
