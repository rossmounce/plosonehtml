                Figure 6.  The HIC 3'UTR binds to P-TEFb.(A) Endogenous HIC 3'UTR binds to P-TEFb and overexpression of the 3'UTR results in an increased amount of HIC 3'UTR RNA bound to P-TEFb. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 µg of empty vector or HIC 3'UTR. RNA from immunoprecipitated P-TEFb was assayed by RT-PCR using primers for the 3′ end of the HIC 3'UTR as in Fig. 3D. (B) Endogenous HIC 3'UTR binds P-TEFb. P-TEFb was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells using antibody against CDK9. Antibody against HA was used as a negative control (upper panel). Immunoprecipitates were examined for HIC RNA as in panel A. (C) Displacement of 7SK in vitro. HeLa cell nuclear extract [27] was incubated in the presence of the indicated amounts of in vitro transcribed HIC 3'UTR or cardiac actin (AC) 3'UTR. P-TEFb was immunoprecipitated using antibody against CDK9, RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates and subjected to RT-PCR using primers against 7SK RNA.
