                Figure 7.  Similarity in RNA structure between the 3′ terminal region of HIC mRNA and regions in 7SK RNA.The 314 nt 3′ terminal region of the HIC 3′ UTR (nt 3,839–4,152) was aligned with the human 331 nt 7SK sequence using Foldalign. Two regions of HIC with significant score are shaded in gray. Region 1 was predicted to be structurally similar to stem 4 of 7SK (boxed) and region 2 to an alternative form of 7SK stem 2.
