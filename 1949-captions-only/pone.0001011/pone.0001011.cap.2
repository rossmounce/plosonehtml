                Figure 2.  FLIM data of living cells expressing the mStrawberry-SYFP2 tandem.Experiments were performed either 1 day (a–d) or 2 days (e–h) after transfection. The panels show the fluorescence intensity of SYFP2 (a, e), the phase lifetime map of SYFP2 (b, f), the histogram of the lifetime distribution (c, g) and the 2D histogram of the lifetime distribution versus the fluorescence intensity (d, h). The false color representation of the lifetime map corresponds to the colors used in the lifetime histogram. The width of the images corresponds to 112 µm.
