                Figure 3.  FLIM data of cells expressing mKO or mOrange.The FLIM was done before (a–d) and after (e–h) exposing the cells to 436 nm light. The panels show the fluorescence intensity (a, e), the modulation lifetime map (b, f), the histogram of the modulation lifetime distribution (c, g) and the 2D histogram of the phase lifetime versus the modulation lifetime (d, h). The false color representation of the lifetime map corresponds to the colors used in the lifetime histogram. The width of the images corresponds to 85 µm.
