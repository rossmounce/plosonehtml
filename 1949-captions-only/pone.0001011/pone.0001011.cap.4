                Figure 4.  Homodimerization of p65 can be detected by FLIM.The lifetime data of multiple cells is summarized (a), by plotting the modulation lifetime against the phase lifetime for cells expressing ECFP-p65 (circles), ECFP-p65 and EYFP-p65 (squares), mKO-p65 only (diamonds) or cells expressing mKO-p65 and mCherry-p65 (triangles). FLIM images of cells expressing mKO-p65 in absence (b–d) or presence (e–g) of mCherry-p65. The panels show the fluorescence intensity of two merged representative nuclei (b, e), the modulation lifetime map (c, f) and the histogram of the modulation lifetime distribution (d, g). The reduced lifetime observed for cells expressing both mKO-p65 and p65-mCherry is due to FRET, indicating homodimerization of p65. The width of the images corresponds to 28 µm.
