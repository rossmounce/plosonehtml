                Figure 1.  Neighbor-joining trees of domestic goat based on 1540 mtDNA haplotypes (A) and on the 22 reference mtDNA haplotypes (B).Distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-Parameter model with gamma correction (alpha = 0.28). On the (A) tree, the numbers on the branches represent bootstrap values out of 1000 replications, and the stars point out the position of reference individuals for each haplogroup used to construct the (B) tree (see Table 5).
