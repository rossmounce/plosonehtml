Columns 0 and 1 depict negative and positive control, respectively (also applies to subsequent panels B to E). (b) Amplification of genomic DNA for detection of loxP flanked exon 4 of the frataxin gene. A double band depicts heterozygous genotype (column 1), one band at 545 bp only accordingly indicates homozygous loxP insertion (columns 2 to 9). (c) Control Cre-PCR from RNA without reverse transcription. (d) RT-PCR of Cre RNA expression. (e) RT-PCR directed at floxed exon 4 of the target gene. The shorter band stems from RNA with excised exon 4, the long band corresponds to the intact loxP flanked exon 4. (f) Immunodetection of Cre/loxP-targeted frataxin expression in the liver. (g) Ponceau staining of membrane before immunodetection to ensure equal loading of protein in all columns.</p>
