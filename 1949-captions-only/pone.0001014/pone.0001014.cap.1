Distribution of ataxin-1 and ataxin-1-GFP. Upper panel; untagged ataxin-1 stained with 1C2 with a DAPI merge; lower panel, GFP-ataxin-1 with DAPI merge. Figure 1B. DsRed1-E5-ataxin-1 emits both red (r) and green (g) fluorescence. The merged red green and red/DAPI fluorescence micrographs are also shown. An orthogonal slice through a reticular IB seeded by DsRed1-E5-ataxin is shown lower right. Scale bars: 8 microns. Figure 1C. IBs of DsRed1-E5-ataxin express protein of comparable age. Synchronous peaks and troughs of red/green fluorescence emitted by IBs of DsRed1-E5-ataxin in shared nuclei. IBs are ranked according to maturity; with high g/r ratios indicating immature protein. Figure 1D. Synchronous seeding of DsRed1-E5-ataxin IBs. HeLa nuclei were ranked according to mean g/r ratio of their IB populations (24hr after transfection). 169 IBs in 16 nuclei were included in this data set.</p>
