                Figure 1.  Effects of maternal CORT on maternal behavior.Daily frequency (mean/hour±SEM) of active maternal care shown by control, CORT-L and CORT-H dams (N = 8 dams per group); daily scores are based on 3 daily one-hour sampling sessions (10 observations/hour). Inset: total levels of active maternal care across days (mean frequency/hour±SEM). Scores from each of 3 daily one-hour sampling sessions were averaged across postnatal days 2 to 8.
