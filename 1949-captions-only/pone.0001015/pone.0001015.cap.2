Variability has been calculated as the MAD (mean absolute deviation from the group average per each group) and here is expressed as the percentage ratio, whereby control subjects contribute the reference value (real values are reported in <a href="#pone-0001015-g003">fig. 3</a>). Each data point represents the variation in the different tests: Loc 1, locomotion minutes 1–10; Loc 2, locomotion minutes 11–20; NS1-2-3-4, Novelty seeking time bins 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, respectively; Pain, paw-lick latency; C0, 25, 60, 120, corticosterone levels at time 0, 25, 60, 120; Immune Response, <em>Brucella</em> colony forming units (CFU). Significance levels are reported for the comparison L-CORT vs. control groups (N = 6-8 per group per test). Since main aim of the study was to demonstrate that moderate neonatal stress would result in adult subjects characterized by reduced inter-individual variation, significance values are reported only for the AFR controls vs. L-CORT comparison.
