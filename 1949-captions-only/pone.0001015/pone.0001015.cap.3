Each bar represents the variation in the different tests: Loc 1, locomotion minutes 1–10; Loc 2, locomotion minutes 11–20; NS1-2-3-4, Novelty seeking time bins 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, respectively; Pain, paw-lick latency; C0, 25, 60, 120, corticosterone levels at time 0, 25, 60, 120; Immune Response, <em>Brucella</em> colony forming units (CFU) (N = 6-8 per group per test).</p>
