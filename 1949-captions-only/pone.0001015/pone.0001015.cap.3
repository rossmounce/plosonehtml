                Figure 3.  Effects of maternal CORT on inter-individual variation (real values).Within-group variation calculated as the MAD (mean absolute deviation from the group average per each group) in general locomotion (a), novelty seeking (b), pain response (c), corticosterone levels (in basal condition and 25, 60, 120-min following the beginning of a 25-min restraint stress, d) and immune response (e) shown by AFR controls, L-CORT and H-CORT adult offspring. Each bar represents the variation in the different tests: Loc 1, locomotion minutes 1–10; Loc 2, locomotion minutes 11–20; NS1-2-3-4, Novelty seeking time bins 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, respectively; Pain, paw-lick latency; C0, 25, 60, 120, corticosterone levels at time 0, 25, 60, 120; Immune Response, Brucella colony forming units (CFU) (N = 6-8 per group per test).
