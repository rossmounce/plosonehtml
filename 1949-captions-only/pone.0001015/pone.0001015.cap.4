                Figure 4.  Effects of maternal CORT on frequency distribution.Frequency distribution of data from the novelty preference, hot plate, corticosterone response to restraint and immune response. Since these parameters showed a differential within-group variation, we performed an analysis to test whether reduced variation would also affect the data distribution. Data from all tests were standardized (see text), pooled and finally analyzed for normality distribution through Shapiro-Wilks test. Whereas data obtained in control subjects showed a significant deviation from normality, L-CORT and H-CORT subjects showed a normal distribution of data. Histograms represent the frequency distribution of data and the bell-shaped line represents the normal comparison.
