                Figure 1.  CXCR4 cell surface expression.IGR-NB8 and IGR-N91, two well characterized NB cell lines, and transduced cell lines/clones were analyzed for their cell surface CXCR4 expression by flow cytometry (FACS). Percent positive cells is indicated as well as the mean fluorescent intensity (brackets) of the CXCR4 staining. The NB cell line SH-SY5Y constitutively expressed high levels of CXCR4 as previously described [21]. The prostate cancer cell line PC3 showed comparable levels of CXCR4 expression upon transduction as NB8-CXCR4 and N91-CXCR4 clones.
