Percent positive cells is indicated as well as the mean fluorescent intensity (brackets) of the CXCR4 staining. The NB cell line SH-SY5Y constitutively expressed high levels of CXCR4 as previously described <a href="#pone.0001016-Geminder1">[21]</a>. The prostate cancer cell line PC3 showed comparable levels of CXCR4 expression upon transduction as NB8-CXCR4 and N91-CXCR4 clones.</p>
