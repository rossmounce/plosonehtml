                Figure 2.  In vivo orthotopic tumour growth and metastasis.Tumour growth measured in mice engrafted with NB8-E6 and NB8-CXCR4-C3 (a), and N91-E2 and N91-CXCR4-14 (c) The mean tumour volume Â± S.D. as measured by echo-doppler at indicated days after implantation is shown. The tumour take expressed as number of mice with tumour/total mice and percent mice with tumours is indicated. (b) and (d) Detection of metastases in mice engrafted with either NB8-E6/NB8-CXCR4-C3 or N91-E2/N91-CXCR4-14 cells. Macroscopic liver metastases were detected by gross examination. Micrometastases were detected in lung, bone marrow, muscle and blood by GFP-PCR. Bars represent percentages of mice with macroscopic liver metastases or GFP-PCR positive signals in indicated organs per tumour bearing animal.
