(statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction) A representative of three independent experiments is shown. (b) <em>In vitro</em> growth of NB8-E6 and NB8-CXCR4-C3 cells in the presence of 100 ng/ml CXCL12 (black squares) or in medium alone (open squares). (c) Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 in CXCR4-transduced cells.</p>
