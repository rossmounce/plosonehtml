                Figure 3.  Effect of functional CXCR4 overexpression in NB cell lines.(a) In vitro growth of NB8-E6, NB8-CXCR4-C3, -B2, and -E9 cells, in 10% (black squares) or 2% serum (open squares). (statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction) A representative of three independent experiments is shown. (b) In vitro growth of NB8-E6 and NB8-CXCR4-C3 cells in the presence of 100 ng/ml CXCL12 (black squares) or in medium alone (open squares). (c) Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 in CXCR4-transduced cells.
