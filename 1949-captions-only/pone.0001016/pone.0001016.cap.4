Results of a representative experiment are shown and are expressed as mean number of cells in one field. Five fields were counted for each result. The experiment was performed in triplicates and repeated three times. Error bars indicate S.D. (b) Invasion of SH-SY5Y, NB8 and N91 control and CXCR4 transduced clones through MatrigelÂ®-coated membranes in N2 supplemented serum-free medium alone, with or without CXCL12. CXCL12-mediated invading cells (invaded cell in the absence of CXCL12 have been subtracted) -in a typical field are shown. The mean number of invading cells in 5 fields is given. Error bars indicate S.D. (* indicates p&lt;0.05, Student's t-test)</p>
