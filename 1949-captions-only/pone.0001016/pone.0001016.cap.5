                Figure 5.  CXCL12 production in mouse tissues and NB tumours.The production of CXCL12 was measured by ELISA in normal mouse tissues, as well as in the different clones, and primary tumours. Results of triplicates are expressed as pg of CXCL12 per mg of extracted protein. One representative of three independent experiment is shown. Experiments were performed in triplicates.
