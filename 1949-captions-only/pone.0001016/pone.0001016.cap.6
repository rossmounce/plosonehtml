                Figure 6. (a) FACS profiles of shRNA-mediated cell surface CXCR4 silencing in N91-shRNA-CS1 and N91-shRNA-CS2 clones and N91-pAB303 control cells. Percent positive cells is indicated as well as the mean fluorescent intensity (brackets) of the CXCR4 staining. (b) In vitro growth capacities of N91-shRNA-CS1, N91-shRNA-CS2 clones and N91-pAB303 control cells. (c) In vivo growth capacities of IGR-N91 cells were CXCR4 has been knocked down by shRNA. Comparison of tumour volumes after 44 days when mice were sacrificed. * indicates p&lt;0.05 (Mann-Whitney test).
