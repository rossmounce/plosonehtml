                Figure 2.  Pronounced temporal variability of tree mortality and recruitment rates near Amazonian forest edges.This variability is measured by (A) standard deviations and (B) coefficients of variation of among-census variation for 1-ha plots. In (B), the solid regression line is for mortality (F1,64 = 5.68, R2 = 8.2%, P = 0.02) and the dashed line for recruitment (F1,64 = 27.30, R2 = 29.9%, P&lt;0.0001).
