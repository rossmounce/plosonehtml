(B) Mortality rates decline with fragment age, but only among plots near forest edges (<em>F<sub>1,31</sub></em> = 6.49, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 17.3%, <em>P</em> = 0.016), which have the highest overall mortality rates (there was no significant trend for forest-interior plots; <em>F<sub>1,31</sub></em> = 0.42, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 1.3%, <em>P</em> = 0.52; linear regressions).</p>
