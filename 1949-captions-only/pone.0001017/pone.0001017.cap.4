                Figure 4.  Temporal variability in tree mortality.(A) Tree mortality is highly episodic in Amazonian forest fragments, as shown by the strong relationship between the mean and CV of mortality rates, based on repeated censuses of 1-ha plots (F1,64 = 13.17, R2 = 17.1%, P = 0.0006). (B) Mortality rates decline with fragment age, but only among plots near forest edges (F1,31 = 6.49, R2 = 17.3%, P = 0.016), which have the highest overall mortality rates (there was no significant trend for forest-interior plots; F1,31 = 0.42, R2 = 1.3%, P = 0.52; linear regressions).
