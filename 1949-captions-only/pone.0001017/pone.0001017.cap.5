                Figure 5.  Increasing divergence of tree-community composition in three fragmented landscapes.Tree communities in forest-edge plots (&lt;100 m from the nearest edge) are shown before forest fragmentation and 13â€“18 years after fragmentation, based on a single ordination of all plots and censuses in the study area. The ordination used importance values for all 267 tree genera found in the plots.
