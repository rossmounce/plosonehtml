Geometric means of the ratios of geometric mean antibody endpoint titres (log scale) for samples taken three weeks after each immunization with reference to pre-vaccination titers in sera taken at the screening visit (week-1).a) anti-AMA49-C1 IgG titers (Group A = PEV301 10 µg; Group C = PEV301 50 µg; Group E = PEV301&amp;302 50 µg, Group F = IRIV) b) anti-UK-39 IgG titers (Group B = PEV302 10 µg; Group D = PEV302 50 µg; Group E = PEV301&amp;302 50 µg, Group F = IRIV)
