                Figure 10.  Body configuration change in mammalian axial anatomy.(A)-Monotonous laminapophysis in Monotremata (Tachyglossus aculeata) with no lumbar transverse process. (B)-Laminapophysis split into anteriorly directed metapophysis that slowly drifts medially to engage in sagittalization of the L4/S1 facet and posteriorly directed anapophysis. Large orthapophysial lumbar transverse processes from “third tubercle” of laminapophysial condyle on the arch (Tapirus bairdii, Perissodactyla). m–metapophysis, a–anapophysis, s–sagittalization.
