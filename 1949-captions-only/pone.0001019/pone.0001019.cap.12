                Figure 12.  Laminapophysial splitting sequence in non-hominiform and hominiform catarrhines.(A &amp; B)-The laminapophysis splits into anterior metapophysis (**) and posterior anapophysis (*). The anapophysis forms a posteriorly directed styloid process on the arch and does not participate in the emergence of the pre-pararthral positioned parapophysial LTP. Typical euarchontogliran style anatomy in Macaca (Primates) Harvard Peabody N/3587. (C)-The anapophysis (*) forms the lumbar transverse process rather than a styloid process in hominiforms (e.g. non-proconsulid apes and humans)-juvenile Pan troglodytes. NLM-neomorphic laminapophysis, LTP-lumbar transverse process.
