                Figure 14.  Multiple homologies for the therian lumbar transverse process (LTP).Diapophysial LTP: In metatherians with loss of the pre-pararthrum (red) and descent of the diarthrum (blue) onto the centrum (Figure 7C, 20), the LTP is often based on the diarthrum, occurs on the centrum, and incorporates a distal costal element as in Figure 8A. Parapophysial LTP: In most Euarchontoglires, the post-pararthrum (orange) and diarthrum (blue) are lost in the posterior thorax so that the LTP seriates with the pre-parapophysis and may incorporate a distal costal element as in Figure 7B. Orthapophysial LTP: In most ferungulates, the final rib has both a pre-pararthrum (red) and a post-pararthrum (orange) but no diarthrum (blue) as in Figure 11B. However the horizontal septum–which appears to be involved in inducing LTP formation–is dorsal to the neuraxis (see Figure 20) and the LTP is based on the middle portion of the condyle of the laminapophysis (green) (see Figure 6B). Note that the mamillary (metapophysis) and styloid (anapophysis) are still seen as in Figure 10B. The “third tubercle” of the condyle of the laminapophysis is the orthapophysis. Anapophysial LTP: In hominiforms, the LTP derives from the styloid portion of the laminapophysis (green) (see Figures 12C, 18B, 27A) and so carries the insertion of the longissimus muscle that occurs on the styloid on other euarchontoglirans. A similar LTP occurs in the Pholidota as in Figure 17A. Other versions of therian LTPs may involve various components from this basic set.
