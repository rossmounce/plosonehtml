However the horizontal septum–which appears to be involved in inducing LTP formation–is dorsal to the neuraxis (see <a href="#pone-0001019-g020">Figure 20</a>) and the LTP is based on the middle portion of the condyle of the laminapophysis (green) (see <a href="#pone-0001019-g006">Figure 6B</a>). Note that the mamillary (metapophysis) and styloid (anapophysis) are still seen as in <a href="#pone-0001019-g010">Figure 10B</a>. The “third tubercle” of the condyle of the laminapophysis is the orthapophysis. <em>Anapophysial LTP</em>: In hominiforms, the LTP derives from the styloid portion of the laminapophysis (green) (see <a href="#pone-0001019-g012">Figures 12C</a>, <a href="#pone-0001019-g018">18B</a>, <a href="#pone-0001019-g027">27A</a>) and so carries the insertion of the longissimus muscle that occurs on the styloid on other euarchontoglirans. A similar LTP occurs in the Pholidota as in <a href="#pone-0001019-g017">Figure 17A</a>. Other versions of therian LTPs may involve various components from this basic set.</p>
