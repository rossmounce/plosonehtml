                Figure 15.  Impact of septo-neural transposition on euarchontogliran LTP suspension system in hominiforms.(A)-A convergent architecture in which LTP tips projecting ventral to the intervertebral center of rotation in most Euarchontoglirans, Carnivora, and Metatherians act to resist lumbar hyperextension by engaging and stretching elastic intertransverse ligaments. Stylo-zygoid contacts in many species further limits hyperextension. (B)-The basal hominiform architecture has LTP tips dorsal to the center of rotation and no styloids so both osseo-ligamentous mechanisms to resist gravitational hyperextension in pronograde posture are absent (after Owen 1857[93]).
