                Figure 17.  Morphological and homological lumbar transverse process (LTP) classes.(A)-The pholidotan Manis temminckii (FMNH 35682) has a full septo-neural transposition as in other ferungulates, but differs from the Carnivora in having purely anapophysial LTPs in place of styloid processes and maintaining the LTP tips well dorsal to the neuraxis-a set of features similar to what is seen in hominiforms. Hyperextension is limited by singly or doubly recurved cylindrical zygapophysial joints as in artiodactyls. B-The rodent Lagostomus trichodactylus (FMNH 53704) has the type of ventrally directed slanted LTPs seen in various ferungulate and metatherian groups-the morphology is part of the convergent LTP suspension system class, but the homology is parapophysial.
