Hyperextension is limited by singly or doubly recurved cylindrical zygapophysial joints as in artiodactyls. B-The rodent <em>Lagostomus trichodactylus</em> (FMNH 53704) has the type of ventrally directed slanted LTPs seen in various ferungulate and metatherian groups-the morphology is part of the convergent LTP suspension system class, but the homology is parapophysial.</p>
