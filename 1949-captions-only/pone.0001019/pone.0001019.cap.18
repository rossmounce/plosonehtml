It is dorsal to the position of the spinal canal. It is thick and strong (triangular or box-like cross-section) instead of flat and thin. (B,C)-Styloid comparison. Lateral view of lumbar vertebrae of human, macaque monkey and <em>Proconsul africanus</em>. The human vertebra, like <em>Morotopithecus</em>, appears to demonstrate absence of the styloid process and relocation of the LTP onto the arch of the vertebra at the base of the structure that carries the facet joint. (D) The Middle Miocene proconsulid hominoid <em>Proconsul africanus</em> appears to have the more primitive LTP and styloid as seen in most euarchontoglirans.</p>
