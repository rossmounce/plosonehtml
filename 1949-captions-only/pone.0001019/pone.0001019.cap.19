(B)-The absence of a styloid process and the LTP attachment reaches above the pedicle and has the typical hominiform pattern retained in primitive form in modern humans. The pedicle is enlarged-as in humans. (C)-CT scan of modern human lumbar vertebra showing that the <em>Morotopithecus</em> LTP, pedicle, proportions and facet orientation are within the range of modern human architecture. These features suggest that <em>Morotopithecus</em> may have been the original hominiform upright biped as a consequence of a cluster of homeotic mutational events.</p>
