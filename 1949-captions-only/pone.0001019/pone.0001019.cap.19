                Figure 19.  Abrupt homeotic transformation of the stem hominiform species.(A)-The lumbar vertebra of Morotopithecus bishopi (Early Miocene hominiform hominoid) has a shape and location of the LTP (lumbar transverse process) near the facet joint on the arch of the vertebra. (B)-The absence of a styloid process and the LTP attachment reaches above the pedicle and has the typical hominiform pattern retained in primitive form in modern humans. The pedicle is enlarged-as in humans. (C)-CT scan of modern human lumbar vertebra showing that the Morotopithecus LTP, pedicle, proportions and facet orientation are within the range of modern human architecture. These features suggest that Morotopithecus may have been the original hominiform upright biped as a consequence of a cluster of homeotic mutational events.
