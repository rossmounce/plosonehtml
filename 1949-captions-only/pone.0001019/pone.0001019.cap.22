                Figure 22.  Laminar articular engagement with opisthocoely in the Perissodactyla.(A)-opisthocoelous vertebral centra-anteriorly directed ball shaped surface constrains motion so facets lock to prevent hyperextension. Supplementary facets may occur between spinous processes (Equus caballus). (B)-The partial ventral shift modifying an ancestral septo-neural transposition places the horizontal septum co-planar with the neuraxis so the intervertebral foramina are obliterated. The nerves exit through perforations in the pedicle. There are supplementary articulations between the successive expanded pedicles in Equus burchelli (FMNH 101855) and Tapirus bairdii (FMNH 34666). Note fusion of the pararthrum and diarthrum to form a synarthrum in Equus. p-pararthrum, d-diarthrum, i-intrapedicular foramen, a-anapophysis, syn-synarthrum. (C)-Opisthocoely and supplementary articulations at the base of the LTP and at the ventral margin of the vertebral body in Equus burchelli (FMNH 101855). (D)-Opisthocoely and biplanar pitching of the receiving facets in the rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum (FMNH 29174) as in other perissodactyls.
