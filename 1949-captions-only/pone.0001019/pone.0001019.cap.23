                Figure 23.  Laminar articular engagement in the Artiodactyla.(A, B)-Hippopotamus amphibius (FMNH 22367) demonstrating full septo-neural transposition (septum dorsal to neuraxis) and the double fluted articular system seen in many artiodactyls to block lumbar hyperextension. (C)-Single fluted locking cylinder articulation (as in pholidotans) and orthapophysial LTP [o] in Boocercus eurycerus (MCZ 27850) with preparthrum [p] (rib-bearing) on the same vertebra as is typical in the Artiodactyla. (D)-Double fluted articulation and separate pedicular perforations for the dorsal and ventral ramus of the exiting segmental spinal nerve in Sus scrofa (FMNH 92908).
