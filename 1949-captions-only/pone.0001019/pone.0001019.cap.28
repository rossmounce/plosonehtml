(B)-lumbar flexion in same individual. (C)-Superimposed images in flexion and extension showing that even with six lumbars, most extension takes place between L4 and the sacrum in humans. (D)-Short lumbar spine with heavy iliolumbar ligaments in <em>Pan</em> obliterating lumbar extension thereby accomplishing support for diagonograde postures. (E)-Comparison of lumbar vertebrae in <em>Gorilla</em>, <em>Pan</em>, and <em>Homo</em> (Owen 1857 <a href="#pone.0001019-Owen2">[93]</a>) showing the thin flat LTP's typical in <em>Pan</em> because of the primacy of ligament suspension under tension for LTP function rather than muscular force transmission as in other hominoids.</p>
