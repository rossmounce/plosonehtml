                Figure 28.  Lumbar extension in Homo and Pan.(A)-Lumbar extension in human with six lumbar vertebrae. (B)-lumbar flexion in same individual. (C)-Superimposed images in flexion and extension showing that even with six lumbars, most extension takes place between L4 and the sacrum in humans. (D)-Short lumbar spine with heavy iliolumbar ligaments in Pan obliterating lumbar extension thereby accomplishing support for diagonograde postures. (E)-Comparison of lumbar vertebrae in Gorilla, Pan, and Homo (Owen 1857 [93]) showing the thin flat LTP's typical in Pan because of the primacy of ligament suspension under tension for LTP function rather than muscular force transmission as in other hominoids.
