Same amount of total RNA is used for each slide (so the signal is actually normalized according to total RNA). The miRNA clustering tree is shown on the left and the sample clustering tree is shown on the top. The color scale shown at the bottom illustrates the relative expression level of the indicated miRNA across all samples: red denotes an expression above the mean, blue denotes an expression lower than the mean and grey represents signal lower than the background.</p>
