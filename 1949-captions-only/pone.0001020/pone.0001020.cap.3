The cloning frequency was normalized to the total hybridization signal in the miRNA microarray. B) Expression profile by microarray hybridization. Ratios of sample/reference hybridization signal is shown. C) Expression profile by real time PCR. Expression level was normalized to that of small non-coding RNA U6B. Mean of triplicate experimentsÂ±SD is shown. Similar results were also obtained in 2 additional independent experiments.</p>
