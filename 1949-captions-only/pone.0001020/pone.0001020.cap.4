A shows miRNAs whose relative expression between na√Øve, effector and memory T cells correlated in all 3 methods. B shows miRNAs with expression profile correlated only in the microarray and real time RT-PCR. C shows the expression profile that correlated only in cloning and RT-PCR. D shows the expression profile that correlated only in cloning and microarray and E represents the miRNAs that did not correlate in any two methods. The correlation was determined arbitrarily according to their movement in the same direction in the different assays.</p>
