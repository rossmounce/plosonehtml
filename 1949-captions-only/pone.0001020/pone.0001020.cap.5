                Figure 5.  Novel miRNA–miR-669d in mouse T cells.The presence of the stem loop sequences for miRNA-669d in the mouse genome is depicted in (A-B). C) Small RNAs from mouse T cells were tested for the presence of miR-669d by real time RT-PCR. Expression level was normalized to that of small non-coding RNA U6B. Mean of triplicate experiments±SD is shown.
