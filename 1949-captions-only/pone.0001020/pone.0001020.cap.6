                Figure 6.  miRNA 3′ end heterogeneity affects detection efficiency of stem-loop primer-based real time PCR.Detection efficiency was compared using exact miR-16 oligonucleotide and miR-16 oligonucleotide with 1 nt deletion or 1 nt addition at the 3′ end as templates. Mean of triplicate experiments±SD is shown.
