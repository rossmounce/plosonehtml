The results are shown for the four never-found nullomers in the human genome and polymorphic sequences databases (see Table 3 in ref. <a href="#pone.0001022-Hampikian1">[1]</a>). (B) Chromosomal means and standard deviations of the numbers of fully-CpG-mutated forms of the 76 nullomers, which occur with low frequency <a href="#pone.0001022-Hampikian1">[1]</a>. Estimates were derived by randomly mutating all CpG positions to either CpA or TpG for each nullomers and then scanning each human chromosome to find their frequency. The set of mutants analyzed contained 76 sequences, because each nullomer contributed one mutated form to the set . (C) The ratio of the average counts of the original and CpG-mutated nullomer sequences. Results are shown for one, two, and three mutations for all nullomers that contain three CpGs (see panel A). Original and CpG mutants with the same A+T content were compared.</p>
