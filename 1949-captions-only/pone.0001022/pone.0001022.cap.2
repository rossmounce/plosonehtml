Note that several nullomers are listed twice in ref. 1, as some sequences are reverse complement of others (e.g., atatCGCGCGt and aCGCGCGatat). (B) Set of nullomers that are found in both human and chimpanzee genomes (data from <a href="http://trac.boisestate.edu/dna/applets/SeqCount.html">http://trac.boisestate.edu/dna/applets/Sâ€‹eqCount.html</a>) <a href="#pone.0001022-Hampikian1">[1]</a>.</p>
