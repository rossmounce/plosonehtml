                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic relatedness of stx-negative and stx-positive E. coli strains within serotypes O26:H11/NM, O103:H2/NM, O121:H19, O145:H28/NM, and O157:H7/NM.Unrooted neighbor-joining tree was generated from allelic profiles of seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, recA) [30] using the Phylip software package (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu​/phylip.html). ST, sequence type; CC, clonal complex (at least six identical alleles); NM, non-motile; stx, Shiga toxin-encoding gene; stx−, stx-negative; stx+, stx-positive; SF, sorbitol-fermenting; NSF, non-sorbitol-fermenting. Strains of serotype O121:H19 differ by at least 4 alleles from all known sequence types and have therefore no assigned clonal complex. Scale bar, 5% estimated evolutionary distance.
