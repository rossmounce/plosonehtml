                Figure 1.  Maximum likelihood tree for 106 ERV-K genomes.ML tree for 4130 bp of shared (Partial) sequences from ERV-K genomes of human (Homo sapiens) (55 sequences), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) (32 sequences) and, rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) (19 sequences). Thirteen RhERV-K (shown as a collapsed red wedge in the tree) arise from a single ancient branch in Group O, while four other deep lineages radiate independently from within Group I. No RhERV-K was observed in Group N. The HERV-K, CERV-K and RhERV-K elements are shown by black, green and red branches, respectively. Duplications of the same provirus appear in colored collapsed wedges.
