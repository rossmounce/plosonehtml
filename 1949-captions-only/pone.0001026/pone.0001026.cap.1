Thirteen RhERV-K (shown as a collapsed red wedge in the tree) arise from a single ancient branch in Group O, while four other deep lineages radiate independently from within Group I. No RhERV-K was observed in Group N. The HERV-K, CERV-K and RhERV-K elements are shown by black, green and red branches, respectively. Duplications of the same provirus appear in colored collapsed wedges.</p>
