                Figure 2.  Bayesian skyline plots of three primate ERV-K.A) human (Homo sapiens) ERV-K (HERV-K), B) common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) ERV-K (CERV-K) and, C) rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) ERV-K (RhERV-K). Time is presented in million years from the present and effective population sizes multiplied by the generation time (Ne.g) are presented in a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. The bold line represents the median estimate for each species while the 95% HPDs (reflecting statistical uncertainty) are shaded. Integration times for all ERV-K were estimated using a rate of 3.3×10−9 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y).
