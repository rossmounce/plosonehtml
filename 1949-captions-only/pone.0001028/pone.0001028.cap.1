                Figure 1.  Absolute and relative values for elemental composition in normal and malignant tissues of liver, kidney, colon, and lung.A. and B. P content. C. and D. N content. The number of observations contributing to each mean is given by the number associated with each bar or point. Data in the right hand panels are expressed as the mean of the patient-specific ratios of malignant relative to normal tissue values (m/n ratio) for each parameter. The horizontal line shows an m/n ratio of one, indicating no difference between malignant and normal tissues. Error bars indicateÂ±one standard error. Asterisks next to each symbol in the right hand panels indicate the results of the organ-specific t-test examining whether the m/n ratio differs from one for that organ (*** = p&lt;0.0001; ** = 0.0001&lt;p&lt;0.001; * = 0.001&lt;p&lt;0.05; no asterisk = non-significant).
