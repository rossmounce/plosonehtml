                Figure 4.  Scatter plots of patient-specific data for paired observations of P content (% of dry mass) for malignant (y-axis) and normal (x-axis) tissues in the four organs studied.The dotted line indicates the 1:1 relationship. A data point lying above the line indicates that P content is elevated in malignant tissues, relative to normal, in that patient.
