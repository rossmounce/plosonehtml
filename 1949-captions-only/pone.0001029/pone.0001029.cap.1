                Figure 1.  Type I procollagen and collagen have the same thermal stability.A. Denaturation thermograms at 0.05°C/min heating rate in 0.2 M Na-phosphate, 0.5 M glycerol, pH 7.4 (PGB). B. Procollagen denaturation kinetics at 40°C in 0.15 M NaCl, 7 mM Na-phosphate, 1.7 mM K-phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS). C. Apparent Tm of collagen and procollagen in PGB and PBS. In DSC and DSCD measurements (circles), Tm was defined from the maximum on the corresponding thermogram (as shown in A). In isothermal CD (squares), the time of 50% denaturation was measured at a given temperature (as shown in B) and the results were plotted as the temperature of 50% denaturation (apparent isothermal Tm) vs. the corresponding equilibration time.
