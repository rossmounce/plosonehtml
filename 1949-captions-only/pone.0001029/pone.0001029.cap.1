Denaturation thermograms at 0.05°C/min heating rate in 0.2 M Na-phosphate, 0.5 M glycerol, pH 7.4 (PGB). B. Procollagen denaturation kinetics at 40°C in 0.15 M NaCl, 7 mM Na-phosphate, 1.7 mM K-phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS). C. Apparent T<sub>m</sub> of collagen and procollagen in PGB and PBS. In DSC and DSCD measurements (circles), T<sub>m</sub> was defined from the maximum on the corresponding thermogram (as shown in A). In isothermal CD (squares), the time of 50% denaturation was measured at a given temperature (as shown in B) and the results were plotted as the temperature of 50% denaturation (apparent isothermal T<sub>m</sub>) vs. the corresponding equilibration time.</p>
