                Figure 2.  Divalent ions do not affect thermal stability of procollagen.Normalized denaturation thermograms (A) and apparent Tm (B) measured by DSCD at 0.05°C/min scanning rate in PBS, DPBS (PBS with 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2), TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl), and TBS with 10 mM CaCl2. All buffers had neutral pH 7.1–7.5. The thermograms in A have the same colors as the corresponding bars in chart B.
