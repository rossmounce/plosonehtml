                Figure 3.  ER-like molecular crowding with nonspecific proteins does not affect procollagen thermal stability.A and B. Normalized DSC thermograms (A) and apparent Tm (B) at 1°C/min heating in PBS without and with 90 mg/ml BSA, 90 mg/ml IgG, or 100 mg/ml lysozyme (the thermograms in A and the corresponding bars in B have the same colors). C. Unfolding kinetics of procollagen at 37.5°C. In PBS with 90 mg/ml BSA, native procollagen fractions (inset, squares) were measured from the area under 1°C/min DSC thermograms of sample aliquots (blue tracings). In PBS without BSA, native procollagen fractions were measured from CD as shown in Fig. 1B.
