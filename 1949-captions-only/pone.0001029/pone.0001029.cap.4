Kinetics of triple helix recovery at 30째C monitored by CD at 223.8 nm in 0.1 mg/ml procollagen solution in PBS after 10 min denaturation at indicated temperatures. B. DSCD thermograms (0.05째C/min) of a native control sample and the refolded procollagen solutions after 10 hour equilibration. The native control has a single, narrow peak at ~41째C. Additional peaks at lower temperature in the refolded samples originate from shorter, less stable, gelatin-like helices.</p>
