                Figure 4.  Native structure of procollagen triple helix spontaneously refolds at 30째C after mild denaturation.A. Kinetics of triple helix recovery at 30째C monitored by CD at 223.8 nm in 0.1 mg/ml procollagen solution in PBS after 10 min denaturation at indicated temperatures. B. DSCD thermograms (0.05째C/min) of a native control sample and the refolded procollagen solutions after 10 hour equilibration. The native control has a single, narrow peak at ~41째C. Additional peaks at lower temperature in the refolded samples originate from shorter, less stable, gelatin-like helices.
