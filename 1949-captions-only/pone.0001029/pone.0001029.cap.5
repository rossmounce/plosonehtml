Kinetics of 0.1 mg/ml procollagen refolding in PBS after 10 min denaturation of the triple helices at 45째C (monitored by CD as in <a href="#pone-0001029-g004">Fig. 4</a>). B and C. Native triple helix refolding in PBS without (B) and with 90 mg/ml BSA (C) after an initial DSC scan from 25 to 50째C at 1째C/min. The fraction of refolded native procollagen (insets) was measured from the area under the DSC thermograms (colored tracings) after overnight equilibration in the DSC instrument at indicated temperatures following the initial denaturation scan (native control). A second scan without the overnight equilibration is shown by the yellow line in C.</p>
