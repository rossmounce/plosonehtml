(5),(6) based on the HSP47 binding sites and dissociation constants reported in <a href="#pone.0001029-Koide2">[40]</a>, as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a> (Theoretical analysis). Two possible values of the dissociation constant <em>K<sub>d</sub></em>(OGxRG) = 4.6 µM (solid line) and <em>K<sub>d</sub></em>(OGxRG) = 0.94 µM (dashed line) were used to account for the uncertainty in HSP47 binding at OGxRG, where x is a variable amino acid.</p>
