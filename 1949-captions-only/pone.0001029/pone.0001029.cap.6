                Figure 6.  HSP47 may allow procollagen triple helix folding at normal and elevated body temperatures.The free energy of triple helix stabilization δ(ΔG) and the corresponding maximum triple helix folding temperature T0+δT were calculated from Eqs. (5),(6) based on the HSP47 binding sites and dissociation constants reported in [40], as described in Methods (Theoretical analysis). Two possible values of the dissociation constant Kd(OGxRG) = 4.6 µM (solid line) and Kd(OGxRG) = 0.94 µM (dashed line) were used to account for the uncertainty in HSP47 binding at OGxRG, where x is a variable amino acid.
