Arrowheads and arrow indicate exogenous and endogenous SOD1, respectively. (B–D) Immunofluorescent analysis of SOD1 aggregates in SK-N-SH cells expressing wild-type SOD1 (B, C) or L84V SOD1 (D, E). Cells were incubated under control conditions (B, D) or with 1 µg/ml tunicamycin (C, E) for 24 h, and then were fixed and stained with an anti-SOD1 antibody. Tunicamycin induced aggregates of SOD1 (arrowheads) in L84V SOD1-expressing cells, but not in wild-type SOD1-expressing cells. Scale bar = 20 µm. (F) Quantification of (B-D). After the staining the cells with SOD1 aggregates were counted and scored. Numbers indicate the amounts of total counted cells. Asterisks show a significant difference from control, *p&lt;0.001. (G) SOD1 aggregates induced by tunicamycin and thapsigargin, but not by etoposide. SK-N-SH cells expressing L84V SOD1 were exposed to 0.3, 1 and 3 µg/ml tunicamycin, 0.3 and 1 µΜ thapsigargin and 100 and 300 µΜ etoposide. Asterisks show a significant difference from control, *p&lt;0.001. (H-J) Eosinophilic SOD1 aggregates induced by tunicamycin. Cells were treated as described in (E) and then stained with HE (H), anti-SOD1 antibody (I), or both (J). Scale bar = 20 µm.</p>
