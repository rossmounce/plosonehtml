                Figure 4.  ER and SOD1 co-localization in peri-cytoplasmic membrane region.(A) Electron micrograph of L84V SOD1-expressing SK-N-SH cells after treatment with 1 µg/ml of tunicamycin for 24 h as described in Materials and Methods. (B) Enlargement of part of (A). Arrowheads indicate abnormal ER aggregates, where mutant SOD1 is localized as in Fig. 3C′ and 3E′. Scale bar = 1 µm. (C) SOD1 localization in peri-cytoplasmic membrane region. Cells were treated as described in (A) and immune electron micrograph was obtained as described in Materials and Methods. Arrows show SOD1 immunoreactive in ER.
