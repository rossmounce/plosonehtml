(B) Enlargement of part of (A). Arrowheads indicate abnormal ER aggregates, where mutant SOD1 is localized as in <a href="#pone-0001030-g003">Fig. 3C′ and 3E′</a>. Scale bar = 1 µm. (C) SOD1 localization in peri-cytoplasmic membrane region. Cells were treated as described in (A) and immune electron micrograph was obtained as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Arrows show SOD1 immunoreactive in ER.</p>
