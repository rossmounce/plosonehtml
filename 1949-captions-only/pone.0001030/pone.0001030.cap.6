Eosinophilic LHIs in SK-N-SH cells (arrowheads in A and C) induced by tunicamycin were immunostained for ubiquitin (B) and SOD1 (D) after de-colorization. (E–H) KDEL immunoreactive in both LHI and Ast-HI. Eosinophilic LHI in SK-N-SH cells (arrowhead in E) and Ast-HI in spinal cord of L84V SOD1 mouse (arrowhead in G) were immunostained against anti-KDEL antibody after de-colorization (F, H).
