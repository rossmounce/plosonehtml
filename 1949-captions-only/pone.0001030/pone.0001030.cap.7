                Figure 7.  ER shows abnormal aggregation with numerous free ribosomes in L84V SOD1 mouse at presymptomatic stage.(A–C) Electron micrographs of a neuron obtained from an L84V SOD1 transgenic mouse containing ER aggregates. The inset in (A) shows a cytoplasmic inclusion-like structure (arrowhead) stained with toluidine blue. (A) ×3500 (scale bars = 20 µm). (B) ×8000 (scale bar = 1 µm). (C) ×15000 (scale bar = 1 µm). Arrowheads indicate abnormal ER aggregates.
