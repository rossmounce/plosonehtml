(A) Adult animal. (B) Swimming larva. (C) Larva undergoing settlement with anterior part flattened on substrate. (D) Postlarva 24 hours post settlement (ps). (E) A three week old juvenile. (F) Sliced brood chamber showing developing embryos of different stages. Bottom panel, benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate cleared whole mount developmental stages. (G) After a series of chaotic and asymmetric cell divisions there is a population of unevenly-sized and irregular macromeres and a population of tiny micromeres that are located on the surface and between the macromeres. Micromeres are too small to be seen in this micrograph. (H) A solid blastula is formed. (I) Gastrulation results in a bilayered embryo with the outer layer thicker at the future posterior pole (top); darker pigment cells are distributed throughout the outer layer. (J) Pigment cells migrate through the outer layer towards the posterior pole and coalesce to form a pigment spot. (K–L) The cells of the pigment spot reverse direction and migrate outwards to form a ring. (L, M) Swimming larva with a posterior pigment ring, inner cell mass, ciliated epithelial layer and a subepithelial middle layer. See 21 and 22 for a more detailed description of development and larval cell types. Scale bar is 100 µm on all images except (A) where it is 1 cm. ap–anterior pole, pp–posterior pole.</p>
