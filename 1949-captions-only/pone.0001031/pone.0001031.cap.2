                Figure 2.  Expression of Wnt in Amphimedon embryos.Top panel, whole mount in situ hybridizations; bottom panel, sectioned in situ hybridisations. (A) During cleavage, Wnt is expressed in micromeres distributed throughout the early embryo. (B) At the blastula stage, Wnt-expressing cells are predominantly localised interiorly. (C, D) Asymmetric localisation of Wnt-expressing cells occurs early in gastrulation, initially inside of the embryo. (E, F) As the gastrulation progresses, Wnt-positive cells are evident in the outer layer in the posterior pole. (G, H) At the spot stage, Wnt expression overlaps with the pigment spot and extends beyond it. (I) This expression pattern is maintained during ring formation. (J) Expression of Wnt continues in the posterior pole in swimming larvae. Scale bar is 100 Âµm. ap, anterior pole; pp, posterior pole.
