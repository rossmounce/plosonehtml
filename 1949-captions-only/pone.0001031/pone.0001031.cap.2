(A) During cleavage, <em>Wnt</em> is expressed in micromeres distributed throughout the early embryo. (B) At the blastula stage, Wnt-expressing cells are predominantly localised interiorly. (C, D) Asymmetric localisation of <em>Wnt</em>-expressing cells occurs early in gastrulation, initially inside of the embryo. (E, F) As the gastrulation progresses, <em>Wnt</em>-positive cells are evident in the outer layer in the posterior pole. (G, H) At the spot stage, <em>Wnt</em> expression overlaps with the pigment spot and extends beyond it. (I) This expression pattern is maintained during ring formation. (J) Expression of <em>Wnt</em> continues in the posterior pole in swimming larvae. Scale bar is 100 Âµm. ap, anterior pole; pp, posterior pole.</p>
