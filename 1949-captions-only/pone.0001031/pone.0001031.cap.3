(B) At the blastula stage, <em>TGF-β-</em>positive cells are more prominent in the outer layer. (C, D) During gastrulation, <em>TGF-β</em> expression is restricted to the outer layer, with two stronger domains at the anterior and posterior poles. (E, F) As the pigment cells migrate to the posterior pole, <em>TGF-β</em> expression disappears from the posterior pole leaving the area just outside the pigment spot clearly devoid of <em>TGF-β</em> transcripts. A weak <em>TGF-β</em> expression domain persists in the very center of the spot. (F, G) The anterior pole expression remains strong at the spot and ring stages. (H) As the pigment cells begin their outward migration, <em>TGF-β</em> expression is strong inside of the forming ring and in the outer layer except of the pigment ring itself and area just outside of it. (I, J) In the later ring, <em>TGF-β</em> expression clears from the center of the ring, but persists in the inner rim of the ring. (J) The embryonic expression gradually fades at late ring stages, and expression in some cells of the follicle layer on the surface of the embryo becomes more apparent. Scale bar, 100 µm.</p>
