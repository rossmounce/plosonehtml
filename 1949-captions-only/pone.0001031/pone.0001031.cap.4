Major evolutionary transitions in Wnt (blue) and TGF-β (red) gradients during embryonic development. <em>Wnt</em> and <em>TGF-β</em> genes arose early in metazoan evolution, after the choanoflagellate lineage diverged from the metazoan ancestor. These genes encoded ligands that originally formed gradients along one embryonic axis, as observed in modern sponges. The TGF-<em>β</em> gradient shifted to a perpendicular position in relation to the Wnt gradient in the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of contemporary eumetazoans, contribution to evolution of a second body axis.</p>
