                Figure 1.   Cyld−/− mice are hyperresponsive to NTHi-induced inflammation in the ear and lung of the mice.A, NTHi was trans-tympanically inoculated into the middle ears of WT and Cyld−/− mice and bullaes were dissected from WT and Cyld−/− mice inoculated with NTHi and saline for the control for histological analysis (H&amp;E stain, 200X). B, NTHi was intratracheally inoculated into the lungs of WT and Cyld−/− mice and lung tissues were dissected from WT and Cyld−/− mice inoculated with NTHi and saline for the control for histological analysis (H&amp;E stain, 200×). C &amp; D, NTHi was trans-tympanically (C) or intratracheally (D) inoculated into the middle ear (C) or lung (D), respectively, of WT and Cyld−/− mice and mRNA expression of the inflammatory mediators, IL-1β and MIP-2, was measured by Q-PCR analysis *p&lt;0.005 compared with control inoculation in WT mice, **p&lt;0.05 compared with NTHi inoculation in WT mice. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). CON, control.
