B, NTHi was intratracheally inoculated into the lungs of WT and <em>Cyld<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice and lung tissues were dissected from WT and <em>Cyld<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice inoculated with NTHi and saline for the control for histological analysis (H&amp;E stain, 200×). C &amp; D, NTHi was trans-tympanically (C) or intratracheally (D) inoculated into the middle ear (C) or lung (D), respectively, of WT and <em>Cyld<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice and mRNA expression of the inflammatory mediators, IL-1β and MIP-2, was measured by Q-PCR analysis *<em>p&lt;0.005</em> compared with control inoculation in WT mice, **<em>p&lt;0.05</em> compared with NTHi inoculation in WT mice.
