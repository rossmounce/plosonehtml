                Figure 2.  NTHi-induced CYLD is responsible for down-regulation of inflammatory response.A &amp; B, NTHi induced CYLD expression at both mRNA (A) and protein levels (B) in HMEEC-1 cells. C, NTHi induced CYLD expression at the mRNA level in the middle ear of WT mice. D &amp; E, NTHi induced expression of CYLD and IL-1β (D) or MIP-2 (E) at the mRNA level in the lung of WT mice. *p&lt;0.05 compared with CON. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). CON, control.
