                Figure 3.  NTHi induces inflammatory response through TLR2-MyD88-TRAF6/7-NF-κB signaling pathway.A &amp; B, Overexpressing dominant-negative (DN) mutants of TLR2, MyD88 and TRAF6/7 inhibited NTHi-induced activation of NF-κB (A) and up-regulation of IL-1β and IL-8 (B) in HMEEC-1 cells. *p&lt;0.001, compared with Mock. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). C, NTHi-induced expressions of IL-1β and MIP-2 mRNA were reduced in the lung of Tlr2−/− mice in vivo. *p&lt;0.005, compared with CON in WT mice, **p&lt;0.05 compared with NTHi inoculation in WT mice. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). D, NTHi-induced expressions of IL-1β and MIP-2 were reduced in the lung of MyD88+/− mice in vivo. E, Histological analysis of lung of Tlr2−/− mice revealed reduced inflammatory response by NTHi compared with WT mice (H&amp;E stain, ×200).
