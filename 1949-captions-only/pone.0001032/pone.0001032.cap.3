Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). C, NTHi-induced expressions of IL-1β and MIP-2 mRNA were reduced in the lung of <em>Tlr2<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice <em>in vivo</em>. *<em>p&lt;0.005</em>, compared with CON in WT mice, **<em>p&lt;0.05</em> compared with NTHi inoculation in WT mice. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). D, NTHi-induced expressions of IL-1β and MIP-2 were reduced in the lung of <em>MyD88<sup>+/−</sup></em> mice <em>in vivo</em>. E, Histological analysis of lung of <em>Tlr2<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice revealed reduced inflammatory response by NTHi compared with WT mice (H&amp;E stain, ×200).</p>
