                Figure 5.  CYLD inhibits TRAF6 and TRAF7 in a deubiquitination-dependent manner.A, NTHi induced ubiquitination of TRAF6. B, co-expressing WT-CYLD inhibited, whereas CYLD knockdown by siRNA-CYLD enhanced the ubiquitination of TRAF6 in HeLa cells. C, NTHi induced ubiquitination of TRAF7. D, co-expressing WT-CYLD inhibited, whereas CYLD knockdown by siRNA-CYLD enhanced the ubiquitination of TRAF7 in HeLa cells.
