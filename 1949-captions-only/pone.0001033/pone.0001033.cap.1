                Figure 1.  High percentages of CD56bright NK cells in two symptomatic TAP-deficient patients.PBMC from four normal donors and the patients were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of CD16 and CD56 is shown on gated CD3−CD19− lymphocytes (one representative experiment). Percentages of CD56bright NK cells among total NK cells are indicated for each donor.
