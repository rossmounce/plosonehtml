Mean values of different subject groups were calculated. ND: normal donors (n = 17); CF: cystic fibrosis patients (N = 2), V: vasculitis patients (n = 5), inf. R.I.: infected respiratory insufficiency (n = 5), uninf. R.I.: uninfected respiratory insufficiency (n = 5); EFA, EMO: symptomatic TAP-deficient patients; DFH, SFH: asymptomatic TAP-deficient patients.</p>
