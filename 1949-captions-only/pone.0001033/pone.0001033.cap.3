                Figure 3.  Over-expression of ILT2 on CD56dim NK cells of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.Mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of ILT2 were expressed relative to the values of a randomly chosen control donor arbitrarily considered as 100%. Mean values of different subject groups were calculated. ND: normal donors (n = 17); CF: cystic fibrosis patients (N = 2), V: vasculitis patients (n = 5), inf. R.I.: infected respiratory insufficiency (n = 5), uninf. R.I.: uninfected respiratory insufficiency (n = 5); EFA, EMO: symptomatic TAP-deficient patients; DFH, SFH: asymptomatic TAP-deficient patients.
