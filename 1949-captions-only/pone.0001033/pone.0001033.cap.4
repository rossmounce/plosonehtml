                Figure 4.  TAP-deficient PHA-induced T cell blasts are resistant to killing by activated autologous NK cells even in the presence of antibodies masking inhibitory receptors.A standard 51Chromium release assay was performed with activated NK cells from two normal donors (NK ND A, NK ND B) and of patient EMO (NK EMO) as effectors and TAP-deficient PHA-induced T cell blasts from patient EMO as targets. The effector to target (E/T) ratio was 6/1. Masking Ab were used at a concentration of 10 Âµg/ml. Indicated values correspond to the percentages of specific lysis.
