                Figure 1.  Development of an immune response.Depicted is a schematic representation of an immune response to a generic pathogenic insult. The phases of immune responses (described in Table 2) are shown in bold. Additional aspects not shown are the involvement of secondary lymphoid tissues for initial T cell and B cell activation by dendritic cells that migrate from the site of inflammation to lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid structures. The resolution of immune responses, immunological memory, and homeostasis are also not depicted.
