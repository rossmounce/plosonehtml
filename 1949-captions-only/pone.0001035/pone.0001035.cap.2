                Figure 2.  Inflammation subpathways involved in the response to danger signal.The concerted action of multiple functional subpathways in the initial response of a macrophage to bacteria or virus is depicted. Solid arrows indicate signaling events and dashed arrows stimulated production of proteins and other inflammatory mediators (including autocrine/paracrine responses of the macrophage to the released molecules).
