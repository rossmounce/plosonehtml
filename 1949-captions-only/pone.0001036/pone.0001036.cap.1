Each marker is indicated by a dot with connecting lines interpolated between adjacent markers. TJL BXD are BXD strains available from The Jackson Laboratory (The BXD strains developed by Taylor and colleagues <a href="#pone.0001036-Taylor1">[26]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001036-Taylor2">[27]</a>). New BXD are the recently developed BXD strains currently resident at UTHSC. <a href="#pone.0001036-Peirce2">[18]</a> Note that the maximum and minimum values of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile LOD score vary considerably for the AIL population, somewhat for the RI (New BXD and TJL BXD) populations, (predicted by missing data pattern) and very little for the 183 member F2 population tested. (There are only three widely spaced markers genotyped for the F2 population on Chr. 1, so the interpolation between points should not be interpreted as a meaningful line. However, markers on all chromosomes were very similar, between a 95% LOD of 1.2 and 1.4.)</p>
