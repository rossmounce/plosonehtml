The genome-wide adjusted composite P = 0.05 threshold is −log P = 3.5 (dark solid horizontal line). Since 5000 permutations were used for each data set, the maximum −log P&lt;3.7 (graphed as −log P = 3.7 for convenience) for each individual data set, so increasing the number of permutations might increase the peak combined value and slightly improve the range of the combined interval. Bars underneath the peaks are labeled AIL, BXD, and combined to indicate the l-LOD support interval of these mapping populations.</p>
