Data on the left (Participant 6 from <a href="#pone-0001037-t002">Table 2</a>) show positive correlation between biceps activity and the illusory extension (r = 0.60) and no other associations. Data on the right (Participant 1) show correlation between activity in the triceps and illusory extension (r = 0.51), as well as between the biceps and illusory flexion (r = 0.90).</p>
