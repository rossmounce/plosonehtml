                Figure 5.  EMG records (top) and perceptual experience (bottom), individual data of two participants.Black line represents activity in the triceps and illusory extension, and grey line, biceps activity and illusory flexion. Data on the left (Participant 6 from Table 2) show positive correlation between biceps activity and the illusory extension (r = 0.60) and no other associations. Data on the right (Participant 1) show correlation between activity in the triceps and illusory extension (r = 0.51), as well as between the biceps and illusory flexion (r = 0.90).
