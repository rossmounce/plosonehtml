                Figure 2.  Scatter plot and best fit line between IFN-γ, SP and IL-9 concentrations (expressed Ln([cytokine]/[urea]), ng/mol) in paired samples of NPA and BAL.Pearson correlation coefficient: SP = 0.39 (n = 40, p = 0.01), IFN-γ = 0.35 (n = 38, p = 0.03)&amp;IL-9 = 0.46 (n = 53, p = 0.001).
