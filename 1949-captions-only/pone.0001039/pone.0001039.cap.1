                Figure 1.  Spectroscopic behavior of Mini-B and DEPN-8.Panel A: CD spectrum for Mini-B in trifluoroethanol (TFE); Panel B: FTIR spectrum for DEPN-8; Panel C: FTIR spectral differences for Mini-B in DEPN-8 (dashed line) compared to Mini-B in TFE (solid line). In Panel A, mean residue ellipticity (MRE) averaged over eight scans is plotted against wavelength for Mini-B in 4:6 (v:v) TFE:10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The double minimum at ~208 and 222 nm is indicative of a high α-helical content. In Panel B, the spectrum for DEPN-8 multilayers (100 µg lipid, arbitrary absorbance units) has a “C-O-C” ether linkage-associated absorption band centered at a wavenumber of 1072 cm−1. In Panel C, the IR spectrum of Mini-B in TFE (solid line) has a peak at 1655 cm−1 indicating high α-helix levels, while the peak at 1658 cm−1 and high-field shoulder at 1678 cm−1 for Mini-B in DEPN-8 (dashed line) indicates an increase in turn/bend conformation with a decreased but still prominent α-helix content.
