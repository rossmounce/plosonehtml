                Figure 2.  Adsorption of DEPN-8 with and without 1.5% (by wt) Mini-B compared to calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE).Adsorption surface tensions are plotted following the addition of a bolus of DEPN-8, DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B, or CLSE to a stirred subphase (10 mM HEPES with 0.15M NaCl and 1.5 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.0) in a Teflon® dish at time zero. Final subphase surfactant concentration was uniform at 0.0625 mg lipid/ml. Data are Mean±SEM for n = 3–5. See text for details.
