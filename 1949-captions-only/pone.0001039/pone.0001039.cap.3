                Figure 3.  Dynamic surface activity of DEPN-8+1.5% (by wt) Mini-B compared to CLSE on the pulsating bubble surfactometer.Panel A: 0.5 mg/ml phosphonolipid (phospholipid); Panel B: 2.5 mg/ml phosphonolipid (phospholipid). Surface tension at minimum bubble radius (minimum surface tension) for DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B and CLSE is graphed as a function of time on a pulsating bubble surfactometer (37°C, 20 cycles/min, 50% area compression). Data are Mean±SEM for n = 3–5. See text for details.
