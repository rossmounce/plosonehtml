                Figure 4.  Surface activity of DEPN-8+1.5% (by wt) Mini-B and CLSE in the presence of bovine serum albumin.Surface tension at minimum radius (minimum surface tension) is graphed as a function of time for DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B and CLSE in the presence of bovine serum albumin (3 mg/ml) on a pulsating bubble surfactometer (37°C, 20 cycles/min, 50% area compression). Surfactant concentration was 2.5 mg/ml of phosphonolipid (phospholipid). Data are Mean±SEM for n = 4–5.
