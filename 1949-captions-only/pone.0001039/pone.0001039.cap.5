                Figure 5.  Quasi-static surface activity of DEPN-8+1.5% or 3% Mini-B compared to CLSE on the captive bubble surfactometer.Minimum and maximum surface tensions are shown for DEPN-8+1.5% or 3% by weight Mini-B compared to CLSE on a captive bubble surfactometer during slow compression (10 cycles over 90 min including a 2 min pause between each cycle). Surface tension values are MeanÂ±SEM for at least three separate experiments. See text for details.
