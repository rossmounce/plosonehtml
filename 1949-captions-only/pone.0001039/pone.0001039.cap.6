                Figure 6.  Dynamic surface activity of DEPN-8+1.5% or 3% Mini-B compared to CLSE on the captive bubble surfactometer.Minimum and maximum surface tensions are shown for DEPN-8+1.5% or 3% by weight Mini-B and CLSE on a captive bubble surfactometer during 10 cycles of rapid compression (20 cycles/min) following slow compression as in Figure 5. Surface tension values are MeanÂ±SEM for at least three separate experiments. See text for details.
