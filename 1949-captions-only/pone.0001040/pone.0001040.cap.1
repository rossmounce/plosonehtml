                Figure 1.  Sleep diary.This is a translation of the diary, which was in Norwegian. The electronic diary included online help, a calendar indicating the number of days completed and remaining, options for viewing graphs of each of the five outcome variables, space for personal notes, and automated checks to ensure that the diary was completed each day and checked for correctness before being submitted. Changes could not be made after the data were submitted. Participants could print out paper versions of the sleep diary and enter the data electronically later if they chose to do so.
