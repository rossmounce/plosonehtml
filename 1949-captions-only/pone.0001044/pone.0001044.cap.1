(A) Serum PA- and (B) Domain 4-specific IgG was measured by ELISA (Abs 405 nm). All mice were boosted at day 42 (↑) with PA in saline. Error bars indicate SEM (n = 5). (C) Endpoint ELISAs were performed on day 14 serum samples from PA-Av/IFA, PA-Av-Alum, and PA-Av-C3d<sub>3</sub>/IFA immunized mice. Endpoint titers shown are 2-fold above background. Error bars represent SEM (n = 5, *p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.005).</p>
