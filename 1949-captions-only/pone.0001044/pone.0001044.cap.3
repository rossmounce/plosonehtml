                Figure 3.  PA-Av-C3d3 is an effective immunogen delivered i.p., s.c or i.m.PA-Av-C3d3 was injected i.p. (▵), s.c. (▪), or i.m. (♦) and (A) PA- or (B) Domain 4-specific IgG was measured by ELISA. Relative efficacy of PA-Av-C3d3 (▪,♦) and PA-Av-alum (□,⋄) was compared following (C) s.c. or (D) i.m. administration of immunogen (see methods). Error bars indicate SEM (*p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.005, n = 3).
