                Figure 5.  C3d conjugation augments the formation of germinal centers and plasma cells.A/J mice were analyzed at the indicated time points post-immunization with PA-Av-Alum or PA-Av-C3d3/IFA. Flow cytometry profiles indicate (A) percent splenic germinal center B cells (CD3−, CD11b−, IgD−, B220+, GL7+, Fas+) of total B cells; (B) percent plasma cells (CD11b−, CD3−, IgD−, B220lo, Syn1hi) of IgD− B cells, and (C) percent activated T cells (B220−, CD11b−, CD4+, CD62Llo, ICOS+) of CD4+ cells. Representative FACS plots are shown with average and standard deviation (n = 3) of gated population indicated. ELISAs were performed to measure PA-specific (D) IgM and (E) IgG and domain 4-specific IgM (F) and IgG (G) from serum of mice immunized with PA-Av-Alum (white columns) or PA-Av-C3d3/IFA (black columns). Error bars represent SEM (n = 3) (*p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.005).
