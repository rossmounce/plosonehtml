                Figure 6.  PA-Av-C3d3 provides enhanced protection against aerosol anthrax spore challenge.A/J mice were immunized with either: adjuvant control (*), PA-Av/IFA (○), PA-Av-Alum (□), or PA-Av-C3d3/IFA (▵). Ten days after immunization, mice were challenged with (A) 5×105 (10–40x LD50, n = 5 per group) or (B) 5×106 (100–400×LD50, n = 10 per group) Sterne B. anthracis spores administered intranasally. Mouse survival was monitored for 10 days post-spore challenge.
