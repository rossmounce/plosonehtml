<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>All vaccinations were well tolerated (<a href="#pone-0001045-t001">Table 1</a>). Mild pain and swelling were the most commonly observed injection site reactions, and there were no significant differences among the proportions of volunteers with these reactions between vaccines (AMA1-C1 vs. Recombivax) or between vaccinations within dose groups. Similarly, there was no dose response in the occurrence of injection site reactions except for injection site swelling after the first vaccination which occurred more frequently with increasing dose concentrations of AMA1-C1 (<em>p</em> = 0.03) . Solicited systemic reactions were uncommon, with mild to moderate headache being the most frequently observed event. There were no significant differences between AMA1-C1 and Recombivax or between successive vaccinations within dose groups, and no dose-response, in the incidence of systemic reactions.</p>
