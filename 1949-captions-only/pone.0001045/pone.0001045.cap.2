                Figure 2.  Comparison of pre-vaccination (A) and post-vaccination (B) antibody responses to AMA1-3D7 and AMA1-FVO.Sera collected on day 0 and 42 were assayed from all study participants. Concordance between the responses to the 3D7 and FVO alleles of AMA1 were highly significant on both days (RMAC, 0.97 on day 0 and 0.96 on day 42)
