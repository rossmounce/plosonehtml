                Figure 4.  Longitudinal anti-AMA1 antibody responses in study participants from the first (A), second (B) and third (C) cohorts.Antibody units were measured by ELISA in sera collected on: day 0 (vaccination 1), day 14 (14 days post-vaccination 1), day 28 (vaccination 2), day 42 (14 days post-vaccination 2), day 90, day 180, day 270, day 360 (vaccination 3), day 374 (14 days post-vaccination 3), days 420, 480, and 540. Points represent the geometric mean antibody units against AMA1-3D7, error bars the standard error, and arrows the vaccination time points; TS, transmission season; °, 5 µg AMA1-C1; □, 20 µg AMA1-C1; Δ, 80 µg AMA1-C1; ×, Recombivax
