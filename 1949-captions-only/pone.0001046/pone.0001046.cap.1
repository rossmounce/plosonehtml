                Figure 1.  Biophysical characterization of wild-type and mutant αB-crystallin proteins.A, Near- and B, Far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and mutant αB-crystallin proteins. Spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with 1 cm and 0.01 cm pathlength cells for the near- and far-UV regions, respectively. Protein concentrations were ~1 mg/mL prepared in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. C, Size-exclusion HPLC traces for wild-type and mutant αB-crystallin proteins in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples (10 µL of a 10 mg/mL solution) were injected onto the column and eluted at 0.5 mL/min. D, Thermostability profiles of αB-crystallin mutants. Protein samples were 0.2 mg/mL in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Thermal ramping was 1°C/min and light scattering at 360 nm was monitored as an indicator of protein precipitation.
