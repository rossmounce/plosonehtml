The change in light scattering at 340 nm for each sample is shown. Each assay was repeated four times and the data shown are representative. <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> show the percentage protection for each protein in the β<sub>L</sub>-crystallin and insulin B-chain aggregation assays respectively. The data in <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> represent the mean±standard error of the mean (SEM) of the 4 different experiments, * denotes a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference in the mean compared to wild-type αB-crystallin.</p>
