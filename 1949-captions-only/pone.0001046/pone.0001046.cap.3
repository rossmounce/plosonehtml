The chaperones were used at a 1.0:0.3 molar ratio of RCMκ-casein:αB-crystallin and a 1.0:0.05 molar ratio of ccβ-Trp:αB-crystallin respectively. The ThT fluorescence was monitored by <em>in situ</em> assay for 15 h and the change in ThT fluorescence of each sample is shown. Each assay was repeated four times and the data shown are representative. The data in <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> show the percentage protection for each protein in the RCMκ-casein and ccβ-Trp assay systems respectively. These data represent the mean±SEM of 4 different experiments, * denotes a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference in the mean compared to wild-type αB-crystallin.</p>
