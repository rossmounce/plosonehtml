                Figure 3.  Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation by wild-type and C-terminal mutants of αB-crystallin.Thioflavin T (ThT) binding curves of A, RCMκ-casein and C ccβ-Trp incubated at 37°C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 in the absence or presence of wild-type and mutant αB-crystallins. The chaperones were used at a 1.0:0.3 molar ratio of RCMκ-casein:αB-crystallin and a 1.0:0.05 molar ratio of ccβ-Trp:αB-crystallin respectively. The ThT fluorescence was monitored by in situ assay for 15 h and the change in ThT fluorescence of each sample is shown. Each assay was repeated four times and the data shown are representative. The data in B and D show the percentage protection for each protein in the RCMκ-casein and ccβ-Trp assay systems respectively. These data represent the mean±SEM of 4 different experiments, * denotes a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference in the mean compared to wild-type αB-crystallin.
