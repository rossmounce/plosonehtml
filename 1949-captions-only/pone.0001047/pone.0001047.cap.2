The pie-chart indicates datasets from various origins, sizes, and cancer types, and the compendia are indicated by the outer rings. The ’Inter1’ training-validation configuration is depicted in this figure (<a href="#pone.0001047-VandeVijver1">[4]</a> as training, and <a href="#pone.0001047-Wang1">[3]</a> as validation). This is one of the six configurations employed (See <a href="#pone-0001047-t001">Table 1</a> for details).</p>
