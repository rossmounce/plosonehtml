                Figure 3.  Pie chart indicating the origin of the gene sets.A total of 2682 gene sets were collected. The GO, KEGG, GenMapp, and Tissue specific gene sets were taken from the study by Segal et al. [10]. The Reactome pathways were downloaded from the Reactome website [23], and the MSDB gene sets were taken from the molecular signature database [24].
