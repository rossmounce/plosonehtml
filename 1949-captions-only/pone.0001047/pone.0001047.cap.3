The GO, KEGG, GenMapp, and Tissue specific gene sets were taken from the study by Segal et al. <a href="#pone.0001047-Segal1">[10]</a>. The Reactome pathways were downloaded from the Reactome website <a href="#pone.0001047-MSigDB1">[23]</a>, and the MSDB gene sets were taken from the molecular signature database <a href="#pone.0001047-Reactome1">[24]</a>.</p>
