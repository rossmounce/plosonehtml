For both signatures an enrichment score for their overlap with the collection of 2682 gene sets was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution. This resulted in a total of 319 gene sets that were enriched in at least one module or in the gene-based signature (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 after Bonferroni correction), see supplemental <a href="#pone.0001047.s005">figure S4</a>. Several modules turned out to have a similar pattern of enrichment across the gene sets. Additionally, gene sets that relate to a common theme turned out to have a similar enrichment pattern across the modules. Therefore, we clustered the matrix of p-values in both dimensions (2-dimensional, hierarchical clustering, complete linkage, Euclidean distance). The dendrograms at the top, and to the left indicate the clustering, where we chose to group either dimension into seven distinct groups. The labels on the left indicate the most common biological theme, and the label on the bottom indicates the groups of modules formed along with the number of modules in each group in brackets. The main table shows the median p-value for the enrichment of each of the seven clusters of modules, across these seven groups of gene sets. Similarly, the table on the right shows the median p-values for the gene signature. Shading of the cells reflects the p-values.</p>
