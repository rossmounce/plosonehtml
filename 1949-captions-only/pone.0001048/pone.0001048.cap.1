Cells grown from C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow with GM-CSF were tested for cell surface expression of dendritic cell markers by flow cytometry, with or without 6 h LPS treatment (250 ng/mL). The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. B. Equivalent cells to A were left uninfected or infected with MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 22 h) expressing eGFP either from a human cytomegalovirus IE1 promoter (BAC-eGFP) or fused to the endogenous gM C-terminus (gM-eGFP). Infection was evaluated by flow cytometric assay of eGFP expression. The percentage of cells in each quadrant is shown. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. C. Equivalent cells to A were left uninfected or infected with gM-eGFP MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 22 h). Infections were done in the presence of 100 µg/ml heparin, 0.1% MHV-68-immune rabbit serum or 100 µg/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) as shown. Infection was assessed by flow cytometric assay of gM-eGFP expression.</p>
