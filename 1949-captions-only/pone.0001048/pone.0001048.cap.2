                Figure 2.  Correlating BAC-eGFP and gM-eGFP expression with other markers of MHV-68 lytic infection in DCs.A. DCs were plated onto coverslips and infected (3PFU/cell, 22 h) with BAC-eGFP or gM-eGFP MHV-68 as shown, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for the ORF65 capsid component with mAb MG-12B8. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. B. DCs were infected (3PFU/cell) with gM-eGFP MHV-68 and then washed and fixed after 4 h or 24 h before staining for ORF65 as in A. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. C. DCs were infected as in A and stained for ORF75a with mAb BN-3H8 The data are from 2 of 3 equivalent experiments. D. DCs were infected with gM-eGFP MHV-68 as in A and stained for gN with mAb 3F7 or for thymidine kinase with mAb CS-4A5. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.
