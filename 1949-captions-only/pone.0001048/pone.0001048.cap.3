DCs were infected with BAC-eGFP or gM-eGFP MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 18 h), then treated or not with LPS (250 ng/mL) for 6 h. CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells were then analyzed for eGFP expression and cell surface MHC class II expression by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. B. DCs were plated onto coverslips then infected with gM-eGFP MHV-68 and exposed or not to LPS as in A. EGFP expression was visualized directly and nuclei counterstained with DAPI. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. C. DCs were infected (3PFU/cell, 22 h) with MHV-68 expressing eGFP-tagged ORF73, then examined by confocal microscopy. Essentially every adherent cell expressed some nuclear eGFP, although the precise staining pattern differed between individual cells. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. D. Cells were infected with eGFP-ORF73 MHV-68 as in C, then stained for the ORF65 capsid component with mAb MG-12B8. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments.</p>
