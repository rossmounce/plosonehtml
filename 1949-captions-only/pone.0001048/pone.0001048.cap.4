                Figure 4.  No sign of MHV-68 infection in mature DCs.A. DCs were left uninfected or exposed to gM-eGFP, BAC-eGFP or eGFP-ORF73 MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 22 h). The non-adherent cells were centrifuged onto cover slips, then stained for MHC class II expression and also examined for eGFP expression/uptake. The data are from 1 of 2 equivalent experiments. B. Bone marrow-derived DCs were incubated or not with LPS to trigger maturation, then exposed to BAC-eGFP+ or gM-eGFP+ MHV-68 as shown (3PFU/cell). 22 h later, CD11c+ cells were analyzed for surface MHC class II expession and virus-driven eGFP.
