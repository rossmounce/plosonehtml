                Figure 5.  Characterization of K3 function in MHV-68-infected DCs.A. K3 was disrupted on the gM-eGFP background by introducing a deletion after its first transmembrane domain. Wild-type, K3+gM-eGFP and K3−gM-eGFP viruses were analyzed by Southern blotting. The predicted alterations to the gM and K3 loci are shown. Thus, gM-eGFP insertion donwstream of gM introduces a BamHI restriction site such that the 10 kb genomic BamHI fragment is cut into 4.1 kb and 6.6 kb fragments. The K3 deletion removes an ApaI site, such that 1.7 kb and 1.9 kb genomic fragments are combined into a single 3.4 kb fragment. B. BHK-21 cells were infected (0.01PFU/cell) as indicated. Replicate cultures were frozen at each time point. All were then assayed for virus titer by plaque assay. C. H2b MEF-1 fibroblasts were left uninfected or infected (2PFU/cell, 4 h) with K3+ or K3− gM-eGFP viruses or a gM-eGFP− K3 mutant (K3−TET+) [20] as a control. The cells were then washed and incubated overnight with the 49100.2 T cell hybridoma, which recognizes an H2-Db-restricted MHV-68 lytic epitope and produces β-galactosidase upon activation. The cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 and beta-galactosidase activity measured with CPRG. Each bar shows mean ± SD absorbance readings from triplicate cultures. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. D. DCs were infected (3PFU/cell, 22 h) with K3+ or K3− gM-eGFP MHV-68 as indicated, then and stained for cell surface H2-Kb expression and eGFP expression by flow cytometry. Each graph shows gated CD11c+ cells. In the dot plots, the number shows the percentage of all CD11c+ cells in each quadrant. The histograms show equivalent data, but gated according to high or low gM-eGFP expression. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. E. H2b DCs were infected with K3+ or K3− viruses as indicated for 4 h, washed and incubated overnight with the MHV-68 p56-specific 49100.2 T cell hybridoma. β-galactosidase expression was then measured with CPRG. Mean ± DC absorbance values of triplicate cultures are shown. Duplicate samples were coated with reducing concentrations of p56 peptide and assayed as above. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments.
