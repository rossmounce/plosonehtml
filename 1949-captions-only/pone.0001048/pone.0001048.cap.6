H2<sup>b</sup> DCs were infected (3PFU/cell, 16 h) with K3<sup>+</sup> or K3<sup>−</sup> gM-eGFP MHV-68 viruses and then co-cultured with the H2-D<sup>b</sup>-restricted, p56-specific 49100.2 hybridoma cells with or without 20 nM p56 peptide for a further 6 h. The DCs were then washed, fixed and stained for ORF65 capsid expression with mAb MG-12B8. The hybridoma cells are partially adherent, so where hybridoma cells were added they may contribute to the DAPI staining. B. Mean ± SD values of gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cell counts in randomly selected fields (&gt;20 each). Each number is expressed relative to the number for infection without hybridoma cells. Thus, “20%” means that the treatment arm had 20% the number of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells per field seen when hybridoma cells were not added. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments.</p>
