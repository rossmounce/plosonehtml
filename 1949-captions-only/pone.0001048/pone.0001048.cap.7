                Figure 7.  Antigen presentation by mixed infected DC cultures.A. H2d DCs were infected with MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 18 h). Ovalbumin was then added to the DCs for 2 h and removed. DO.11.10 hybridoma cells (CD4+, ovalbumin-specific, IAd-restricted) were then added for a further 15 h. IL-2 in cell supernatants was then measured by ELISA. Each bar shows mean Â± SD values of triplicate cultures. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. B. H2b DCs were infected with MHV-68 (3PFU/cell, 24 h). Ovalbumin was then added to the DCs for 6 h and removed. CFSE-labelled OT-I transgenic T cells from lymph nodes (CD8+, ovalbumin-specific, H2-Kb-restricted) were then added for a further 3 d. The fraction of proliferating CD8+ cells (based on loss of CFSE staining) was then determined by flow cytometry. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments.
