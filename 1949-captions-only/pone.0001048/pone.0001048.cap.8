DCs were left uninfected or infected (3PFU/cell, 22 h) with gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> MHV-68 and then assayed for cell surface CD11c, MHC II, CD86 and CD80 expression by flow cytometry. Control = isotype-matched irrelevant antibody. Plots show CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells and are representative of 4 independent experiments. B. DCs were left uninfected or infected (3PFU/cell, 14 h), then treated with LPS (250 ng/mL), IFNÎ³ (200 U/mL) or nothing for a further 7 h. The cells were then stained for surface CD11c, CD86 and MHC class II. Plots show CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells and are representative of 3 independent experiments. CD11c positive cells are shown and are representative of 3 independent experiments.</p>
