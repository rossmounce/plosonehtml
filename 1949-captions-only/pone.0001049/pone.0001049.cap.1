Connection patterns are represented as binary connection matrices C<sub>ij</sub>, with existing connections (edges) indicated by a filled (black) square (c<sub>ij</sub> = 1). No distinction is made between connections that have been shown to be absent and connections that are unknown; all are represented by a white square (c<sub>ij</sub> = 0). Main diagonals are indicated in grey and self-connections are excluded (c<sub>ii</sub> = 0). From top to bottom: (A) Macaque cortex (<em>N = </em>47, <em>K = </em>505). (B) Cat cortex (<em>N = </em>52, <em>K = </em>820). Panels on the right show the matching index matrix M<sub>ij</sub> calculated from the connection matrix following Hilgetag et al. <a href="#pone.0001049-Hilgetag1">[6]</a>. The matching index scales between 0 (no match) and 1 (perfect match), and m<sub>ij</sub> = m<sub>ji</sub>. The arrangement of brain regions for each of the four matrices was arrived at as follows. The M<sub>ij</sub> matrix was converted to a distance matrix, from which a hierarchical cluster tree was computed using a consecutive linking procedure based on farthest inter-cluster distances. This resulted in a linear ordering of areas based on cluster membership and inter-cluster distances. The ordering was rotated such that visual areas appear topmost.</p>
