                Figure 2.  Degree of areas in macaque and cat cortex.The degree of each area of macaque cortex (A) and cat cortex (B) is calculated as the sum over all row and column entries for that area in the matrix of structural connections (Fig. 1). High-degree areas are all areas with a degree greater than the network mean plus one standard deviation. In this, and in all subsequent figures in this paper, these high-degree areas are labeled in yellow.
