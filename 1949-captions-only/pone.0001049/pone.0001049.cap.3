                Figure 3.  Statistical significance of motif participation for individual brain regions.(A) Macaque cortex. (B) Cat cortex. Each plot shows z-scores (half circles, light blue = relative to random networks, dark blue = relative to lattice networks) for each individual area. Areas with significantly positive z-scores for both comparisons are marked in shades of red (see legend). These areas are marked identically in Fig. 4. High-degree areas are marked by yellow arrows. Motif classes of size M = 3 are shown at the upper right of the plot.
