                Figure 5.  Apex ratio for motif  and clustering coefficients in macaque and cat cortex.The apex ratio (A) reflects the incidence of a given brain region at the apex (central node) of all motifs of class  that the region participates in (see inset). Areas are displayed in decreasing order. High-degree areas are displayed with yellow bars, others are displayed with gray bars. Horizontal lines mark the mean apex ratio (solid line) and the mean plus one standard deviation (dashed line). Panel B shows the ranked clustering coefficient for each area of macaque and cat cortex, with high-degree areas once again shown in yellow. Horizontal lines mark the mean clustering coefficient (solid line) and the mean minus one standard deviation (dashed line).
