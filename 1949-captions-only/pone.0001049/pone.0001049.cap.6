(B) Closeness centrality, calculated as the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths linking a given vertex to all others in the network (see <a href="#s2">Methods</a>). Areas are ranked in decreasing order, with high-degree areas shown in yellow. Horizontal lines mark mean centrality (solid line) and mean plus one standard deviation (dashed line).</p>
