                Figure 6.  Centrality measures in macaque and cat cortex.(A) Betweenness centrality, calculated as the fraction of all shortest paths traveling through a given vertex (see Methods). (B) Closeness centrality, calculated as the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths linking a given vertex to all others in the network (see Methods). Areas are ranked in decreasing order, with high-degree areas shown in yellow. Horizontal lines mark mean centrality (solid line) and mean plus one standard deviation (dashed line).
