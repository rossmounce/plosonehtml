(B,C) Area V4 and area 46 submatrices and projection length distributions. (B, left) Area V4 submatrix, comprised of the subset of areas and connections of the macaque cortex directly connected to area V4. Areas are arranged such that connections are optimally contracted towards the main diagonal, resulting in two clusters containing mostly dorsal (upper left) and mostly ventral (lower right) areas. V4 afferents and efferents are shaded in dark gray. (B, middle) Graph rendering of the V4 submatrix shows that this subnetwork comprises two component clusters with V4 in a central position. Rendering of the graph was performed in Pajek (<a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/">http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/â€‹pajek/</a>; <a href="#pone.0001049-Batagelj1">[69]</a>) using the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm <a href="#pone.0001049-Kamada1">[70]</a>. V4 is marked by a blue dot, members of cluster 1 (mostly dorsal stream visual areas) are marked in white, and members of cluster 2 (mostly ventral stream visual areas) are marked in gray. (B, right) Surface representation of V4 (shaded in blue) and its direct neighbors (shaded in light blue). Histogram shows the distribution of the connection lengths between area V4 and its immediate neighbors. The mean connection length is 17.09 mm (S.D. = 9.60 mm). (C, left) Area 46 submatrix. (C, middle) Pajek plot for area 46 submatrix. Clusters linked by area 46 appear less segregated than those for area V4 and contain a mixture of visual, sensorimotor and multimodal areas. (C, right) Surface representation of area 46 and its neighbors, and histogram of area 46 connection lengths (mean = 33.41 mm, S.D. = 10.58 mm).</p>
