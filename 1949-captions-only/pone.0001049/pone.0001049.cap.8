Horizontal lines mark the mean small-world index of the intact macaque (A) and cat (B) network (solid lines) as well as their respective standard deviations (dashed lines). Error bars show the standard deviations of the distributions of <em>σ<sub>sw</sub></em> after the lesion was made. All distributions for <em>σ<sub>sw</sub></em> were derived from n = 1000 comparisons to degree-matched random networks. Differences at the ends of the spectrum were highly significant (p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>); non-significant differences are marked with a cross (×).</p>
