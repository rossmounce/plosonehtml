                Figure 8.  Impact of single area lesion on small-world index.Areas are sorted in decreasing order and high-degree areas are shown in yellow. Horizontal lines mark the mean small-world index of the intact macaque (A) and cat (B) network (solid lines) as well as their respective standard deviations (dashed lines). Error bars show the standard deviations of the distributions of σsw after the lesion was made. All distributions for σsw were derived from n = 1000 comparisons to degree-matched random networks. Differences at the ends of the spectrum were highly significant (p&lt;10−16); non-significant differences are marked with a cross (×).
