(A). Scaled down representation of the entire cluster of the 1199 signature genes and 61 whole blood samples. (B). Experimental dendrogram displaying the clustering of the samples into two main branches: the TAA branch (red) and the control branch (blue) with a few exceptions. (C). Gene expression pattern of representative genes within biological pathways that are statistically significantly over-represented (random overlapping <em>p</em>-value&lt;0.05) by the up-regulated (red bars) or the down-regulated (blue bars) signature genes of TAA.</p>
