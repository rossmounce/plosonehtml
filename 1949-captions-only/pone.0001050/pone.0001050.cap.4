                Figure 4.  Validation of the 41 classifier genes using TaqMan real-time PCR assays.The expression profile of the 41 classifier genes was measured in each of the 82 samples by real-time PCR using TaqManÂ® Gene Expression Assays. Based on TaqMan assay data, the coefficient of the 41 classifier genes were re-learned from the 52 training samples and used to classify the status of 30 testing samples using the same method applied to microarray data. (A). Classification probabilities for each testing sample: TAA (case) vs. normal (control); (B). Contingency table summarizes the predicted and actual class membership for the testing set; (C). Classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.
