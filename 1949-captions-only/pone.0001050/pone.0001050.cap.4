Based on TaqMan assay data, the coefficient of the 41 classifier genes were re-learned from the 52 training samples and used to classify the status of 30 testing samples using the same method applied to microarray data. (A). Classification probabilities for each testing sample: TAA (case) vs. normal (control); (B). Contingency table summarizes the predicted and actual class membership for the testing set; (C). Classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.</p>
