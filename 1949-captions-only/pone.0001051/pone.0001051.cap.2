                Figure 2.  Loss of ankyrin-B-dependent [3H]-ouabain-binding sites mimics the cellular action of digitalis.(A) Isolated unloaded ankyrin-B+/− ventricular cardiomyocytes display increased cellular shortening compared to unloaded WT cardiomyocytes, consistent with increased [Ca2+]i transients [14]. Asterisk represents p&lt;0.01 between untreated WT and ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes (15–20 cardiomyocytes from 4–5 mice). WT and ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes treated with maximal doses of ouabain (100 µM) display significant elevations in cellular shortening compared with untreated WT and ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes (15–20 cardiomyocytes from 4–5 mice, p&lt;0.01, asterisks). (B–C) Live, isolated ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes display reduced (~20%) surface expression as measured by binding of [3H]-ouabain (n = 3, p&lt;0.01). (D–E) Conscious echocardiograms of wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− mice before and after transverse aortic constriction. Black labels represent wild-type animals, white labels represent ankyrin-B+/− data. Ankyrin-B+/− mice show preserved fractional shortening compared to wild-type mice over a wide range of hemodynamic stress (induced through transverse aortic constriction).
