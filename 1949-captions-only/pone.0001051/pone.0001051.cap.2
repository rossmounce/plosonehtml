Asterisk represents p&lt;0.01 between untreated WT and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> cardiomyocytes (15–20 cardiomyocytes from 4–5 mice). WT and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> cardiomyocytes treated with maximal doses of ouabain (100 µM) display significant elevations in cellular shortening compared with untreated WT and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> cardiomyocytes (15–20 cardiomyocytes from 4–5 mice, p&lt;0.01, asterisks). (B–C) Live, isolated ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> cardiomyocytes display reduced (~20%) surface expression as measured by binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-ouabain (n = 3, p&lt;0.01). (D–E) Conscious echocardiograms of wild-type and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mice before and after transverse aortic constriction. Black labels represent wild-type animals, white labels represent ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> data. Ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mice show preserved fractional shortening compared to wild-type mice over a wide range of hemodynamic stress (induced through transverse aortic constriction).</p>
