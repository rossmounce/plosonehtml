While we observe no major differences in phenotypes at eight weeks, we observe a slight decrease in size and the presence of lordokyphosis in ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mice at six months of age. At two years, unlike wild-type littermates, living ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mice display a significant decrease in adiposity and loss of soft tissues as well as prominent lordokyphosis. D, Dorsal hair regrowth phenotypes in 12 month C57Bl/6 wild-type and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> littermates. We observed no difference in regrowth in 1 or 3 month mice. E, H&amp;E stain of dorsal skin sections from age-matched (24 month) wild-type and ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> littermates. Note the decrease in adipose from the subdermis of ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mouse skin. F, Reduced longevity of ankyrin-B<sup>+/−</sup> mice compared with wild-type littermates.</p>
