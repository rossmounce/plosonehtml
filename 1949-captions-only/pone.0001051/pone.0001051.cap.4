                Figure 4.  Ankyrin-B+/− mice display premature senescence and reduced longevity.Gross phenotypes of wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− mice at (A) eight weeks, (B) six months, and C) two years. While we observe no major differences in phenotypes at eight weeks, we observe a slight decrease in size and the presence of lordokyphosis in ankyrin-B+/− mice at six months of age. At two years, unlike wild-type littermates, living ankyrin-B+/− mice display a significant decrease in adiposity and loss of soft tissues as well as prominent lordokyphosis. D, Dorsal hair regrowth phenotypes in 12 month C57Bl/6 wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− littermates. We observed no difference in regrowth in 1 or 3 month mice. E, H&amp;E stain of dorsal skin sections from age-matched (24 month) wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− littermates. Note the decrease in adipose from the subdermis of ankyrin-B+/− mouse skin. F, Reduced longevity of ankyrin-B+/− mice compared with wild-type littermates.
