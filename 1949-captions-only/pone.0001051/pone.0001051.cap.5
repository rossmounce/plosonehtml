                Figure 5.  Ankyrin-B-haploinsufficiency in multiple cell types.A, Relative 220 kD ankyrin-B expression across mouse tissues. Right panel illustrates expression of 220 kD ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B+/− mouse tissues compared with wild-type littermate tissue (n&gt;3, p&lt;0.05). B, Quantitative immunoblot of 220 kD ankyrin-B expression in wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− mouse pancreas using ankyrin-B Ig. Protein levels were quantified by 125-labeled Protein A (n&gt;3). C–D, Immunolocalization of glucagon (left) and ankyrin-B (right) in the Islet of wild-type mouse pancreas. Note that we observe no immunoreactivity of ankyrin-B in the exocrine pancreas. E, Immunolocalization of somatostatin and ankyrin-B in wild-type islets. We observe no co-expression of ankyrin-B and somatostatin in delta cells. F, Immunolocalization of glucagon and ankyrin-B in wild-type mouse islets. We observe no co-localization of glucagon and ankyrin-B in alpha cells. G, Immunolocalization of glucagon and ankyrin-B in Islets of ankyrin-B+/− mice. Note the significant decrease in ankyrin-B levels.
