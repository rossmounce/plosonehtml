Subjects were recruited for these clinical trials under protocols approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee and enrolled only after obtaining written informed consent. They were aged 19–48 (median = 26) and were all seronegative for HIV, HBV and HCV at screening. Demographic information on the subjects is summarised in <a href="#pone-0001052-t001">Table 1</a>. (The data for the middle column (long-boost interval) derive from the trial published in <a href="#pone.0001052-McShane2">[14]</a>). Routine laboratory haematology and biochemistry were performed prior to vaccination and all values were within normal limits. All subjects enrolled in the trials presented here were negative on an ex-vivo Elispot assay for the two <em>M.tb</em> specific antigens ESAT6 and CFP10.</p>
