                Figure 1.  Behaviors predicted by the 5-variable Selkov model for different parameter values.(a) Glycolytic oscillations in S1 (solid curve) and S2 (dashed curve) for η = 0.15, ν = 0.00345, ε = 10−6, α = 15, K1 = 1500, K3 = 1. (b) Linear growth rate of the unstable modes as a function of the square of the wavenumber, k for η = 1.215, ν = 0.03, ε = 0.0003, α = 15, K1 = 1500, K3 = 1, and d1 = d2 = 0.01. Inset: Evolution of [S1] in the spatially homogeneous case for the same parameter values. (c) Turing space (shadowed domain) as a function of the (dimensionless) input and output rates of ATP (ν) and ADP (η), for the same parameter values as in (b). (d) Predicted value of the wave-length of the most unstable mode at each point in the Turing space of (c).
