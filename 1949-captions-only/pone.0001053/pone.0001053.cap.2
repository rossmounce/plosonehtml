                Figure 2.  Turing pattern obtained with the 5-variable Selkov model in two space dimensions.Stationary pattern in [ATP] achieved after 10 min from an initial condition randomly distributed around the Turing-unstable fixed point. White corresponds to [ATP] = 2.47 mM and black to 1.1 mM. The simulation was done for η = 1.3, ν = 0.0175, ε = 0.0005, α = 15, K1 = 1500, K3 = 1, and d1 = d2 = 0.01.
