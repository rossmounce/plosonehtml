                Figure 1.  Sequence motifs and expression of cnidarian opsin in the nerve net of Hydra magnipallata.(A) Sequence alignment of 4th cytoplasmic loop region of animal opsins used in this study indicating the Lys 296 chromophore binding site (arrowhead) and the G protein-binding tripeptide (asterisks). (B) In situ hybridization with Hm2 cnidops probe. Asterisk denotes the hypostome. Opsin is expressed most strongly in a ring of sensory neurons that surround the mouth. Inset, oral view.
