Trees in (A) 1–3 correspond to possible unrooted topologyies and those in (B) 1–15 represent all possible rooted trees, see <a href="#pone-0001054-t001">Table 1</a>. Orange X indicates that tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin-only dataset. Red X indicates tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin+outgroup dataset. Yellow X indicates that tree implies additional gene duplication/loss events compared to minimum (tree 1 is minimum with 2 duplications 0 losses implied). Grey X indicates tree with cnidops as earliest branching opsin group–a result inferred in parametric bootstrap analyses, which incorrectly grouped cnidops+outgroup opsins because of long branch-attraction (see supplementary <a href="#s4">methods</a>). Cil = ciliary; Rh = rhabdomeric; RG = Go/RGR.</p>
