                Figure 3.  Summary of analyses to determine and root opsin phylogeny.Illustrated is each possible unrooted and rooted hypothesis, assuming monophyly of four major opsin clades. Trees in (A) 1–3 correspond to possible unrooted topologyies and those in (B) 1–15 represent all possible rooted trees, see Table 1. Orange X indicates that tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin-only dataset. Red X indicates tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin+outgroup dataset. Yellow X indicates that tree implies additional gene duplication/loss events compared to minimum (tree 1 is minimum with 2 duplications 0 losses implied). Grey X indicates tree with cnidops as earliest branching opsin group–a result inferred in parametric bootstrap analyses, which incorrectly grouped cnidops+outgroup opsins because of long branch-attraction (see supplementary methods). Cil = ciliary; Rh = rhabdomeric; RG = Go/RGR.
