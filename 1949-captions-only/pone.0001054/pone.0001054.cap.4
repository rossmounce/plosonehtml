(A) Our preferred phylogenetic hypothesis where ciliary opsins are an outgroup to other opsin clades and cnidops is the sister to the rhabdomeric+G<sub>o</sub> clade. This hypothesis minimizes the number of gene duplication and loss events required to explain the evolutionary history of metazoan opsins and is consistent with morphological data <a href="#pone.0001054-Eakin1">[33]</a>. (B and C) Phylogenetic hypotheses in which cnidops represents the outgroup to other opsins. Given our finding of a ciliary opsin in <em>Nematostella</em>, these hypotheses require the additional loss of ciliary opsin in the <em>Hydra</em> lineage and an additional loss of cnidops in bilaterian animals.</p>
