                Figure 4.  Three hypotheses for metazoan opsin relationships.These are statistically indistinguishable when considering only the likelihood of observed amino acid sequences. (A) Our preferred phylogenetic hypothesis where ciliary opsins are an outgroup to other opsin clades and cnidops is the sister to the rhabdomeric+Go clade. This hypothesis minimizes the number of gene duplication and loss events required to explain the evolutionary history of metazoan opsins and is consistent with morphological data [33]. (B and C) Phylogenetic hypotheses in which cnidops represents the outgroup to other opsins. Given our finding of a ciliary opsin in Nematostella, these hypotheses require the additional loss of ciliary opsin in the Hydra lineage and an additional loss of cnidops in bilaterian animals.
