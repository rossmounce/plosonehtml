                Figure 5.  Our preferred hypothesis for opsin phylogeny (figure 4A) reconciled to a conservative view of metazoan phylogeny.Black circles indicate gene duplication events. Tan ovals indicate the opsin complement at key nodes in metazoan phylogeny. By this hypothesis, both ciliary and cnidops opsins were present in the eumetazoan ancestor of Cnidaria+Bilateria while rhabdomeric and Go opsins evolved by gene duplication prior to the evolution of bilaterian animals, but not before.
