Ancestral G protein interactions in phototransduction cascades mediated by ciliary, rhabdomeric and G<sub>o</sub> opsins can be significantly resolved (P&gt;0.95) but the ancestral states of the rhabdomeric+G<sub>o</sub>, and cnidops clades are equivocal. ML state reconstructions shown for each node as colored branches. Red, G<sub>i/t</sub>; Blue, G<sub>q</sub>; Green, G<sub>o</sub>; Black, no G protein interaction (as is the case for RGR/Retinochrome opsins); Grey, equivocal reconstruction from ML. Reconstructed ancestral amino acid motifs of the 4th cytoplasmic loop region of opsin are shown along branches in logos. Maximum vertical height scales to P  = 1.0. We obtained clear reconstructed states for most of the residues in a conserved tripeptide motif (residues 310, 311 and 312, horizontal bar) for the ciliary, rhabdomeric and G<sub>o</sub> /RGR nodes. For the most part, the remainder of the residues in can be unequivocally reconstructed to the level of Dayhoff classes. B = HRK, X = LIVM, J = GATSP, Z = DENQ.</p>
