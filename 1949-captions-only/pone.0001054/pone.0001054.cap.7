                Figure 7.  Summary of co-variation analyses and tests for selection.Previously described G protein binding states, together with amino acid sequences of the 4th cytoplasmic loop regions from our opsin dataset, were used to test the hypothesis that the two character sets co-vary across our opsin phylogeny. Co-variation was assessed using mutual information content (MIC). Shown here is a representation of these results. Predictive P-values (Bottom axis) based on MIC for co-variation between each residue in the 4th cytoplasimic loop and their respective G protein interactions (Right axis) are shown. These analyses were conducted using Bayesian mutational simulation mapping in SIMMAP [64]. We also tested possibility that these residues had evolved under a selective regime using the criterion of site specific rate heterogeneity as implemented in DIVERGE2 [29]. The two highest scoring residues from co-variation analyses (310 and 312) also retain the signature of selection (asterisk). See table S1 for citations. P = predictive P-value, M = the M statistic given by MIC.
