Co-variation was assessed using mutual information content (MIC). Shown here is a representation of these results. Predictive P-values (Bottom axis) based on MIC for co-variation between each residue in the 4<sup>th</sup> cytoplasimic loop and their respective G protein interactions (Right axis) are shown. These analyses were conducted using Bayesian mutational simulation mapping in SIMMAP <a href="#pone.0001054-Bollback1">[64]</a>. We also tested possibility that these residues had evolved under a selective regime using the criterion of site specific rate heterogeneity as implemented in DIVERGE2 <a href="#pone.0001054-Zheng1">[29]</a>. The two highest scoring residues from co-variation analyses (310 and 312) also retain the signature of selection (asterisk). See <a href="#pone.0001054.s001">table S1</a> for citations. <em>P</em> = predictive P-value, <em>M</em> = the M statistic given by MIC.</p>
