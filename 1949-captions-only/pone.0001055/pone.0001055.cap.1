PCR products from the different genomic positions were cloned in appropriate vectors and afterwards, labeled with the <em>aacC3-IV</em> gene (gentamycin cassette). The pTCP (versus pTMP) plasmid carrying homologous GMI1000 fragments were linearized and resulting plasmids were used as donor to transform naturally the wild type strain GM1000 and recombination rate of each position designed. Total genomic DNA from <em>R. solanacearum</em> transformants and carrying <em>aacC3-IV</em> cassette resulting from double crossing-over were used as exogenous DNA donor to “re-transform” the wild type strain GM1000 and the CFBP2968, NCPPB332 and CFBP2957 strains to determine the recombination rate of genomic DNA.
