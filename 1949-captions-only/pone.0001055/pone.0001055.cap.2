The value for the Shimodaira-Hasagawa likelihood ratio test is given for the internal branches (only when <em>P</em>≥0.95). In both cases, the sequence from <em>R. solanacearum</em> is not clustered with the other β-proteobacterial sequences, this with a significant value for the clustering test.</p>
