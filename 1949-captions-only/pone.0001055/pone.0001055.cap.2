                Figure 2.  Two examples of HGT detected on the megaplasmid (a) and on the chromosome (b) through a phylogenetic approach.The two trees have been built respectively with the sequences from the HOGENOM families HBG007143, corresponding to the Proline imminopeptidase (a), and HBG225336, corresponding to the transcriptional regulator of Acetoin catabolism (b). The value for the Shimodaira-Hasagawa likelihood ratio test is given for the internal branches (only when P≥0.95). In both cases, the sequence from R. solanacearum is not clustered with the other β-proteobacterial sequences, this with a significant value for the clustering test.
