Plasmid donors were built following the general experimental design of <a href="#pone-0001055-g001">figure 1</a>. Recombination rate of these different genomic positions (proportional to red line) were measured after natural transformation and based on insertion of the <em>aacC3-IV</em> cassette by double crossing-over.</p>
