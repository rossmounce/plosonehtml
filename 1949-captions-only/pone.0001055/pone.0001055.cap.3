                Figure 3.  Recombination frequency variation between 17 R. solanacearum chromosome and megaplasmid borne DNA positions.Fifteen target positions on the chromosome (TCP) and three on the megaplasmid (TMP) were identified based on gene acquisition and function as described in the text. Plasmid donors were built following the general experimental design of figure 1. Recombination rate of these different genomic positions (proportional to red line) were measured after natural transformation and based on insertion of the aacC3-IV cassette by double crossing-over.
