                Figure 4.  Correlation between recombination frequencies obtained with plasmid DNA and genomic DNA after natural transformation of R. solanacearum GMI1000 as recipient.Donor DNA belongs to the same strain and was either plasmid DNA containing 2 kb long R. solanacearum DNA or genomic DNA from recombinant strains (see the text). The numbers along the curves refer to the DNA position acronym with white and black symbols for chromosome and megaplasmid positions, respectively (TCP2&lt;detection limit, TMP3, not determined). TF, transformation frequency.
