                Figure 5.  Ratio of recombination frequencies after natural transformation of different distantly R. solanacearum strains.Total genomic DNA of GMI1000 strain was used as donor with GMI1000, CFBP2968, NCPPB332 and CFBP2957 as recipient strains. These strains CFBP2968, NCPPB332 and CFBP2957 have respectively 98%, 81% and 69% of the GMI1000 genes conserved in their genomes (TCP2&lt;detection limit). TF, transformation frequency.
