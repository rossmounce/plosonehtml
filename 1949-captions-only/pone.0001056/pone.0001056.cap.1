Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by lysis, and antibody bound to CD18 or to CD11b-integrins displaying the high-affinity epitope was detected by FACS analysis. The cells were gated to identify the neutrophil population, and 10 000 cells were analyzed in each sample. Data are shown as one representative histogram plot (A,B) or as median of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (C,D) from 30 (A,C) and 25 (B,D) experiments per cohort done in triplicate. Mean value is indicated as a black hyphen. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to determine significance between each patient and its individually matched control.</p>
