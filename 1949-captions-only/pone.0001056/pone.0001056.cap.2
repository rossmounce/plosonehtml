The stimulation was stopped by incubation the samples on ice, and contaminating erythrocytes were removed by lysis. Antibody bound to CD18 was detected by FACS analysis. The cells were gated to identify the neutrophil population, and 10 000 cells were counted in each sample. Data are shown as one representative histogram plot (A,B) or as median of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (C,D) from 22 (A,C) and 30 (B,D) experiments per cohort done in triplicate. Mean value is indicated as a black hyphen. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to determine significance between each patient and its individually matched control.</p>
