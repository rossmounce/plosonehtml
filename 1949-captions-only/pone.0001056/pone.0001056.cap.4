Data are expressed as counts per min (cpm) and shown as one representative histogram plot (A,C,E) or as total ROS production peak value from 9–10 experiments per cohort (B,D,F). Mean value is indicated as a black hyphen. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to determine significance between each patient and its individually matched control (** represents significant difference; <em>p</em>&lt;0.01).</p>
