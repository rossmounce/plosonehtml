                Figure 4.  IL-8 and LTB4 induced ROS production in neutrophils from patients with stable CAD.The production of ROS in response to (A–B) IL-8 (100 ng/mL), (C–D) LTB4 (100 nM), or (E–F) PMA (50 nM), was measured in isolated neutrophils from patients (black dashed line and black dot, respectively) and individually matched controls (grey line and grey dot, respectively). Data are expressed as counts per min (cpm) and shown as one representative histogram plot (A,C,E) or as total ROS production peak value from 9–10 experiments per cohort (B,D,F). Mean value is indicated as a black hyphen. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to determine significance between each patient and its individually matched control (** represents significant difference; p&lt;0.01).
