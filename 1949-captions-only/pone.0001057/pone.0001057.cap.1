Panels m–o, non-irradiated cells. DNA was stained with DAPI. Panels a, d, g, j, m &amp; p, γH2AX; panels b, e, h, k &amp; n, HP1α; Panel q, H3K9Me3; panels c, f, I, l, o &amp; r merged images. Overlapping red and green signals appear yellow. The top row shows a group of cells with typical appearance. Individual nuclei are shown magnified in rows 2–6. For the nuclei shown in rows 2–4, line traces were generated (shown on the right) with the line drawn through the brightest HP1α regions. For γH2AX, HP1α and H3K9Me3, images were first adjusted using levels such that fainter interfocal nuclear fluorescence was not included.</p>
