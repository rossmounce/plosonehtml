                Figure 2.  γH2AX foci generated by etoposide treatment do not appear in HP1α-staining regions in MCF7 cells.MCF7 cells were incubated in medium containing etoposide and processed as in Figure 1. Panels a–c, two hour exposure to 5 µM etoposide. Panels d–i, 24 hour exposure to 1 µM etoposide. Panels j–l, untreated cells. Cells were fixed immediately after etoposide treatment.
