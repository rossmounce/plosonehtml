Panels, a &amp; e were obtained from a separate irradiated nucleus processed for nucleolin and γH2AX immunofluorescence. Panel a, DAPI; b, γH2AX; c, HP1α; d, DAPI; e, merged DAPI (blue) and nucleolin (red), γH2AX (green) images; f, γH2AX (green)/DAPI (blue); g, HP1α (red)/DAPI (blue); h, γH2AX/HP1α/DAPI. In panels e–h, the red and green chanels were reduced to binary images, retaining as much detail as possible, before overlaying on the DAPI image. DAPI staining was carried out under optimum conditions to reveal nuclear structure.</p>
