                Figure 4.  Replication stress can induce phosphorylation of histone H2AX in heterochromatin.Panels a–l, subconfluent asynchronous MCF7 cells were exposed to hydroxyurea (2 mM) for one hour immediately prior to fixation and processing for γH2AX (green) and HP1α (red) immunofluorescence. Panels a–c, representative nuclei displaying non-S phase, early to mid S-phase (S-E) and late S-phase (S-L) γH2AX staining respectively. Panels d–f &amp; g–I, single S-L nuclei; j–l, single S-E nucleus. Panels d, g, j, γH2AX; e, h, k, HP1α; f, i, l, merged γH2AX/HP1α images. Line traces are presented on the right. Lines were drawn across the nucleus through heterochromatic (HP1α staining) regions in each case, including the DAPI channel. Panels m–r, subconfluent MCF7 cells were exposed to cisplatin (50 µM) for one hour, 38 hours after release from serum starvation. Cells were fixed immediately after cisplatin treatment and processed for γH2AX immunofluorescence. Panels m &amp; p, γH2AX; n &amp; q, DAPI; o &amp; r merged γH2AX (green)/DAPI (red) images.
