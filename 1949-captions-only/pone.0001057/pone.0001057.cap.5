                Figure 5.  G1 and S-phase H2AX phosphorylation.MCF7 cells were serum starved (0.05% FCS) for 24 hours before release into medium containing 20% FCS. Cells were fixed at different times such that fixed cell populations were predominantly in G1, early S (S-E) or late S-phase (S-L). (6.5 hr, 24 hr and 38 hr respectively). HU or cisplatin were added to the cells, to 2 mM or 50 ÂµM respectively, at the indicated times prior to fixation. Irradiated cells were fixed 30 minutes after irradiation.
