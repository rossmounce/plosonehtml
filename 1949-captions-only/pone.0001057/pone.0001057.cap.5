Cells were fixed at different times such that fixed cell populations were predominantly in G<sub>1</sub>, early S (S-E) or late S-phase (S-L). (6.5 hr, 24 hr and 38 hr respectively). HU or cisplatin were added to the cells, to 2 mM or 50 ÂµM respectively, at the indicated times prior to fixation. Irradiated cells were fixed 30 minutes after irradiation.</p>
