The BMD of the entire femurs and tibias measured by DXA is shown in the graphs below. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 5 WT and 3 Akt1-/- littermates. **P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. (B) Three-dimensional CT images of distal femurs. (C) pQCT images of the distal metaphysis and the mid-diaphysis of the femurs. The color gradient indicating BMD is shown in the right bar. The trabecular content and density at the metaphysis, and the cortical thickness and density at the diaphysis are shown in the graphs below. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 4 mice/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT. (D) Toluidine blue staining of the proximal tibias. Inset boxes indicate the regions of the bottom figures. The growth plate heights were 94.7±2.9 and 95.8±3.8 µm for WT and Akt1-/-, respectively (mean±SEM of 4 mice/group). Bars, 200 µm (top)&amp;30 µm (bottom). (E) Bone formation parameters in histomorphometric analysis at the proximal tibias. MAR, mineral apposition rate; BFR/BS, bone formation rate per bone surface; Ob.S/BS, osteoblast surface per bone surface; TUNEL(+), percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic osteoblasts. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 3–4 mice/group. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. The bottom figures show the representative calcein double labelings; bars, 20 µm.</p>
