An asterisk indicates a nonspecific band detected by an antibody to Akt1. (B) Cell proliferation determined by BrdU uptake into calvarial osteoblasts of two genotypes cultured with and without insulin, IGF-I, or FGF-2. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 6 wells/group. (C) Survival rate of WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts 48 h after serum deprivation in cultures with and without insulin or IGF-I. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 6 wells/group. *P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. (D) The number of TUNEL-positive osteoblasts per field (6×10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>) 24 h after serum deprivation in cultured calvarial osteoblasts. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of 3 wells/group. *P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. Bars, 100 µm. (E) Caspase-3 activity (top graph) and Western blotting for cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (bottom) in WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts adenovirally transfected with GFP, Akt1<sup>CA</sup>, and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> before and 6 h after serum deprivation. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 3 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT. ADU: arbitrary densitometry unit. (F) FoxO3a, FoxO1, FoxO4 and Bad expressions determined by RT-PCR in primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts (OB) and MC3T3-E1 cells (MC). (G) Time course of FoxO3a, FoxO1, and β-actin levels by Western blotting after serum deprivation in the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions of cultured WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts. Closed and open arrowheads indicate phosphorylated and unphosphorylated FoxO3a, respectively. (H) Western blotting for FoxO3a in the cytoplasmic fraction of WT osteoblasts cultured with and without 10% FBS for 30 min. The lysates were treated with and without lambda protein phosphatase (λ-PPase). (I) Time course of FoxO3a and β-actin levels by Western blotting after serum deprivation in the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions of cultured osteoblasts adenovirally transfected with GPF or Akt1<sup>CA</sup>. (J) Survival rate of WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts retrovirally transfected with empty vector (EV) or FoxO3a<sup>DN</sup> 48 h after serum deprivation. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 6 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. Akt1-/- with EV. (K) Caspase-3 activity of WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts retrovirally transfected with EV or FoxO3a<sup>DN</sup> before and 6 h after serum deprivation. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 3 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. Akt1-/- with EV. ADU: arbitrary densitometry unit.</p>
