Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (symbols)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to time 0. (B) Time course of Bim, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and β-actin levels determined by Western blotting after serum deprivation in cultured calvarial osteoblasts. (C) Western blotting for Bim, cleaved caspase-3, and β-actin levels 6 h after serum deprivation in MC3T3-E1 cells retrovirally transfected with three kinds of Bim siRNA or the control GFP siRNA. (D) Bim promoter activity determined by luciferase reporter assay in cultured MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing a 2-Kb Bim 5′-end flanking region. Plasmid vectors of the control GFP, FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 were co-transfected in increasing amounts. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the fold change compared to GFP. (E, F) Bim mRNA level determined by real-time RT-PCR 3 h and 6 h after serum deprivation in MC3T3-E1 cells retrovirally transfected with FoxO3a (E), FoxO3a<sup>DN </sup>(F), or the respective EV. Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to time 0. (G) Bim promoter activity analysis in MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with the control GFP, FoxO3a, and Akt1<sup>CA</sup> plasmid vectors in increasing amounts. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the fold change compared to GFP. (H) Time course of Bim, phosphorylated total Akt (P-Akt), total Akt (Akt), and β-actin levels determined by Western blotting after serum deprivation in cultured calvarial osteoblasts adenovirally transfected with GPF or Akt1<sup>CA</sup>. (I) Bim mRNA level determined by real-time RT-PCR 3 h and 6 h after serum deprivation in cultured WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts retrovirally transfected with EV or FoxO3a<sup>DN</sup>. Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to time 0. *P&lt;0.05 vs. Akt1-/- with EV.</p>
