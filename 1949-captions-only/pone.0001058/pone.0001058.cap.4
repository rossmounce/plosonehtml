Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 4 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT. (B) mRNA levels of type I collagen (COL1A1), ALP, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin, Runx2, and osterix in WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts determined by real-time RT-PCR. Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to WT culture. *P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. (C) ALP and Alizarin red stainings of WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts with and without adenoviral transfection of GFP or Akt1<sup>CA</sup>. (D) ALP, Alizarin red, and von Kossa stainings of MC3T3-E1 cells retrovirally transfected with Runx2 or the empty vector (EV). Runx2 transfectants were retrovirally co-transfected with Akt1<sup>CA</sup> or the control EV, and Akt1 siRNA (siAkt1) or the control (siGFP). The graphs indicate mRNA levels of osteocalcin and Akt1 determined by real-time RT-PCR. Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to the control culture. (E) Osteocalcin promoter activity in retroviral Runx2 transfectants of MC3T3-E1 cells that were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing a 1,050 bp osteocalcin 5′-end flanking region. Plasmid vectors of Akt1<sup>CA</sup>, the negative control EV, and the positive control Cbfb that is a representative co-activator of Runx2, as well as those of siAkt1 and the control EV were co-transfected. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the fold change compared to EV. (F) ChIP assay using cell lysates of WT and Akt1-/- osteoblasts adenovirally transfected with GFP or Runx2. Purified DNA from with (IP) and without (input) immunoprecipitation by an antibody to Runx2 was amplified by PCR using a primer set in the mouse osteocalcin promoter region (−471/−67).</p>
