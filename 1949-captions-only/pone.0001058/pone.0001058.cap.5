Bars, 100 µm. (B) Bone resorption parameters in histomorphometric analysis at the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibias. N.Oc/B. Pm, number of osteoclasts per 100 mm of bone perimeter; Oc.S/BS, osteoclast surface per bone surface; ES/BS, eroded surface per bone surface. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 3–4 mice/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT (+/+). (C) The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts formed in the coculture of osteoblasts (OB) and bone marrow cells (BM) from WT or Akt1-/- littermates. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 4 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT. Bars, 500 µm. (D) The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts formed from BMM cultured in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. Data are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) for 4 wells/group. *P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. Bars, 200 µm. (E) Time course of survival rate of mature osteoclasts after deprivation of RANKL and M-CSF. Mature osteoclasts were formed from BMM in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. Data are expressed as means (symbols)±SEM (error bars) for 4 wells/group. *P&lt;0.05 vs. WT. (F) mRNA levels of RANKL, osteoprotegerin, and M-CSF in cultured osteoblasts by real-time RT-PCR. Data are normalized to those of β-actin and are expressed as means (bars)±SEM (error bars) of the relative amount compared to the WT culture. *P&lt;0.01 vs. WT. (G) Schematic diagram of the mechanisms underlying the Akt1 function to maintain bone mass and turnover. Akt1 suppresses the susceptibility to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of osteoblasts by inhibiting the FoxO3a nuclear entry and the Bim transactivation, and stimulates the differentiation and function by enhancing the Runx2 transcriptional activity, resulting in increased bone formation. Akt1 also induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts to support osteoclast differentiation, and shows cell-autonomous defects in osteoclasts to stimulate the differentiation and survival, resulting in increased bone resorption.</p>
