                Figure 1.  Head diagram of the EEG sensor positions and labeling.The diagram shows the correspondence between the high-density 129-channel Sensor Net (EGI, Inc.) and the International 10–10 System. The Sensor Net locations that match the positions of International 10–10 system are labeled. The 10–10 System names are followed by the numbers of the Sensor Net. The sensors corresponding to the 10–20 System (presented in all the maps hereafter) are in bold. The gray background highlights all the sensors included in the analyses. The sensor locations encircled in green exemplify the first and second neighborhoods for the sensor encircled in brown (sensor 73), i.e., the territory considered in the calculation of a single value of S-estimator.
