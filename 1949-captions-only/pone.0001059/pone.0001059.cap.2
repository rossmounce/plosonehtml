                Figure 2.  Whole-head S-estimator maps for SZ patients and normal controls.Group-averaged maps for the broad-band resting EEG (1â€“70 Hz) are shown for patients (A) and controls (B). C: Difference map, Patients vs. Controls. Here and hereafter the clusters of sensors with S-estimator significantly higher or lower in patients than in controls are in red or blue, respectively. There are no significant differences in the gray regions.
