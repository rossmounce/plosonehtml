C: Difference map between the first EEG vs. second EEG of patients. The regions where the S-estimator in the patients' first EEG was significantly higher or lower than that in the second EEG are in red or in blue, respectively. There are no significant differences in the gray regions. D: Map of the likelihood that the synchronization estimations from the first and second EEG can be considered stationary according to <em>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</em> test. The color is inversely related to the probability: the lighter, the more probable.</p>
