                Figure 6.  Whole-head power maps for SZ patients and normal controls.The group-averaged maps of absolute power for the broad-band resting EEG are shown for patients (A) and for controls (B). C: Difference map (Patients vs. Controls). In the blue regions the absolute power in patients is significantly lower than that in controls. There are no significant differences in the gray regions.
