                Figure 1.  Stimulus presentation.The control screen was an isoluminant grey screen presented for 15 seconds to determine whether subjects could trace their scotoma boundary against a regular background. The adaptation phase was a dynamic field of random greyscale noise presented at 60Hz for 15 seconds. The test phase was a further isoluminant grey screen presented for 15 seconds. Subjects were asked to mark the boundary of any illusory area by means of a touchscreen mounted to the monitor. A red cross of arm length 1Â° was present throughout to guide fixation for the drawing phase. Adaptation and test phase were repeated to a total of five times.
