The <em>adaptation phase</em> was a dynamic field of random greyscale noise presented at 60Hz for 15 seconds. The <em>test phase</em> was a further isoluminant grey screen presented for 15 seconds. Subjects were asked to mark the boundary of any illusory area by means of a touchscreen mounted to the monitor. A red cross of arm length 1Â° was present throughout to guide fixation for the drawing phase. Adaptation and test phase were repeated to a total of five times.</p>
