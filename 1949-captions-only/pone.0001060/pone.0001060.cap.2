                Figure 2.  Scotomas identified by the dynamic after effect.Red line represents mean scotoma boundary; grey region indicates 95% confidence interval of estimate. White line represents boundary of dense scotoma identified from microperimetry assessment (except subject TK where scotoma is larger than the area measured using microperimetry, and GW and MK where only the upper boundary of the scotoma could be identified). Where present, white cross indicates centre of fixation. EP, PF: microperimetry performed using Rodenstock SLO-101 scanning laser ophthalmoscope. TK, SP, GW, MK: microperimetry performed using Nidek MP-1 microperimeter.
