                Figure 3.  Transferred after image for subject MK.Red line indicates mean scotoma boundary assessed using dynamic after effect. Subject observed the adapting pattern with his left eye which has a dense central scotoma (figure 1) whilst covering the right eye. On a given signal MK moved his hand from his right to his left eye and observed the isoluminant screen. No dense scotoma was identified using microperimetry in the right eye but paracentral areas of relative scotoma were present.
