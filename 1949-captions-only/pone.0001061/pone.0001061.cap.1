                Figure 1.  Strategy to compare E2F4 bound and E2F4 dependent gene expression in mouse and human.(A) Transcription factor binding was identified in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with proximal promoter arrays in three human tissues, a human cell line, seven mouse tissues, and a mouse cell line. (B) Gene expression in the liver, kidney, and testes of littermate mice lacking one or two copies of E2f4 were compared in replicate, and genes specifically perturbed in the adult identified in all three tissues. (C) Analysis approaches identified the genes bound in common among all human and all mouse tissues, those shared between species, and whether any genes were both bound by E2f4 in mouse adult liver, kidney, or testes, and whose expression were altered by removal of E2f4.
