Fractions and shading are calculated relative to the tissue with the fewest bound genes. The total number of binding targets for each tissue is shown in white boxes. (B) Similar plot for the overlap of mouse genes bound by E2f4 in liver, spleen, kidney, brain, testes, pancreatic islets, pancreatic acinar, and Min6. (C) Overlap between the mouse and human genes bound in common in all mouse and human tissues where homologs exist between the species. Consistent with previous results <a href="#pone.0001061-Odom1">[23]</a>, the overlap is approximately 20%. (D) The genes bound by E2F4 in both mouse and human are substantially enriched in genes accounting for E2F4 function.</p>
