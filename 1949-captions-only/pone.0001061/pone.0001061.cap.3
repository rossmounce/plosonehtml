                Figure 3.  Gene expression changes upon germline removal of E2f4 transcription factor binding in mouse liver, kidney, and testes are minimal, and poorly overlap the genes bound in mice containing E2f4.(A) The complete list of genes that were differentially expressed when E2f4 was removed where the proximal promoter of these transcripts was present on the mouse promoter array. Genes were sorted by confidence in kidney, liver, and testes, sequentially, and the binding data then obtained separately. Most gene expression changes were tissue-specific, and very few of these genes showed in vivo E2f4 binding. (B) The complete list of genes bound by E2f4 in kidney, liver, and testes, clustered by transcription factor binding in each tissue sequentially. The transcripts of almost no genes bound in vivo were perturbed in the adult E2f4 null mice.
