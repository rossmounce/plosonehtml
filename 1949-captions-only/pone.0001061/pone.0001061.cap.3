Genes were sorted by confidence in kidney, liver, and testes, sequentially, and the binding data then obtained separately. Most gene expression changes were tissue-specific, and very few of these genes showed in vivo E2f4 binding. (B) The complete list of genes bound by E2f4 in kidney, liver, and testes, clustered by transcription factor binding in each tissue sequentially. The transcripts of almost no genes bound in vivo were perturbed in the adult <em>E2f4</em> null mice.</p>
