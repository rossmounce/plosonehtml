                Figure 1.  The original protocol developed in our study allows recovering the dental pulp and minimizes the risk of laboratory-acquired contamination of the specimen.The tooth was encasted into sterile resin (1a) ; the apex was sterily sectioned (1b) to give access to the canal system (1c) ; solutions were injected (1d) ; after incubation, the tooth was put upside down into sterile tube (1e) and centrifuged (1f).
