                Figure 2.  Amplification of a 286-bp 16S rDNA fragment in human dental pulp incorporting an original protocol for the decontamination of PCR reagents.Lanes 1 and 8 feature molecular weight marker VI (molecular weight marker sizes in base-pairs are indicated in the left margin); lanes 4 and 5, negative controls; lanes 2, 3, 6 and 7, positive controls (C. burnetii DNA). Figure 2a, ineffective PCR reagent decontamination by using restriction enzymes alone. Figure 2b, effective PCR reagent decontamination by filtration followed by restriction enzyme digestion.
