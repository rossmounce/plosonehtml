                Figure 3.  Decontamination of experimentally infected teeth.Figure 3a, 16S rDNA partial amplification in 10 teeth exhibiting positive result in all teeth without decontamination: Lanes 1 and 12 feature molecular weight marker VI (molecular weight marker sizes in base-pairs are indicated in the left margin); lanes 2–11, teeth amplification. Figure 3b, 16S rDNA partial amplification in 10 teeth exhibiting negative result in all teeth with decontamination. Lanes 1 and 17 feature molecular weight marker VI (molecular weight marker sizes in base-pairs are indicated in the left margin); lanes 1,2,3,15 and 16, negative controls; lanes 4–14, teeth amplification.
