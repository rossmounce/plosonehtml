                Figure 1.  Panels A–D show the % parasitemia for individual monkeys by vaccine group according to the day after sporozoite challenge for Experiment #1.Data shows the first day parasites were detected and continues until the animal was drug treated when parasitemia exceeded 1% ( 3 animals inadvertently treated at lower parasitemias have open symbols). For comparison, in each panel the grey line shows the mean parasitemia for the Control group. In panel C, one animal never became parasitemic as indicated by x-x. Panel E shows the geometric mean parasitemias for vaccine groups for all days in which at least three animals had not been drug treated. (The monkey from the DNA Pk4×3/COPAK group which did not become infected was excluded from the average).
