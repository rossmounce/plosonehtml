For comparison, in each panel the grey line shows the mean parasitemia for the Control group. In panel C, one animal never became parasitemic as indicated by x-x. Panel E shows the geometric mean parasitemias for vaccine groups for all days in which at least three animals had not been drug treated. (The monkey from the DNA Pk4×3/COPAK group which did not become infected was excluded from the average).</p>
