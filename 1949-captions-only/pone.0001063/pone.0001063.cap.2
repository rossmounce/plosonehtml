Priming with DNA on PLG gave a stronger interferon-γ response than DNA in PBS but this was not significant (p = 0.58). Panel B. Geometric mean antibody titers by ELISA at time of sporozoite challenge for each of the four malaria vaccine antigens. Priming with 3 doses of DNA gave higher antibody levels than did a single DNA priming dose for PkCSP, PkMSP1 and PkAMA1 antigens (p&lt;0.05). Priming with 3 doses of DNA in PBS produced higher serum antibody titers than did priming with 3 doses of DNA on PLG for PkCSP, PkSSP2, and PkAMA1 antigens (p&lt;0.05).</p>
