After the third DNA vaccination monkeys receiving both PkCSP and PkSSP2 immunizations had significantly lower responses to PkCSP than did animals receiving only PkCSP DNA (p = 0.04). After the COPAK boost, monkeys primed with low dose PkCSP 0.5 mg DNA had the highest response interferon-γ response (p = 0.08 vs high dose PkCSP, p = 0.04 vs Pk4 vaccine, p = 0.04 vs PkCSP+PkSSP2). Panel B shows IgG responses at the three time points. After three DNA vaccinations, serum titers were highest in the high dose DNA PkCSP 5.0 mg group (p = 0.01). After boosting with recombinant COPAK virus, monkeys primed with the high dose DNA had the highest serum IgG titers but this was not significantly different from the other vaccine groups.</p>
