                Figure 5.  Panels A–C show the % parasitemias for individual monkeys by vaccine group according to the day after sporozoite challenge for Experiment #3.Data shows the first day parasites were detected and continues until the animal was treated with anti-malaria drugs. For comparison, in each panel the grey line shows the mean parasitemia for the Control group. Panel D shows the geometric mean parasitemias for all the vaccine groups for all days in which at least three animals had not been drug treated. For each day 8–11 the mean parasitemia for the group receiving the booster dose at the 21 week interval was lower than the other groups (p&lt;0.05, Student's T test).
