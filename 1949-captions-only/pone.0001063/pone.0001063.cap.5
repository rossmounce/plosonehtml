For comparison, in each panel the grey line shows the mean parasitemia for the Control group. Panel D shows the geometric mean parasitemias for all the vaccine groups for all days in which at least three animals had not been drug treated. For each day 8–11 the mean parasitemia for the group receiving the booster dose at the 21 week interval was lower than the other groups (p&lt;0.05, Student's T test).</p>
