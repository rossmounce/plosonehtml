Data from Control animals are not included. Panel A shows PkCSP endpoint ELISA titers where there is no significant correlation. Panel B shows PkCSP interferon-Î³ ELIspot titers with a linear regression line included. There is a significant negative correlation (p = 0.04), animals with lower ELIspot responses having longer times to the appearance of first parasite in the blood.</p>
