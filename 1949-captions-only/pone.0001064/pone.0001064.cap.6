<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5"></a><p>Fifteen regulated genes belong to the function class <em>amino acid metabolism</em> (AA). Seven showed increased and eight showed decreased transcript levels during phototrophic growth. Four of these genes are of particular interest: <em>carA</em>, <em>carB</em>, <em>arcB</em>, and <em>arcC</em>. The induced genes <em>carA</em> and <em>carB</em> encode a carbamoylphosphate (Carb-P) synthase, whereas the repressed genes <em>arcB</em> and <em>arcC</em> encode proteins of the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. CarA/B synthesize Carb-P by consumption of 2 ATP. The purpose of the ADI pathway is to hydrolyze Carb-P for generation of 1 ATP. Obviously, contrary regulation of the two gene clusters makes sense. Because ATP is plenty in light, additional ATP generating reactions can be shut down. Synthesis of Carb-P, however, facilitates nucleotide synthesis, which in turn may enhance cell growth. Interestingly, the gene <em>pyrI</em>, encoding a subunit of the aspartate carbamoyltransferase, was also found to be induced in our study. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Carb-P to carbamoylaspartate, the first step in pyrimidine synthesis.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p6"></a><p>Furthermore, we found several genes involved in the energy metabolism of <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> to be regulated. Among them <em>nuoC</em>, <em>nuoD</em>, <em>nuoK</em>, <em>petB</em>, and <em>dmsB</em> showed increased mRNA levels under phototrophic growth conditions. NuoC, D, and K are subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase. PetB is part of the cytochrome bc complex. DmsB is a chain of the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase, which utilizes DMSO as alternative terminal electron acceptor <a href="#pone.0001064-Muller1">[19]</a>. In contrast, <em>cydA1</em>, a subunit of one of the three terminal oxidases, was found to be repressed under phototrophic conditions. The genes <em>korA, korB</em>, and <em>acn</em> encode enzymes that are involved in the TCA cycle. The transcription of these genes was found to be induced under anaerobic conditions. KorA and KorB constitute the 4Fe-4S protein Î±-ketoglutarate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which enables an organism to assimilate CO<sub>2</sub> by a reductive TCA cycle. Acn is the aconitate hydratase that catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p7"></a><p>Its chemotactic apparatus enables <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> to move through its aquatic habitat in order to keep itself at favorable conditions. This very important feature is controlled by a set of 18 sensor proteins, the so-called halobacterial transducers (Htrs), and the bacterial-like CheAY-system <a href="#pone.0001064-Rudolph1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001064-Ng1">[21]</a>. Under phototrophic conditions we found a repression of 4 Htr encoding genes, i.e. <em>htrI</em>, <em>htrVIII</em>, <em>basT</em>, and <em>htr18</em>. HtrI is involved in phototaxis dependent on orange and UV light, HtrVIII is responsible for aerotaxis, and BasT enables <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> to sense the presence of the amino acids Leu, Ile, Val, Met, and Cys <a href="#pone.0001064-Yao1">[22]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001064-Brooun1">[23]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001064-Kokoeva1">[24]</a>. Finally, for HtrVIII no functional data exist. At least the repression of HtrI and HtrVIII can be easily explained. Typical for phototrophic conditions are strong light intensity and lack of oxygen. These circumstances obviously eliminate the need for high numbers of light sensors and for the presence of oxygen sensors. Additionally to the chemotaxis system, gas vesicles can provide a unidirectional movement of cells, i.e. floating to the surface of a water body. Interestingly, <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> induced as well as repressed the expression of gas vesicle genes. The genes <em>gvpL1</em>, <em>gvpK1</em>, and <em>gvpI1</em> on plasmid pHs1 were induced under phototrophic conditions, whereas <em>gvpI2</em> and <em>gvpC2</em> on the chromosome were repressed. However, the interpretation of that phenotype is not trivial, since gas vesicle formation in <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> R1 is generally impaired by a transposon element in front of the plasmid-borne <em>gvp</em> operon <a href="#pone.0001064-Stoeckenius1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001064-DasSarma1">[26]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p8"></a><p>Four genes of the function class <em>transport</em> (TP) were induced and 8 genes were repressed under phototrophic conditions. Most of them encode ABC transport proteins such as permeases, substrate-, and ATP-binding proteins. Basically, the action of ABC transporters should be aided by the abundance of ATP in light. The induction of 4 genes may be explained by the need for the substrates, which are imported by these ABC transporters. Accordingly, repression of 8 transport genes may point to the fact that these are specific to substrates, which are not necessary for phototrophic growth. The general problem with the interpretation of transport protein regulation is that the substrate specificity is not accessible via homology search.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p9"></a><p>Finally, 11 transposases (function class ISH) showed increased transcript levels under phototrophic conditions. The proteins belong to the COGs 0675, 1943, and 3385. We can just speculate about the reason for the activation of these mobile elements. It might reflect a certain flexibility of the genome. Generally, <em>Hbt. salinarum</em> seems to be very sensitive to environmental changes, because e.g. even a simple freeze-thaw cycle induces mutations that result in phenotypic differences (D Oesterhelt, unpublished observation).</p>


<h4>Validation of transcriptional regulations via quantitative RT-PCR</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Due to the small regulation levels it was essential to validate the transcriptional differences found in the DNA microarray experiment by an independent method. For that we chose a quantitative two-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In the first step total RNA was unspecifically transcribed into cDNA by using random hexamer primers. In a second step quantitative real-time PCR was applied using the gene-specific primers shown in <a href="#pone-0001064-t001">Table 1</a>. For that, 6 of the 10 RNA samples (3 of 5 from each growth condition) used for the DNA microarray experiment were applied to RT-PCR. In order to get an overview of the reliability of the microarray data we performed RT-PCRs of 17 genes. Ten of which having statistical ranks from 4 to 221 and, hence, belong to the group of significantly regulated genes. The other 7 genes are distributed over the range of statistically insignificant genes (having statistical ranks from 332 to 2411).</p>
