The assumed tree topology ((<em>m, s</em>), ((<em>t, y</em>), (<em>e, o</em>))) is based on <a href="#pone.0001065-Ko2">[60]</a>. Silent distances were calculated using CODEML <a href="#pone.0001065-Yang1">[63]</a> and averaged across 22 genes. (ML) unrooted tree showing maximum likelihood distances under a codon-based substitution model. Equilibrium frequencies of each codon were calculated from the nucleotides frequencies at three codon positions (F3x4). (NG) unrooted neighbor-joining tree based on Nei-Gojobori <a href="#pone.0001065-Nei1">[64]</a> pairwise distances. Numbers shown on each branch are per site synonymous distances x1000. (1x) topology employed in 1x simulations. Mutation rates and numbers of generations per branch were set to give expected <em>per</em> site silent divergence of 0.05 for the <em>m, s, t, y, e, o, ty</em>, and <em>eo</em> lineages and 0.075 and 0.025 for the <em>ms</em> and <em>tyeo</em> lineages, respectively, for equilibrium MCU = 0.7. Abbreviations for ancestral nodes are shown below and to the right of the nodes.</p>
