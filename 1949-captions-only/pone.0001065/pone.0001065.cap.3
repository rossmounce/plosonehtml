                Figure 3.  Inference of pu and up substitutions on the m lineage under equilibrium codon bias evolution.The numbers of hits and the ratios of inferred to actual hits reflect averages across 300 replicates of the 1x equilibrium scenario. X-axis scales apply to graphs in the same column. The legend in A applies to B and E and the legend in C applies to D. Reliability of dup,pu inference was greater for ML than for MP for MCUâ‰¥0.6 (see text for criteria).
