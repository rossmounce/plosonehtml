                Figure 5.  Reliability of ancestral codon bias inference under equilibrium evolution.A, B, and C show ratios of inferred to actual values and the dup,pu for the 0.5× tree (averages among 500 replicates) and D, E, and F show values for the 2× tree (averages among 200 replicates). Actual and inferred numbers of hits are not shown. The legend in A applies to B, D, and E and the legend in C applies to F. X-axis scales are identical for graphs in the same column.
