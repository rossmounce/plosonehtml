                Figure 6.  Reliability of ML inference for evolution under the GCpref codon and HKY85 models.dup,pu values are shown for 4-fold synonymous codons for ML inference under the equilibrium GCpref codon model and for data simulated under the HKY85 substitution matrix. The latter matrix was set to give identical expected numbers of substitutions and equilibrium GC content for the two scenarios. The legend applies to both graphs and the y-axis scales are identical in the two graphs. Note that dup,pu inference biases are larger for 4-fold redundant codons than for 2-fold redundant codons under the GCpref codon model. Data are averaged across 300 replicates.
