The latter matrix was set to give identical expected numbers of substitutions and equilibrium GC content for the two scenarios. The legend applies to both graphs and the y-axis scales are identical in the two graphs. Note that <em>d</em><sub>up,pu</sub> inference biases are larger for 4-fold redundant codons than for 2-fold redundant codons under the GCpref codon model. Data are averaged across 300 replicates.</p>
