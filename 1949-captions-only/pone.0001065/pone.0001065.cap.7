                Figure 7.  Reliability of ancestral codon bias inference under non-equilibrium evolution: variable selection intensity.The legend in A applies to B, D, and E. The legend in C also applies to F. X-axis scales are identical for graphs in the same column. Note that the MCU values reflect values at the m node and differ from ancestral values. For the 1/3Ne scenario, reliability of dup,pu inference was greater for ML than for MP for 0.6≤MCU≤0.8. For 2Ne, ML was more reliable for MCU≥0.8 (see text for criteria). Data are averaged across 300 replicates.
