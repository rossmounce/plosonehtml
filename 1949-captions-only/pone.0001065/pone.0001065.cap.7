The legend in C also applies to F. X-axis scales are identical for graphs in the same column. Note that the MCU values reflect values at the <em>m</em> node and differ from ancestral values. For the 1/3<em>N</em><sub>e</sub> scenario, reliability of <em>d</em><sub>up,pu</sub> inference was greater for ML than for MP for 0.6≤MCU≤0.8. For 2<em>N</em><sub>e</sub>, ML was more reliable for MCU≥0.8 (see text for criteria). Data are averaged across 300 replicates.</p>
