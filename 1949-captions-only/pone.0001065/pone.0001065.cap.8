                Figure 8.  Reliability of ancestral codon bias inference under non-equilibrium evolution: variable mutation.The legend in A applies to B, D, and E. The legend in C applies to F. X-axis scales are identical for graphs in the same column. Note that MCU values are given for the m node and have shifted from ancestral values. For the 2u/v scenario, reliability of dup,pu inference was greater for ML than for MP for MCU≥0.8, but MP was more reliable for MCU≤0.6. For 0.5u/v, dup,pu was more reliably inferred by ML than by MP for MCU≥0.7, but MP was more reliable for MCU = 0.5. Data are averaged across 300 replicates.
