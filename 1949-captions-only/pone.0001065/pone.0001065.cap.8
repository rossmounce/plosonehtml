The legend in C applies to F. X-axis scales are identical for graphs in the same column. Note that MCU values are given for the <em>m</em> node and have shifted from ancestral values. For the 2<em>u/v</em> scenario, reliability of <em>d</em><sub>up,pu</sub> inference was greater for ML than for MP for MCU≥0.8, but MP was more reliable for MCU≤0.6. For 0.5<em>u/v</em>, <em>d</em><sub>up,pu</sub> was more reliably inferred by ML than by MP for MCU≥0.7, but MP was more reliable for MCU = 0.5. Data are averaged across 300 replicates.</p>
