                Figure 9.  Reliability of ML codon bias inference under lineage-specific non-stationarity.Differences between inferred and actual dup,pu values are plotted as a function of MCU for each lineage (averages across 300 simulations are plotted). The legend applies to all graphs. X-axis scales apply to all graphs in the same column. Y-axis scales are identical among all graphs. The lineage-specific scenarios are as follows: stationary MCU (st) in &lt;l&gt;s and e, decreasing MCU (1/3Ne) in m, y, o, and eo, and increasing MCU (2Ne) in t and ty. Scenarios were varied in the ancestral ms and tyeo lineages. For the ms lineage: black (st), red (1/3Ne), blue (2Ne). For the tyeo lineage: thick (st), thin (1/3Ne), dotted (2Ne).
