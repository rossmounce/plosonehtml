                Figure 1.  Colo-205 cells treated with Hsp90 inhibitors exhibit increased mitochondrial mass and apoptotic cell death.(A) Apoptosis measured by Annexin V/ PI staining at 72 h of herbimycin A treatment (0.5 µM). B) Mitochondrial mass assessed by NAO staining for (B) 17-AAG (0.4 µM, 24 h), (C) HA (0.5 µM, 48 h), (D) radicicol (1.5 µM, 72 h). Control (filled) vs. treated (empty) histograms.
