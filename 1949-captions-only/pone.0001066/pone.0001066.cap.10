Recovery of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins OSCP and COX II in OMM fraction in cells treated with hsp90 and proteasome inhibitors.Western blots of whole mitochondria (WM), digitonin-extracted OMM and mitoplast (MP) fractions from COLO 205 cells treated with HA (0.5 µM, 48 h) and MG132 (0.5 µM, 24 h). (B) Immunoprecipitable [35S]-pulse-labeled mitochondrial OSCP after trypsin treatment of mitochondria, representative of two experiments.
