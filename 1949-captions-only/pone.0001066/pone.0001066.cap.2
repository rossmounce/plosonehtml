Ultrathin sections from HA-treated COLO 205 cells (0.5 µM, 48 h) with no protease treatment (C) and after pronase digestion (D). Arrows indicate mitochondrial profiles. (E) Protein quantitation in mitochondrial fractions from 10<sup>6</sup> COLO 205 cells treated with HA (0.5 µM) or radicicol (1.5 µM), normalized to untreated cells; average of three experiments, standard error, <sup>#</sup> <em>P</em> = 0.079, * <em>P</em>&lt;0.05, ** <em>P</em>&lt;0.005 for comparison to untreated cells.
