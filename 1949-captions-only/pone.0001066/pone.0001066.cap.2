                Figure 2.  Mitochondrial protein accumulation with hsp90 inhibition.Transmission electron micrographs of control (A) and treated (B) COLO 205 cells (HA, 0.5 µM, 48 h) demonstrating increased number of mitochondrial profiles with dense matrix substance. Ultrathin sections from HA-treated COLO 205 cells (0.5 µM, 48 h) with no protease treatment (C) and after pronase digestion (D). Arrows indicate mitochondrial profiles. (E) Protein quantitation in mitochondrial fractions from 106 COLO 205 cells treated with HA (0.5 µM) or radicicol (1.5 µM), normalized to untreated cells; average of three experiments, standard error, # P = 0.079, * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.005 for comparison to untreated cells. (F) Mitochondrial protein/106 cells normalized to average total area of mitochondrial profiles/cell for control and HA-treated (0.5 µM, 48 h) COLO 205 cells. (P&lt;0.05).
