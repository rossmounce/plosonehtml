COLO-205 cells treated with HA (0.5 µM) (A) or 17-AAG (0.4 µM ) (B). (C) 143B cells treated with HA (0.5 µM). PCNA, GAPDH and α-tubulin were used as loading controls. For each panel, proteins above the line are upregulated with hsp90 inhibitor treatment, and proteins below the line have stable expression.</p>
