                Figure 4.  Hsp90 inhibitors affect mitochondrial protein expression at a post-transcriptional level.(A) Northern blots of mtDNA gene COI and nuclear genes COX4, ATP5A, and ATP5O in COLO 205 cells treated with HA (0.5 ÂµM). 18S rRNA was used as loading control. (B) Quantitation of Northern blots by densitometry normalized to 18S rRNA levels. (C) Southern blot hybridized with mtDNA (CytB and ND2) and nuclear DNA gene (ATP5C) probes.
