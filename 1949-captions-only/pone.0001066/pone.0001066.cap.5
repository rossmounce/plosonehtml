                Figure 5.  Hsp90 inhibition increases mitochondrial protein stability.(A) Immunoprecipitation of pulse-chase [35S]-labeled OSCP subunit from control and HA (0.5 µM) treated cells. HA was added to cells at the time of pulse labeling. Total OSCP protein is demonstrated by Western blotting in lower panel. (B) Densitometry of the OSCP autoradiography signal is graphed. (C) Mitochondrial localization of hsp90 in COLO 205 cells and response to HA (0.5 µM) and MG132 (0.5 µM) treatment for 48 h. Mitochondrial VDAC expression increases with both treatments.
