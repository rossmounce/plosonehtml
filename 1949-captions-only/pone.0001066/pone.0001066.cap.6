                Figure 6.  Proteasome inhibition results in increased mitochondrial mass and matrix condensation.Transmission electron micrograph of (A) control and (B) MG132-treated COLO 205 cells (0.5 µM MG132, 24 h). (C) Flow cytometric assay of mitochondrial mass by NAO staining. COLO 205 cells treated with MG132 (0.5 µM). Control (filled) vs treated (empty) histograms.
