                Figure 7.  Mitochondrial protein expression in COLO 205 cells treated with Hsp90, proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.(A,B) Western blots of cell lysates after treatment with indicated inhibitors for 24 h. Inhibitor concentrations: 17-AAG (0.2, 0.4 µM), MG132 (0.25, 0.5 µM), MG262 (0.05, 0.1 µM), monensin (0.25, 0.5 µM), chloroquine (25, 50 µM), 3-MA (5 mM). Extracts from 2–4×104 cells were loaded per lane.
