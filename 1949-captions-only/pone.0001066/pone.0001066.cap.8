                Figure 8.  Mitochondria of COLO 205 cells contain ubiquitinated proteins.Anti-ubiquitin Western blots: (A) iodixanol gradient-purified mitochondria from control, HA- (0.5 µM, 48 h), and MG132-treated cells (0.5 µM, 24 h). VDAC signal is shown for loading control. (B) mitochondria after incubation with trypsin (5–30 min) or 0.1 M Na2CO3. TX-Triton X-100 (1%); P-pellet, S-supernatant, control blots of OMM-associated protein (hexokinase II); (C) OMM and mitoplast mitochondrial fractions after digitonin extraction. (D) Western blots of immunoprecipitated OSCP from COLO 205 cell extracts-control (C) and 48 h HA (0.5 µM) treatment.
