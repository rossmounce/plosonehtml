                Figure 1.  K13 blocks lytic replication in BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells.A. Expression of K13-ERTAM in BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells as determined by immunoblotting with a Flag antibody. Bâ€“C. Treatment with 4OHT induces nuclear translocation (B) and DNA-binding (C) of p65 in BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells expressing K13-ERTAM but is without effect in the control cells. Nuclear translocation was measured by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using a p65/RelA primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). D. Inhibition of TPA-induced K8.1 and ORF59 expression by K13. BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells expressing an empty vector and K13-ERTAM, respectively, were left untreated or pretreated with 4OHT for 18 h and then induced with TPA for 96 h. K8.1 and ORF59 expression was detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the indicated antibodies and revealed by Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Cells were imaged with an Olympus Fluorescent microscope equipped with a SPOT camera. A representative of two independent experiments is shown.
