The experiments were performed essentially as described for <a href="#pone-0001067-g001">Figure 1D</a> with the exception that RTA expression was induced by treatment with doxycycline (10 ng/ml). A representative of two independent experiments is shown. B. Flow cytometry analysis showing inhibition of RTA-induced K8.1 expression by 4OHT pretreatment in K13-ER<sup>TAM</sup> cells. C. Equivalent induction of RTA upon doxycycline treatment in the vector- and K13-ER<sup>TAM</sup> -expressing BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells in the absence or presence of prior treatment with 4OHT. Cells were treated with the indicated doses of doxycycline for 72 h prior to immunoblotting. D. K13 blocks RTA/doxycycline-induced production of infectious virions. 293PAN-Luc cells were infected in triplicate in a 24 well plate with 200 µl of cell-free supernatant collected from cells described in 2A. 72 h post-infection, luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. The values (Mean±SEM) shown are from a representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. E. A semi-quantitative PCR assay showing inhibition of RTA/doxycycline-induced production of infectious virions by K13 in the cellular supernatants collected in 2D.</p>
