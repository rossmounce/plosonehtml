Status of the NF-κB pathway in BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells expressing wild-type K13 and its NF-κB-defective mutants, K13-58AAA and K13-67AAA, respectively, as measured by an ELISA-based DNA-binding assay. B. Wild-type K13 blocks doxycycline-induced K8.1 and ORF59 expression, while the NF-κB-defective mutants fail to do so. Cells were treated with doxycycline (10 ng/ml) and immunofluorescence analysis performed as described for <a href="#pone-0001067-g001">Figure 1D</a>.</p>
