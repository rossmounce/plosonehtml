                Figure 3.  Role of the NF-κB pathway in the inhibition of KSHV lytic reactivation by K13. A. Status of the NF-κB pathway in BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells expressing wild-type K13 and its NF-κB-defective mutants, K13-58AAA and K13-67AAA, respectively, as measured by an ELISA-based DNA-binding assay. B. Wild-type K13 blocks doxycycline-induced K8.1 and ORF59 expression, while the NF-κB-defective mutants fail to do so. Cells were treated with doxycycline (10 ng/ml) and immunofluorescence analysis performed as described for Figure 1D.
