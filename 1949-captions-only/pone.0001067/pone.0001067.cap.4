                Figure 4.  Down-regulation of K13 induces lytic gene expression.A–B. Cells were transfected with a control siRNA or a siRNA against K13 (Table S1) using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Approximately 96 h post-transfection, down-regulation of K13 (A), vCyclin (B) and LANA-1 (C), and induction of RTA/ORF50 (D) gene expression was demonstrated by qRT-PCR. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the data presented as fold change in target gene expression (Mean±S.E.). E. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showing up-regulation of ORF59 expression in cells transfected with K13 siRNA. Cells were analyzed 96 h post-transfection.
