                Figure 5.  K13 protects cells against lytic replication-induced cell death.A. BCBL1-TREx-RTA-MSCV and K13 cells were treated with doxycycline (20 ng/ml) for 4 days to induce lytic replication. Cells were washed and incubated in doxycycline-free medium for 1 week. Cell viability was measured using MTS assay as described previously [36] and plotted relative to untreated cells. The values (Mean±S.E.) shown are from a representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. B. Equivalent induction of RTA upon doxycycline treatment in the vector- and K13-expressing BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells. Cells were treated with the indicated doses of doxycycline for 72 h prior to immunoblotting. C–D. Induction of lytic replication with TPA in BCBL1-TREx-RTA-K13 cells leads to the emergence of cells (K13/TPA) with increased K13 expression (C) and NF-κB activity (D), as measured by immunoblotting and an ELISA-based NF-κB DNA-binding assay, respectively. BCBL1-TREx-RTA-K13 cells were left untreated or treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) for 4 days followed by recovery in drug-free medium for 4 weeks prior to analyses. E. Induction of lytic replication in BCBL1-TREx-RTA-MSCV cells with TPA leads to emergence of cells with increase in endogenous K13 expression as measured by qRT-PCR. Treatment with TPA, followed by growth in drug-free media, was carried out essentially as in 4D. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the data presented as fold change in target gene expression (Mean±S.E.).
