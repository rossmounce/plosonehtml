G3PDH serves as a normalization control. C. Differential effect of K13 on the expression of TPA-target lytic genes and LANA-1. BCBL1-TREx-RTA-K13-ER<sup>TAM</sup> cells were treated with TPA for 96 h with and without prior treatment with 4OHT and expression of the indicated genes measured by real-time RT-PCR analysis and normalized relative to GNB2L1 (housekeeping control). Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the data presented as fold change in target gene expression (MeanÂ±S.E.).</p>
