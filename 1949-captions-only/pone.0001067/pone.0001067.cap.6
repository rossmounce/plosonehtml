                Figure 6.  K13 differentially modulates the expression of KSHV genes following TPA treatment.A, B. 4OHT pretreatment effectively blocks TPA-induced RTA up-regulation in BCBL1-TREx-RTA-K13- K13-ERTAM cells as measured by immunoblotting with an RTA polyclonal antibody (A) and RT-PCR analysis (B), respectively. G3PDH serves as a normalization control. C. Differential effect of K13 on the expression of TPA-target lytic genes and LANA-1. BCBL1-TREx-RTA-K13-ERTAM cells were treated with TPA for 96 h with and without prior treatment with 4OHT and expression of the indicated genes measured by real-time RT-PCR analysis and normalized relative to GNB2L1 (housekeeping control). Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the data presented as fold change in target gene expression (MeanÂ±S.E.).
