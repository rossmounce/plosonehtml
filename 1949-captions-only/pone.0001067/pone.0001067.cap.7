                Figure 7.  Effect of K13 on lytic replication-induced vIL6 and hIL-6.A. K13 activity fails to block TPA- and doxycycline-induced vIL6 induction. BCBL1-TREx-RTA-MSCV and K13-ERTAM cells were treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) and doxycycline (10 ng/ml) for 96 h with and without prior treatment with 4OHT, followed by immunostaining with a vIL6 antibody. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. A representative of two independent experiments is shown. B. BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells expressing an empty vector, wild-type K13 or K13 mutants defective in NF-κB activation were treated with doxycycline for 96 h followed by immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against vIL6 as described in 7A. C. K13 fails to block RTA-induced vIL6 secretion. Culture of BAF-130 cells in the absence of WEHI-3B-conditioned medium (WH) led to a dramatic loss of cell viability (lane 1) which was rescued by the addition of supernatants (S.N.) from doxycycline-treated BCBL1-TREx-RTA-MSCV and K13-ERTAM cells (lanes 5 and 9). Induction of K13 activity via 4OHT pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on vIL6 production (lane 10). Addition of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to vIL6 (300 ng/ml) effectively reversed the effect of doxycycline-treated supernatants on BAF-130 survival whereas a control antibody was without effect, thereby confirming the contribution of vIL6 to the observed effects. The values (Mean±S.E.) shown are from a representative of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. UT, untreated. D. K13 promotes RTA-induced hIL6 secretion. Secretion of hIL6 was measured using an ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego) in cell supernatants (10 µl) collected from BCBL1-TREx-RTA-MSCV and K13-ERTAM cells that had been treated with doxycycline in the absence and presence of 4OHT, as described in Figure 7A. The values (Mean±S.E.) shown are from a representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate.
