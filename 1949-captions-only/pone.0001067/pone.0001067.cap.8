Cells with low K13 expression are eliminated by apoptosis and lytic replication, while those with intermediate to high expression are stimulated to proliferate through the stimulatory effect of the NF-κB pathway on cell cycle and through the secretion of growth-promoting cytokines (e.g. hIL6). Elevated K13 expression also blocks the production of key viral proteins needed for lytic replication, thereby protecting cells from lytic replication-induced cell death. However, K13 has a permissive effect on RTA-induced vIL6 production and cooperates with it to stimulate hIL6 secretion further, thereby dysregulating the lytic gene expression program. The dysregulated expression of viral and cellular genes leads to further deregulation of signaling pathways controlling cellular survival, proliferation, immune response, and angiogenesis, initially leading to polyclonal expansion and, subsequently, through the accumulation of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations, to monoclonal cellular proliferation. Increased K13 expression, either alone or in combination with other viral (e.g. vCyclin, LANA-1, vGPCR and K1) and cellular proteins (e.g. proinflammatory cytokines) may lead to dysregulated expression of additional viral and cellular proteins in a cell-type and context-dependent manner, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of different cancers associated with KSHV infection. It is conceivable that acquisition of secondary genetic and epigenetic changes in the later stages of the disease may reduce or obviate the need for continuous K13 expression and NF-κB activity in some cases (not depicted).</p>
