After sedimentation (30 g, 5 min), collected soil particles are extensively washed, and the presence of soil-bound PrP<sup>C</sup> immunodetected as described (see <a href="#s3">Materials and Methods</a>). The same protocol is used for the incubation of ASL in the absence (column 3), or in the presence (column 4), of the indicated concentration (w/v) of recombinant murine PrP (rPrP). Soil-bound immunoreactivity appears as a dark chemiluminescent signal, clearly distinguishable from the background (i.e. observed in the absence of PrP). (B) A titration experiment is reported, in which progressively increasing PrP<sup>C</sup> quantities are incubated (1 h, RT) with ASL, under conditions of constant total tissue-to-soil ratio. This is achieved by mixing different volume ratios of hBHs (10% (w/v) in PBS) from wild-type (WT) and PrP-knockout (KO) mice (WT:KO (µl:µl) 0:20, 5:15, 10:10, 15:5, 20:0) (final volume, 200 µl of PBS). The resulting final concentrations (w/v) of WT brain homogenates (hBH) are as indicated. The relative amounts of immunodetected soil-bound PrP<sup>C</sup>s, determined by the densitometric analysis of the collected chemiluminescence, subtracted for the background signal ([hBH] = 0%), are reported (in arbitrary units, a.u.) in the scatter plot as a function of [hBH]. Regression analysis indicates a linear relation (with a p value&lt;0.05 (t-Student test)), at least within the tested concentration range, and demonstrates that the assay is specific for PrP<sup>C</sup>. Reported are also the regression line, the regression equation (with the standard error for the slope and the intercept) and the R<sup>2</sup> value. Other experimental details are as in (A). (C) To visualise soil-bound prions (columns 1–3), ASL samples are incubated with the indicated final concentrations ((w/v) in PBS) of RML-infected mouse brain homogenates (serially diluted into non-infected (2.5%) homogenates), before applying to purified soil pellets the above described immuno-based procedure, implemented with PK digestion and addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (see <a href="#s3">Materials and Methods</a>). The obtained dark immunosignal, readily appreciable with respect to soil samples incubated with hBH (2.5%, column 4), is therefore indicative for the presence of PK-resistant soil-bound PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The null response, obtained by processing RML-brain homogenates (2.5%) in the absence of soil (no soil, column 5), demonstrates that the signal is specific for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> adsorbed onto soil surfaces, rather than resulting from (contaminating) not bound PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Other experimental details are as in (B).</p>
