                Figure 1.  Direct Visualisation of Soil-bound PrPC and PrPSc.(A) Samples (100 mg) of arable sandy loam (ASL) are incubated (1 h, RT; final volume, 200 µl of PBS) in the absence (column 1), or in the presence (1% (w/v), column 2), of healthy mouse brain homogenate (hBH). After sedimentation (30 g, 5 min), collected soil particles are extensively washed, and the presence of soil-bound PrPC immunodetected as described (see Materials and Methods). The same protocol is used for the incubation of ASL in the absence (column 3), or in the presence (column 4), of the indicated concentration (w/v) of recombinant murine PrP (rPrP). Soil-bound immunoreactivity appears as a dark chemiluminescent signal, clearly distinguishable from the background (i.e. observed in the absence of PrP). (B) A titration experiment is reported, in which progressively increasing PrPC quantities are incubated (1 h, RT) with ASL, under conditions of constant total tissue-to-soil ratio. This is achieved by mixing different volume ratios of hBHs (10% (w/v) in PBS) from wild-type (WT) and PrP-knockout (KO) mice (WT:KO (µl:µl) 0:20, 5:15, 10:10, 15:5, 20:0) (final volume, 200 µl of PBS). The resulting final concentrations (w/v) of WT brain homogenates (hBH) are as indicated. The relative amounts of immunodetected soil-bound PrPCs, determined by the densitometric analysis of the collected chemiluminescence, subtracted for the background signal ([hBH] = 0%), are reported (in arbitrary units, a.u.) in the scatter plot as a function of [hBH]. Regression analysis indicates a linear relation (with a p value&lt;0.05 (t-Student test)), at least within the tested concentration range, and demonstrates that the assay is specific for PrPC. Reported are also the regression line, the regression equation (with the standard error for the slope and the intercept) and the R2 value. Other experimental details are as in (A). (C) To visualise soil-bound prions (columns 1–3), ASL samples are incubated with the indicated final concentrations ((w/v) in PBS) of RML-infected mouse brain homogenates (serially diluted into non-infected (2.5%) homogenates), before applying to purified soil pellets the above described immuno-based procedure, implemented with PK digestion and addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (see Materials and Methods). The obtained dark immunosignal, readily appreciable with respect to soil samples incubated with hBH (2.5%, column 4), is therefore indicative for the presence of PK-resistant soil-bound PrPSc. The null response, obtained by processing RML-brain homogenates (2.5%) in the absence of soil (no soil, column 5), demonstrates that the signal is specific for PrPSc adsorbed onto soil surfaces, rather than resulting from (contaminating) not bound PrPSc. Other experimental details are as in (B).
