                Figure 2.  Prion-contaminated ASL and Quartz Sand Can Propagate Prion Infection.Prion-susceptible N2a-PK1 (upper panels), and prion-resistant N2a (lower panels), cells are inoculated with the pellet fraction obtained by centrifuging the indicated concentrations of RML-infected (columns 1–3, 5–7, 9–11), or healthy (columns 4, 8, 12), brain homogenates in the absence (no soil, columns 1–4), or in the presence (2 mg), of (whole) ASL (columns 5–8), or quartz sand (columns 9–12). After 6 (1:3) and 3 (1:10) consecutive splittings, cells are analysed for prion propagation using the Elispot assay (6·104 cells/well, run in duplicate). While no signal of infectivity is detectable using hBH (upper panels, columns 4, 8 and 12), a prion-positive immunosignal is evident in N2a-PK1 cells inoculated with ASL samples contaminated by RML-homogenates (2.5%) (columns 5 and 6). Under the same conditions, RML-tainted quartz sand yields a more intense signal (column 10). Also at difference from ASL, a positive result is obtained with quartz particles added with a 0.25% RML-homogenate (cf. columns 7 and 11). The lack of prion amplification by N2a-PK1 cells inoculated with pellets from soil-free RLM-homogenates (columns 2 and 3), indicates that positive signals arise from soil-bound prions, not from (soil-unbound) PrPSc leftovers in the inoculum. Likewise, incapacity of N2a cells to be infected (lower panels) clearly demonstrates that the anti-PrP immunoreactivity is consequent to the de novo production of prions by cells, rather than to residuals of the inoculum in cell culture chambers. Additional controls are the incubation of N2a-PK1, or N2a, cells with a spike of crude RML- (column 13), or healthy- (column 14), homogenate (final concentration 0.025% (w/v)). Shown results are representative of 3 to 6 independent experiments, which always yielded qualitatively comparable results.
