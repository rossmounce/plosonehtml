<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>Most Chinese people in Hong Kong are first or second generation migrants from southern China, mainly from the neighbouring province of Guangdong. The major waves of migration were in the late 1940s, early 1950s and the late 1970s <a href="#pone.0001070-Tsang1">[29]</a>. Migrants were mainly young people looking for work <a href="#pone.0001070-Hong1">[30]</a>, with, until very recently, little migration back to China after 1949. At that time gross domestic product (GDP) per head in China was similar to pre-industrialized western Europe <a href="#pone.0001070-Dahlman1">[31]</a>. Guangdong province was an economic backwater until the establishment of the Special Economic Zones near Hong Kong in 1978. In contrast industrialization and economic growth started in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in Hong Kong <a href="#pone.0001070-Ngo1">[32]</a>. By the 1930s living conditions in Hong Kong were better than in the neighboring provinces with workers sending remittances back to China <a href="#pone.0001070-Butters1">[33]</a>. By 1952 per capita GDP was half that of western Europe and by 1995 had overtaken western Europe <a href="#pone.0001070-Dahlman1">[31]</a>. We have previously used this natural experiment to examine whether childhood migration was related to self-reports of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or heart disease, obtained from telephone interviews <a href="#pone.0001070-Schooling1">[34]</a>. We previously found no difference in the age-adjusted risk of self-reported IHD (and/or angina) by sex or growth period spent in China or Hong Kong, although self-reported IHD was more common in women than men, suggesting the self-reports were incomplete, thus biasing any relation towards the null. In the present study, we used clinical measurements in a sub-sample to investigate whether the associations of some specific dimensions of IHD risk (body shape and lipid levels) but not others (diabetes) varied by sex according to growth environment location (Guangdong, Hong Kong or both) for Hong Kong residents.</p>

<h4>Sample</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>The sampling frame and methods of this population-based cross-sectional study in Hong Kong have been described elsewhere in detail <a href="#pone.0001070-Lam1">[35]</a>. In brief, a probability sample was used to obtain the WHO MONICA <a href="#pone.0001070-WHO1">[36]</a> recommendation of about 200 participants in each of five 10-year, adult, sex-specific age groups. Randomly generated telephone numbers were used to select households, and within households a Kish grid was used to randomly select respondents. Almost all Hong Kong households (99%) have a telephone <a href="#pone.0001070-Janghorbani1">[37]</a>. From 1994 to 1996, 7174 Chinese (25–74 years) took part in telephone interviews (a response rate of 78%). The study was supplemented by a relatively small number (556) age 55–74 specifically recruited because there were fewer people of this age in the population. Of the 7730 interviewed, 2900 (38%) came for physical examination. The attendees and non-attendees match the population and non-attendance bias should be small <a href="#pone.0001070-Lam2">[38]</a>. <a href="#pone.0001070.s001">Appendix S1</a> shows a comparison of the total sample and those who came for physical examination by socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported health status. For place of birth, exercise, smoking status, self-reported medically diagnosed diabetes or hypertension and general health, the Cohen effect sizes were negligible (&lt;0.1). Effect sizes for job activity, a proxy for socio-economic status, (0.16) and education (0.23) were slightly larger but still acceptable. We excluded pregnant women and those with serious diseases such as cancer and those who were hospitalized. The detailed methods of measurement have been reported <a href="#pone.0001070-Lam3">[39]</a>. The University of Hong Kong Ethics Committee approved the study and participants gave prior, written, informed consent.</p>


<h4>Exposure assessment</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Our primary exposure is growth environment obtained from place of birth, age and length of stay in Hong Kong. Growth environment was categorized as: 1) pre-industrial, i.e. born in Guangdong province and migrated to Hong Kong at age 20 years or older, 2) mixed, i.e. born in Guangdong and migrated to Hong Kong before age 20 years, and 3) more developed, i.e. born and raised in Hong Kong. We chose age 20 years as the cut-off to allow for the completion of possibly slower growth in Guangdong province and to maximise the limited number who migrated as adults given digit preference for migration at age 20 years. We specifically used a separate group for people who migrated before the age of 20, because they experienced potentially detrimental environmental change during growth <a href="#pone.0001070-Gluckman1">[40]</a>, even though their average experience might be similar to either group. We excluded people born elsewhere to reduce confounding by other unmeasured differences.</p>


<h4>Outcome specification of IHD risk</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The main outcome measures were risk factor for IHD in which differences between the sexes become more pronounced at puberty due to the action of sex steroids. At puberty, HDL-cholesterol, body shape and possibly apolipoprotein B (ApoB) change towards a less cardio-protective pattern in males and a more cardio-protective pattern in females <a href="#pone.0001070-Berenson1">[16]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001070-Roemmich1">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001070-Jaross2">[41]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001070-Morrison2">[43]</a>. Body shape was proxied by waist-hip ratio. HDL-cholesterol, ApoB and waist-hip ratio are all risk factors for IHD, although not necessarily optimal predictors <a href="#pone.0001070-Ballantyne1">[44]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001070-Pischon1">[47]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>A secondary outcome measure was a risk factor for IHD whose precursors also change at puberty but more likely as a function of growth hormone than sex-steroids, i.e. type 2 diabetes <a href="#pone.0001070-Arslanian2">[48]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001070-Goran2">[53]</a>. Diabetes is also a well established risk factor for IHD <a href="#pone.0001070-Ballantyne1">[44]</a>. Type 2 diabetes was classified using the World Health Organization definition of self-report of previously medically diagnosed diabetes or a fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or a post-load reading of ≥11.1 mmol/L for those who completed a standard oral glucose tolerance test (consisting of 95% of those not on diabetic medications).</p>


<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Chi squared tests were used to compare characteristics between groups. Locally weighted regression and scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) was used to examine risk factors across the age-range. The association of each risk factor with growth environment adjusted for potential confounding factors was assessed in men and women separately using multiple regression. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from linear regression for continuous outcomes. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated from logistic regression for diabetes. Whether growth environment had a different association in men and women was assessed from the heterogeneity across strata and the significance of interaction terms. We tested for interactions by running models with and without the interaction term and examining the statistical significance of the likelihood ratio test of the difference between the two models on the relevant chi-squared distribution. A two-tailed p value of less than 5% was considered statistically significant.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>Potential confounding factors considered were education, type of housing, use of alcohol, smoking and exercise categorized as in <a href="#pone-0001070-t001">Table 1</a> and age. First we adjusted for age (model 1). Next, we added all other confounders (model 2). Finally, we also adjusted HDL-cholesterol, ApoB and diabetes for waist-hip ratio and body mass index (model 3). Each analysis used all relevant complete data (available for 97%).</p>
