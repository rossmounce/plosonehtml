                Figure 1.  AIQ decreases CIA severity.DBA1 mice with established CIA were injected i.p. either with PBS (control) or with AIQ (1.5 mg/kg) on day 22 or on day 25. A. Severity of arthritis was assessed by clinical scoring. Numbers in parenthesis represent frequency of arthritis (% mice with arthritis score&gt;2 at day 35). B. Histological analysis of trichromic-stained (lower) or H&amp;E-stained (upper) sections of joints obtained at day 45 was performed. Scoring of inflammation, cartilage damage and bone erosion of paws from untreated (control) and AIQ-treated CIA mice is shown. Neutrophil infiltration in the joints was determined by measuring MPO activity in protein extracts isolated at day 35. n = 6â€“8 mice per group. *p&lt;0.001 versus control.
