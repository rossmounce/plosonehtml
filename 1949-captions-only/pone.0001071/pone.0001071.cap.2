                Figure 2.  AIQ administration inhibits inflammatory response in CIA.DBA1 mice with established CIA were injected i.p. either with PBS (control) or with AIQ (1.5 mg/kg) on day 25 post-immunization. Systemic and local expression of inflammatory mediators was assayed in protein extracts from joints (A) and sera (B) isolated at day 35 post-immunization. A paw from an unimmunized mouse was analyzed simultaneously for assessment of the basal response. n = 3â€“4 mice/group. *p&lt;0.001 versus controls.
