Systemic and local expression of inflammatory mediators was assayed in protein extracts from joints (A) and sera (B) isolated at day 35 post-immunization. A paw from an unimmunized mouse was analyzed simultaneously for assessment of the basal response. n = 3â€“4 mice/group. *p&lt;0.001 versus controls.</p>
