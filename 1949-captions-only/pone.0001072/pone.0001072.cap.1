The red cross indicates the bead's equilibrium position inside the optical trap. Scale bar, 2 µm. (d) Example of a force component obtained with QPD when the bead was distant from the growth cone (upper trace) and when the bead was in contact with the growth cone (lower trace). Red lines are drawn 5 σ from the 0 mark. σ, s.d. of force fluctuations. When the QPD trace crossed the red lines for at least 100 ms and a lamellipodium or filopodium was seen hitting the bead, a reliable collision was detected. (e) Example of F<sub>x</sub> and F<sub>y</sub> during repetitive collisions between a moving lamellipodium and a trapped bead. Trap stiffness was 0.05 pN nm<sup>−1</sup>. (f) Comparison of F<sub>x</sub> and F<sub>y</sub> determined with a QPD (black traces) and video tracking (yellow traces).</p>
