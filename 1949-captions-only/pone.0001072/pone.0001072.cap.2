Trap stiffness was 0.008 pN nm<sup>−1</sup>. The red cross indicates the bead's equilibrium position inside the optical trap. (c) F<sub>x </sub>and F<sub>y</sub> from the QPD during the lateral collision shown in (a–b). (d–e) Collision between a protruding filopodium and a trapped bead. (f) F<sub>x</sub> and F<sub>y</sub> from the QPD during the filopodial protrusion shown in (d–e). Trap stiffness was 0.008 pN nm<sup>−1</sup>. (g–h) Histograms of forces measured during lateral collisions and protrusions. Data were collected from 75 experiments, each lasting 2 min. Scale bar, 2 µm.</p>
