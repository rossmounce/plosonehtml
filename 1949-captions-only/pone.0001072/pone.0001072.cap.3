                Figure 3.  Effect of trap stiffness on force exerted.(a–b) Fx from the QPD during collisions between the same filopodium and the same bead trapped with a stiffness of 0.006 and 0.010 pN nm−1. Traces were filtered at 50 Hz and sub-sampled. (c–d) Scatter plot of force duration for collisions between filopodia and beads trapped with a stiffness of 0.006 and 0.010 pN nm−1. Data collected from 15 experiments at each stiffness.
