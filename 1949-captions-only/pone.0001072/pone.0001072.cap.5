                Figure 5.  Force field exerted by lamellipodia.(a) A lamellipodium colliding with three trapped beads. (b) Direction and amplitude (in arbitrary units, a.u.) of forces exerted on the three beads. Superposition of bead displacements was obtained by video tracking at 5 Hz from a 4-min recording. Scale bar, 2 Âµm.
