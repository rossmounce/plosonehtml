Example image of a targeted dendrite and spine pair. Dotted line indicates line-scanned region. B. Back-propagating AP trains were induced to cause maximal dye-saturating calcium indicator fluorescence changes in both spines and dendrites to calculate f<sub>max.</sub> Upper panel, AP train. Lower panels, example maximal fluorescence plateau levels. Darker line indicates boxplot smoothed trace average used for f<sub>max</sub> calculations. C. Examples of average δf and δf<sub>max</sub> signals following single AP and AP trains respectively, from spines and dendrites. Arrow indicates onset of stimulation. D. Inverse peak calcium change (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>AP</sub> <sup>−1</sup>) following a single AP versus added buffer capacity, κ<sub>D</sub>, for dendrite (blue, upper panel) and spine (red, lower panel). Average values (mean±SEM) for each added buffer concentration (33, 50, 62.5, 75, 90, 100 µM) are plotted over individual data points (open circles) (n = 35). Endogenous buffer capacity (κ<sub>E</sub>) was read off from the intersection of the linear fit with the x axis at zero level of added dye. [Spine κ<sub>E</sub> = 19 UCI:40, LCI:4; Dendrite κ<sub>E</sub> = 62 UCI:172, LCI:15). 95% confidence intervals are shown in dotted outlines.</p>
