                Figure 4.  Diffusion cannot explain faster calcium dynamics in spines.(A) Free calcium signals (left panel) and fluorescent signals (calcium bound to dye, middle panel) are plotted for different shells (shell 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22) in the multi-compartmental model for spines (upper panels) and dendrites (lower panels). Right panels show 10â€“90% rise times from the fluorescent signals in the middle panels. B. Parameter space analysis similar as in Figure 3 for model parameters f (diffusion factor) and kon,dye (binding rate of the calcium indicator). B. Color-coded plot of fluorescence 10% to 90% rise times for spines (upper panel) and dendrites (lower panel) with the contours indicating the experimental range for rise time values for spines (red) and dendrites (blue). Plus signs indicate default parameter values for spines (red) and dendrites (blue) as listed in Table 2. C. Similar plots as in B for fluorescence decay times for spines (upper panel) and dendrites (lower panel). Scale bars for color-coding show rise times (left scale) and decay times (right scale) in ms. D. Overlay of contour plots of rise times and decay times showing large areas of overlap where the model fits both experimental rise and decay times in spines and dendrites correctly.
