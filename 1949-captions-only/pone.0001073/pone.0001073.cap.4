Right panels show 10â€“90% rise times from the fluorescent signals in the middle panels. B. Parameter space analysis similar as in <a href="#pone-0001073-g003">Figure 3</a> for model parameters f (diffusion factor) and k<sub>on,dye</sub> (binding rate of the calcium indicator). B. Color-coded plot of fluorescence 10% to 90% rise times for spines (upper panel) and dendrites (lower panel) with the contours indicating the experimental range for rise time values for spines (red) and dendrites (blue). Plus signs indicate default parameter values for spines (red) and dendrites (blue) as listed in <a href="#pone-0001073-t002">Table 2</a>. C. Similar plots as in B for fluorescence decay times for spines (upper panel) and dendrites (lower panel). Scale bars for color-coding show rise times (left scale) and decay times (right scale) in ms. D. Overlay of contour plots of rise times and decay times showing large areas of overlap where the model fits both experimental rise and decay times in spines and dendrites correctly.</p>
