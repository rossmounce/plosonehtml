                Figure 1.  Isolation of a CA1-1 enhancer (cae1-1) in root hair tip growth.(A) Col and CA1-1 root hairs grown in the presence of 1% sucrose. (B) Root hairs grown in the presence of 5% sucrose. CA1-1 showed some bulbous root hairs, however all of root hairs in the CA-rop2 enhancer mutant (cae1-1 CA1-1) were bulbous. In the Col background, cae1-1 caused root hairs waving and branching.
