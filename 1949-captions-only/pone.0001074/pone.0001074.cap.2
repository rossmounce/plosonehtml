Solid boxes indicate exons and solid lines indicate introns. The <em>cae1-1</em> mutation site and the T-DNA insertion sites for <em>mrh2-1</em> and <em>mrh2-2</em> were indicated. <em>cae1-1</em> was renamed to <em>mrh2-3</em>. <em>Lower panel</em>, domain feature of the 1051 amino acid-containing MRH2 protein. Numbers above indicate the positions of amino acids. Motor domain, the catalytic domain of kinesin motor (102–449); CC, coiled-coil (452–765); ARM, the ARM repeat domain (792–915). (B) RT-PCR analysis of <em>MRH2</em> expression in <em>cae1-1</em> CA1-1. <em>ACT2</em>, the internal control. (C) <em>cae1-1</em> failed to complement <em>mrh2-1</em> and <em>mrh2-2</em>, respectively. Root hairs of F<sub>1</sub> for both crosses (<em>cae1-1</em>×<em>mrh2-1</em>, and <em>cae1-1</em>×<em>mrh2-2</em>) were shown, together with their parents.</p>
