Images were projections of 20–50 confocal sections, separated by 1 µm distance. The bar represents 20 µm. (A) Col. (B–D) MT images from three typical root hairs of <em>mrh2-3</em>: slight waving (B), severe waving (C), and severe waving and branching (D). (E–G) MT images from root hairs showing three representative types of CA1-1 root hairs: normal hair (E), swelling hair (F) and hair with bulbous tip (G). (H) Bulbous root hair of <em>mrh2-3</em> CA1-1. (I–J) Quantitative analysis of MT orientation. Angles of MT relative to the root hair growth axis were measured. (I) The average MT angles for each root hair were calculated to show the overall MT angles for single root hair. (J) Distribution of MT angles. The data represents the average of three replicates, each with a total of about 180 MTs from 3–7 root hairs. Different letters above the column indicate a statistical significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between genotypes within the same category.</p>
