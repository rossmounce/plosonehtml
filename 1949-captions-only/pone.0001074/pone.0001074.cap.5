                Figure 5.  Taxol reduced mrh2-3 root hair waviness.Three-day old seedlings were transferred to the 1 ÂµM taxol-containing medium for two days of further growth. Representative root hairs were shown in (A), and the distribution of the waving angles of root hairs were presented in (B). The angles for each waiving relative to the root hair growth axis were measured. The bar represents the average and the SD of three replicates. Each replicate has 3 or 4 roots, with a total of approximately 30 root hairs. The asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) compared to the DMSO control within the same category.
