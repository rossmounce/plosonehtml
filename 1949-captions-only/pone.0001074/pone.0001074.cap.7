The solvent DMSO was used as the 0 µM control. Col, the wild-type. (A) Quantitative analysis of <em>mrh2-3</em> root hair length in response to LatB. A total of 12–15 root hairs for each root (except about five root hairs for 0.2 µM LatB treatment) were measured, and the average and the SD of eight roots are shown. (B) Proportions of short root hairs in <em>mrh2-3</em> after LatB treatments. The same data as in (A) were analyzed. Root hairs shorter than 220 µm were classified as short root hairs. The asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) compared to Col under the same treatment.</p>
