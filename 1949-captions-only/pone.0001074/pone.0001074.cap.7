                Figure 7.  Hypersensitivity of mrh2-3 root hairs to LatB.Three-day-old seedlings that were grown in the drug-free medium and then transferred to the LatB-containing medium for two additional days. The solvent DMSO was used as the 0 µM control. Col, the wild-type. (A) Quantitative analysis of mrh2-3 root hair length in response to LatB. A total of 12–15 root hairs for each root (except about five root hairs for 0.2 µM LatB treatment) were measured, and the average and the SD of eight roots are shown. (B) Proportions of short root hairs in mrh2-3 after LatB treatments. The same data as in (A) were analyzed. Root hairs shorter than 220 µm were classified as short root hairs. The asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) compared to Col under the same treatment.
