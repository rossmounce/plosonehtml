                Figure 9.  Co-sedimentation of MRH21-449 and MRH2649-1051 with the polymerized tubulin.Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in the presence (+) or the absence (−) of the polymerized tubulin (MT). After high-speed centrifugation, proteins from the supernatant (S) and the pellet (P) were separated on the SDS-PAGE gel. (A) Control experiments for the co-sedimentation assay. GST-MAP65-1 (5 µM, positive control) or GST (10 µM, negative control) were loaded to 5 µM MT. (B) GST-MRH21-449 (10 µM) was loaded in the presence or absence of 5 µM MT. (C) GST-MRH2649-1051 (1 µM) was loaded in the presence (+) or the absence (−) of 2 µM MT.
