After high-speed centrifugation, proteins from the supernatant (S) and the pellet (P) were separated on the SDS-PAGE gel. (A) Control experiments for the co-sedimentation assay. GST-MAP65-1 (5 µM, positive control) or GST (10 µM, negative control) were loaded to 5 µM MT. (B) GST-MRH2<sup>1-449</sup> (10 µM) was loaded in the presence or absence of 5 µM MT. (C) GST-MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup> (1 µM) was loaded in the presence (+) or the absence (−) of 2 µM MT.</p>
