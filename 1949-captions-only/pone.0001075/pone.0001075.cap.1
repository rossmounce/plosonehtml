                Figure 1.  VT680 efficiently labels splenocytes, remains internalized in vitro and in vivo, and does not interfere with cell function.A. Splenocytes were incubated with increasing doses of VT680 and mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each dose is shown. B. Viability of splenocytes after labeling with increasing doses of VT680. C. In vitro retention of VT680 and CFSE in resting cells for three days after labeling (log scale). D. In vitro retention of VT680 and CFSE in dividing cells for three days after labeling (log scale). E. Cellular distribution of VT680 assessed microscopically. F. Cellular distribution of VT680 in resting and dividing cells assessed with a bio-cellular assay. G. VT680-labeled Thy1.1 cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with unlabeled Thy1.2 cells and cultured together. A different group was cultured separately. 24 h later VT680 retention was assessed in Thy1.1+ (Gate i) and Thy1.2+ (Gate ii) cells. H. Expression of IFN-γ on naïve cells (thick-line histogram) and cells stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin (shaded histogram) that were either unlabeled or labeled with VT680. I. Retention of VT680 in vivo. Thy1.2 splenocytes were labeled with VT680 or CFSE ex vivo and injected to Thy1.1 mice. At indicated times recipient spleens (Thy1.1) were harvested and retention of label on donor cells (Thy1.2) was calculated. J. CD25 and CD44 expression. Thy1.2 splenocytes were labeled with VT680 and injected to Thy1.1 mice. At indicated times recipient spleens were harvested and CD25 and CD44 expression was measured on VT680-labeled, Thy1.2 donor splenocytes and unlabeled, Thy1.1 cells of recipient mice. Mean and SEM are shown, n = 3–5.
