After 7 days, activated Thy1.2 HA-specific CTLs either labeled with VT680 or unlabeled were injected i.v. A. Tumor growth kinetics in mice that did not receive CTLs and in mice that received VT680 and unlabeled CTLs. B. Relative distribution and activation status of VT680-labeled and unlabeled donor Thy1.2 CTLs retrieved from the tumor-draining lymph nodes. C. Relative distribution and activation status of VT680-labeled and unlabeled donor Thy1.2 CTLs retrieved from the tumor. Mean and SEM are shown, n = 3. D. Overview of tumor bulk. E. Multiphoton microscopy on day 2 after adoptive transfer. Paths of cell migration are shown in the last panel. F. Intravital microscopy on day 4. T cells (red) are in close contact to a cancer cell (green), which shows phenotypic changes suggestive of ongoing apoptosis. Paths of cell migration are shown in the last panel.</p>
