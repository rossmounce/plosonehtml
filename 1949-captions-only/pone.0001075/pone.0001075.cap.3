After 7 days of growth VT680-labeled HA-specific CTLs were injected. A. Fluorescent-mediated molecular tomography (FMT) depicting kinetics of CTL accumulation in tumor and lymph nodes. B. Z stacks of FMT images on day 8. C. Correlation of FMT signal vs days after CTL transfer in tumors (white) and draining lymph nodes (black) from the right, tumor-bearing, paw (circles) and the left, contra-lateral, paw (triangles). D. Number of cells vs. fluorescence determined by phantom experiments. E. Average number of CTL cell divisions during 5 d after injection determined by VT680 fluorescence loss. F. Estimation of CTL accumulation in tumors (white) and draining lymph nodes (black) from the right, tumor-bearing, paw (circles) and the left, contra-lateral, paw (triangles), determined by combining information from D and E.</p>
