The “Ciliated cells divide” column indicates presence (Y) or absence (N) of cells in the species which both bear cilia and re-enter the cell cycle: gametes and other terminally differentiated ciliated cells are excluded. The “Neks” column indicates both how many genes encoding Nek kinase domains were identified in the indicated species. The number in parentheses is a minimal estimate of how many Nek subfamilies are represented in the genome, as determined from our analysis (see text). N.D. indicates that we did not determine the number of subfamilies for the particular species.</p>
