                Figure 2.  Phylogram of Nek kinase domains from unikonts+Chlamydomonas.Numbers at nodes are interpreted as a posteriori support values. Bold digits at some nodes indicate nodes used for hypothesis testing, and the Bayes Factor (BF) where indicated. Right brackets include sequences joined by well-supported internal nodes, which we propose to refer to as Nek subfamilies, named after the human member with the shortest branch length.
