                Figure 4.  Phylogram of Nek kinase domains across eukaryotes.For ease of visualization, large nodes have been collapsed (triangles) and are shown expanded in subsequent figures (Figures 5â€“7) as indicated. In these figures sequences from bikont species are cyan, while sequences from unikont species are red. Right brackets include sequences joined by well-supported internal nodes, which we propose to refer to as Nek subfamilies, named after the human member with the shortest branch length where appropriate.
