                Figure 3. (a) Circuit 19 with an odd number of negative regulators in cycle and (b) Circuit 11 with an even number of negative regulators in cycle. (c) and (d) We ran multiple optimizations ϑ* = argmaxϑL. For each optimization run, we plot the mutual information I* = I(C,G|ϑ*) vs. the mean number of molecules of the reporter protein 〈NG〉. Below 10 copies we saw poor LNA performance (cf. Text S1). Input distribution p(c) = 1/||C|| and ||C|| = 8 so that I(C,G)≤H(C) = 3 bits. Blue squares and red triangles are for γ = 0.001 and γ = 0.01, respectively. The blue and red linearly interpolated lines correspond to the convex hull for each respective γ value. The black solid curve gives the numerically evaluated optimal bound (cf. Results: Determining Optimal Bounds) and dashed curve gives analytic bound for any input distribution (cf. Materials and Methods: Maximum Mutual Information for a Fixed Copy Number). Inset: 〈I〉 as a function of the inverse fraction of data included m [cf. Results: (Almost) Optimal Circuits] in the analysis. Blue and red correspond to two different γ values. Linear regression extrapolated to case of infinite data (y-intercept). The results represent two typical circuits with 1-cycles. Note that here, as in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, circuits on the left have higher 〈I〉 values as well as narrower gaps between the two γ values than circuits on the right.
