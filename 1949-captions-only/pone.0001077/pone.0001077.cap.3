(c) and (d) We ran multiple optimizations ϑ<sub>*</sub> = argmax<sub>ϑ</sub><em>L</em>. For each optimization run, we plot the mutual information <em>I</em><sub>*</sub> = <em>I</em>(<em>C</em>,<em>G</em>|ϑ<sub>*</sub>) vs. the mean number of molecules of the reporter protein 〈<em>N<sub>G</sub></em>〉. Below 10 copies we saw poor LNA performance (cf. <a href="#pone.0001077.s001">Text S1</a>). Input distribution <em>p</em>(<em>c</em>) = 1/||<em>C</em>|| and ||<em>C</em>|| = 8 so that <em>I</em>(<em>C</em>,<em>G</em>)≤<em>H</em>(<em>C</em>) = 3 bits. Blue squares and red triangles are for γ = 0.001 and γ = 0.01, respectively. The blue and red linearly interpolated lines correspond to the convex hull for each respective γ value. The black solid curve gives the numerically evaluated optimal bound (cf. <em>Results: Determining Optimal Bounds</em>) and dashed curve gives analytic bound for any input distribution (cf. <a href="#s4"><em>Materials and Methods</em></a><em>: Maximum Mutual Information for a Fixed Copy Number</em>). Inset: 〈<em>I</em>〉 as a function of the inverse fraction of data included <em>m</em> [cf. <em>Results: (Almost) Optimal Circuits</em>] in the analysis. Blue and red correspond to two different γ values. Linear regression extrapolated to case of infinite data (y-intercept). The results represent two typical circuits with 1-cycles. Note that here, as in <a href="#pone-0001077-g004">Fig. 4</a> and <a href="#pone-0001077-g005">Fig. 5</a>, circuits on the left have higher 〈<em>I</em>〉 values as well as narrower gaps between the two γ values than circuits on the right.</p>
