                Figure 6. Bar graphs for 〈I〉 values for the two classes of circuits: odd (blue) includes circuits with cycles containing an odd number of repressors and even (green) includes circuits with cycles containing an even number of repressors. Top γ1 = 0.001, middle γ2 = 0.01, and bottom 〈I(γ1)〉−〈I(γ2)〉. For all 3 measures, there is a statistically significant difference between the two classes of circuits as calculated by the U Test (top p = 0.0002, middle p = 0.0003 and bottom p = 0.01).
