Top γ<sub>1</sub> = 0.001, middle γ<sub>2</sub> = 0.01, and bottom 〈<em>I</em>(γ<sub>1</sub>)〉−〈<em>I</em>(γ<sub>2</sub>)〉. For all 3 measures, there is a statistically significant difference between the two classes of circuits as calculated by the U Test (top <em>p</em> = 0.0002, middle <em>p</em> = 0.0003 and bottom <em>p</em> = 0.01).</p>
