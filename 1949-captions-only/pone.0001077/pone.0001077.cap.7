                Figure 7. (a) The objective function L and (b) the mutual information I as a function of the input parameters sX and sY corresponding to the small molecules “strength” on transcription factors X and Y (cf. Materials and Methods: Model and Parameters) for circuit 2. The rest of the parameters are held constant for this figure. The five labeled peaks correspond to 5 distinct behaviors or unique signal encodings (cf. Fig. 8 and Table 1).
