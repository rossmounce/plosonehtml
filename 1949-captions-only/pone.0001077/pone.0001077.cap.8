Since these are all high information solutions, the individual conditionals are all separated well. Note that at, each maximum, the colors are arranged differently, highlighting the fact that the conditionals are different, and therefore the network behaves differently at each of these high information solutions. The arrangement of these individual conditionals is summarized in <a href="#pone-0001077-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
