                Figure 9. Top-left: Spectra for the numerically calculated Hessian at each of the corresponding 5 peaks labeled in Fig. 7. Soft modes (→0) are directions in which L has small curvature; hard modes (→−∞) are directions in which L has large curvature. Many eigendirections exhibit small curvature (magnitude of eigenvalue less than 10−2 for peaks 2–4 and 10−1 for peaks 1 and 5), demonstrating that the maxima are robust to large deviations in parameter space. Colored panels: Magnitude of contribution from each parameter to each eigenvector for each of the five Hessians. Mode index is sorted as in top-left figure (from least curvature to greatest curvature). Row labeled leak corresponds to parameter a0. Paired rows labeled X, Y, Z, and G correspond to the two parameters, K and a, describing the gene regulation function for each transcription factor (X, Y, Z) and reporter protein (G). Rows labeled r correspond to the decay rates of each of the 3 transcription factors. Rows labeled s correspond to the input parameters modulating the three transcription factors. For all five peaks, the two most soft modes correspond to a0 and a mixture of KY, aY, respectively. sX and sZ contribute mostly to the hard modes.
