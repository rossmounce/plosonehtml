Soft modes (→0) are directions in which <em>L</em> has small curvature; hard modes (→−∞) are directions in which <em>L</em> has large curvature. Many eigendirections exhibit small curvature (magnitude of eigenvalue less than 10<sup>−2</sup> for peaks 2–4 and 10<sup>−1</sup> for peaks 1 and 5), demonstrating that the maxima are robust to large deviations in parameter space. Colored panels: Magnitude of contribution from each parameter to each eigenvector for each of the five Hessians. Mode index is sorted as in top-left figure (from least curvature to greatest curvature). Row labeled leak corresponds to parameter <em>a</em><sub>0</sub>. Paired rows labeled <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>, and <em>G</em> correspond to the two parameters, <em>K</em> and <em>a</em>, describing the gene regulation function for each transcription factor (<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>) and reporter protein (<em>G</em>). Rows labeled <em>r</em> correspond to the decay rates of each of the 3 transcription factors. Rows labeled <em>s</em> correspond to the input parameters modulating the three transcription factors. For all five peaks, the two most soft modes correspond to <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> and a mixture of <em>K<sub>Y</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>Y</sub></em>, respectively. <em>s<sub>X</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>Z</sub></em> contribute mostly to the hard modes.</p>
