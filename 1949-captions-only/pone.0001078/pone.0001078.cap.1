                Figure 1.  Outline of the basic extraction procedure.Yeast cells are harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer 1, and heated to 90Â°C for ten minutes. The lysate is then brought to neutral pH, and heated again to increase solubilization. Following this step, the lysate can either be brought to a composition similar to standard SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately used in gel electrophoresis-based applications (left branch), or the proteins can be precipitated and the SDS-containing buffer can be removed for SDS-incompatible applications (right branch).
