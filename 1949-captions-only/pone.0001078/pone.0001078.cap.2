                Figure 2.  Extraction efficiency is limited by the ratio of SDS to cells.(A) The amount of total protein that can be extracted at a density of 5×108 cells/ml is shown as a function of SDS-concentration in the lysis buffer. Other buffer components were kept constant (0.1 M NaOH, 0.05 M EDTA, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol). SDS-concentrations below ~2% limit extraction efficiency at this cell concentration. (B) Cells were lysed in buffer containing 2% SDS, at cell densities of 5×108 cells/ml (Lane A) or 2.5×109 cells/ml (Lane B). Extract representing 5×106 cells was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The lower intensity of many bands in lane B shows that extraction efficiency is limited at the higher cell density. Lane C shows a re-extraction of the cells from lane B at a cell density of 5×108cells/ml. In this lane, twice the amount of extract (107 cells) was loaded compared to lanes A and B in order to make bands that were under-extracted in sample B more clearly visible.
