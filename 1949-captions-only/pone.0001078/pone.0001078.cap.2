Other buffer components were kept constant (0.1 M NaOH, 0.05 M EDTA, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol). SDS-concentrations below ~2% limit extraction efficiency at this cell concentration. (B) Cells were lysed in buffer containing 2% SDS, at cell densities of 5×10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml (Lane A) or 2.5×10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml (Lane B). Extract representing 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The lower intensity of many bands in lane B shows that extraction efficiency is limited at the higher cell density. Lane C shows a re-extraction of the cells from lane B at a cell density of 5×10<sup>8</sup>cells/ml. In this lane, twice the amount of extract (10<sup>7</sup> cells) was loaded compared to lanes A and B in order to make bands that were under-extracted in sample B more clearly visible.</p>
