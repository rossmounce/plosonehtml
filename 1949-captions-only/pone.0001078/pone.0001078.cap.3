The amount of extracted total protein and individual proteins was then determined using gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Rpl25p and Sup45p show an increase in extraction efficiency in the presence of DC, whereas Sup35p shows a decrease. Conversely, Sup35p is more efficiently extracted in the presence of Urea, while Rnq1p, Rpl25p and Sup45p are extracted less efficiently. (B) shows the western blot for the data presented in panel A for Sup35p and Rnq1p. (C) Temperature dependence of extraction in the presence of Urea for total protein, Rnq1p and Sup35p. Rnq1p is extracted to maximum efficiency at ~60Â°C, but decays at higher temperatures, whereas Sup35p requires high temperatures for efficient extraction.</p>
