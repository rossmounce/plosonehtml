They were then subjected to a second round of extraction either by boiling in sample buffer also containing 8 M Urea (sample “Urea”), by glass bead lysis followed by boiling in normal sample buffer (sample “Glass Beads”), or by glass bead lysis followed by boiling in sample buffer also containing 8 M Urea (sample “Glass Beads, Urea”). Note that the second extracts are twice concentrated with respect to the first extract. (B) Western blotting analysis of samples from panel A. The western blot using anti-Sup35 antibodies confirms that this particular protein requires Urea for efficient extraction. In contrast, other individually tested proteins were not recovered by a second Urea-based extraction (Pgk1p is shown here as a representative example). (C) The total protein content of mock-extracted and extracted yeast cells was visualized by staining with the fluorescent protein stain Sypro Red. The Sypro Red Signal drops by &gt;95% following application of the extraction procedure.</p>
