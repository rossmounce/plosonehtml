                Figure 5.  Yeast Protein extraction in 96 well format.Different yeast strains were grown in a 96 well plate format, followed by protein extraction and gel electrophoretic analysis in the same format. (A) Shows the western blot for a 3Ã—4 well section from the 96 well plate. Pgk1p and Sup35p were detected simultaneously by mixing the respective antibodies. Note that the 96 well electrophoresis system employed here uses a staggered row format, hence the change in alignment between the different rows. The three columns correspond to three strains with different Sup35p expression levels (see text for further explanation). (B) Box plot summarizing variability of the Sup35p abundance data generated from all 24 wells for each strain. Sup35p levels were normalized to Pgk1 levels. Indicated are the mean (central line in the boxes and numbers above the boxes), 25th/75th percentiles (box limits), and 10th/90th percentiles (feathers).
