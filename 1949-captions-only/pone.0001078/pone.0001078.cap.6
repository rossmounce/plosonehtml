The other half was methanol-precipitated, resuspended in the same volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer as the non-precipitated sample, and then applied to the same gel. The identical band patterns for the two samples indicate that samples can be precipitated and resuspended without any apparent loss of proteins, with the exception of very large proteins (&gt;150 kDa) which appear to be partially lost or degraded during the precipitation procedure. (B) 25 µg of precipitated protein (representing ~1×10<sup>7</sup> cells) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in order to demonstrate the suitability of this procedure for efficient SDS removal.</p>
