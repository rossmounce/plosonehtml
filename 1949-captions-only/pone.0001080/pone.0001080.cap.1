                Figure 1.  Higher absolute CD4+ T cell counts in HSV-2+/HIV-1+ subjects independent of HIV-1 viral load.The open blue diamonds represent the CD4+ T cell counts, and the open red dots represent HIV-1 viral load over time for persons co-infected with HSV-2 at the time of diagnosis with an early HIV-1 infection. The solid blue diamonds represent the CD4+ T cell counts, and the solid red dots HIV-1 viral load, for those HSV-2 negative at the time of early HIV-1 infection. Observations were right censored at the time anti-retroviral therapy was initiated, which occurred at approximately a CD4+ T cell count of 350 cells/ÂµL.
