                Figure 2.  HSV-2 acquisition after HIV-1 acquisition is not associated with subsequent differences in CD4+ T cell counts or HIV-1 viral load.The open blue diamonds represent the CD4+ T cell counts, and the open red dots represent HIV-1 viral load, over time for persons testing positive for HSV-2 at 1 year after study enrollment. The solid blue diamonds represent the CD4+ T cell counts, and the solid red dots HIV-1 viral load, for those HSV-2 negative at 1 year after study enrollment. Forty-seven of the 85 persons who tested HSV-2 negative at study entry were re-tested. Observations were right censored at the time persons initiated anti-retroviral therapy, which was initiated at approximately a CD4+ T cell count of 350 cells/ÂµL.
