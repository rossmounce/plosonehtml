                Figure 1.  Path Diagram of Insect-Induced Transcriptional Responses.Changes in gene expression which follow wounding or herbivory are causally attributable to the SA, JA, and ethylene regulatory pathways. Three causal variables (ETH, JA, SA; dashed circles) are shown on the left side of the figure, intercorrelated (curved, double headed arrows) due to unknown regulatory and physiological factors (no causal relationship is assumed among these predictor variables). Two response variables (closed circles), DBM (for Plutella xylostella), and TNI (for Trichoplusia ni), are shown on the right side of the figure; wounding is not shown to reduce the figure's complexity. Causal influences are indicated by straight, single headed arrows, which are standardized partial regression coefficients. The input data for these analyses are ratios quantifying induced versus control expression levels at nine hours for the 212 genes showing statistically significant changes in gene expression.
