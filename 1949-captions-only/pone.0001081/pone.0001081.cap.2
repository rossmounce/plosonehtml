<h4>Path Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>For a direct comparison of the transcriptional responses exerted by the two different insects in this study, and to examine causal influences of the phytohormones JA, ethylene and SA, we conducted a path analysis. Path analysis is a statistical method closely related to multiple regression, and designed to examine statistical consequences of biological models of causal relationships among variables <a href="#pone.0001081-Wright1">[52]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001081-Wright2">[53]</a>. Data for analysis of hormone response coefficients is based on significant expression changes for 212 cDNAs in relationship to unmanipulated controls, with the genes as the unit of replication. Highly significant correlated changes in gene expression are observed among three causal and three response traits (<a href="#pone-0001081-t002">Table 2</a>; all p&lt;0.001 with Bonferroni correction for multiple tests). Correlations among hormone responses were uniformly positive. Responses to ethylene and SA showed the strongest positive correlations (r = 0.79). Although SA and JA pathways are often considered to act antagonistically <a href="#pone.0001081-Bostock1">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001081-Felton1">[9]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001081-Tamaoki1">[54]</a>, nevertheless, their overall correlated expression changes were significantly positive.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p2"></a><p>The correlations between hormone responses and insects or wounding are attributable to a combination of direct and indirect causal pathways, and hormone response coefficients allow us to identify causal influences within these composite correlations. For example, the positive correlation between SA induction and <em>T. ni</em> responses (0.46, <a href="#pone-0001081-t002">Table 2</a>) can be partitioned into the summation of direct and indirect pathways:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001081.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br></p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p3"></a><p>Direct effects of the SA pathway on <em>T. ni</em> - induced changes (<em>H<sub>TS</sub></em> = 0.004), are negligible, whereas the total indirect effects (<em>r<sub>SE</sub></em>×<em>H<sub>TE</sub>+r<sub>SJ</sub></em>×<em>H<sub>TJ</sub></em> = 0.456) result primarily from the strong correlation between SA and ethylene responses, which in turn have direct effects on induced responses to <em>T. ni</em>. Thus, <a href="#pone-0001081-g001">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0001081-t003">Table 3</a> show that <em>H<sub>PS</sub></em> is 0.287 for <em>P. xylostella</em>, but <em>H<sub>TS</sub></em> = 0.004 for <em>T. ni</em>. This means that transcriptional responses to <em>P. xylostella</em> are equivalent to 28.7% of SA-induced effects, but in <em>T. ni</em> these transcriptional changes correspond to only 0.4% of salicylate-induced changes. Thus, transcriptional responses to <em>P. xylostell</em>a are primarily determined by direct effects of the ethylene and SA pathways, while <em>T. ni</em> induced changes are attributable primarily to direct effects of the ethylene and JA pathways. Hormonal control of herbivore-induced changes differs significantly between <em>P. xylostella</em> and <em>T. ni</em> (P&lt;0.01 by analysis of covariance; <a href="#pone-0001081-t004">Table 4</a>). Finally, wound-induced changes in gene expression are influenced by all three pathways, although JA has the strongest direct effects (<a href="#pone-0001081-g003">Figure 3</a>).</p>
