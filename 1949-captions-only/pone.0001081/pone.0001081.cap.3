                Figure 3.  Hormone Response Coefficients for Wound-, T. ni-, and P. xylostella-Induced Changes.Hormonal control differs significantly between T. ni and P. xylostella (P&lt;0.01 by ANCOVA). Wound-induced changes in transcript levels are influenced by all three hormonal pathways, although JA has the strongest direct effects.
