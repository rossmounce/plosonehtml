                Figure 1.  Imaging SARS-CoV, Vero E6 cells, and ACE2.(A) Vero E6 cells stained with propidium iodide. Light microscopy shows a syncytium (white arrow) in the center of the field of view (top), viewed under propidium iodide fluorescence (middle), and an overlay of both images (bottom). (B) Immuno-EM with 10 nm gold confirmed the attachment of ACE2 to the spikes. (C) Cryo-EM field of view of SARS-CoV decorated with ACE2, and select two-dimensional class averages of the SARS spike-ACE2 complex (D). Cryo-EM reconstruction of the SARS spike (E), and SARS spike-ACE2 complex (F), viewed from side and end-on perspectives (left, right). Color scheme: ACE2, violet; spike, green; stalk, blue; envelope, beige; nucleocapsid, red. Scale bars: (A) 50 µm, (B,C) 1000 Å, (D–F) 100 Å.
