                Figure 2.  Estimate of resolution of the SARS spike-ACE2 complex.The resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between two half reconstructions of the SARS spike-ACE2 complex. The resolution was estimated to be 18.5 Ã… using the 0.5 FSC criteria (red dotted red line).
