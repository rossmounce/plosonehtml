The positive component attributed to the SARS spike in (B,G) indicates a re-arrangement in the S2 core, and the positive component attributed the SARS-CoV–ACE2 complex shows the addition of ACE2 and an exterior re-arrangement in S1 (D,I). The net difference map is presented in (C,H). The structures are presented from a side perspective (A–E), and end-on perspective (F–J). The arrows in (F) and (J) illustrate the mass reorganization that occurs in the central axis of the spike where one small central blob splits into three nubs. In (A,F) the region on the spike adjacent to ACE2 which corresponds to the receptor binding domain, has been highlighted with a dotted line and is colored purple. The color scheme used for the cryo-EM structure is the same as in <a href="#pone-0001082-g001">Figure 1</a>. Scale bar, 100 Å.</p>
