                Figure 4.  Merging cryo-EM and atomic resolution 3D structures.The atomic resolution structures; PDB ID code, 2AJF (ACE2, blue; receptor-binding domain, red) and PDB ID code, 2FXP (yellow) were docked within the SARS spike-ACE2 complex using SITUS. The SARS spike-ACE2 complex is shown from (A) side and (B) end-on perspectives, the arrow points to the C-terminus of ACE2. The color scheme used for the cryo-EM structure is the same as in Figure 1. Scale bar, 100 Ã….
