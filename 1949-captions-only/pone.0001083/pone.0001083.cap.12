                Figure 12.  Distribution of reorientation angle, Î², in the Central Zone (black line) and the Rim Zone (red line).In both zones, the fly prefers to walk in the same direction after a stop as it was heading before the stop. Because the peak at zero is so large for both zones (&gt;0.1), the plot has been truncated to better display the characteristics of the distribution. Bin size: 5 degrees.
