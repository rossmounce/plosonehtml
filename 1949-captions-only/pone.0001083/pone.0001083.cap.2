                Figure 2.  Position and speed characteristics of a fly moving in a circular Open Field arena.(a) The trajectory obtained from tracking a fly for two hours using the setup shown in Fig. 1. (b) The speed of the fly between 1150 and 1200 s, calculated by taking a numerical derivative of the smoothed position data. The stop-start behavior characteristic of fly locomotor activity is evident.
