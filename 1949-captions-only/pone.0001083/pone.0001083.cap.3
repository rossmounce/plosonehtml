There appeared to be little angular preference, but the preference for the arena wall (<em>r</em> = 7.5 cm) is evident. (b) Marginal radial probability distribution <em>p(r)</em>. The histogram was obtained by binning <em>r<sup>2</sup></em> in bins of size 1.13 cm<sup>2</sup> (50 total bins). This estimate suggests defining a boundary between a Rim Zone and Central Zone at approximately <em>r</em> = 7.3 cm.</p>
