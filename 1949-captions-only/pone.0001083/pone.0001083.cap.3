                Figure 3.  Spatial preference for a fly in the circular Open Field arena.(a) The joint probability distribution p(r,̂) obtained using a bin size of 1° in ̂, 0.05 cm in r. There appeared to be little angular preference, but the preference for the arena wall (r = 7.5 cm) is evident. (b) Marginal radial probability distribution p(r). The histogram was obtained by binning r2 in bins of size 1.13 cm2 (50 total bins). This estimate suggests defining a boundary between a Rim Zone and Central Zone at approximately r = 7.3 cm.
