                Figure 5.  The probability distributions of velocities tangential to and normal to the wall in the Rim Zone.The fact that the normal (radial) velocity is concentrated near zero suggests that the Rim Zone motion should be treated as one-dimensional. The peak at zero for the normal velocity distribution reaches up to p = 5.93, and is eliminated for clarity.
