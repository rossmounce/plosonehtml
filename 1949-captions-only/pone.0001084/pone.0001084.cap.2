                Figure 2.  (a) Effects of predator presence and oxygen availability on the development of the external gills of salamander larvae.(b) Low-oxygen tolerance of salamander larvae reared under predator presence or absence, and high- or low-oxygen treatment. Open and solid squares indicate that rearing condition of larval salamander is the high-oxygen treatment and the low-oxygen treatment, respectively. Error bars indicate Â±1 s.e.m.
