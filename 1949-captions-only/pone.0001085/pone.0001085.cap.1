                Figure 1.  Nitric oxide caused loss of sumo conjugates.(A) HEK293 cells transfected with HA-SUMO1, 2 or 3 were treated with 500 µM GSNO for 4 h, lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with αHA or α actin. Asterisk: free SUMO1/2/3. (B) Time-dependent effect of GSNO on SUMO1 conjugates in transfected HEK293 cells, treated as in (A). In a control experiment, cells were treated with H2O2 (1 mM) for 1h. (C) HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GSNO for 4 h, lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with αSUMO1, αubiquitin or αactin. (D) RAW264.7 cells pretreated with or without SMT were stimulated with LPS for 24 h, lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with αSUMO1, αiNOS or αactin.
