                Figure 2.  S-nitrosation of Ubc9 did not compromise its SUMO E2 enzyme activity.(A) S-nitrosation of HA-Ubc9 (wild-type or cysteine mutants) in HEK293 cells stimulated with 500 µM GSNO determined by biotin-switch assay. (B) HeLa cells were incubated with 500 µM H2O2 for 30 min or 500 µM GSNO for the indicated time, lysed in Laemmli buffer with (lower blot) or without (upper blot) DTT, and immunoblotted with αUbc9. (C) HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, treated with H2O2 (for 1h) or GSNO (for 4 h), lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with αp53 or αactin.
