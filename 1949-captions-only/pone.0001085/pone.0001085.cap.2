(B) HeLa cells were incubated with 500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min or 500 µM GSNO for the indicated time, lysed in Laemmli buffer with (lower blot) or without (upper blot) DTT, and immunoblotted with αUbc9. (C) HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (for 1h) or GSNO (for 4 h), lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with αp53 or αactin.</p>
