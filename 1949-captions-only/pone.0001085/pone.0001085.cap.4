Both longer and shorter exposures are shown. Bracket: poly-ubiquitinated Pias3; Arrow: mono-ubiquitinated Pias3. (B) Effect of GSNO on Pias3-Trim32 interaction determined by GST-pull down assay. GST-Pias3 fusion proteins, immobilized on beads, were mixed with cell lysates with GFP-Trim32 expression in the absence or presence of 500 µM GSNO. Pull-downed and input GFP-Trim32 was analyzed by immunoblotting. (C) Confocal microscopic analysis of subcellular localization of Myc-Pias3 and GFP-Trim32 in cotransfected HEK293 cells. 4 h after transfection, cells were incubated with or without LMB for 16 h. (D) HeLa cells transfected with or without GFP-Trim32 were stimulated with or without GSNO for 4 h and then the denatured lysates were immunoprecipitated with αPias3, followed by detection for Ub. Bracket: poly-ubiquitinated Pias3; Arrow: mono-ubiquitinated Pias3; Asterisk: unmodified Pias3. (E) HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were stimulated with or without GSNO for 1 h and then subjected to His-Ub pull down. Bracket: ubiquitinated GFP-Trim32. In panels (A), (C), (D) and (E), cells were incubated with MG132 to prevent potential protein degradation.</p>
