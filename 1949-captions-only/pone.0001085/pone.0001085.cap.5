                Figure 5.  S-nitrosation of Pias3 and its effects on Pias3-Trim32 association.(A) S-nitrosation of GFP-Pias3 in HEK293 cells stimulated with 500 µM GSNO determined by biotin-switch assay. (B) Recombinant Pias3 was exposed to 100 µM GSNO and blocked with MMTS. In-gel digested Pias3 was subjected to Nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. (C) Effect of GSNO on Pias3(C459S)-Trim32 interaction determined by GST-pull down assay.
