The first row of numbers refers to the different haplotypes at, respectively, microsatellites UMN0304, UMN113, and INRA189. The second row of numbers refers to the haplogroup frequencies in KNP and HiP respectively. The minimum number of mutations is indicated if this is greater than one, roughly corresponding to the length of the connecting line. Grey haplogroups: the three most frequent haplogroups. Dashed lines: alternative connections.</p>
