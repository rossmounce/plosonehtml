Black diamonds: mean annual rainfall in the three years before birth. Open diamonds: rainfall in the second year before birth. Grey diamonds: rainfall in the year of birth. Error bars: standard error (<span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001086.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>), except for the two lowest data points of haplogroup {1,1,2} in which the haplogroup was observed only once. Here they correspond to a chance ≥84% of sampling ≤1 (positive error bar) or ≥1 haplogroup (negative error bar). Sample sizes were equalized as much as possible.</p>
