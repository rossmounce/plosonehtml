Here they correspond to a chance ≥84% of sampling ≤1 or 2 (positive error bar) or ≥1 or 2 haplogroups (negative error bar). Years of birth 1987, 1990, 1992 and 1994 consist of pooled years because of the small sample size (with the <em>x</em> axis corresponding to the average year of birth). Years of birth were pooled with similar amounts of rainfall in the preceding three years (difference&lt;69 mm/year).</p>
