C, Measurements of the corneal epithelium thickness show the thinning caused by basonuclin-null mutation is highly significant (n = 6, p&lt;0.001). DAPI staining of nuclear DNA (the arrow shows an example) shows that compared with the control (D), basonuclin-null (E) corneal epithelium has ~15% fewer cells (F) (n = 6, p&lt;0.05), whereas the cell numbers in stroma are the same (G). The reduced epithelial cell number is likely caused by a reduced cell proliferation. Compared with the control (H), the basonuclin-null (I) epithelium contained ~25% fewer Ki67 antigen-positive cells (J) (n = 6, p&lt;0.05). The arrow in H shows an example of Ki67-positive cells. The statistical analyses represent the average of six mice for each genotype. The code of statistical significance is given at the lower right corner. All images are of the same magnification. Scale bar in B equals 30 micron.</p>
