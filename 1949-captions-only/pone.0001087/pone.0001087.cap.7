The model also proposes a regulatory feedback loop in controlling corneal epithelial thickness. Any perturbation (e.g., thinning) in corneal thickness would be counterbalanced by adjustment in the rate of cell proliferation. The model is based on previous reports on null mutations of Pax6, KFL4, AP2alpha, HMGN1 and this work (Bnc1) (See text for the description).</p>
