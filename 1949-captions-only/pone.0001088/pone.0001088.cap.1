                Figure 1.  Locations of sampling sites for S. invicta in South America.The native range of the species is indicated by gray shading on the map. The number of nests sampled at a site ( = number of sequences obtained) is indicated in parentheses in the key to the sites if greater than one. Sites at which b-like alleles were found are highlighted with black rectangles; those at which the b alleles of the b-like class were found are underlined.
