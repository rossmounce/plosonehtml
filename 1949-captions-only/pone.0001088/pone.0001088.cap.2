                Figure 2.  Summary hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of fire ant Gp-9 sequences based on Bayesian inference.Sequences from species other than S. invicta are indicated by specific abbreviations in gray. Sequences from S. invicta are indicated by dots; the identity and social form (M, monogyne; P, polygyne; ?, unknown) of the colony of origin are also indicated for critical sequences. All colonies from which alleles of the b-like clade were recovered were confirmed to be polygyne. Inferred amino acid replacements at three codons considered to be diagnostic for b-like alleles are mapped onto the phylogeny (reversals are indicated by bars with cross-hatching). Posterior clade probabilities &gt;50% are indicated as percentages below branches.
