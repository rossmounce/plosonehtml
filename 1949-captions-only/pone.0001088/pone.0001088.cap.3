                Figure 3.  Nucleotide variation along Gp-9 and its 3′ flanking region in all Solenopsis study species.The top graph shows the number of different nucleotides at each position; the bottom graph shows the mean number in a 25-bp sliding window moved by 10-bp increments. Blue shading indicates approximate positions of exons (E1-E5) and pink shading indicates the 3′-UTR. Introns are designated by I1-I4.
