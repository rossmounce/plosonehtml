                Figure 5.  Sequence logos for variable amino acids encoded by unique Gp-9 sequences in all Solenopsis study species and in the b-like clade.Logos represent each position by a stack of letters, with the height of each letter proportional to the frequency of the amino acid in the recovered sequences. Overall stack height is proportional to the sequence conservation at that position (measured in bits, maximum sequence conservation is 4.3 bits). A schematic of the exon/intron structure of fire ant Gp-9 is shown above the logos. Codons in the highly variable 3â€² portion of exon 5 are demarcated with light blue boxes.
