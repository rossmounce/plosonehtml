Overall stack height is proportional to the sequence conservation at that position (measured in bits, maximum sequence conservation is 4.3 bits). A schematic of the exon/intron structure of fire ant <em>Gp-9</em> is shown above the logos. Codons in the highly variable 3â€² portion of exon 5 are demarcated with light blue boxes.</p>
