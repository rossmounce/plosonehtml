                Figure 6.  Distributions of overall pairwise estimates of dN-dS for Gp-9.Estimates are shown separately for the set of all Gp-9 sequences from the socially polymorphic South American fire ant species (Clade IIIa sequences) as well as for the subsets of all B-like and b-like sequences. Proportions of positive and negative dN-dS values are indicated for each group of sequences.
