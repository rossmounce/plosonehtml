                Figure 1.  Effect of heterogenous nucleating agents.The height of the bar represents the relative difference between the number of crystals observed in the presence and the absence of a heterogeneous nucleating agent, summed over all the proteins tested. Details of the data are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2. “Combined nucleants” refers to a mixture of all 9 nucleants.
