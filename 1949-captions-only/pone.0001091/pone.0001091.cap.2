                Figure 2.  Example of a positive effect of a heterologous nucleating agent on crystallization.(A) Control crystallization drop with no heterogeneous nucleating agent added (glucose isomerase, condition F4: 2% w/v polyethyleneimine, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.5 M sodium chloride). (B) Crystallization drop with identical crystallization conditions as in A, but with horse hair added as a heterogeneous nucleating agent.
