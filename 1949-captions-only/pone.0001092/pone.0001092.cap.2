The control cells, as well as the cells expressing <em>ScALO1</em> and <em>AtLGDH</em> can not accumulate L-ascorbic acid starting from D-glucose, therefore measured values correspond to the endogenous erythro-ascorbic acid. The standard deviation bars correspond to the data obtained from independent clones, and from independent growth and antioxidant determinations. Please note the different scale of the ordinate axes in the two graphs.</p>
