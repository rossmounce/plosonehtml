                Figure 4.  Growth curves of wild type and L-ascorbic acid producing yeasts under acidic stress.Growth curves of wild type and engineered GRF18U and BY strains (upper and lower panel, respectively) inoculated in minimal glucose media at low inorganic pH (panel A) or at low pH plus organic acid (lactic acid, 45g/l, panel B) or at low pH plus organic acid with L-AA added exogenously (panel C). Panels 4A and 4B: • GRF18U wild type; ▪ GRF18U[ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP]; ▴ GRF18U[ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP RnFGT]; ○ BY4742 wild type; □ BY4742 [ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP]; ▵ BY4742 [ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP RnFGT]; Panel 4C: • GRF18U wild type; ○ BY4742 wild type; − GRF18U or BY4742 wild type added with 30mg/l ascorbic acid; * GRF18U or BY4742 wild type added with 60 mg/l ascorbic acid.
