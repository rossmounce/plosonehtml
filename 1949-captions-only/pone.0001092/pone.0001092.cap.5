                Figure 5.  Flow cytometric analysis of wild type and vitamin C producing yeasts under oxidative stress.Panel 5A: schematic representation of the different subpopulations that can be observed in the following panels, where wild type (5B) and recombinant strains (5C and 5D) grown in minimal glucose medium added with H2O2 3.0 mM were analyzed after DHR123 and PI staining (rodamine signal is reported in the abscissa and PI signal on the ordinate axes). Upper panels: GRF18U background. Lower panels: BY background. (B): wild type. (C): [ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP] transformed cells. (D): [ScALO AtLGDH AtME AtMIP RnFGT] transformed cells
