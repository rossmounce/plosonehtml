                Figure 1.  A comparison of DNA copy number genotypes showing Ballele (top) and logR (bottom) simulated data for a) tumour cell line showing 100% changes in each case, and b) tumour biopsy with 80% tumour and 20% stromal (normal) DNA.In each case all common DNA copy number changes are represented (separated by vertical lines) and discussed sequentially within the text.
