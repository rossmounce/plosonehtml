                Figure 2.  Simulated Ballele (top) and logR (bottom) plots showing serial dilution of the a) loss of heterozygousity, and b) amplification (3n) tumour genotypes in the presence of increasing levels of stromal (normal).In each case stromal levels of 0% (pure tumour) to 80% are represented in steps of 10% (separated by vertical lines), along with the normal 2n genotype.
