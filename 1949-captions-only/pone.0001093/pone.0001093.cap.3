                Figure 3.  Estimating AMP &amp; LOH levels in a) real data using b) SiDCoN.Comparison to simulated data indicates that ~60% of cells are AMP or LOH for the indicated regions (thus 40% of cells are normal 2n in each case). These data suggest that this tumour biopsy contains 40% stroma, although more copy number changes across the genome are needed to confirm this.
