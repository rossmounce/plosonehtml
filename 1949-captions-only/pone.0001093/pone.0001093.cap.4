The simulator is particularly useful for explaining LOH/HD combinations in the presence of stroma as seen here. c) another EAC tumour biopsy with changes on a higher background of stroma/normal cells. Manually adjusting the simulator is useful for determining the level of tumour cell involvement in each change.</p>
