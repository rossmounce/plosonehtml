                Figure 4.  Some examples of observed vs simulated chromosomal excerpts showing mixed populations of DNA copy number changes (top) and the manually adjusted simulations of these changes (bottom).a) a melanoma cell line with changes including HD and mix of LOH &amp; HD. b) an EAC tumour biopsy profile which includes LOH, N-LOH and a mix of HD and LOH. The simulator is particularly useful for explaining LOH/HD combinations in the presence of stroma as seen here. c) another EAC tumour biopsy with changes on a higher background of stroma/normal cells. Manually adjusting the simulator is useful for determining the level of tumour cell involvement in each change.
