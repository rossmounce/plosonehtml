                Figure 5.  Screen grabs from SiDCoN showing a) the main “datasheet” interface with space for three DNA copy number genotypes and a stromal component for each SNP, b) the lookup sheet containing information needed for calculations dependent on the copy number genotypes entered and c) the Ballele and logR output, implementing randomised values to visually simulate the look of actual data.
