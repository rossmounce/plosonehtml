                Figure 1.  Brain TV set-up.(a) The online 3D bar plot displays the time-varying power modulations measured at a selected cortical site over the last 10 seconds in three frequency bands (8–30 Hz, 60–90 Hz and 110–140 Hz). The depicted power modulations represent the power for a given frequency expressed in units of standard deviation of a reference power measured during a baseline period. Baseline power is defined during a calibration phase performed at the beginning of the session while the subject was instructed to rest with eyes open. (Note that the white annotations on the figure are not part of the display). (b) The clinical setting: Patient watching a display that provides him with a visual feedback of online power variations picked up by one of his implanted electrodes.
