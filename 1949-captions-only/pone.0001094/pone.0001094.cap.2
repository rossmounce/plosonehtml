The frequency values range from 1 to 200 Hz and the horizontal time axis spans over 3 seconds including 2 s of auditory stimulation (black horizontal bar). Note that, power modulations are given in units of the standard deviation from baseline period (see <a href="#s2">methods</a>) and that the normalization parameters were the same for all maps.</p>
