                Figure 2.  Oscillatory power modulations associated with speech in the mid superior temporal sulcus.Time-Frequency maps representing the time course of spectral power modulations at electrode t'8 (Talairach coordinates : −65, −12, 4) for frequencies up to 200 Hz in each one of the 6 experimental conditions. The frequency values range from 1 to 200 Hz and the horizontal time axis spans over 3 seconds including 2 s of auditory stimulation (black horizontal bar). Note that, power modulations are given in units of the standard deviation from baseline period (see methods) and that the normalization parameters were the same for all maps.
