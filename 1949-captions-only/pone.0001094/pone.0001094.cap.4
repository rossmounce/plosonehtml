Note that this patient had a cardiac pacemaker incompatible with MRI scanning and therefore, the Talairach coordinates of the sites could not be reconstructed with a precision higher than 1 cm along the y and z axis. (b) The spatial location of the recording sites in the coronal plane relative to the Sylvian fissure. (c) Time-Frequency maps depicting the time course of spectral power measured in left (t'4, t'6) and right (t5 and t7) sites for all frequencies up to 200 Hz during the first two seconds of auditory stimulation (black horizontal bar) in response to speech (SPEECH) and music (MUSIC). The baseline is common to the NORMAL and MUSIC conditions. (d) Bar plot display of the mean and standard deviation of the total activation measured in the high gamma (60â€“140 Hz) range during the first two seconds of auditory stimulation, for each one of the eight conditions of the SOUND paradigm.</p>
