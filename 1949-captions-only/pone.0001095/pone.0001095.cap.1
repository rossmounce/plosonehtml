                Figure 1.  Scheme of consensus inference and local inference.After the preprocessing of the microarray data for the long-lived cells versus the wild type, we translate the differentiation into changes of biological activities by consensus and local inference using three kinds of biological instruments: Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, and cellular localization of proteins.
