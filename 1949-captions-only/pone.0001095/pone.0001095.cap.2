                Figure 2.  Non-homogeneous spatial patterns of relative scales.The estimates of the normalization scale in each subarray are shown by their spatial locations. We normalize each of the three target (sch9 mutant) arrays versus each of the three reference (wild type) arrays, and total nine spatial patterns are shown. Each row corresponds to a reference and each column corresponds to a target.
