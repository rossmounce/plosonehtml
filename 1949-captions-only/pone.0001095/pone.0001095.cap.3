                Figure 3.  M-A plots of sub-sub normalization followed by modified median polishing summarization.In the M-A plots, the x, y coordinate value of a dot respectively show the average and difference of a gene expression between the wild type and a mutant. The differentiation for most probe sets of S. pombe are around zero as expected. Black: S. cerevisiae; Magenta: S. pombe. Top: sch9 mutant; Middle: ras2 mutant; Bottom: tor1 mutant. Two horizontal lines at Â±0.15 are also plotted.
