                Figure 5.  Box plots of fold changes between cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosome proteins.The box plots of expression log-ratios for the cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosome proteins in the long-lived mutants with respect to wild type. We also compare the expression differentiation by the Wilcoxon rank test and all three p-values are 0.00.
