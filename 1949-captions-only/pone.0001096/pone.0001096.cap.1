(B) Western blot analyses for GRP94 and GRP78 in MKN45 cells treated with honokiol (a, 20µM; b, 40 µM) in a time-response manner. (C) Comparison of GRP94 protein expression among human gastric cancer cell lines (SCM-1, AGS, N87, and MKN45), tumor isolated from MKN45 cells-inoculated mice (T), normal mouse gastric epithelium tissue (N), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). All results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.</p>
