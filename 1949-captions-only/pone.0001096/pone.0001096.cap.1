                Figure 1.  Effects of honokiol on the expressions of GRP94 and GRP78 in human gastric cancer cell lines.(A) Western blot analyses for GRP94 and GRP78 in MKN45 cells treated with honokiol for 8 h in a dose-response manner. (B) Western blot analyses for GRP94 and GRP78 in MKN45 cells treated with honokiol (a, 20µM; b, 40 µM) in a time-response manner. (C) Comparison of GRP94 protein expression among human gastric cancer cell lines (SCM-1, AGS, N87, and MKN45), tumor isolated from MKN45 cells-inoculated mice (T), normal mouse gastric epithelium tissue (N), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). All results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
