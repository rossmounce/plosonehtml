(A-a) GRP94 expressions in tumors or normal gastric tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry. The sections were stained with GRP94 antibody as described under <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. The expressions of GRP94 proteins in cytoplasm were stained into dark brown. (A-b) Western blotting for determination of GRP94 proteins in tumors with or without honokiol treatment was detected. (A-c) The detection of GRP94 protein expression by Western blotting in MKN45 cells with or without honokiol (40 µM) treatment or in normal gastric tissues was shown. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments. (B) Tumor volume was assessed. Data are presented as mean±SEM (n = 7).</p>
