                Figure 3.  Honokiol induces a GRP94 degradation-associated apoptotic response in human gastric cancer cells.(A) Western blot analyses for PARP and GADD153 in MKN45 cells treated with honokiol for 8 h in a dose-response manner. (B) Time course responses for PARP, GADD153, caspase-7 and caspase-12 in MKN45 cells treated with honokiol (20 ÂµM). Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
