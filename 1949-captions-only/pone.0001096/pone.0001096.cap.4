(B-a) GRP94 protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis in control and GRP94-siRNA-transfected MKN45 cells. (B-b) Honokiol and etoposide induce GRP94 cleavage in MKN45 cells. Cells were treated with 20 µM honokiol and 40 µM etoposide (Etopo.) as indicated for 4 h. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.</p>
