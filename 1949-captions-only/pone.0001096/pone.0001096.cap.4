                Figure 4.  Silencing of GRP94 by siRNA induces cell apoptosis.(A) Apoptosis in GRP94-siRNA-transfected MKN45 cells was analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining as described under Materials and Methods, which was compared with cells treated with honokiol (40 µM) or etoposide (40 µM). (B-a) GRP94 protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis in control and GRP94-siRNA-transfected MKN45 cells. (B-b) Honokiol and etoposide induce GRP94 cleavage in MKN45 cells. Cells were treated with 20 µM honokiol and 40 µM etoposide (Etopo.) as indicated for 4 h. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
