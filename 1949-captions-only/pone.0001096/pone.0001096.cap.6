                Figure 6.  Suppression of calpain activity by calpain inhibitors or c siRNA-calpain-II decreased honokiol-induced cell apoptosis.Human gastric cancer cells were analyzed for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining as described under Materials and Methods. (A) SCM-1 cells were treated with honokiol (HK, 40 µM) for 4 h in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitors (ALLN and ALLM, 50 µM). (B) AGS cells transfected with siRNA-calpain-I- or siRNA-calpain-II were treated with honokiol (HK, 20 µM) for 4 h. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
