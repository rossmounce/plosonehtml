(A) SCM-1 cells were treated with honokiol (HK, 40 µM) for 4 h in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitors (ALLN and ALLM, 50 µM). (B) AGS cells transfected with siRNA-calpain-I- or siRNA-calpain-II were treated with honokiol (HK, 20 µM) for 4 h. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.</p>
