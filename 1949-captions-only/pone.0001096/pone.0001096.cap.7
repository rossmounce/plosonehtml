                Figure 7.  Effects of honokiol on calpain-I and II protein levels and interaction of calpain and GRP94.Cells were treated with honokiol (20–60 µM) for various time courses as indicated. (A) Calpain-I and II protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis in honokiol-treated SCM-1 cells. (B) Primary antibodies for calpain-II and GRP94 were applied to the cells (MKN45 and SCM-1) followed by secondary antibodies coupled with FITC-conjugated or TRITC-conjugated, respectively. Co-localization of two labeled antigens was detected as a single image when the images from both channels were overlaid. (C) Interaction of calpain and GRP94 were detected in N87, AGS, MKN45 and SCM-1 cells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-calpain-II or anti-GRP94 antibodies. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
