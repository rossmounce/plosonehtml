                Figure 8.  Effect of inhibitors of caspases, proteasome and cathepsins on honokiol-induced GRP94 cleavage in SCM-1 cells.Cells were either untreated or pretreated with inhibitors for 1 h followed by 40 µM honokiol treatment for another 24 h. (A) caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK, 25 and 50 µM) or calpain inhibitor (ALLN, 25 µM); (B) cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074-Me, 25 and 50 µM) or cathepsin L inhibitor (cathepsin L inhibitor II, 25 and 50 µM); (C) proteasome inhibitor (MG132, 0.1–10 µM) or calpain inhibitor (ALLN, 25 µM). Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
