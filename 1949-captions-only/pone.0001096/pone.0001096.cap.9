                Figure 9.  Honokiol induces calpain-mediated GRP94 degradation and apoptosis.Western blotting for determination of GRP94 degradation and calpain-I and II expression and activation of caspase-7 and caspase-12 in SCM-1 cells 24 h after honokiol (40 µM) treatment in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitors (ALLN and ALLM, 25 and 50 µM) was detected. In some experiments, SCM-1 cells were transfected with calpain-II-siRNA or control-siRNA. Results shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.
