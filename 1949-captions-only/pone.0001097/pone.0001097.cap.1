                Figure 1.  Phylogeny and clustering of the fHANT-AC.(a) Organismal phylogeny based on rRNA and RPB2 genes (right), and gene phylogeny of the fHANT-AC cluster (left), along with data on internal gene order and extent of clustering (center). Phylograms are from 50% majority rule Bayesian consensus. Shading of genes indicates confirmed expression of sequences in GenBank (dbEST:CF878787.1, CB906451.1, CF872359, CF865713, CB895628). Thick black branches denote strong support for the complete combined sequence (Bayesian posterior probabilities [BPP]&gt;0.95, maximum parsimony bootstrap percentages [MPB]&gt;85), and thick gray branches denote strong support from two of three individual genes (BPP 0.99 and/or MPB 70%). Strong support from maximum likelihood bootstraps ([MLB]&gt;80%) is indicated by an *. Actual support values for critical nodes are in Table 1. Clades labeled A (Ascomycota), B (Basidiomycota) and S (Sordariomycetes) follow James et al. (2006). Contributing phylogenetic analyses are in SI Fig. S1a,b.
