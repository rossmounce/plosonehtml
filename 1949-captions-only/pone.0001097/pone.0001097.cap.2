                Figure 2.  Distribution and phylogeny of HANT-AC gene homologs.(a) Unrooted phylograms of maximum likelihood analyses performed in RaxML-VI-HPC ver. 2.2.3. Support values for critical nodes can be found in Table 2. Contributing phylogenetic analyses are in SI Fig. 2a,b,c. (b) Distribution and clustering of HANT-AC genes in eukaryotes. Clustering indicated if most or all genomes in clade show clustering. Phylogeny of eukaryotes is adapted from Baldauf [57]. 1A homolog similar to bacterial sequences is present in Nematostella vectensis. 2N. vectensis may also possesses bacteria-like nitrite reductase homologs.
