                Figure 1.  Distribution of non-synonymous variations along PCSK9.There are five functional domains in the PCSK9 protein [4]–[6]: 1) a signal peptide (SP) (1~30 aa), 2) a prodomain (31~147 aa), 3) a catalytic domain (148~425 aa), 4) a putative P domain (426~525 aa), and 5) a C-terminal domain (526~691 aa). Gain-of-function mutations are only identified in families with hypercholesterolemia [10] or subjects with high LDL cholesterol levels [17], and loss-of-function mutations in subjects with low levels of LDL cholesterol [15]–[19]. Some non-synonymous mutations have been identified in subjects with either high or low plasma LDL cholesterol [4], [17], and are labeled ‘both’ in the figure. Rare mutations found in families with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia are labeled with an asterisk. The gain-of-function mutations are: S127R, F216L, R237W, D374Y, H417Q, R469W, E482G, F515L and H553R. The loss-of-function mutations are: 14insL, E57K, Y142X, L253F, H391N, Q554E, and C679X. Mutations associated with either high- or low- plasma levels of LDL cholesterol subjects are: R46L, A53V, N425S, A443T, I474V, Q619P, and E670G.
