Gain-of-function mutations are only identified in families with hypercholesterolemia <a href="#pone.0001098-Abifadel1">[10]</a> or subjects with high LDL cholesterol levels <a href="#pone.0001098-Kotowski1">[17]</a>, and loss-of-function mutations in subjects with low levels of LDL cholesterol <a href="#pone.0001098-Shioji1">[15]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001098-Yue1">[19]</a>. Some non-synonymous mutations have been identified in subjects with either high or low plasma LDL cholesterol <a href="#pone.0001098-Benjannet1">[4]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001098-Kotowski1">[17]</a>, and are labeled ‘both’ in the figure. Rare mutations found in families with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia are labeled with an asterisk. The gain-of-function mutations are: S127R, F216L, R237W, D374Y, H417Q, R469W, E482G, F515L and H553R. The loss-of-function mutations are: 14insL, E57K, Y142X, L253F, H391N, Q554E, and C679X. Mutations associated with either high- or low- plasma levels of LDL cholesterol subjects are: R46L, A53V, N425S, A443T, I474V, Q619P, and E670G.</p>
