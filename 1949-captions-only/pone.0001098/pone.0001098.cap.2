The coordinates after 84 should be minus one to be consistent with that in Human reference sequence (NP_777596), since an insertion at position 84 was present in the dusky titi. The signal peptide (SP) domain (1–90) shows the evolution of Leucine (Leu) repeats (15–23) in <em>PCSK9</em>, and the C-terminal domain shows the premature stop codon (X) in the tamarin (686), and dusky titi (689).</p>
