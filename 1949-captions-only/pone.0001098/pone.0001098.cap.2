                Figure 2.  Protein sequence alignment of PCSK9 in 14 primates.“.” Indicates identity to the first sequence (i.e., human) in each alignment. “-” indicates an alignment gap, and “X” indicates a stop codon. The coordinates after 84 should be minus one to be consistent with that in Human reference sequence (NP_777596), since an insertion at position 84 was present in the dusky titi. The signal peptide (SP) domain (1–90) shows the evolution of Leucine (Leu) repeats (15–23) in PCSK9, and the C-terminal domain shows the premature stop codon (X) in the tamarin (686), and dusky titi (689).
