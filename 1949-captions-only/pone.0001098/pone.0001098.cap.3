                Figure 3.  Ratios of dN/dS estimated for the C-terminal domain of PCSK9 in indicated branches of the primate phylogeny.Values of dN/dS along each branch were calculated by using the free-ratio model using the CODEML program in ‘PAML’ [72]. Branch lengths were estimated by maximum likelihood under this model. A dN/dS value of &gt;1 suggests that positive selection has acted along that lineage. ‘Inf’ indicates cases where dS = 0. The phylogenetic tree was deduced from the entire coding sequence of PCSK9.
