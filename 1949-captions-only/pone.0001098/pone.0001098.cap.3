Branch lengths were estimated by maximum likelihood under this model. A <em>d</em><sub>N</sub>/<em>d</em><sub>S</sub> value of &gt;1 suggests that positive selection has acted along that lineage. ‘Inf’ indicates cases where <em>d</em><sub>S</sub> = 0. The phylogenetic tree was deduced from the entire coding sequence of <em>PCSK9</em>.</p>
