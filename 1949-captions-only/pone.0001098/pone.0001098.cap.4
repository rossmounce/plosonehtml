The pairwise ratios of <em>d</em><sub>N</sub>/<em>d</em><sub>S</sub> were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method implemented in the package ‘PAML’ <a href="#pone.0001098-Yang7">[72]</a>. Pairwise combinations of Hominoids (HOM), Old World monkeys (OWM), and New World monkeys (NWM) are plotted; for example, ‘Human’ represents the points that are making comparisons between human and another primate. We plotted the entire sequence, non C-terminal domain, and C-terminal domain separately. The higher pairwise <em>d</em><sub>N</sub>/<em>d</em><sub>S</sub> ratio in the C-terminal domain suggests that this domain is evolving in a non-neutral model, which maybe due to positive selection or relaxed selective constraint in some lineages. The entire sequence and non C-terminal domain of <em>PCSK9</em> showed a net signature of purifying selection.</p>
