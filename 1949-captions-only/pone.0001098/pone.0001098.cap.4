                Figure 4.  Positive selection or relaxed selective constraint of the C-terminal domain of PCSK9.dN is plotted versus dS for all pairwise combinations of primate sequences. The pairwise ratios of dN/dS were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method implemented in the package ‘PAML’ [72]. Pairwise combinations of Hominoids (HOM), Old World monkeys (OWM), and New World monkeys (NWM) are plotted; for example, ‘Human’ represents the points that are making comparisons between human and another primate. We plotted the entire sequence, non C-terminal domain, and C-terminal domain separately. The higher pairwise dN/dS ratio in the C-terminal domain suggests that this domain is evolving in a non-neutral model, which maybe due to positive selection or relaxed selective constraint in some lineages. The entire sequence and non C-terminal domain of PCSK9 showed a net signature of purifying selection.
