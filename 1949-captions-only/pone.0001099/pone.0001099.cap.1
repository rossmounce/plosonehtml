                Figure 1.  Barrier activity is a general property of tDNAs .A. (Upper) Representation of S. pombe centromere 1 (cen1). The central core (black) is surrounded by inverted repeats including the inner repeat (imr1; red) and outer repeats (otr1-; light blue, navy and purple). Black vertical lines within imr represent tDNAs in cen1. (Lower) Map of cen1 tDNAAla (green) and surrounding sequence. The ura4+reporter gene (ORF,yellow arrow; surrounding sequence, black line) was inserted into imr1 of cen1. PCR primers are shown as black arrows. B. Illustrations to the left of the graph as above. tDNA alanine (green), isoleucine (gray) and glutamine (light blue) are represented as colored triangles in imr1. Real time RT-PCR analysis of centromeric ura4+ transcription was normalized to endogenous ura4+transcription and compared among indicated strains. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM).
