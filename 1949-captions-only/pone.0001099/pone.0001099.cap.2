                Figure 2.  Barrier activity requires the RNA polymerase III complex.A. Chromatin IP analysis of cen1 for enrichment of Sfc6 (TFIIIC) and Rpc130 (Pol III). The X-axis represents 1.5 kb of cen1 imr including tDNAAla (green) and nearby tDNAGlu (white). Centromere specific primers are listed in Materials and Methods. Error bars represent SEM. B . Real time RT-PCR analysis of centromeric ura4+ transcription normalized to endogenous ura4+ transcription in strains containing wild-type or mutant barriers (Left). Indicated strains were analyzed by chromatin IP for Sfc6 (Middle, dark gray) and Rpc130 (Right, light gray) enrichment. Error bars represent SEM.
