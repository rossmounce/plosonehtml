Boundaries of the distinct chromatin domains (dark blue, heterochromatin; pink, euchromatin) are fluid and established through counteracting processes dependent upon the local concentrations of activators and repressors. B. Inverted Repeat barriers are transcribed by RNA pol II (orange arrow) and associated with active chromatin modifications. C. B-box barriers associate with TFIIIC (red star) and coalesce at the nuclear periphery. D. cen tDNA barriers distinguish pericentromeric heterochromatin from centromeric chromatin and require association of both TFIIIC and RNA Pol III (green circle).
