<h4>Preparation of samples</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Simulated TB culture materials were prepared for each experiment by inoculating each well of a 24-well MODS plate with 500 µL of a known concentration of <em>Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin</em> (BCG). BCG was used for reasons of safety and because BCG has been shown to be of similar susceptibility to UV radiation as wild-type <em>M tuberculosis</em><a href="#pone.0001100-Riley2">[9]</a>. Suspensions of BCG were prepared from log dilutions of MacFarland 1.0 turbidity standard, containing 3×10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming-units (CFU)/mL, using Middlebrook 7H9+10% OADC (oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase) nutrient broth. Tween 80 (1%) was used to prevent cell clumping. Three different dilutions were prepared for each experiment.</p>


<h4>Experiments</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>On each day of experimentation, 24-well plates were inoculated such that groups of 8 wells each contained one of three different concentrations of BCG (ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>/mL). Experiments with the cooker were performed during the southern hemisphere winter month of August 2006, outdoors in the town of Chosica (20 miles east of Lima, 11°55′ south of the equator). Plates (in plastic ziplock bags within sealed autoclave bags) were placed in the cooker, which had been positioned facing the direction of the sunlight.and allowed to pre-warm to at least 80°C. One plate, containing three groups of 8 wells with differing concentrations of BCG, was removed at each of a set of designated time points over the course of a day of experimentation. In order to test the capacity of the cooker extensively, we varied the time points at which plates were removed between different experiments on different days; for example, either 2, 4, 6 hours; or 1, 2, 3 hours; or ¼, ½, 1, 2 hours. Retrieved plates were stored in a cool box with icepacks until processing later the same day in the laboratory. As intervention-free controls, identical sets of plates were placed in a control box kept in the shade which had the same dimensions as the cooker but lacked a glass lid and reflective walls, and were removed at each of the same time points. Measurements of temperature using a thermocouple and light intensity using a radiation meter were taken at the beginning and end of each experiment and at each time point.</p>


<h4>Cultures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>The contents of the wells for each concentration were harvested from each plate using a microliter pipette and transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Serial dilutions of the pooled harvested samples in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with OADC were made at 1:1, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 for quantitative culture. Samples were inoculated into MODS plates as previously described <a href="#pone.0001100-Moore1">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001100-Moore2">[3]</a>, incubated at 37°C and read under an inverted light microscope at x40 magnification on days 6, 8, 10, 14 and 21. The time to positivity and the number of CFU recovered from each sample at each time point were recorded. The numbers of mycobacteria in the samples were determined by limiting dilution in liquid media, with microscopic observation for growth of characteristic groups of bacteria. Effective sterilization was defined as plates from which no surviving mycobacteria could be recovered even after prolonged MODS culture of six weeks.</p>


<h4>Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Data were collected in a Microsoft Excel 2003 database. The absolute and relative reductions in CFU counts achieved in the cooker were compared to the control culture plates.</p>

Variability in light intensity had relatively little effect upon the existing temperature within the solar cooker. With the addition of the additional reflector, the length of pre-warming time required for the cooker to reach 80°C was between 15 and 30 minutes. The highest temperature attained inside the cooker was 102°C.</p>
