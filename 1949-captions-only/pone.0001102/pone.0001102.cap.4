                Figure 4.  Immunohistochemistry using anti-TLR 2 antibody in ileal samples.(a) In control group, TLR-2 positive cells were located in the crypts, with weak and apical cytoplasmic staining. (b) In group 2 (scored as scale (b) in H&amp;E-stained sections) and (c) in group 3 combining the 3 factors (scored as scale (d) in H&amp;E-stained sections), a strong cytoplasmic TLR-2 staining was observed in the crypts and in the villi (Original magnification 200×, 400×).
