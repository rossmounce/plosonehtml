                Figure 2.  A schematic diagram of the interlocked feedback system in the Drosophila circadian clock.In the real biochemical reactions, the binding of PER-P:TIM to dCLK:CYC suppresses the transcription for PER and TIM and activates the transcription for dCLK. In this map, PER-P:TIM directly suppresses the transcription of PER and TIM and activates the transcription for dCLK. “:” and “-” indicate binding complexes and modification, respectively.
