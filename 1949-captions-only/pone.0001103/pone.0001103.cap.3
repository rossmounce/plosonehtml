                Figure 3.  Convergence of the logarithmic width of the parameter spectrum for 12 search parameters.One thousand solutions for optimized kinetic parameters were obtained by using the repetition of the two-step search. The black solid line is S[1], the black dotted line A[1] = A[2], the black chain R[1] = R[2], the blue solid line V[1], the blue dotted line V[2], the blue chain D[1], the red solid line P[1], the red dotted line T[1], the yellow solid line K[1], and the red chain K[2].
