The number of the employed clusters is changed from 1 to 6. <em>VarS</em> (Equation 7) is plotted with respect to the solution number. <em>VarS</em> of less than one shows the parameter solutions are included in the employed clusters. The brown line is one cluster employed, the blue line two clusters, the green line three clusters, the yellow four clusters, the red line five clusters, and the black line six clusters.</p>
