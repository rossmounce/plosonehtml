A change ratio of 1.5 was validated (data not shown). The absolute sensitivities are employed. The resulting distributions exclude the models whose oscillations are abolished by parameter perturbations (|sensitivity|&gt;10). The sensitivities with a value of less than 10<sup>−10</sup> are set to 10<sup>−10</sup>. The black circles indicate the minimum, the blue crosses the maximum, and the red triangles the mean, respectively. The kinetic parameters are sorted according to the minimum value of the absolute sensitivities in the descending order. Use of a threshold value of 10<sup>−8</sup> separates the critically influential parameters. (A) Period sensitivity, (B) Amplitude sensitivity.</p>
