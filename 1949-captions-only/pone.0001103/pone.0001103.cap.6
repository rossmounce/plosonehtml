                Figure 6.  Frequency distributions of the period and amplitude in a randomly perturbed oscillator model.The period (A) and amplitude (B) were simulated 10,000 times while all kinetic parameters were randomly varied within a range from 1/1.5-fold to 1.5-fold. The oscillators with a long period (&gt;36 h) are excluded, resulting in the remove of the oscillators with small amplitude.
