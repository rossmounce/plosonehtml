                Figure 7.  Frequency of the CVs of period and amplitude distributions in randomly perturbed oscillator models.For 400 solution vectors (oscillator models), the period and amplitude were simulated 10,000 times by randomly varying all kinetic parameters within a range from 1/1.5-fold to 1.5-fold, resulting in 400 distributions of the simulated period and amplitude. The CVs were calculated for every period and amplitude distribution and the frequency distributions of the CVs for period (A) and amplitude (B) are plotted for 400 oscillator models.
