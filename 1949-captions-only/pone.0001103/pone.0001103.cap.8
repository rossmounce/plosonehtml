The six clusters for the sensitivity distributions and their associated parameter vectors are named sensitivity cluster from 1 to 6 and parameter cluster from 1 to 6, respectively. The models are sorted in the ascending order of the CV value, where the left is highly robust models because their CVs are small. The sensitivity and parameter cluster indexes that each model belongs to are plotted with respect to the model index. The sensitivity cluster (A) and parameter cluster (B) are for the models sorted according to the CV period value. The sensitivity cluster (C) and parameter cluster (D) are for the models sorted according to the CV amplitude value. Note that the number of models is less than 400 because some sensitivity distributions with a very large value (|sensitivity|&gt;10) are excluded.</p>
