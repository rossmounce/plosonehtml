                Figure 9.  A distribution of the mean absolute sensitivity for period and amplitude in highly robust models.The blue and red bars are the period and amplitude sensitivities, respectively. The blue line is the threshold for selecting the critical parameters responsible for period and the red for amplitude. The absolute sensitivity values for ten highly robust models that show the smaller CV values are averaged. The resulting mean sensitivity is normalized by the maximum value. 1:S[1], 2:A[1], 3:R[1], 4:B[1], 5:S[2], 6:S[3], 7:A[2], 8:R[2], 9:B[2], 10:S[4], 11:P[1], 12:K[1], 13:V[1], 14:V[2], 15:T[1], 16:K[2], 17:D[1], 18:D[2], 19:D[4], 20:D[5], 21:D[3], 22:D[6], 23:D[73], 24:S[5], 25:A[3], 26:R[3], 27:B[3], 28:S[6], 29:V[3], 30:V[4], 31:T[3], 32:K[4], 33:D[8], 34:D[9], 35:D[10], 36:D[11].
