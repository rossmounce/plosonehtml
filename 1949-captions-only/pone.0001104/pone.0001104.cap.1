                Figure 1.  Posteromedical cortex (PMC), denoted in red and overlaid on a canonical T1-weighted brain template image in three orthogonal views, was used as an apriori functional region of interest.In this region parameter estimates for activation magnitude showed a lesser-to-greater activation from Control, to MCI, to AD subjects.
