                Figure 2.  Bar graph demonstrates the proportion of activators and deactivators among the four diagnostic groups.The proportion of deactivators was significantly different (p&lt;0.05) across diagnostic groups after adjusting for age, education and baseline MMSE score, with significantly fewer deactivators with increasing cognitive impairment grouping.
