                Figure 3.  Bar graph demonstrates activation magnitude parameter estimate in the PMC region (taken from Figure 1), demonstrating a continuum from control, to MCI-Nonconverter, to MCI-Converter, to AD.There were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) differences between all groups with the exception of the control and MCI-Nonconverter group, and the AD and MCI-Converter group. Note the overall pattern of negative activation magnitude in the Control and MCI-Nonconverter groups, and positive activation magnitude in the AD and MCI-Converter groups.
