<h4>MRI analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>MRI technique has been widely used in studies of experimental epilepsy <a href="#pone.0001105-Fabene2">[11]</a>. MRI experiments were performed using a Bruker Biospec Tomograph equipped with an Oxford, 33-cm-bore, horizontal magnet operating at 4.7 T. Animals were anesthetized with 1% halothane in 1 L of oxygen in air per minute (initial dose: 4% halothane); rectal temperature and heart rate were monitored and were similar in control and post-SE animals. The rats were placed into a 7.2-cm-i.d. bird cage transmitter coil. The signal was received through a 2-cm surface coil, actively decoupled from the transmitter coil, and placed directly on the animal's head. Three mutually perpendicular slices were acquired through the brain as scout images. Five contiguous 2-mm-thick slices were imaged starting 1 mm posterior to the olfactory bulbs using a RARE sequence with TEoff = 65.2, FOV = 4×4 cm<sup>2</sup>, matrix size: 256×128, zero-filled at 256×256.</p>


<h4>rCBV</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>In this experiment an USPIO particle (Sinerem®, kindly supplied by Guerbet, Aulnay-Sous-Bois, France) was used as a contrast agent. Sinerem® is constituted by an iron-oxide core of about 6 nm diameter coated by dextran (coated particle dimensions of about 20 nm) and is characterized by a blood half-time longer than 2 h in rats <a href="#pone.0001105-Dousset1">[12]</a>. Sinerem® (6 mg iron/kg) was dissolved in saline and injected in the tail vein.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>rCBV acquisition protocols and image analysis techniques were as described previously <a href="#pone.0001105-Fabene1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001105-Fabene3">[13]</a>. Briefly, transversal multislice gradient echo images were acquired before and two minutes after administration of Sinerem® with the following parameters: TR = 350 ms, TE = 15 ms, flip angle = 30°, Field of view 4×4 cm<sup>2</sup>, matrix size 256×256, slice thickness = 2 mm. Five continuous slices were acquired.</p>


<h4>rTTP maps</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>First passage images were acquired during the arrival of the contrast agent in the brain. A snapshot flash sequence was used, with TR = 27.9 ms, TE = 10 ms, flip angle = 7°, matrix size 128×32 (zero filled at 128×128). A single slice 2mm thickness was acquired. The time interval among images was 0.2 sec: three images were acquired before and 17 images after the bolus administration of Sinerem.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>The dynamic data were then analyzed to calculate the peak enhancement and especially the relative TTP. The latter parameter is related to mean transit time and blood flow. TTP was evaluated on the signal intensity plot as the time point of maximal signal reduction. Relative TTP was obtained as a difference between TTP and time of arrival TA: rTTP = TTP−TA, where the time of arrival is the time for contrast material to arrive in the brain <a href="#pone.0001105-Yamada1">[14]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>Peak enhancements were calculated by the relation: (SImin-SIpre)/SIpre, where SImin is the signal intensity at the time of maximal signal drop and SIpre is the average signal intensity of three points before contrast administration.</p>


<h4>Histochemical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Free floating sections were washed in PBS at room temperature and permeabilized for 1 hour in PBS containing 0,3% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum, the same solution was used to dilute the antibodies. Subsequently, sections were incubated overnight in a mixture of rabbit polyclonal anti-Agrin with mouse monoclonal anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP; Cymbus Biotechnology LTD, Chemicon International, CA, USA). After washes, sections were incubated in fluorescein (FITC) conjugated affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson Laboratories, INC; Baltimore, PA) and Cy3-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson Laboratories), for two hours at room temperature. Sections were collected on polylysine-coated slides, mounted with N-propyl gallate and viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (543 nm) excitation beams. Sequential acquisition, i.e., one color at a time, was utilized on double-label tissues to avoid side-band excitation of the other fluorophore. Sections treated as above, but in the absence of the primary or secondary antibody, were used as control. To label injured neurons, the Dark Neuron stain method was used as described by others <a href="#pone.0001105-1">[15]</a>.</p>


<h4>Transmission Electron Microscopy</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>For ultrastructural analysis, dissected tissue blocks from 16 animals (4 animals per group) were fixed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, for 2 hours at 4°C. After rinsing in 0.1 M PB, the specimens were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in PB for 1 hour, dehydrated in graded concentrations of acetone and embedded in a mixture of Epon and Araldite (Electron Microscopic Sciences, Fort Washington, PA, USA). Semithin sections, at 1 µm thickness, were stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections were cut at 70 nm thickness on an Ultracut-E ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung), stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and observed on a Zeiss EM 10 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>


<h4>Vascular Casts</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>Vascular casts were obtained as described in our previous work <a href="#pone.0001105-Sbarbati1">[16]</a>. For the vascular cast preparation, two rats per group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and thoracotomized. A catheter was introduced into the arch of the aorta through the left ventricle and the right atrium was opened. The circulatory system was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and a freshly prepared solution of a low­viscosity resin, Mercox CL-2B (Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) was injected along the same route. Maceration of the brain tissue was performed using a 10% solution of potassium hydroxide until only the resin casts of blood vessels remained. The specimens were rinsed by several passages of distilled water, and then frozen. The casts were freeze-dried (Modulyo, Edwards-Kniese, Marburg, Germany), fixed to stubs with colloidal silver, sputter-coated with gold (MED 010, Balzers), and examined under a SEM (DSM 690, Zeiss).</p>


<h4>MicroArrays</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>mRNA was isolated from the cingulate cortex of 4 rats in each group. Tissue was selected in supragranular and subgranular layers. The mRNA was used as the template for generating a cDNA library. cRNA labeled with dUDP-biotin (Enzo Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannhein, Germany) has been retro-transcripted. dUDP-biotin-cRNA was purified by and hybridizated on different OligoGEArrays containing probes specific for genes implicated in signal transduction pathways (95 genes, 2 blanks, 6 negative controls, 9 positive controls) (Oligo GEArray Rat Apoptosis Microarray ORN-014, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation), apoptosis (96 genes, 1 blanks, 6 negative controls, 9 positive controls) (Oligo GEArray Rat Apoptosis Microarray ORN-012, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation) and DNA-damage response (113 genes, 2 blanks, 4 negative controls, 9 positive controls) (Oligo GEArray Rat Apoptosis Microarray ORN-029, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation). The hybridization pattern was revealed by CDP-Star® substrate fluorescence using Chemiluminescent Detection Kit and recorded on a X-ray film.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2"></a><p>All the steps of the procedure were performed using reagent kits purchased by SuperArray® Bioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA) and closely following manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p3"></a><p>The film was acquired using a desktop scanner and saved as a grayscale TIFF file. Data from array were analyzed using GEArray Analyzer software (Superarray Bioscience Corporation).</p>


<h4>Statistical evaluation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>For MRI data analysis, the difference between T2W and rCBV values obtained in control vs pilocarpine-treated rats was evaluated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the LSD post-hoc test, setting the significance at p&lt;0.05. The same statistical approach was used for immunohistochemical and vascular cast analysis.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2"></a><p>For microarrays analysis, genes with values &lt;0.20 were considered to be “not expressed”. Differences of expression of 1.5-fold or more between the lineages under analysis were considered significant. A cross-validation between different arrays is provided.</p>

<h4>Cerebral blood volume and rTTP</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Compared to controls, animals pilocarpine-treated showed a specific laminar pattern in rCBV distribution, with increased values in the more superficial layers (control: 0.32±0.13 a.u.; epileptic: 0.63±0.16 a.u.; p&lt;.0001) and decreased in rCBV values in the deeper layers (control: 0.21±0.07 a.u.; epileptic: 0.11±0.05 a.u.; p&lt;.0001). The decreased rCBV values indicate an ischemic area (<a href="#pone-0001105-g001">Fig. 1</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>rTTP was used as a surrogate measure of mean transit time <a href="#pone.0001105-Yamada1">[14]</a>, to evaluate blood flow alterations in epileptic vs control brains. rTTP maps show a generalized increase (about 0.4 secs) in blood flow rate in epileptic vs control brains, with a spatially distinct pattern (<a href="#pone-0001105-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Maximal signal drop values, obtained by first passage technique, resemble those obtained by images acquired at the equilibrium distribution of USPIO (all rCBV maps reported in <a href="#pone-0001105-g002">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
