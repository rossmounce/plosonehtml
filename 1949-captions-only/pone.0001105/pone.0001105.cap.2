Overlay rTTP maps on source images showing a generalized increase in blood flow rate in pilocarpine-treated (B) versus control brain (A). These alterations in the cerebral cortex of pilocarpine-treated rats present a specific spatial distribution (supra- (red arrow) versus sub-granular layers (blue arrow)).</p>
