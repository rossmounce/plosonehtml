                Figure 4.  Agrin expression in control (A) and pilocarpine-treated (B) animals.Increased agrin expression in the endothelial cells is evident in both superficial and deeper layers 2 h after SE-onset. This increase was more evident in the supergranular than in the subgranular layers. Localization of GFAP-like immunoreactivity revealed a selective increase in astrocytic GFAP expression in the less acutely damaged superficial layers (square).
