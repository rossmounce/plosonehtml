                Figure 5.  EM images in control animals and 2 h and 24 h after SE in both supergranular (A, A′, A″) and subgranular levels (B, B′, B″).Subgranular layers are characterized of profound tissue damage 2 h after SE (B′) whereas supergranular layers at this time point appear to be normal except for the perivascular edema (A′). Twenty-four h after SE pathological evidences are detectable in both areas (A″′, B″′).
