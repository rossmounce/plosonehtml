                Figure 2.  SDS-PAGE of recombinantly expressed garden warbler cryptochrome (shown for gwCry1a protein).A Coomassie stained SDS gel, and B Western-blot (with α-Cry1 antiserum from immunised goat), both showing identical fractions of the IMAC purification process. gwCry1a (628 aa) is recognisable as a distinct band at ~62 kDa in both the coomassie stained SDS gel and on the Western-blot (indicated by the arrowhead to the right). 1: gwCry1a lysate (protein extract from insect cell pellet, 1:10 dilution); 2: gwCry1a cleared lysate (centrifuged and filtered lysate, 1:10 dilution); 3: gwCry1a flow through (after sample loading on column, 1:10 dilution); 4: gwCry1a elution step1 (e1) [75% imidazole]; 5: gwCry1a elution step2 (e2) [100% imidazole] protein quantity for e2 is 5 µg; 6: negative control (recombinantly expressed human La/SSB autoantigen; ~48 kDa) confirms the specificity of the antibody.
