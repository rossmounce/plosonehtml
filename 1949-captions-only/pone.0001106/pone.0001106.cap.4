                Figure 4.  Sequence alignment between different members and species within the cryptochrome/photolyase protein family.A Sequence alignment of Cry1a of two migratory songbird species Sylvia borin (Garden warbler; GenBank accession no. AJ632120), Erithacus rubecula (European robin; AY585716), Cry1 of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress; Q43125) and DNA photolyase of Escherichia coli (P00914). The alignment shows that all three members of the Trp-triad electron transfer chain known to be involved in intraprotein electron transfer during signalling through photoreduction in both E. coli photolyse and AtCry1 are clearly present in the Cry1a sequences of both migratory bird species (Trp-397, Trp-374, Trp-321). B Reaction scheme for gwCry1a (adapted from a very similar scheme for AtCry1 proposed by Giovani et al. [36]). Processes directly observed here are represented by solid arrows. Other steps are indicated by dashed arrows [36]. The excited state of the FAD is assumed here to be a singlet; an almost identical scheme would result if, instead, triplet FAD were assumed to be the photoactive excited state. Singlet-triplet interconversion in the [FADH• Trp•] radical pair is indicated by the curved block arrows. D and A are respectively an external electron donor and acceptor.
