AJ632120), <em>Erithacus rubecula</em> (European robin; AY585716), Cry1 of <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> (mouse-ear cress; Q43125) and DNA photolyase of <em>Escherichia coli</em> (P00914). The alignment shows that all three members of the Trp-triad electron transfer chain known to be involved in intraprotein electron transfer during signalling through photoreduction in both <em>E. coli</em> photolyse and <em>At</em>Cry1 are clearly present in the Cry1a sequences of both migratory bird species (Trp-397, Trp-374, Trp-321). B Reaction scheme for <em>gw</em>Cry1a (adapted from a very similar scheme for <em>At</em>Cry1 proposed by Giovani <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0001106-Lin2">[36]</a>). Processes directly observed here are represented by solid arrows. Other steps are indicated by dashed arrows <a href="#pone.0001106-Lin2">[36]</a>. The excited state of the FAD is assumed here to be a <em>singlet</em>; an almost identical scheme would result if, instead, <em>triplet</em> FAD were assumed to be the photoactive excited state. Singlet-triplet interconversion in the [FADH<sup>•</sup> Trp<sup>•</sup>] radical pair is indicated by the curved block arrows. D and A are respectively an external electron donor and acceptor.</p>
