The overlapping area of the Venn diagram represents the number of targets common to both experiments. B) 3′UTR sequences of LARK target RNAs that contain A-rich elements with one or more “ACAAA” motifs. C–E) Comparison of the frequencies of particular sequence features in the entire Drosophila genome, in brain RNAs (those detected in brain total RNA), and0 in LARK targets. C) Frequencies of targets containing an A-rich region. D) Frequencies of target genes containing a large intron; E) Frequencies of targets containing miRNA binding sites. *** p&lt;0.001 based on Chi-square test for equality of distributions. Error bars represent standard error of the binomial distribution.</p>
