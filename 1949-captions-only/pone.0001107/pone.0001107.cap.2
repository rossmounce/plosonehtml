B) Quantification of relative protein amount and RNA level for the two target genes. RNA and protein samples were collected at ZT6, a time at which LARK abundance is high. Protein abundance was normalized to that of MAP Kinase (MAPK). RNA levels were normalized to <em>Ribosomal protein 49</em> (<em>rp49</em>). * n = 5, p&lt;0.05; *** n = 7, p&lt;0.001 based on Student's t-test. Error bar represents SEM.</p>
