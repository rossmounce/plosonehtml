B) Eclosion profiles of <em>E74<sup>BG01805</sup></em> mutant and revertant (<em>E74<sup>R9</sup></em>) populations in LD. Excision of the P-element completely restored the wild-type eclosion profile. Similarly, reversion to the wild type was seen with two other independent P-element excision strains, <em>E74<sup>R3</sup></em> and <em>E74<sup>R6</sup></em> (not shown). C) Eclosion profiles for control and <em>E74<sup>BG01805</sup></em> mutant populations in DD. D) Severe early-eclosion phenotype of transheterozygotes carrying <em>E74<sup>BG01805</sup></em> in trans to a deletion of the gene [Df(3L)81K19]. E) Quantification of the percentage of flies eclosing between ZT10 and ZT22 for various genotypes. * P&lt;0.05, *** P&lt;0.0001 compared to <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em>, based on Chi-sqare test for equality of distributions. F) Representative actograms for <em>w<sup>1118</sup>, E74<sup>BG01805</sup></em>, and revertant males. In all panels of this figure, the light/dark schedule employed for entrainment is indicated by the horizontal white and black bars (LD); DD is indicated by gray and black bars. The total number of flies that eclosed during the experiments are indicated in parentheses for each genotype. Error bars represent standard errors of the binomial distributions.</p>
