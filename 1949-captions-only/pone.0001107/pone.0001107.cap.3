                Figure 3.  A hypomorphic mutation of the E74 gene results in an early-eclosion phenotype but does not affect locomotor rhythmicity.A) LD eclosion profiles for control and E74BG01805 homozygous populations. B) Eclosion profiles of E74BG01805 mutant and revertant (E74R9) populations in LD. Excision of the P-element completely restored the wild-type eclosion profile. Similarly, reversion to the wild type was seen with two other independent P-element excision strains, E74R3 and E74R6 (not shown). C) Eclosion profiles for control and E74BG01805 mutant populations in DD. D) Severe early-eclosion phenotype of transheterozygotes carrying E74BG01805 in trans to a deletion of the gene [Df(3L)81K19]. E) Quantification of the percentage of flies eclosing between ZT10 and ZT22 for various genotypes. * P&lt;0.05, *** P&lt;0.0001 compared to w1118, based on Chi-sqare test for equality of distributions. F) Representative actograms for w1118, E74BG01805, and revertant males. In all panels of this figure, the light/dark schedule employed for entrainment is indicated by the horizontal white and black bars (LD); DD is indicated by gray and black bars. The total number of flies that eclosed during the experiments are indicated in parentheses for each genotype. Error bars represent standard errors of the binomial distributions.
