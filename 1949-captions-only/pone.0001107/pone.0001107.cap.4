                Figure 4.  Overexpression of LARK suppresses the mutant eclosion phenotype of E74BG01805 populations.A) Eclosion profiles of E74BG01805 and E74BG01805, UAS-lark23A populations. The total number of flies that eclosed during the experiments are indicated in parentheses for each genotype. B) Percentages of flies eclosing between ZT10 and ZT22 are quantified for various genotypes. The data in panel B for the E74 and UAS-lark23A E74 populations are from day one of the results shown in panel A. For panel B, n = 86 for UAS-lark(23A)E74. n = 183 for UAS-lark(94A); E74. n = 2544 for w1118. n = 1963 for E74. *** P&lt;0.0001 compared to all other genotypes, based on Chi-sqare test for equality of distributions. Error bars represent standard error of the binomial distribution. E74 refers to E74BG01805 ; 94A and 23A are two different independent strains carrying UAS-lark transgenes [28].
