                Figure 5.  E74A protein shows diurnal changes in abundance.Western Blots show detection of the E74A (upper panel) and LARK (lower panel) proteins at ZT15 and ZT23 in pharate adults overexpressing LARK under control of the elav-gal4 driver. Similar results were observed in two independent experiments.
