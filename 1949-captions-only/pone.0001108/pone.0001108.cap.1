In the PG tasks (PGS and PGL), they grasped the stimulus with a PG; in the WHG tasks (WHGL and WHGS), they grasped the stimulus with a WHG; in the reaching tasks (RS and RL), they touched the stimulus the knuckles, with the hand closed like in a fist. Subjects were informed about the movement to perform (PG, WHG or reaching) with a sound delivered through headphones. All actions had to be performed with the right hand. Stimulus dimension was randomized across and within subjects.</p>
