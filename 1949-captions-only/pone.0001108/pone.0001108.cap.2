                Figure 2.  Group statistical map for the contrast comparing type of grasp (PG vs WHG).The contrast revealed difference of activity only within the left aIPS (p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected). The group statistical map is superimposed on the canonical brain of the MNI series in sagittal (a) axial (b), and coronal (c) sections. (d) This panel shows contrast estimate. Talairach coordinates of areas in which the level of activity significantly differed between conditions are reported in Table 1.
