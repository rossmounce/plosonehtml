The group statistical map is superimposed on the canonical brain of the MNI series in sagittal (a), axial (b), and coronal (c) sections. d) This panel shows contrast estimate. Green circles indicate brain areas whose level of activity was significant between conditions. Talairach coordinates for these areas are reported in <a href="#pone-0001108-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
