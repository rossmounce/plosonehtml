                Figure 4.  Group statistical map for the contrast comparing natural and constrained grasp: M1 activation.The contrast revealed differential activation within the left M1 (p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected). The group statistical map is superimposed on the canonical brain of the MNI series in sagittal (a), axial (b), and coronal (c) sections. d) this panel shows contrast estimate. Talairach coordinates for areas in which the level of activity significantly differed between conditions are reported in Table 1.
