                Figure 5.  Graphical representation of the interaction type of stimulus by type of grasp for initiation time and the time of maximum grip aperture.a) The interaction between type of stimulus and type of grasp indicate an increase in initiation time for constrained grasps with respect to natural grasps. b) The interaction between type of stimulus and type of grasp indicate that the time of maximum grip aperture was anticipated for constrained grasps with respect to natural grasps. Dotted lines refer to natural and constrained grasps towards the small stimulus. Solid lines refer to natural and constrained grasps towards the large stimulus.
