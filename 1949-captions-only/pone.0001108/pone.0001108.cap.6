                Figure 6.  Grasp angle for natural and constrained precision grip tasks.a) Pattern of grasp angle for a precision grip movement performed towards the small stimulus (Natural conditions). Please note the consistency of contact points for the index finger and the thumb. b) Pattern of grasp angle for a precision grip movement performed towards the large stimulus (Constrained conditions) Please note that for this task variability for the index finger and the thumb contact points increases.
