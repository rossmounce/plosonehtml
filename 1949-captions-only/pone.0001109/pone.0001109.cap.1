Circles represent paraphyletic position either revealed by previous study (Red) or in the present study (blue) supported by high (&gt;75) bootstrap values (ML and MP) and posterior probabilities, Yellow circles when the relationship between the species is not resolved and potentially paraphyletic. Asterisks represent close lineages (&lt;3%) which occur at localities more distant than 2000 km.</p>
