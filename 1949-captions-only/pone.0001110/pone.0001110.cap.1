The secondary structures of CXCL12γ 1–68 domain and CXCL12α are almost identical (black boxes: α helices, white arrows: β strands, E: extended conformation). (B) <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of CXCL12γ (1 mM, 30°C), on which only non overlapping amide protons were indicated for clarity. Residues from the γ extension are clustered between 8–8.5 ppm <sup>1</sup>H frequency. (C) CXCL12γ 1–68 domain and CXCL12α fold similarly. A good correlation (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 74) is observed between N-H<sup>N</sup> RDCs (CXCL12γ 10–64) with RDCs backcalculated from the CXCL12α structure. (D) <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H heteronuclear NOes, longitudinal (R1; square) and transversal (R2; triangle) relaxation rates on CXCL12γ. CXCL12γ is folded between residues 10 and 64 and the γ extension is disordered with low NOe, R2 and R1 values.</p>
