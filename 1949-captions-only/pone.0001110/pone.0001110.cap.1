                Figure 1.  CXCL12γ has an unstructured C-terminal domain but is identical to CXCL12α in the 1-68 region.(A) Sequences of the wild type and mutant CXCL12α, β and γ isoforms produced and used in this study (mutated residues are underlined). The secondary structures of CXCL12γ 1–68 domain and CXCL12α are almost identical (black boxes: α helices, white arrows: β strands, E: extended conformation). (B) 15N-HSQC spectrum of CXCL12γ (1 mM, 30°C), on which only non overlapping amide protons were indicated for clarity. Residues from the γ extension are clustered between 8–8.5 ppm 1H frequency. (C) CXCL12γ 1–68 domain and CXCL12α fold similarly. A good correlation (Chi2 = 74) is observed between N-HN RDCs (CXCL12γ 10–64) with RDCs backcalculated from the CXCL12α structure. (D) 15N-1H heteronuclear NOes, longitudinal (R1; square) and transversal (R2; triangle) relaxation rates on CXCL12γ. CXCL12γ is folded between residues 10 and 64 and the γ extension is disordered with low NOe, R2 and R1 values.
