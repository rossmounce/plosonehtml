                Figure 3.  The interaction of CXCL12γ with dp4 and dp8 HP derived oligosaccharides reveals two main binding sites.(A) Weighted chemical shift differences √((ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/10)2) of CXCL12γ (0.2 mM) amide protons upon addition of dp4 (0.56 mM magenta) and dp8 (0.5 mM blue). Unassigned amide protons are left blank. Both the core structure and the C-terminus of CXCL12γ are affected upon oligosaccharide interaction. (B) 15N-HSQC in the 1-68 domain of CXCL12γ at 0 (black), 0.13 (red) 0.3 (green) and 0.5 mM (blue) dp4 concentration. (C) 15N-HSQC of CXCL12γ C-terminal residues at 0 (black) and 0.5 mM (blue) dp4 concentration. Highly overlapped C-terminal assignments could not be all followed upon interaction. It is nevertheless obvious that most residues are perturbed upon interaction with HP derived oligosaccharides. (D) Residues 69–98 of CXCL12γ where randomised by Simulating Annealing and manually attached to CXCL12α structure (PDB 1VMC). HP dp4 structure (extracted from PDB 1HPN) is also shown. Chemical shift variations upon dp4 addition are represented on CXCL12γ in yellow, orange, or red (respectively &gt;0.03, 0.04 or 0.08 ppm) and dark grey (not determined). A continuous binding surface is formed on CXCL12γ core domain between R20 and R41 and the last 15 residues of the protein are highly affected by the interaction.
