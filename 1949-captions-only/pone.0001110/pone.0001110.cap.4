                Figure 4.  Analysis of wild type and mutant CXCL12 binding to immobilized GAGs.Binding of wild type and mutant CXCL12 were recorded as in Fig. 2. CXCL12α (26 to 300 nM), β, β-m1, β-m2 (13 to 150 nM), γ, γ-m1, γ-m2 (2.6 to 30 nM) were injected over GAG activated sensorchips and the response in RU was recorded as a function of time.
