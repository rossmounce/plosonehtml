                Figure 7.  Comparative analysis of the CXCR4 binding and signaling properties of CXCL12α and γ.(A) 125I-CXCL12α (0.25 nM) was bound to CXCR4+ CEM cells in the presence of cold CXCL12α (squares), γ (triangle) or γ-m1 (circle). (B) Intracellular calcium mobilization induced by CXCL12α (squares), γ (triangles) isoforms or CXCL12α P2G (line) in A3.01 cells. CXCL12α P2G is a non signaling mutant of CXCL12α. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
