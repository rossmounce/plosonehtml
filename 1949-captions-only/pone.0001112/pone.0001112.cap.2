Cells were grown on culture plates and photographed during exponential growth (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). (B) Anchorage-independent growth of control, DT, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 knockdown cells. One thousand cells were suspended in soft agar and grown for two weeks. Plates were then stained with INT overnight and photographed. Details are given in Methods. (C) Growth rates of control, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells under normal and serum-deficient conditions. Control, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells were seeded (2×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/60mm dish) and grown under normal growth conditions (left panel), and DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells were seeded (5×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/60 mm dish) and grown in serum-deficient medium (right panel). Growth rates in serum-deficient medium were compared to those obtained under normal growth conditions.</p>
