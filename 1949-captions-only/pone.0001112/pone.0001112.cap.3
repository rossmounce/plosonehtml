Harvested cells were stained with anti-BrdU antibody to monitor newly replicated genomic DNA and 7-AAD to monitor whole genomic DNA. (A) Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and (B) quantitated in each phase of the growth cycle by FlowJO. Phases of the growth cycle, G0-G1, S phase (Early S and Late S) and G2-M were shown and the values given represent the percent of the total cell population. Details of the experiments shown in the figure are given in Methods.</p>
