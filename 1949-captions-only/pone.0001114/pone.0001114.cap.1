                Figure 1.  Expression of E6 and E7 in human cervical carcinoma cell lines and of HBx in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by Western blot and effect of MG132 proteasome inhibitor treatment on the levels of E6, E7 and HBx in these cell lines:a) E6 from protein extracts of CasKi cells treated with MG132 for 3 hrs; b) E7 from protein extracts of CasKi cells treated with MG132 for 3 hrs; c) E6 from protein extracts of CasKi cells treated with MG132 for 6 hrs; d) E7 from protein extracts of SiHa cells treated with MG132 for 3 hrs; e) E7 from protein extracts of HeLa S3 cells treated with MG132 for 3 hrs; f) HBX from protein extracts of Hep 3B2.1-7 cells treated with MG132 for 3 hrs.
