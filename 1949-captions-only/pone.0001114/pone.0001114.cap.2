Left panels show light microscopy images of the cells. Heavily damaged cells are marked with arrows. Right panels show immunofluorescent images of the same slides treated with viral protein-specific mAbs followed by FTIC-conjugated polyclonal antibody to mouse IgGs: aâ€“CasKi cells and E6-specific C1P5 mAb, b-Hep 3B2.1-7 cells and HBx-specific 4H9 mAb; c) immunohistochemistry of CasKi tumors. Left panel shows binding of E6-specific mAb C1P5. Right panel shows absence of binding of control mAb 18B7; d) western blot of Hep 3B2.1-7 tumor with HBx-specific mAb 4H9.</p>
