                Figure 2.  Detection of viral antigens in tumor cells and in tumors:a, b) immunofluorescence of fixed and permeabilized tumor cells. Left panels show light microscopy images of the cells. Heavily damaged cells are marked with arrows. Right panels show immunofluorescent images of the same slides treated with viral protein-specific mAbs followed by FTIC-conjugated polyclonal antibody to mouse IgGs: aâ€“CasKi cells and E6-specific C1P5 mAb, b-Hep 3B2.1-7 cells and HBx-specific 4H9 mAb; c) immunohistochemistry of CasKi tumors. Left panel shows binding of E6-specific mAb C1P5. Right panel shows absence of binding of control mAb 18B7; d) western blot of Hep 3B2.1-7 tumor with HBx-specific mAb 4H9.
