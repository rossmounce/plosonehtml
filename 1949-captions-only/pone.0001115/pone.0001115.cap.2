                Figure 2.  LOOCV performance for homotypic cluster detection on Dmel.For each of the 34 TFs, target sequences are scored with Cluster-Buster, using a PWM built from all known binding sites (grey curve) or from all known binding sites except those located in the region being scored (blue curve). Scrambled PWMs are used as negative controls (black curve).
