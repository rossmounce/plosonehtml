The red dotted curve is the negative control. (B) Implementation of network-level conservation by integrating the Cluster-Buster scores on multiple genomes through order statistics. Rank ratios for orthologous sequences (both positive and negative) are obtained for each species separately and are integrated by the order statistics formula. <em>Dmel</em> sequences are finally ranked according to the integrated score. (C) LOOCV performances (AUC values in the y axis) for each TF (x axis), using the <em>Dmel</em> PWM or the phyloPWM. The first two bars represent the scoring on <em>Dmel</em> alone, the next two on all genomes with network-level conservation (NLC), and the last two on all genomes with motif conservation (MC). The TFs are sorted according to decreasing baseline performance (black).</p>
