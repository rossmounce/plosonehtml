                Figure 3.  Integrating HMM-based enhancer scoring across multiple genomes.(A) LOOCV performances of Cluster-Buster (red dashed curve) and STUBBMS (green curve) on two genomes (Dmel and Dpse), Cluster-Buster on all genomes using network-level conservation (NLC) (red curve), and Cluster-Buster combined with motif conservation (MC) (purple curve). The red dotted curve is the negative control. (B) Implementation of network-level conservation by integrating the Cluster-Buster scores on multiple genomes through order statistics. Rank ratios for orthologous sequences (both positive and negative) are obtained for each species separately and are integrated by the order statistics formula. Dmel sequences are finally ranked according to the integrated score. (C) LOOCV performances (AUC values in the y axis) for each TF (x axis), using the Dmel PWM or the phyloPWM. The first two bars represent the scoring on Dmel alone, the next two on all genomes with network-level conservation (NLC), and the last two on all genomes with motif conservation (MC). The TFs are sorted according to decreasing baseline performance (black).
