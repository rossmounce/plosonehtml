Orthologous sites were chosen based on a minimum of either 40% (green curve), 70% (red), 80% (brown), or 90% (orange) identity with the <em>Dmel</em> true binding site. (B) Differences between the AUC values obtained from a <em>Dmel</em> PWM and a phyloPWM, for each TF. TFs with differences above 0.05 are colored orange. PWMs with few sites (y-axis) have greater AUC differences than PWMs with many sites.</p>
