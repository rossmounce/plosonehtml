                Figure 4.  Homotypic cluster detection with phyloPWMs.(A) LOOCV performance for Dmel PWMs (blue curve), and phyloPWMs from all species tested (Dmel, Dsim, Dsec, Dere, Dyak, Dana, Dpse, Dper, Dvir, Dmoj, and Dgri). Orthologous sites were chosen based on a minimum of either 40% (green curve), 70% (red), 80% (brown), or 90% (orange) identity with the Dmel true binding site. (B) Differences between the AUC values obtained from a Dmel PWM and a phyloPWM, for each TF. TFs with differences above 0.05 are colored orange. PWMs with few sites (y-axis) have greater AUC differences than PWMs with many sites.
