Models consisting of combined <em>de novo</em> PWMs with the true experimental PWM are shown for oligo-analysis (dashed orange) and PhyloGibbs (dashed green). Scoring is either done on <em>Dmel</em> alone (thin full lines) or on all species by network-level conservation (NLC) (thick lines and dashed lines). (B) In green and orange are LOOCV performances for scoring with heterotypic models (either species-specific for oligo-analysis or cross-species for PhyloGibbs) on all species including the <em>Dmel</em> PWM (cfr thick full lines in A). Scoring on all species is done by network-level conservation (NLC). In blue is the control, namely NLC using the <em>Dmel</em> PWM alone, without newly discovered motifs.</p>
