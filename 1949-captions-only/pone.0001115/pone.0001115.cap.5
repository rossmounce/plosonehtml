                Figure 5.  LOOCV performances for heterotypic CRM-models.(A) Heterotypic models consist of PWMs obtained by motif discovery on Dmel sequences using MotifSampler (brown curve) or oligo-analysis (orange curve) and on all species using PhyloGibbs (green curve). Models consisting of combined de novo PWMs with the true experimental PWM are shown for oligo-analysis (dashed orange) and PhyloGibbs (dashed green). Scoring is either done on Dmel alone (thin full lines) or on all species by network-level conservation (NLC) (thick lines and dashed lines). (B) In green and orange are LOOCV performances for scoring with heterotypic models (either species-specific for oligo-analysis or cross-species for PhyloGibbs) on all species including the Dmel PWM (cfr thick full lines in A). Scoring on all species is done by network-level conservation (NLC). In blue is the control, namely NLC using the Dmel PWM alone, without newly discovered motifs.
