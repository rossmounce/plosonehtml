                Figure 1.  Trigeminal disinhibition induces facial tactile allodynia.(A) Time course of changes in behavioral responses evoked by dynamic tactile mechanical stimulation (air puff) of the face of intracisternaly strychnine injected rats and aCSF injected rats. (B) Time course of changes in behavioral responses evoked by dynamic tactile mechanical stimulation (air puff) of the hindpaw of intracisternaly strychnine injected rats and aCSF injected rats. Graphs represent the mean response (Â±s.e.m.) of rats to 5 gentle air puffs applied at 10 s intervals. *, P&lt;0.05; ***, P&lt;0.001, strychnine vs. aCSF.
