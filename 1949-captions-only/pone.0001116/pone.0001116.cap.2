                Figure 2.  Direct disinhibition of WDR neurons does not underlie allodynia.(A) Example of the effects of strychnine applied within the Sp5O on responses to light brushing of WDR neuron receptive field (bar). The simultaneous mean arterial blood pressure recording (MAP) is shown on the top of the trace. (B) Graphs illustrating the time-course of changes in firing of Sp5O WDR neurons (left) and the time-course of changes in blood pressure (ΔMAP, right) in response to innocuous Aβ- mediated stimuli (light brushing) after strychnine application within the Sp5O. Results are expressed as mean±SEM, n refers to the number of animals tested (only one neuron per animal was tested). Although WDR neurons displayed higher firing in response to innocuous stimuli after strychnine, blood pressure remained stable.
