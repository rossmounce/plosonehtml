                Figure 3.  Strychnine administered within the superficial MDH disinhibits tactile activities in the Sp5O.(A) Example of the effects of strychnine applied within the superficial MDH on responses of a Sp5O WDR neuron to light brushing of its receptive field (bar). The simultaneous mean arterial blood pressure recording (MAP) is shown on the top of the trace. (B) Graphs illustrating the time-course of changes in firing of Sp5O WDR neurons (left) and the time-course of changes in blood pressure (ΔMAP, right) in response to innocuous Aβ- mediated stimuli (light brushing) after strychnine application within the superficial MDH. Results are expressed as mean±SEM, n refers to the number of animals tested (only one neuron per animal was tested). WDR neurons displayed higher firing in response to innocuous stimuli after strychnine application within the superficial MDH and this was paralleled with reversible increases in blood pressure.
