The stimulus elicited a response (9 ms) within the Aδ-fiber range. (B) Example of the effects of intracisternal strychnine on responses of a superficial lamina NS neuron to light brushing of its receptive field (bar). The simultaneous mean arterial blood pressure recording (MAP) is shown on the top of the trace. (C) Graphs illustrating the time-course of changes in firing of superficial lamina NS neurons (left) and the time-course of changes in blood pressure (ΔMAP, right) in response to innocuous Aβ- mediated stimuli (light brushing) after intracisternal strychnine injection. Results are expressed as mean±SEM, n refers to the number of animals tested (only one neuron per animal was tested). Previously unresponsive NS neurons were activated by innocuous stimuli after strychnine and this was paralleled with reversible increases in blood pressure.</p>
