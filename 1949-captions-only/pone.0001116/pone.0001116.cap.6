                Figure 6.  PKCγ expressing dorsal horn neurons are activated during allodynia.(A) Image of PKCγ immunopositive neurons and Fos positive cell nuclei in the MDH; bar: 200 µm. Fos was expressed following light brushing of the ipsilateral lip after intracisternal strychnine. The image on the right shows high power view of dual labeled neurons (arrowhead shows one typical example) located in the inner part of lamina II and in the outer part of lamina III; bar: 50 µm. (B) Fluorescence images of PKCγ immunopositive neurons (left, bar: 25 µm), glycine receptor α-β subunit immunoreactivity (middle, bar: 10 µm) and dual labeled neurons (right, arrowhead shows one example, bar: 10 µm).
