KIG31-1 or vehicle was injected 30 minutes before strychnine; *, P&lt;0.05. (B) Bar histogram illustrating the dose-dependent antiallodynic effect of intracisternal KIG31-1 (n = 4-5/group). Data is given as a percentage of control values obtained with injection of vehicle (Tat-carrier). **, P&lt;0.01; ***, P&lt;0.001, KIG31-1 <em>vs.</em> Tat carrier. (C) Examples of Fos immunolabeling in the MDH following light brushing of the ipsilateral lip after intracisternal strychnine in a control animal (Tat carrier, left) and in a 500 pmole KIG31-1 treated rat (KIG31-1, right). Bar is 200 µm. (D) Intracisternal administration of the selective PKCγ inhibitor KIG31-1 (500 pmoles) 30 minutes before strychnine resulted in a significant reduction in the brush-evoked Fos expression in the superficial laminae of the MDH. I-IIo: laminae I and outer II; IIi-IIIo: laminae inner II and outer III. *, P&lt;0.05, KIG31-1 <em>vs.</em> Tat carrier.</p>
