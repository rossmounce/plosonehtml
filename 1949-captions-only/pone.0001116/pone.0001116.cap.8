                Figure 8.  NMDA receptor blockade prevents allodynia and dorsal horn neuron activation.(A) Time course of changes in responses evoked by air puff applied on the face of intracisternaly strychnine injected rats after intracisternal administration of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist d-AP5 or of aCSF. d-AP5 or aCSF was injected 1 hour before strychnine; *, P&lt;0.05. (B) Examples of Fos immunolabeling in the MDH following light brushing of the ipsilateral lip after intracisternal strychnine in a control animal (aCSF, left) and in a d-AP5 treated rat (AP-5, right). Bar is 200 µm. (C) Intracisternal administration of d-AP5 (10 µg in 5 µl aCSF) 1 hour before strychnine resulted in a significant reduction in the brush-evoked Fos expression in the superficial laminae of the MDH. I-IIo: laminae I and outer II; IIi-IIIo: laminae inner II and outer III. *, P&lt;0.05, d-AP5 vs. aCSF.
