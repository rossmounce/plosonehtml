To identify recessive mutations, <em>F</em>1 animals are allowed to self-fertilize to produce the <em>F</em>2 generation. In this paper we consider the case of <em>n F</em>1 animals giving rise to <em>m F</em>2 animals. (B) Plots describing the probability, Ï€(<em>n</em>), that among <em>n F</em>1 animals screened, following mutagenesis by EMS (<em>r</em> = 1,250), will be found at least one <em>F</em>1 animal heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in a gene of interest. The parameter <em>a</em> is as defined in the text. The plots were generated by the program Mathematica 5.0 (Wolfram Research), using <em>n</em> as a continuous variable.</p>
