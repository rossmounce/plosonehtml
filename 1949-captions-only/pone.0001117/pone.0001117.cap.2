All plots were generated using the program Mathematica 5.0 (Wolfram Research). (A) Black line, graph of <em>n<sub>act</sub></em>/<em>N vs.</em> log<sub>10</sub><em>y</em> for <em>N</em> = 1,000. Blue and red lines, graphs of asymptotes and their equations. (B) Graphs of <em>n<sub>act</sub></em>/<em>N vs.</em> log<sub>10</sub><em>y</em>. Different colors indicate <em>n<sub>act</sub></em>/<em>N</em> for different specified values of <em>N</em>. Black line, Poisson approximation, colored lines, exact solutions. Inset, magnification of the graph for the region of log<sub>10</sub><em>y</em> between 0.3 and 0.5. For each value of <em>N</em>, <em>y</em> can only take on values such that 1/(<em>N</em>−1)≤<em>y</em>≤<em>N</em>−1. Furthermore, although for illustration purposes we have drawn the curves as continuous, <em>y</em> is <em>not</em> a continuous variable, and treating it as such only works for large <em>N</em>. This is most obvious for <em>N</em> = 10 where <em>y</em> can only take on the values 1/9, 1/4, 3/7, 2/3, 1, 3/2, 7/3, 4, and 9. (C) Graphs of <em>n<sub>act</sub></em>/<em>N vs.</em> log<sub>10</sub><em>y</em> for varying values of <em>p</em>, as defined in the text. Graphed using the Poisson approximation. (D) Graphs depicting the fractional error incurred when using the Poisson approximation to estimate <em>n<sub>act</sub></em>/<em>N</em> for screens in which one <em>F</em>1 animal is plated per plate. Although graphs are continuous, only integer values of <em>y</em> are relevant. Also note that the smallest allowable value of <em>y</em> is chosen so that at least 1 <em>F</em>2 animal is chosen per plate.</p>
