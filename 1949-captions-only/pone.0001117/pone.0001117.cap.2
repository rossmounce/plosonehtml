                Figure 2.  The effects of different parameters on the number of haploid genomes screened.(A–C) Plots assuming all F1 animals are placed together on a single plate. p = 0.75, unless otherwise indicated. All plots were generated using the program Mathematica 5.0 (Wolfram Research). (A) Black line, graph of nact/N vs. log10y for N = 1,000. Blue and red lines, graphs of asymptotes and their equations. (B) Graphs of nact/N vs. log10y. Different colors indicate nact/N for different specified values of N. Black line, Poisson approximation, colored lines, exact solutions. Inset, magnification of the graph for the region of log10y between 0.3 and 0.5. For each value of N, y can only take on values such that 1/(N−1)≤y≤N−1. Furthermore, although for illustration purposes we have drawn the curves as continuous, y is not a continuous variable, and treating it as such only works for large N. This is most obvious for N = 10 where y can only take on the values 1/9, 1/4, 3/7, 2/3, 1, 3/2, 7/3, 4, and 9. (C) Graphs of nact/N vs. log10y for varying values of p, as defined in the text. Graphed using the Poisson approximation. (D) Graphs depicting the fractional error incurred when using the Poisson approximation to estimate nact/N for screens in which one F1 animal is plated per plate. Although graphs are continuous, only integer values of y are relevant. Also note that the smallest allowable value of y is chosen so that at least 1 F2 animal is chosen per plate.
