                Figure 3.  Determining parameters for maximally efficient screens.Graphs of nact vs. log10y are plotted for three different values of W. For nreq = 5,000 (horizontal line), the minimal value of W is 37,642. log10ymax is indicated. Plots generated by the program Mathematica 5.0 (Wolfram Research).
