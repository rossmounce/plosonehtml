                Figure 4.  Optimal F2-to-F1 screening ratios and screen efficiency calculations.(A) Contour plots examining maximal screen efficiency, εmax, as a function of α and γ, for different values of p, for screens where all F1 animals are plated on one or a small number of plates. Plots generated using the program MatLab (MathWorks). (B) Graphs examining fold increase in work performed as screening ratio (m/n) deviates from its optimal value, for screens where all F1 animals are plated on one or a small number of plates and α/γ = 10. (C) Graphs depicting maximal screen efficiencies as a function of α for screens in which F1 animals are plated individually. In these graphs γ = 1, which is the most common value for this screening mode. (D) Graphs of the optimal F2-to-F1 screening ratios (m/n) for different values of p as functions of α/γ, for screens where all F1 animals are plated on one or a small number of plates. Note that the vertical axis is the natural log of m/n and not the base 10 log. (E) Graphs of the optimal F2-to-F1 screening ratios (m/n) for different values of p as functions of α, for screens in which F1 animals are plated individually. In these graphs γ = 1, which is the most common value for this screening mode.
