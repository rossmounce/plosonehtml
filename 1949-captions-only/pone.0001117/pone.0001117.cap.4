Plots generated using the program MatLab (MathWorks). (B) Graphs examining fold increase in work performed as screening ratio (<em>m</em>/<em>n</em>) deviates from its optimal value, for screens where all <em>F</em>1 animals are plated on one or a small number of plates and α/γ = 10. (C) Graphs depicting maximal screen efficiencies as a function of α for screens in which <em>F</em>1 animals are plated individually. In these graphs γ = 1, which is the most common value for this screening mode. (D) Graphs of the optimal <em>F</em>2-to-<em>F</em>1 screening ratios (<em>m</em>/<em>n</em>) for different values of <em>p</em> as functions of α/γ, for screens where all <em>F</em>1 animals are plated on one or a small number of plates. Note that the vertical axis is the natural log of <em>m</em>/<em>n</em> and not the base 10 log. (E) Graphs of the optimal <em>F</em>2-to-<em>F</em>1 screening ratios (<em>m</em>/<em>n</em>) for different values of <em>p</em> as functions of α, for screens in which <em>F</em>1 animals are plated individually. In these graphs γ = 1, which is the most common value for this screening mode.</p>
