Since AnxA2 is present on early endosomes, we used wide field, and not confocal, microscopy in (A) to ensure that structures that may contain both p11 and the early endosomal marker EEA1 were not missed in this analysis (hence some background nuclear staining). Cropped images are shown on both right panels. Bar: 10 Âµm.</p>
