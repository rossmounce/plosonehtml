Membrane-bound and free AnxA2 were then separately recovered after high speed centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS gels and western blotting, as indicated. The faster migrating form of AnxA2 in panel A corresponds to the core domain of the protein lacking the N-terminus, and results from AnxA2 proteolytic cleavage. Note that the core domain does not become efficiently membrane-associated, as expected <a href="#pone.0001118-Mayran1">[15]</a>, (B) The recombinant mutant AnxA2<sup>H28</sup> is selectively detected with the monoclonal antibody H28 (see 4A), which does not detect WT AnxA2 <a href="#pone.0001118-Thiel2">[23]</a>, while the HH7 monoclonal antibody recognizes WT AnxA2 <a href="#pone.0001118-Thiel1">[10]</a>, as shown with blots of HeLa and BHK lysates.</p>
