                Figure 4.  Recombinant annexin A2 binding to endosome and liposome membranes.(A) Early endosomes (left panel) or PA/PE/cholesterol liposomes (right panel) were prepared and incubated in vitro for 30min at 37°C with 5 µg purified recombinant AnxA2 (AnxA2H28). Membrane-bound and free AnxA2 were then separately recovered after high speed centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS gels and western blotting, as indicated. The faster migrating form of AnxA2 in panel A corresponds to the core domain of the protein lacking the N-terminus, and results from AnxA2 proteolytic cleavage. Note that the core domain does not become efficiently membrane-associated, as expected [15], (B) The recombinant mutant AnxA2H28 is selectively detected with the monoclonal antibody H28 (see 4A), which does not detect WT AnxA2 [23], while the HH7 monoclonal antibody recognizes WT AnxA2 [10], as shown with blots of HeLa and BHK lysates.
