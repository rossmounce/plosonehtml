The control (ctrl RNAi) siRNA used was designed against viral stomatitis virus (VSV-G) G-protein, which is not expressed in HeLa cells; equal amount of proteins were loaded in each lane and tubulin was used as an equal loading marker. (B) AnxA2 (diced AnxA2 RNAi) or p11 (RNAi2) was downregulated in HeLa cells, and total lysates were analyzed by western blotting as indicated (C) p11 was knocked down (as in A–B), and then a post-nuclear supernatant was prepared (left panel) and used as to further fractionate total endosomes (right panel). The samples were then analyzed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. (D) AnxA2-GFP (AnxA2<sup>H28</sup>-GFP) was expressed in mock-treated (left panel) or p11-siRNA2-treated HeLa cells (right panel) and then cells were processed for immunofluorescence as in <a href="#pone-0001118-g001">Fig 1</a> (using the special permeabilizaiton protocol). Arrows show AnxA2-GFP/EEA1 colocalizations and cropped images are shown under both conditions. Bar: 10 µm.</p>
