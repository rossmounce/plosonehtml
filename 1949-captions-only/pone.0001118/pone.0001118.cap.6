                Figure 6.  p11 downregulation does not alter transport from early to late endosomes.Rhodamin-dextran was endocytosed for 10 min at 37°C and then chased for 40 min in marker-free medium, after p11 knockdown as in Fig 5 (left panels, with the corresponding mock-treatment on the left) or AnxA2 knockdown as in Fig 5 (right panels, with the corresponding mock-treatment on the left). Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence using the indicated antibodies as in Fig 1. Bar: 10 µm.
