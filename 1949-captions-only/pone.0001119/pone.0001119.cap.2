(a) Cortical isosurface of virtual whole human brain. (b) Right hemisphere cortical isosurface of pre- and postcentral (left) gyrus with wireframe mesh (black) and vertices (red). (c) Physical whole human brain stereolithograph replica. (d) Right hemisphere pre- and postcentral (left) gyrus for comparison with Figure 2b.
