                Figure 1.  Comparative circular map of ET3-1 and other SA genomesshowing (from outside) 1) Scale in basepairs, 2) Mobile elements (red = conserved island, blue = pathogenicity island, pink = putative phage), 3) Ribosomal RNA operons (arrowheads), 4) Homology to other SA genomes, from outside and with color code, dark purple = MRSA252, light purple = MSA553, red = NCTC8325, orange = COL, yellow = Mu50, green = N315, teal = MW2, light blue = MSSA476, 5) ORF homology of ET3-1; navy blue = strong homolog to other SA, light blue = intermediate homolog to other SA, green = weak homolog to other SA, red = non-SA homolog, yellow = no GenBank matches (e-value&gt;10âˆ’5), 6) Location of tRNAs (small arrows), 7) ORF direction, light teal = forward strand, dark teal = reverse strand, 8) Microarray data from bovine isolates; light green inner portion = similar ET3 bovine isolates and dark green (outer) = non-ET3 bovine isolates. Yellow lines indicate insertion elements and transposases. 9) GC content = red graph line.
