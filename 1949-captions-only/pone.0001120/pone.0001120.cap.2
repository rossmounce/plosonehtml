The alignments illustrate the conservation of the core genome and the importance of mobile genetic elements in SA genome variation. Similar genetic elements integrate in different locations; for example, phageSaBov in strain ET3-1 and bacteriophage Mu50β in strain Mu50 have homologous content but vary in their sites of integration. A linear path of mobile element acquisition is not evident among the sequenced strains, underscoring the role of lateral transfer in the evolution of SA.</p>
