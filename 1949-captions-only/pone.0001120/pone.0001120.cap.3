Three additional unique ET3-1 MGEs, including νSaBov carrying several streptolysin homologs, φ12Bov and the large element φSaBov-νSaβ, are illustrated (note individual scales). Arrowhead colors: red = previously characterized SaPI gene of unknown function, turquoise = toxin, blue = SA homolog, green = no homologs, pink = homolog from non-SA microbe or phage, yellow = mobile element enzyme, light blue = phage protein, gray = protease, purple = lipoprotein, hollow triangle = putative pseudogene.</p>
