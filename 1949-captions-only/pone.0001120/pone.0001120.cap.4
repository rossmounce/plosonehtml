Striped segments show areas of sequence variation; arrowheads indicate the insertion of 10 or more amino acids. The remnants of <em>ebh</em> in ET3-1 comprise 5 separate transcripts and are punctuated by a small mobile element encoding 6 genes with homologs on plasmid pN315 (from SA isolate N315) and in <em>S. epidermidis</em>.</p>
