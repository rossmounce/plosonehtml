                Figure 4.  Variation in the fibronectin-binding protein Ebh.Colored bars represent the amino acid alignment of the Ebh proteins from the sequenced SA isolates as labeled, including the sequenced bovine isolate ET3-1. Striped segments show areas of sequence variation; arrowheads indicate the insertion of 10 or more amino acids. The remnants of ebh in ET3-1 comprise 5 separate transcripts and are punctuated by a small mobile element encoding 6 genes with homologs on plasmid pN315 (from SA isolate N315) and in S. epidermidis.
