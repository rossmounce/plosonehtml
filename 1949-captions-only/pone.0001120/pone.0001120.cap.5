The scale, in nucleotides, is shown in blue. Mobile genetic elements are annotated above each histogram block and ribosomal RNA operons are represented as large white gaps in the green histograms. The purple histogram above the ET3-1 genome representation shows the orientation of the ORFs. For the green microarray and Smith-Waterman alignment histograms, green = present, yellow = divergent, red = absent. For the blue/multi histogram showing ORF homology of ET3-1; navy blue = strong homolog to other SA, light blue = intermediate homolog to other SA, green = weak homolog to other SA, red = non-SA homolog, yellow = no GenBank matches (blastp e-value&gt;10<sup>âˆ’5</sup>).</p>
