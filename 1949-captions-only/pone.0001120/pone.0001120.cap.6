                Figure 6.  Venn diagram summarizing the unique gene content among bovine mastitis-associated S. aureus.In total, 47 microarray probes corresponded to gene sequences that are unique to ET3-1 among the sequenced S. aureus genomes. Nearly 94% of these genes were conserved in all of the ET3 isolates, while only 2 of these ‘unique’ genes were conserved among all 11 isolates of bovine origin.
