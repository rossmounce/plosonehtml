                Figure 7.  Comparative genomic DNA hybridization and in silico comparison of gene content within mobile elements of bovine and human SA isolates.In the MLST-based cladogram generated by PAUP [74], [76] at the left, “B” denotes a strain originally isolated from a bovine; “H” denotes isolation from a human. All data associated with “B” strains and MSA553A are microarray hybridization data; all remaining “H” strains show the results of in silico Smith-Waterman alignment of the 70mer microarray probe to the genome sequence. Red = absent, yellow = indeterminable/variable, green = present. OPtrans = oligopeptide transporter island and Ebh = region of probes representing the ebh gene or gene remnants+probes for 6 gene insertion in ET3-1. The white boxes within the SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov3 islands show gene clusters that were consistently absent from strains associated with human infection and largely conserved in strains recovered from bovine sources, including those that more closely resemble the isolates from humans.
