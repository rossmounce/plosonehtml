All data associated with “B” strains and MSA553<sup>A</sup> are microarray hybridization data; all remaining “H” strains show the results of <em>in silico</em> Smith-Waterman alignment of the 70mer microarray probe to the genome sequence. Red = absent, yellow = indeterminable/variable, green = present. OPtrans = oligopeptide transporter island and Ebh = region of probes representing the <em>ebh</em> gene or gene remnants+probes for 6 gene insertion in ET3-1. The white boxes within the SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov3 islands show gene clusters that were consistently absent from strains associated with human infection and largely conserved in strains recovered from bovine sources, including those that more closely resemble the isolates from humans.</p>
