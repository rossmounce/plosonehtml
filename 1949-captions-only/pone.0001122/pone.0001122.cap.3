                Figure 3.  Frequency of LMP1 and LMP2 epitope- specific T cells in PBMCs from healthy donors and NPC patients.The frequency of T cells specific for HLA A2 restricted on LMP1 and LMP2 was detected by EBV tetramer staining and FACS analysis in freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy donors (n = 7) and NPC patients (n = 9). The number of tetramer positive cells in 100 lymphocytes are shown in the figure.
