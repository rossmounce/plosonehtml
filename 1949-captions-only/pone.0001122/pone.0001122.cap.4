                Figure 4.  Cytotoxic activity of auto-LCL activated cultures from PBMCs of NPC patients.Polyclonal CTL cultures were test for cytotoxic activity against a panel of targets including the autologous EBV transformed LCL, PHA blasts, allogenic HLA class I matched or mismatched LCL. A. Representative experiments illustrating three pattern of cytotoxic activity. Pattern I: Lysis of the auto-LCL ≥25% and HLA class I mismatched LCL ≤10%; Pattern II: lysis to both HLA class I matched and mismatched LCL; Pattern III: less than 10% lysis against autologous or allogenic EBV positive or negative targets B. EBV-specific CTL cultures from NPC patients lysed freshly isolated autologous NPC tumor cells. Representative 51Cr release assays performed with CTL cultures from two NPC patients are shown in the figure.
