A relative decrease of CD8+ cells and increase of CD4+ cells was observed in TILs compared to LCL-stimulated cultures; both cultures showed high percentage of CD3+CD45RO+ and CD4+CD25+ cells. Frequency of LMP1 and LMP2 epitope-specific T cells in auto-LCL stimulated cultures and TILs from NPC patients (B). LMP1 and LMP2 epitopes specific T cells were detected by EBV tetramer staining and FACS analysis in autologous LCL-stimulated PBMCs (n = 9) and TILs (n = 6) from NPC patients.</p>
