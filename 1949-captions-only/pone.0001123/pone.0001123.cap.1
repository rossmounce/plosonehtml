A: Wild-type smooth muscle actomyosin in the presence of ADP. B: Wild-type smooth muscle actomyosin in the apo state. The contour level for A and B is chosen to represent the correct molecular mass. Note the well defined density and angle of the light-chain region (LC) C: R403Q mutant smooth muscle actomyosin in the presence of ADP. D: R403Q mutant smooth muscle actomyosin in the apo state. The contour level for C and D is chosen to show as much of the light chain domains as possible without completely obscuring the shape of the motor domain. E: Overlay of the maps in A–D. Color code and contouring as in A–D. F, G: Watershed segmentation of the maps in C (F) and D (G). These results reconfirm the orientation of the light-chain domains that correspond to those of the wild-type reconstructions (sketches) and the better definition of boundaries in the center of the filaments: the actin subunits are well segmented while there is no sub-segmentation of myosin domains as can be obtained for wild-type reconstructions <a href="#pone.0001123-Volkmann4">[33]</a>. The sketches show central lines extracted from the density of the wild-type (grey) and the segmentation of the R403Q (black). Only the line segments extracted for the corresponding light-chain regions (LC) are shown, line segments corresponding to the motor domain region (MD) overlap almost completely for all maps.</p>
