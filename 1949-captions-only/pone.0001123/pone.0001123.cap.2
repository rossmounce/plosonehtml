                Figure 2.  Difference and structural variability maps.4-nm wide slices perpendicular to the helix axis of several maps are shown on the left. Only peaks significant at a confidence level of 99.99% are shown. A: Wild-type smooth muscle actomyosin in the absence of nucleotide. The motor domain (MD) and light-chain (LC) regions are labeled. A faint ghost image of this map is also overlaid on C and E to aid visualization. B: A difference map generated by subtracting the R403Q mutant smooth muscle actomyosin apo state reconstruction from the R403Q mutant smooth muscle actomyosin ADP state reconstruction. A clear difference peak can be identified in the light-chain region. A faint ghost image of the wild-type ADP state reconstruction is overlaid to aid visualization. This image is also overlaid on D and F. C: Difference map between two independently generated R403Q mutant apo state reconstructions. Only occasional, randomly distributed, isolated pixels can be seen, no coherent difference peaks exist. D: Difference map between two independently generated R403Q mutant ADP state reconstructions. E: Structural variability (AVID map) of R403Q mutant apo state reconstruction. Only randomly distributed peaks can be seen, there is no consistent structural variability in any confined region. F: Structural variability (AVID map) of R403Q mutant ADP state reconstruction. Bar:10 nm. G: Surface representation of the difference map shown in B. The cyan density represents additional density in the R403Q mutant ADP state reconstruction if compared to the R403Q mutant apo state reconstruction. The apo state (pink) and ADP state (blue wireframe) wild-type reconstructions are also shown. The difference between the mutant reconstructions is located in the light-chain region and correlates with the changes observed in wild-type smooth muscle actomyosin.
