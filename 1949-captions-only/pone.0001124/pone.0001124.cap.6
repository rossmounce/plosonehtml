<h4>Biogeomancer</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The five exemplar species used to evaluate Biogeomancer had 2,881 GBIF records, of which 43% were already georeferenced. 355 (12%) of these were successfully georectified. Only 112 (4%) of these were ‘new’ coordinates for records not georeferenced in GBIF. The georectified coordinates were identical to those provided by GBIF in only 3 cases, but 76% were within 0.5 degrees. 94% of the georectified data passed ILDIS validation. Based on these five examples, we extrapolate 59,000 additional records could have been georeferenced and added to our analysis. Given that this would increase our data set by less than 10%, the considerable time input in processing these records was not justified in this instance.</p>


<h4>Data providers</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>Nearly 60% of records we recovered come from the UK National Biodiversity Network (NBN) (<a href="#pone-0001124-t001">Table 1</a> &amp; <a href="#pone-0001124-g007">Figure 7</a>). The second largest data source, Bundesamt für Naturschutz, provided a further 16%. These two suppliers provide gridded presence data for species, based on surveys rather than label information directly linked to herbarium/museum specimens. These two sources only provide data for 137 species. In contrast Missouri Botanical Garden provides 4% of records but includes 2,562 species (<a href="#pone-0001124-g008">Figure 8</a>).</p>
