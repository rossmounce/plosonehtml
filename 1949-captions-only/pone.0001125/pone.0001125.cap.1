MBs are smaller in HS flies than in the CT group. (B) Heat stress induced a significant 31% reduction in MB calyx volume (<em>F</em><sub>[1,97]</sub> = 188.39, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001), estimated from planimetric measurements of serial sections of HS and CT flies shown in (A). (C) MB pedunculus cross-section area (the means of measurements from three serial caudal sections) was reduced by 29% in HS flies (<em>F</em><sub>[1,97]</sub> = 123.43, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001). (D) AL volume [derived as in (B)] was reduced by 15% in HS flies (<em>F</em><sub>[1,51]</sub> = 26.04, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001). (E) Optic lobe volume [medulla+lobula, derived as in (B)] was not significantly influenced by heat stress (<em>F</em><sub>[1,40]</sub> = 1.59, <em>P</em> = 0.22). (F) Central complex volume [fan shaped body+ellipsoid body, derived as in (B)] was reduced by 9% in HS male flies only (<em>F</em><sub>[1,51[</sub> = 10.78, <em>P</em> = 0.002). (G) Wing area was reduced by 6% in HS female flies only (<em>F</em><sub>[1,60]</sub> = 7.04, <em>P</em> = 0.01). (H) Forelimb length was not significantly affected in HS flies (<em>F</em><sub>[1,60]</sub> = 1.21, <em>P</em> = 0.28). (B–H) Bars are mean±standard error (SE); <em>n</em> indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, <em>P</em>≤0.05).</p>
