                Figure 1.  Thermal Stress Disrupts Brain Development.(A) Frontal 7 µm paraffin sections of MB calyces at their broadest point, viewed with a fluorescence photo microscope. MBs are smaller in HS flies than in the CT group. (B) Heat stress induced a significant 31% reduction in MB calyx volume (F[1,97] = 188.39, P&lt;0.0001), estimated from planimetric measurements of serial sections of HS and CT flies shown in (A). (C) MB pedunculus cross-section area (the means of measurements from three serial caudal sections) was reduced by 29% in HS flies (F[1,97] = 123.43, P&lt;0.0001). (D) AL volume [derived as in (B)] was reduced by 15% in HS flies (F[1,51] = 26.04, P&lt;0.0001). (E) Optic lobe volume [medulla+lobula, derived as in (B)] was not significantly influenced by heat stress (F[1,40] = 1.59, P = 0.22). (F) Central complex volume [fan shaped body+ellipsoid body, derived as in (B)] was reduced by 9% in HS male flies only (F[1,51[ = 10.78, P = 0.002). (G) Wing area was reduced by 6% in HS female flies only (F[1,60] = 7.04, P = 0.01). (H) Forelimb length was not significantly affected in HS flies (F[1,60] = 1.21, P = 0.28). (B–H) Bars are mean±standard error (SE); n indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, P≤0.05).
