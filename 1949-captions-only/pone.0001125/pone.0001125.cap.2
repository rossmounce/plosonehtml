                Figure 2.  All Classes of Intrinsic MB Neurons Are Sensitive to Thermal Stress.(A) Schematic illustration of heat stress treatment administered 35 min/day throughout larval and pupal development, or restricted to specific developmental stages that correspond with the birth of MB neurons projecting to γ, α′β′, or αβ-lobes. (B) MB calyx volume measurements (derived as in figure 1B). All three classes of MB neurons are sensitive to heat stress (F[4,138] = 17.92, P&lt;0.0001). Calyx volume in flies receiving daily episodes of heat stress treatment throughout development reflected additive reductions of each of the three neuron classes exposed to heat stress as shown in (A). Bars are mean±SE; n indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, P≤0.05).
