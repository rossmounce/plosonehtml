(B) MB calyx volume measurements (derived as in <a href="#pone-0001125-g001">figure 1B</a>). All three classes of MB neurons are sensitive to heat stress (<em>F</em><sub>[4,138]</sub> = 17.92, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001). Calyx volume in flies receiving daily episodes of heat stress treatment throughout development reflected additive reductions of each of the three neuron classes exposed to heat stress as shown in (A). Bars are mean±SE; <em>n</em> indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, <em>P</em>≤0.05).</p>
