All MB structural elements represented in each of three CT <em>P[GAL4]/T10</em> genotypes were present (labeled) but clearly diminished in HS flies. We noted that cytoplasm-targeted GFP revealed low-level enhancer activity (labeled in blue) that is often not observed when targeting GFP expression to membranes (see references 50 and 52 for examples). (B) Nuclear-targeted GFP expression patterns driven by different <em>GAL4</em>-expressing elements in whole mount brains of CT (top) and HS (bottom) flies viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. We observed fewer KCs in the three HS <em>P[GAL4]/nls14</em> genotypes compared with CT flies. (C) KCs counted in the brains of flies represented in (B). A two-way ANOVA found highly significant effects of genotype (<em>F</em><sub>[2,104]</sub> = 42.36, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001) and treatment (<em>F</em><sub>[1,104]</sub> = 143.00, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001), while the interaction component was not significant (<em>F</em><sub>[1,104]</sub> = 2.69, <em>P</em> = 0.07). KC numbers were reduced by 29% in <em>247/nls14</em>, 36% in <em>201Y/nls14</em> and 57% in <em>c739/nls14</em>. Bars are mean±SE; <em>n</em> indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, <em>P</em>≤0.05).</p>
