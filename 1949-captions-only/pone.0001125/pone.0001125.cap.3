                Figure 3.  Thermal Stress Disrupts MB Development by Reducing KC Numbers.(A) Cytoplasm-targeted GFP expression patterns driven by different GAL4-expressing elements in whole mount brains of CT (top) and HS (bottom) flies viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. All MB structural elements represented in each of three CT P[GAL4]/T10 genotypes were present (labeled) but clearly diminished in HS flies. We noted that cytoplasm-targeted GFP revealed low-level enhancer activity (labeled in blue) that is often not observed when targeting GFP expression to membranes (see references 50 and 52 for examples). (B) Nuclear-targeted GFP expression patterns driven by different GAL4-expressing elements in whole mount brains of CT (top) and HS (bottom) flies viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. We observed fewer KCs in the three HS P[GAL4]/nls14 genotypes compared with CT flies. (C) KCs counted in the brains of flies represented in (B). A two-way ANOVA found highly significant effects of genotype (F[2,104] = 42.36, P&lt;0.0001) and treatment (F[1,104] = 143.00, P&lt;0.0001), while the interaction component was not significant (F[1,104] = 2.69, P = 0.07). KC numbers were reduced by 29% in 247/nls14, 36% in 201Y/nls14 and 57% in c739/nls14. Bars are mean±SE; n indicated on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, P≤0.05).
