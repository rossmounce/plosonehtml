The mean performance index calculated for HS flies was lower than CT flies at all time intervals. A two-way ANOVA detected significant effects of treatment (<em>F</em><sub>[1,56]</sub> = 101.25, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001) and time (<em>F</em><sub>[2,56]</sub> = 41.93, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001), while the interaction component was not significant; <em>F</em><sub>[2,56]</sub> = 2.00, <em>P</em> = 0.15). (B) Shock reactivity. HS flies showed normal avoidance of 80 V dc electric shock used in (A) and a slight reduction in avoidance at 120 V (<em>F</em><sub>[1,36]</sub> = 6.23, <em>P</em> = 0.017). (C) MCH odor avoidance. HS flies demonstrated a normal avoidance of MCH at the 1×10<sup>−2</sup> dilution used in (A) and a slight reduction in avoidance at the 5×10<sup>−3</sup> dilution (<em>F</em><sub>[1,37]</sub> = 14.72, <em>P</em> = 0.0005). (D) OCT odor avoidance. HS flies demonstrated normal avoidance responses to OCT at both dilutions. (A–D) Symbols or bars are mean±SE; <em>n</em> indicated above each symbol or on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, <em>P</em>≤0.05).</p>
