                Figure 4.  Associative Odor Learning is Impaired by Thermal Stress.(A) Olfactory learning and memory. The mean performance index calculated for HS flies was lower than CT flies at all time intervals. A two-way ANOVA detected significant effects of treatment (F[1,56] = 101.25, P&lt;0.0001) and time (F[2,56] = 41.93, P&lt;0.0001), while the interaction component was not significant; F[2,56] = 2.00, P = 0.15). (B) Shock reactivity. HS flies showed normal avoidance of 80 V dc electric shock used in (A) and a slight reduction in avoidance at 120 V (F[1,36] = 6.23, P = 0.017). (C) MCH odor avoidance. HS flies demonstrated a normal avoidance of MCH at the 1×10−2 dilution used in (A) and a slight reduction in avoidance at the 5×10−3 dilution (F[1,37] = 14.72, P = 0.0005). (D) OCT odor avoidance. HS flies demonstrated normal avoidance responses to OCT at both dilutions. (A–D) Symbols or bars are mean±SE; n indicated above each symbol or on each bar. Different letters designate significant differences (SNK, P≤0.05).
