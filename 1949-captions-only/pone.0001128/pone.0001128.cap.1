                Figure 1.  Oxytocin and generosity.Mean DM1 generosity (DM1 UG offer minus average minimum acceptable offer) for those receiving OT or placebo. Generosity is 80% larger in the OT group (p = 0.005, N = 68). The increased generosity is not due to altruism as OT infusion in a task designed to isolated altruism showed no impact relative to placebo (p = 0.51, N = 68).
