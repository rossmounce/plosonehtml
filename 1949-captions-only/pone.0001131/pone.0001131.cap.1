                Figure 1.  Ignore condition for abstract rules.a) Grand-average ERPs elicited by standards (black) and deviants (gray), and deviant minus standard difference wave (red). b) Topographic distribution of the MMN component (scalp current density, SCD). Electrode positions with SCD values significantly deviating from zero are indicated in the p-value map. c) Tomographic distribution of the MMN component (primary current density, PCD). The hotter colors correspond to higher probability values (one-way ANOVA; thresholded to p&lt;.0001).
