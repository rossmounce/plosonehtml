                Figure 4.  Stimulation for an abstract rule sequence.Tone pairs vary in their absolute frequencies. Standard tone pairs (black) are characterized by an ascending frequency relation, whereas deviant tone pairs (gray) are descending. Duration of the second tone in the pair varies randomly and independently of the frequency relations.
