                Figure 1.  Syk-Tyr323 was required for the consolidation of the leading edge during CD18-mediated migration of dHL-60 cells.(A,B) Confocal microscopy images of dHL-60 cells expressing EGFP-Syk or EGFP-Syk Y323F stained for CD18 (A) or F-actin (B). Upon stimulation by 100 nM fMLP on immobilized fibrinogen, all transfectants polarized and formed lamellipodia (black arrows and arrow heads), which were characterized by an enrichment of CD18, F-actin, EGFP-Syk, or EGFP-Syk Y323 (white arrows and arrow heads). However, the expression of the Syk mutant led to the formation of multiple lamellipodia (arrow heads). Pictures are representative of at least three independent experiments. Quantitative analysis of microscopic images of fixed dHL-60 cells showing the percentage of cells with (C) excessive lamellipodium formation and (D) enhanced EGFP epifluorescence at the lamellipodium (n&gt;300 cells each, taken from at least three independent experiments). (E) Time-lapse microscopy of migrating dHL-60 transfectants on immobilized fibrinogen in response to a gradient of 10 nM fMLP (▴). Images 1–5 were recorded at intervals of 30 s. Control transfectants migrated efficiently in contrast to Syk Y323F mutants which formed multiple, unstable lamellipodia and showed impaired migration. The outlines of the cells at intervals of 30 s were transposed in rising grayscales to visualize cell movement. (F) Percentage of migrating dHL-60 transfectants (n = 63 EGFP-Syk, n = 67 EGFP-Syk Y323F) from at least four independent experiments. Data represent means±SD, bar = 10 µm.
