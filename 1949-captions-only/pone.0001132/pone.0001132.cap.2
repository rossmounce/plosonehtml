Upon stimulation by 100 nM fMLP on immobilized fibrinogen, PI3K p110δ was enriched at the lamellipodium (arrow) of (A) EGFP-Syk transfectants and (B) dHL-60 control cells (WT). In contrast, dHL-60 cells expressing EGFP-Syk Y323F or Syk-siRNA (siSyk) showed an impaired enrichment of PI3K p110δ staining at the leading edge (arrow heads). (C) Quantitative analysis of subcellular Syk and PI3K p110δ distribution using microscopic images of fixed dHL-60 cells from at least three independent experiments. (n = 67 EGFP-Syk, n = 88 EGFP-Syk Y323F; n = 210 WT, n = 138 Syk-siRNA). (D) PI3K p110γ was translocated to the leading edge in EGFP-Syk (arrow) as well as in EGFP-Syk Y323F transfectants (arrow heads). (C) Quantitative analysis (n = 48 EGFP-Syk, n = 49 EGFP-Syk Y323F).
