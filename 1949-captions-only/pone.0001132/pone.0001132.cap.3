                Figure 3.  The enrichment of Cbl at the lamellipodium was not dependent on Syk-Tyr323.Confocal microscopy images of dHL-60 cells (A) expressing EGFP-Syk or EGFP-Syk Y323F or (B) stably expressing a Syk-siRNA (siSyk). Upon stimulation by 100 nM fMLP on immobilized fibrinogen, Cbl was enriched at the lamellipodium of (A) EGFP-Syk transfectants and (B) dHL-60 control cells (arrow and arrow heads). A similar result was obtained in dHL-60 cells expressing EGFP-Syk Y323F or siSyk. (C) Quantitative analysis of subcellular Syk and Cbl distribution using microscopic images of fixed dHL-60 cells taken from three independent experiments (n = 77 EGFP-Syk, n = 78 EGFP-Syk Y323F; n = 177 WT, n = 105 Syk-siRNA). Data represent means±SD. Bar = 10 µm.
