                Figure 4.  Syk activity was required for the enrichment of PI3K products at the leading edge.Microscopy images of PH-AKT-GFP dHL-60 cells in suspension (sus) or after induction of adhesion (ad) to immobilized fibrinogen in the presence of 0.2 mM Mn2+ (A), or adhered and polarized after the induction with 100 nM fMLP (B, C). PH-AKT-GFP dHL-60 cells were treated with 30 µM piceatannol (+Pic) or vehicle for control (-Pic) (B), or expressed mCherry-Syk or mCherry-Syk Y323F (C). PH-AKT-GFP dHL-60 cells stimulated in suspension did not translocate Syk or PH-AKT-GFP (EGFP) to the membrane. In contrast, adherent cells showed an enriched Syk staining, or mCherry-Syk and PH-AKT-GFP epifluorescence at the lamellipodium forming site (arrow). Inhibition of Syk or the expression of mCherry-Syk Y323F increased the population of cells with a homogenous distribution of Syk and a diminished concentration of PH-AKT-GFP at the lamellipodium forming site (arrow head). Pictures are representative for at least three independent experiments. (D) Quantitative analysis of the subcellular localization of Syk, mCherry-Syk or mCherry-Syk Y323F (Syk LA) or PH-AKT-GFP epifluorescence (PH LA) at the lamellipodium in PH-AKT-GFP dHL-60 cells taken from at least three experiments (n = 137−Pic, n = 157+Pic; n = 113 mCherry-Syk, n = 99 mCherry-Syk Y323F). Data represent means±SD. Bar = 10 µm.
