                Figure 5.  Syk was required for the enrichment of PI3K p110δ at the leading edge of murine PMN and delayed wound closure.(A,B) Confocal microscopy images of Syk-deficient (Syk−/−) and control (Syk−/+) PMN of bone marrow chimeric mice. Upon stimulation by 1 µM fMLP on immobilized fibrinogen, PI3K p110δ and PI3K p110γ were enriched at the lamellipodium (arrow) of polarized cells. In contrast, Syk−/− PMN showed an impaired enrichment of PI3K p110δ staining at the leading edge (arrow heads, A) whereas PI3K p110γ was still translocated to the lamellipodium forming sites (Β). Bar = 10 µm. (C) Quantitative analysis of subcellular localization of PI3K p110δ and PI3K p110γ distribution using microscopic images of fixed murine PMN from at four independent experiments. Data represent means±SD. (D) 24 h old wound sections of wildtype mice reconstituted with a Syk−/− or a Syk+/− hematopoietic system for control stained with the PMN specific Gr-1 antibody (upper panel) or GR-1 antibody and DAPI (lower panel). Control sections showed substantial infiltration of Syk+/− PMN (arrows) into the wounded tissue (wm: wound margin at dotted line, es: eschar). In contrast, Syk−/− PMN migration into the wounded tissue was impaired. Scale bars, 100 µm. (E) Quantitative analysis of PMN numbers per HPF in the wound tissue using microscopic images. (F) Wound sizes at given time points after wounding is displayed as percentage of initial (day 0) wound area for Syk+/− (○) or Syk−/− (▴) bone marrow chimeric mice (100%). Data represent means±SD; n = 5 mice with four wounds per animal; pday3 = 0.24, *pday5–10&lt;0.001.
