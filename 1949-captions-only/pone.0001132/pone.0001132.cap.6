Syk binds to the phosphorylated ITAM, becomes activated and enriched at the leading edge. DAP12 and the FcR γ-chain are associated with different receptors, but it is unknown to date how these receptors interact with the β<sub>2</sub> integrin Mac-1. Here, we have shown that Syk-Tyr<sup>323</sup> and Syk activity were required for the recruitment of PI3K p110δ and the accumulation of PI3K products at the cell front. In contrast, the translocation of PI3K p110γ to the leading edge was independent of Syk activity and Syk-Tyr<sup>323</sup>. Translocation and activation of PI3K p110γ is mediated by GPCR-mediated signaling. Upon GPCR activation the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>i</sub> protein dissociates from the receptor and the βγ-subunit <a href="#pone.0001132-Wettschureck1">[22]</a>. The βγ-complex of the G protein is known to activate PI3Kγ <a href="#pone.0001132-Deane1">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001132-Hawkins1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001132-Wettschureck1">[22]</a>. Taken together, Syk activity and Syk-Tyr<sup>323</sup> mediated signaling via PI3K p110δ was required for the persistent accumulation of PI3K products at the cell front which is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the leading edge and efficient migration.</p>
