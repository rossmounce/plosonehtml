                Figure 1.  Examples of co-localization between miRNAs and CIS retroviral integration sites in the mouse genome.Each panel represents 20 kb of genomic DNA. Blue triangles indicate retroviral integration sites, red ticks represent miRNAs, black boxes and lines show the position of spliced transcripts. (A) chr11:87,562,001–87,582,000.
