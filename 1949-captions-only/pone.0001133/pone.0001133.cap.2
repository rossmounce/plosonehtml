                Figure 2.  The number of miRNAs co-localized with retroviral integration sites.Blue diamonds represent the number of miRNAs located at the indicated distance or less from CIS inserts, and red diamonds correspond to miRNAs located at the indicated distance or less from non-CIS inserts. The trendline for miRNAs associated with non-CIS inserts is shown as red dotted line.
