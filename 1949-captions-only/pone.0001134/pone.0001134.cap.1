                Figure 1.  DMPK regulates muscle insulin signaling.(A) Cardiac and skeletal muscles (soleus and gastrocnemius); (B) white adipose tissue; and (C) liver homogenates from dmpk−/− and wild type mice were analysed by Western blot. Caveolin 3, caveolin 1 and β-actin were used as loading controls. Heart homogenate was loaded as positive control for DMPK expression in B and C. (D) C2C12 myoblasts transduced with recombinant adenovirus for myc-DMPK or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as control were analyzed by Western blot. Caveolin 3 was used as loading control. Data are means±SEM. *P&lt;0.05 vs control values (n = 3-5).
