Caveolin 3, caveolin 1 and β-actin were used as loading controls. Heart homogenate was loaded as positive control for DMPK expression in B and C. (D) C2C12 myoblasts transduced with recombinant adenovirus for myc-DMPK or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as control were analyzed by Western blot. Caveolin 3 was used as loading control.
