(B, D) Insulin receptor, glucose transporter GLUT4, caveolin 3 and DMPK protein contents were analyzed in cardiomyocytes and soleus, respectively, from wild-type (WT) and <em>dmpk</em><sup>−/−</sup> (KO) mice (n = 3). (E, F) Subcellular fractions were prepared from cardiac ventricles of basal and insulin-treated mice. (E) Plasma membranes (PM) and low density microsomes (LDM) were analysed by SDS-Page and Western blot. Representative autoradiograms from 3 experiments are shown. Equal amounts of membrane proteins (4 µg) from the different fractions were laid on gels. (F) GLUT4 translocation was quantified from 3 independent experiments. (Data are mean±SEM; *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 vs unstimulated values)</p>
