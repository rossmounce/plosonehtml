                Figure 3.  Metabolic parameters in dmpk−/− mice.Glucose tolerance tests of (A) 4-week-old males; (B) 8–10-week-old males; (C) 8–10 week-old females. (wild type , black squares; dmpk−/− mice, white circles). (n = 5–8 mice per group) (D) Plasma insulin, during glucose tolerance test performed on 16 h-fasted mice (n = 5−8 for each group). (E) Insulin, triglycerides, and free fatty acids (FFAs) concentrations in plasma from fed mice (n = 8–14 for each group). (F) Glucose tolerance tests on 4-month-old males on high fat diet (n = 8 per group; wild type, black squares; dmpk−/− mice, white circles). Data are mean±SEM; *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.001; ***P&lt;0.0001 vs wild-type values.
