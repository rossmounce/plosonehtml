                Figure 4.  Overexpression of DMPK mutants alters stress fiber formation in HeLa cells.(A) Stress fiber formation was analyzed by phalloidin labeling. Cells were transfected with myc-WTDMPK (a–c), the kinase-dead myc-K110ADMPK mutant (d–f), and the C-terminal lacking myc-ΔMADMPK mutant (g–i). Arrowheads indicate the transfected cells. Scale bar, 24 µm (applies to all panels). Representative images from 3 independent experiments are shown. (B) Stress fiber formation was quantified using the Image J software as phalloidin intensity/cell area. Values for untransfected cells were set as 100%. Means from three independent experiments with 20 cells analyzed per condition are shown. Data are mean±SEM; ***P&lt;0.0001 vs unstransfected cells.
