                Figure 5.  DMPK is required for insulin receptor targeting to the plasma membrane.(A) HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with YFP-InsR along with control empty vector (a–d), myc-WTDMPK (e–h), myc-K110ADMPK (i–l) or myc-ΔMADMPK (m–p). Shown are representative images of 3 independent experiments. Scale bar, 24 µm (applies to all panels). (B) Receptor percentage at the cell surface was quantified by using Image J software. Means from three independent experiments with 20 cells analyzed per condition are shown. Data are mean±SEM ; **P&lt;0.001; ***P&lt;0.0001 vs unstransfected cells.
