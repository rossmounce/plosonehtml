Shown are representative images of 3 independent experiments. Scale bar, 24 µm (applies to all panels). (B) Receptor percentage at the cell surface was quantified by using Image J software. Means from three independent experiments with 20 cells analyzed per condition are shown. Data are mean±SEM ; **<em>P</em>&lt;0.001; ***<em>P</em>&lt;0.0001 vs unstransfected cells.</p>
