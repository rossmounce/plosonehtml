                Figure 6.  Effect of kinase-deficient mutant DMPK (myc-K110ADMPK) on YFP-InsR subcellular distribution.HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with YFP-InsR along with myc-WTDMPK (upper panels) or myc-K110ADMPK (lower panels). Cellular distribution of YFP-InsR partially coincides with that of Golgi complex protein GM130 in cells expressing myc-K110ADMPK (panel h). Dashed circles in b and f show the magnified areas. Scale bar, 24 Âµm. Representative images of 3 independent experiments are shown.
