                Figure 7.  DMPK is required for IGF-1 receptor targeting to the plasma membrane.(A) HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with GFP-IGF-1 along with control empty vector (a–d), myc-WTDMPK (e–h), myc-K110ADMPK (i–l), or myc-ΔMADMPK- (m–p). Dotted arrows in panel k and l show a cell which only incorporated the GFP-IGF-1 plasmid, expressing the receptor at the plasma membrane. In the same panels, neighboring cells co-expressing the receptor and myc-K110ADMPK are indicated by continuous arrows; in these cells, the accumulation of the receptor in intracellular compartments is observed. Shown are representative images of 3 independent experiments. Scale bar, 24 µm (applies to all panels). (B) Receptor percentage at the cell surface was quantified by using Image J software. Means from three independent experiments with 20 cells analyzed per condition are shown. Data are mean±SEM; **P&lt;0.001; ***P&lt;0.0001 vs unstransfected cells.
