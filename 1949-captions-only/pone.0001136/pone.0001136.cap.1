                Figure 1.  Allele-specific maintenance of a complex methylation pattern.A. Upper part: schematic representation of the AF1 mutant and wild type Rxrα alleles. Boxes indicate exons. The nucleotide sequence surrounding the LoxP site in AF1 (arrow head) and the methylation state of the cytosine residues are shown below. Open stars correspond to unmethyled cytosines, filled stars to methylated non-CpG and filled circles to methylated CpG sites. The three classes of methylated molecules are shown and their frequency (per cent) in a total of 287 clones sequenced after amplification. B. Distribution of the three classes of methylated molecules amplified from the AF1 allele. Mice indicated as “Family 1” were derived from the same unmethylated RxrαAF1 male carrying the Sycp1-Cre transgene and that indicated “Family 2”, from a distinct ancestor. Genomic DNA from organs (liver, kidney and testis) dissected from 2 to 3 independent mice and genomic tail DNA from 2 to 4 different mice of each generation were subjected independently to bisulfite treatment. Each genomic DNA were then PCR amplified separately and classified in three different classes of methylated molecules. Number of mice used in each experiment are indicated in parentheses. From left to right: Family 1 liver, kidney, testis and tail DNA after 15 generations, tail DNA after 18 and 23 generations in the B6D2 F1 genetic background; tail DNA after 8 generations of crosses into the indicated backgrounds; Family 2 tail DNA after 15 generations in B6D2 F1. n correspond to the numbers of molecules analysed.
