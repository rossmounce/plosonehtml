                Figure 2.  Epigenetic marks in sperm nuclei.A. Distribution in sperm DNA of the methylation profiles shown in Fig. 1. Numbers of molecules of each profile are indicated and correspond to the analysis of two independent PCR reactions where two different preparations of sperm bisulfite-treated DNA were used as template. B. The RxrÎ± locus is included in the protamine-associated fraction of the sperm chromatin. Wild type (+/+) and heterozygote (AF1/+) sperm chromatin preparations were partitioned into histone-enriched (H) or protamine-enriched (P) DNA fractions after EcoRI and BamH1 restriction cleavage. PCR analysis of the methylated LoxP region and of Line I elements, known to be present in the nucleosomal fraction [18], was performed on the fractions using the primers and conditions indicated in Table 1.
