Distribution in sperm DNA of the methylation profiles shown in <a href="#pone-0001136-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Numbers of molecules of each profile are indicated and correspond to the analysis of two independent PCR reactions where two different preparations of sperm bisulfite-treated DNA were used as template. B. The <em>Rxr</em>Î± locus is included in the protamine-associated fraction of the sperm chromatin. Wild type (+/+) and heterozygote (<em>AF1</em>/+) sperm chromatin preparations were partitioned into histone-enriched (H) or protamine-enriched (P) DNA fractions after <em>EcoR</em>I and <em>BamH</em>1 restriction cleavage. PCR analysis of the methylated <em>LoxP</em> region and of <em>Line I</em> elements, known to be present in the nucleosomal fraction <a href="#pone.0001136-Bird2">[18]</a>, was performed on the fractions using the primers and conditions indicated in <a href="#pone-0001136-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
