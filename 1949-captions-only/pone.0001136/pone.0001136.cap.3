DNA methylation analysis in the modified Rxrα locus of Dnmt1−/− mice.Bisulfite sequencing analysis at the LoxP site in 8.5 dpc embryos either heterozygous or homozygous for the Dnmt1 null mutation, including representative examples of partially methylated molecules. Genomic DNA from three embryos of each genotype have been independently subjected to bisulfite treatment.
