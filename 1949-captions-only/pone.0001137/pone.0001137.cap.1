                Figure 1.  OA-stimulated VSMC proliferation and migration is associated with decreased expression of PGC-1α.VSMCs were incubated with 0.4 mmol/L OA for 24 h before analysis. VSMC proliferation were determined by MTT assay (A) and direct cell counting (B). VSMC migration was assessed by wound healing assay (C) and transwell analysis (D). The time course of 0.4 mmol/L OA effect on PGC-1α expression was linear over 48 h. PGC-1α expression was quantified by quantitative PCR (E). VSMCs were treated with various concentrations of OA for 24 h. PGC-1α expression was examined by quantitative PCR (E) and western blot (F). Data in VSMC proliferation and migration detections represent the means±SEM of 18 determinants from 3 independently prepared samples each with 6 measurements. Data in PGC-1α mRNA level detections are expressed as means±SEM of five different experiments normalized to β-actin levels. Data in PGC-1α protein level detections are expressed as means±SEM of four different experiments normalized to GAPDH levels. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, #P&lt;0.001 vs. control.
