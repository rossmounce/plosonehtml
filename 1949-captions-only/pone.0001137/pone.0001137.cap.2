PGC-1α expression was analysised by quantitative PCR (A) and western blot (B). Effects of PGC-1α overexpression on OA-induced VSMC proliferation were determined by MTT assay (C) and cell counting (D). Effects of PGC-1α overexpression on OA-induced VSMC migration were determined by wound healing (E) and transwell analysis (F). Data in VSMC proliferation and migration detections represent the means±SEM of 18 determinants from 3 independently prepared samples each with 6 measurements. Data in PGC-1α mRNA level detections are expressed as means±SEM of five different experiments normalized to β-actin levels. Data in PGC-1α protein level detections are expressed as means±SEM of four different experiments normalized to GAPDH levels. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, #P&lt;0.001 vs. control or GFP group.</p>
