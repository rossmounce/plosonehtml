                Figure 1.  Immunohistochemistry labeling results.A. 2+ score: weak-to-moderate complete membrane staining in more than 10% of tumor cells (objX40). B. 3+ score: strong complete membrane staining in more than 10% of tumour cells (objX40). C. Heterogeneous staining of a primary ovarian tumour (objX20). D: Heterogeneous staining of a metastasis (objX20) E. FISH: heterogeneous amplification of HER2 in a tumor showing a cluster of tumor cells with amplification (white arrow, left part) and a cluster of non amplified tumor cells (orange arrow, right part). F: Clusters of red spots (HER2 amplification) together with two green spots (centromere 17).
