In our study, 25% of equivocal samples (IHC 2+ staining) were amplified for <em>HER2</em> gene. Based on the HER2 reference scoring algorithm, 21 samples were considered as positive (15 scored 3+ by IHC and 6 scored 2+ validated by FISH). Three samples could not be compared by FISH due to fixation (one 3+ and two 2+ IHC scored). IHC = immunohistochemistry; FISH = fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization.</p>
