                Figure 2.  HER2 gene amplification repartition according to HER2 protein status.Perfect concordance in protein expression and gene amplification has been observed for samples with 3+ or 0/1+ IHC staining. In our study, 25% of equivocal samples (IHC 2+ staining) were amplified for HER2 gene. Based on the HER2 reference scoring algorithm, 21 samples were considered as positive (15 scored 3+ by IHC and 6 scored 2+ validated by FISH). Three samples could not be compared by FISH due to fixation (one 3+ and two 2+ IHC scored). IHC = immunohistochemistry; FISH = fluorescence in situ hybridization.
