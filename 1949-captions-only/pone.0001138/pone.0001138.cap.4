                Figure 4.  HER2 in major published studies.A. Overexpression Review of selected articles evaluating HER2 protein expression in large series of patients (including more than 50 tumour samples) published in international journals after 1994. Boxes represent % of HER2 overexpression (scored as 2+ or 3+) and error bars show Â±2 standard errors for each study. B. IHC and FISH status Review of selected articles evaluating HER2 gene amplification (FISH or CISH) and/or HER2 protein expression in large series of patients (including more than 50 tumour samples) published in international journals after 1994.In situ hybridisation represents FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) and CISH (chromogenic In situ hybridisation) results. Mean HER2 overexpression/amplification across studies is represented; IHC = Immunohistochemistry.
