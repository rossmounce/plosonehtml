Overexpression Review of selected articles evaluating <em>HER2</em> protein expression in large series of patients (including more than 50 tumour samples) published in international journals after 1994. Boxes represent % of <em>HER2</em> overexpression (scored as 2+ or 3+) and error bars show Â±2 standard errors for each study. B. IHC and FISH status Review of selected articles evaluating <em>HER2</em> gene amplification (FISH or CISH) and/or <em>HER2</em> protein expression in large series of patients (including more than 50 tumour samples) published in international journals after 1994.<em>In situ</em> hybridisation represents FISH (fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridisation) and CISH (chromogenic <em>In situ</em> hybridisation) results. Mean <em>HER2</em> overexpression/amplification across studies is represented; IHC = Immunohistochemistry.</p>
