                Figure 6.  Graphical representation of the life history and spatial transition model.For simplicity, the full life history model with each size state (s) is shown for a single location (k) only. Transitions from size states j to i are represented by Ψk = kij within a location and fecundities for each size state are represented by Fks. The only parameter not estimated from field data was survival from size state 0 to size state 1 (S10). Transitions between locations Ψk≠kij are listed in boxes for individuals leaving (open arrows) or entering river k (closed arrows).
