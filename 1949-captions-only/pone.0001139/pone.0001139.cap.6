Transitions from size states <em>j</em> to <em>i</em> are represented by Ψ<em><sup>k = k</sup><sub>ij</sub></em> within a location and fecundities for each size state are represented by F<em><sup>k</sup><sub>s</sub></em>. The only parameter not estimated from field data was survival from size state 0 to size state 1 (S<sub>10</sub>). Transitions between locations Ψ<em><sup>k≠k</sup><sub>ij</sub></em> are listed in boxes for individuals leaving (open arrows) or entering river <em>k</em> (closed arrows).</p>
