Sections were assayed for N-Cadherin expression by immunofluorescence (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O). The actin microfilaments and the nuclei were stained by Phalloidin (B, C, F, G, J, K, N, O) and DAPI incorporation (D, H, L, P) respectively. During delamination of cranial NCCs there is a massive accumulation of cells in the dorsal part of the neural tube (A–D). In this cell population, colocalisation of N-Cadherin and Phalloidin is lost indicating that they undergo an EMT (C, G, K). By contrast, during trunk delamination, NCCs emigrate one by one. No particular distortion of the dorsal neural tube is detectable (M-P, arrow heads). (Q–V) Analysis of BrdU incorporation in cranial neural tube during and after NCC delamination. Transversal cryosections (5 µm) of stages HH8–9 embryos, during and after delamination, labeled by immunofluorescence using anti-BrdU antibody (Q, R, T, U). Nuclei are stained by DAPI. Percentages of BrdU positive cells in the different zones of the neural tube are represented in diagrams (S,V). Cranial NCCs are not synchronized in S-phase during delamination (Q–R) or migration (T–U). del, delaminating cells; sur, surrounding region; mid, midline region; mig; migrating cells.</p>
