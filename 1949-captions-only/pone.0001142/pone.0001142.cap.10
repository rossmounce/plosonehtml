                Figure 10.  Ets-1 and Snail-2 Cooperate to Achieve Delamination.(A–N) Analysis of the effects of h-ets-1 and snail-2 coelectroporation (A–H) and snail-2 alone (I–N) in intermediate to ventral neural tube at 48hpe. Transversal cryosections (10 µm) labeled with anti-Laminin (A–B), anti-N-Cadherin (C–F, I–L) and HNK-1 (G–H, M–N) antibodies. Co-electroporated cells degrade the basal lamina (A–B), lose N-Cadherin expression (C–F, white arrow heads and dotted line), cell-cell junctions at the apical side (white bracket) and strongly express HNK1 (G–H). These cells emigrate from the tube as a population of dissociated cells. H-ets-1 and snail-2, electroporated together, are able to promote EMT and migratory NCCs identity. Conversely, snail-2 electroporation does not affect either N-Cadherin expression or distribution (I–L, white arrow heads). Electroporated cells are unable to undergo EMT and then remain in the neural tube. However, snail-2 electroporation leads to massive ectopic activation of HNK-1 (M–N) all along the dorso-ventral axis of the neural tube.
