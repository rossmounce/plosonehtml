                Figure 2.  Ets-1 Expression Occurs Later and in a More Restricted Area than Those of Foxd3 and AP2.(A–O') Whole in situ hybridization of normal chick embryos at stages 4s–13s using c-ets-1 (A–H), foxd-3 (F–J') and ap-2 (K–O') probes. (F–H) Embryos were cut along the rostro-caudal axis. The left and right sides of the neural tube were treated independently with c-ets-1 and foxd-3 probes. C-ets-1 expression (A–B, F–G) begins after foxd-3 (F–G) and ap-2 (K–L) expressions. It is restricted to cells leaving the neural tube (C–D, insets) and cranial region (compare E–E' to J–J' and O–O'). * indicates ets-1 expression in the sclerotome. r, rhombomere.
