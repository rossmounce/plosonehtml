(F–H) Embryos were cut along the rostro-caudal axis. The left and right sides of the neural tube were treated independently with <em>c-ets-1</em> and <em>foxd-3</em> probes. <em>C-ets-1</em> expression (A–B, F–G) begins after <em>foxd-3</em> (F–G) and <em>ap-2</em> (K–L) expressions. It is restricted to cells leaving the neural tube (C–D, insets) and cranial region (compare E–E' to J–J' and O–O'). * indicates <em>ets-1</em> expression in the sclerotome. r, rhombomere.</p>
