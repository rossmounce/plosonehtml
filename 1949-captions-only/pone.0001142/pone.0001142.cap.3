                Figure 3.  Ets-1 Activity Is Required for Cranial but not Trunk Delamination.(A–L) Analysis of cranial NCCs delamination in HH7-9 chick embryos electroporated by c-ets-1 DBD and harvested at 15 hours post electroporation (hpe). (A–D; G–J) Whole mount in situ hybridization using ap-2 probe. GFP expression in (A) and (G) indicates the electroporation zone. (C–D) and (I–J) are vibratome sections (30 µm) of embryos presented in (B) and (H) respectively. (E–F; K–L) Transversal cryosections (14 µm) labeled by immunofluorescence using anti-HNK-1 antibody and nuclear-stained by DAPI incorporation. Electroporated cells are detected by GFP expression. Pink broken lines in (L) outline the NCCs. (M–N) Analysis of NCC migration in embryos electroporated in the rhombencephalon at stage HH10+ when the delamination is in progress and harvested at 15hpe (stage HH14). (O–T) Analysis of NCC specification in chick embryos electroporated by c-ets-1 DBD at stage HH7-9 and harvested at 6hpe. GFP expression in (O), (Q) and (S) indicates the electroporation zone of the embryos presented in whole mount in situ hybridization using snail-2, foxd-3 and sox-9 probes in (P), (R) and (T) respectively. (U–W) Analysis of trunk NCCs delamination in chick embryos electroporated by c-ets-1 DBD harvested at 24hpe. Transversal cryosections (10 µm) were labeled by immunofluorescence using anti-HNK-1 (U), anti-Pax-7 (V) and anti-Pax-6 (W) antibodies. Expression of c-ets-1 DBD in the head leads to a decrease or a lack of ap-2 (B–D, H–J) and HNK-1 expression (E, K). At cellular level, there is either a reduction of the size of the NCC stream on the electroporated side (L) or even a lack of NCCs between the ectoderm and the neural tube (E; F, green staple) while on control side NCCs are normally localized (B–D, ap-2 staining; F, pink arrow heads; L, left pink lasso). Data shown in A–D, E–F, G–J, K–L come from four distinct embryos respectively. This effect is restricted to the delamination step since inhibition of ETS-1 activity after the delamination does not affect the migration (M–N). Finally, c-ets-1 DBD does not prevent NCC specification as snail-2 (O–P), foxd-3 (Q–R) and sox-9 (S–T) remain expressed in the neural folds on both electroporated and control sides. At trunk level, misexpression of c-ets-1 DBD has no effect on dorso-ventral patterning, or on NCCs delamination and migration (U–W). r, rhombomere.
