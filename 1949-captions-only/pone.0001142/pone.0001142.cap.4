                Figure 4.  Trunk NCC Delamination Occurs Prematurely is Amplified and Prolonged by h-ets-1 Misexpression.(A–a) Analysis of the effects of h-ets-1 misexpression in trunk dorsal neural tube assayed at 15hpe (A–E, O–R), 24hpe (F–N) and 48hpe (S–a). (A–J, O–R) Whole mount in situ hybridization using sox-10 (A–J, dark blue), cadherin-6B (O–R, dark blue) and h-ets-1 (A–E, O–R, light blue) probes. (K–N) Wholemount immunostaining using anti HNK1 antibody. (C–E, H–J, M–N, P, R) Vibratome sections (30 µm) of embryos presented in (B), (G), (L), (O') and (Q') respectively. (V–Y) In situ hybridization on transversal cryosections (20 µm) using sox-9 (V–W) and sox-10 (X–Y) probes. (Z–a) Transversal cryosections (10 µm) immunolabeled using anti-N-Cadherin antibody. Electroporated cells are detected by GFP expression (S–T, W, Y, a) or DAPI staining (U). At 15hpe in h-ets-1 caudally transfected embryos, sox-10 trunk NCCs delaminate precociously (A–B, E, arrow heads). Besides, more rostrally, the outflow is increased (C–D) compared to contralateral side and is associated with a loss of cadherin-6B expression (O–P). At 24hpe, at level where delamination is already completed on the control side (H–J, asterisks), h-ets-1 expression prolongs delamination of a massive amount of sox-10 (H–J, arrow heads) and HNK-1 (M–N) positive NCCs. At 48hpe, h-ets-1 transfected cells are still able to leave the dorsal neural tube as a multilayered wave (S–U) but they fail to express NCCs markers such as sox-9 (V–W), sox-10 (X–Y) and keep a strong expression of N-Cadherin (Z–a). ot, otic vesicle.
