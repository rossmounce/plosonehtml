                Figure 5.  Ets-1 Misexpression Emancipates Trunk NCC Delamination from Subordination to Successful G1/S Transition.(A–N) Analysis of the effects of h-ets-1 misexpression in trunk dorsal neural tube on cell cycle assayed at 15hpe. Immunofluorescence labeling using anti-BrdU antibody of transversal cryosections (5 µm). Nuclei are stained by DAPI incorporation. Dotted lines in (C), (F), (I) indicate delaminating transfected area as defined by GFP expression (B, E, H). Trunk NCCs emigrating precociously from dorsal electroporated neural tube opposite segmental plate (A–C) or the first epithelial somite (D–F) are not synchronized in S-phase. Similarly, opposite dissociating somites (G–I), h-ets-1 misexpression in the dorsal neural tube leads to increased NCC delamination of a mix of BrdU positive and negative cells. In contrast, trunk NCCs are predominantly in S-phase when h-ets-1 misexpression does not target the most dorsal territory (J–K, arrow heads) or when NCCs are transfected by w375r (L–N, arrow heads).
