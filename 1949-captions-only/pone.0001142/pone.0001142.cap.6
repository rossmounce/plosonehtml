(A–D) Vibratome sections (30 µm) of whole mount in situ hybridization using <em>h-ets-1</em> probe. At 24hpe, misexpression of <em>h-ets-1</em> leads to ectopic delaminations towards basal or luminal sides (A, C, arrow heads; dotted lines indicate the neural tube limit). At 48hpe, the phenomena is stronger, involving more cells leaving the neural tube in both head (B) and trunk (D) as compact bulges of cells. (E–J) Transversal cryosections (10 µm) labeled with anti-Laminin antibody. Electroporated cells degrade the basal lamina (arrow heads) before invading the ECM. (K–X) Analysis of NCC fate in ectopic delaminating cells. (K–R) Whole mount in situ hybridization with <em>snail-2</em> (K–O, dark blue), <em>foxd-3</em> (L–P, dark blue), <em>ap-2</em> (M–Q, dark blue), <em>sox-10</em> (N–R, dark blue) and <em>h-ets-1</em> (O, P, Q, R, light blue) probes. Dotted lines in (K), (L), (M), (N) indicate the transfected area as defined by GFP expression (insets in K, L, M, N). (S–X) Immunofluorescence labeling with anti-HNK-1 antibody on transversal (S–T, V–W) and longitudinal (U, X) cryosections (10 µm). At 24hpe, misexpression of <em>h-ets-1</em> in head or trunk does not ectopically activate <em>snail-2</em>, <em>foxd-3</em>, <em>ap-2</em> or <em>sox-10</em> (K–R). Furthermore, at 48hpe ectopic cells (including cells emerging from the dorsal part of the neural tube) never express HNK-1 (S–U, arrow heads). Misexpression of <em>w375r</em> has no effect (V–X). drg, dorsal root ganglia; lum, lumen; ot, otic vesicle.</p>
