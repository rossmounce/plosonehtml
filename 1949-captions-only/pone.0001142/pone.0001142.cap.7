(A) Vibratome section (30 µm) of whole mount in situ hybridization using <em>cyclin-d1</em> probe. (B–L, Q–V) Immunofluorescence on cryosections (10 µm) with anti-BrdU (B), anti-phosphohistoneH3 (C–F), anti-β3-Tubulin (G-I), anti Lim-1/2 (J–L), anti-Pax-6 (Q–S), anti-Pax-7 (T–V) antibodies. (M–P) Nuclei are stained with DAPI. <em>H-ets-1</em> misexpression leads to ectopic activation of <em>cyclin-d1</em> expression without affecting equilibrium between cell proliferation (B–F) and cell differentiation (G–L). Ectopic <em>h-ets-1</em> expression provokes cell accumulation close to the basal side of the neural tube (M–P). Interestingly, cell recruitment is detectable even when the phenotype is not strong enough to lead to ectopic delamination (M–N). These cell movements of neuroepithelial cells occur along the apico-basal axis of the neural tube and do not disturb dorso-ventral patterning (Q–V). fp, floor plate; lum, lumen.</p>
