Transversal cryosections (10 µm) labeled by immunofluorescence with anti-Fibronectin (A–D, G–H), anti-N-cadherin (I–L, O–P) antibodies, by DAPI incorporation (E, M) and by histological staining with May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) (F, N). <em>H-ets-1</em> electroporated cells invade the extracellular matrix without producing Fibronectin (A–D, arrow heads) and remain strongly attached to each others by N-cadherin (I–L, arrow heads) at 24hpe (A–B, I–J) and 48hpe (C–D, K–L). Accumulations of N-Cadherin are observed within the core of the ectopic clusters at 48hpe (K–L, white arrows). Nuclear detection (E, M) and histological staining (F, N) of sections presented in (C) and (K) confirm the high cellular density in the ectopic clusters (E–F, M–N, white and black lines). Cells transfected by <em>w375r</em> exhibit normal behavior (G–H, O–P). Tr, trunk.</p>
