                Figure 8.  Ets-1 Misexpression Promotes Delamination without Inducing Epithelium to Mesenchyme Transition.(A–P) Analysis of the effects of h-ets-1 misexpression in intermediate to ventral neural tube at trunk levels at 24hpe (A–B, I–J) and 48hpe (C–H, K–P). Transversal cryosections (10 µm) labeled by immunofluorescence with anti-Fibronectin (A–D, G–H), anti-N-cadherin (I–L, O–P) antibodies, by DAPI incorporation (E, M) and by histological staining with May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) (F, N). H-ets-1 electroporated cells invade the extracellular matrix without producing Fibronectin (A–D, arrow heads) and remain strongly attached to each others by N-cadherin (I–L, arrow heads) at 24hpe (A–B, I–J) and 48hpe (C–D, K–L). Accumulations of N-Cadherin are observed within the core of the ectopic clusters at 48hpe (K–L, white arrows). Nuclear detection (E, M) and histological staining (F, N) of sections presented in (C) and (K) confirm the high cellular density in the ectopic clusters (E–F, M–N, white and black lines). Cells transfected by w375r exhibit normal behavior (G–H, O–P). Tr, trunk.
