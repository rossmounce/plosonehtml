                Figure 9.  Ectopic Electroporated Cells Are Still Attached by Functional Cell-Cell Junctions.(A–J) Analysis of the effects of h-ets-1 misexpression in intermediate to ventral neural tube at 48hpe. Transversal cryosections (10 µm) labeled by immunofluorescence with anti-N-Cadherin antibody (A–C, red; G–J, blue). Actin microfilaments and nuclei are stained with Phalloidin (D–I) and DAPI incorporation (A–F) respectively. Electroporated cells detected by GFP expression (A, D, G) are organized around dots of high N-Cadherin expression (A–C, red dots, white arrows) or high Phalloidin staining (D–F, red dots, white arrows). N-Cadherin and Phalloidin perfectly match to each other (G–J, arrow heads) indicating that N-Cadherin expressed by the electroporated cells is involved in functional cell-cell junctions.
