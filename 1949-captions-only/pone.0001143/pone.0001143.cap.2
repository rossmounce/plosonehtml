Our findings suggests an affirmative answer: recreational users showed normal response speed but impaired inhibitory control, and the size of this deficit seems to correspond to the amount of cocaine consume <a href="#pone.0001143-Bolla1">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001143-VerdejoGarcia2">[19]</a>. Hence, the greater the dose and the frequency of cocaine use, the greater the magnitude of the loss of inhibitory control seems to be. In view of evidence suggesting that cocaine is accompanied by a selective effect on DAD22, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dopamine modulates response inhibition <a href="#pone.0001143-Hershey1">[15]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>In contrast to numerous previous studies of chronic cocaine users, the design of our study allows us to reject a number of alternative accounts of our observations. Participants were screened for several psychiatric disorders and matched for age, IQ, sex, and alcohol consumption, which rules out accounts in terms of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (as schizophrenia, ADHD, and obsessive compulsive disorder) that are known to affect response inhibition <a href="#pone.0001143-Thoma1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001143-Rosenberg1">[28]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001143-Schachar1">[29]</a>. Particularly important was the matching of the age range: While inhibitory control seems not to be related to general intelligence <a href="#pone.0001143-Logan2">[21]</a>, there is evidence that cognitive inhibitory process declines throughout the life span <a href="#pone.0001143-Logan2">[21]</a>. Given that MDMA is associated with impairments in working memory processes and cannabis is related to dysfunctions in cognitive flexibility and that both drugs seem not to be linked with malfunction in inhibitory control function <a href="#pone.0001143-VerdejoGarcia2">[19]</a>, we doubt that our results can be attributed to the use of marijuana and MDMA.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>Given the seemingly small amount of cocaine involved, the present findings are worrying. Even though the task we used to diagnose the inhibitory deficiency in recreational users is rather artificial, the deficit itself is likely to affect everyday behavior. Many real-life situations require the active inhibition of a pre-potent action. This is particular obvious for examples like traffic behavior, where stopping to walk or to drive is necessary when the traffic light turns from green to red, or when passengers, animals, or vehicles are suddenly crossing the street.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4"></a><p>The present findings raise the question whether recreational cocaine users also show impairments in other cognitive control functions, such as the shifting between tasks and mental sets, and the updating and monitoring of working memory <a href="#pone.0001143-Miyake1">[30]</a>. The direct effects of recreational cocaine use on the brain need to be explored as well. It remains to be demonstrated, for instance, that recreational use of cocaine produces changes at the neuromodulatory (reduced functioning of DAD2 receptors) and functional level (dysfunction in LPFC, ACC, and OFC) that are proportional to the degree of behavioural performance deficits.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.p5"></a><p>Moreover, the findings obtained in this study are important because they spot a selective behavioral deficit that could contribute to cocaine use, and explain its association with other disorders of impulse control, such as ADHD and pathological gambling. However, their etiological role in cocaine use are still uncertain, and more research is necessary to determine the relative contribution of cocaine use and other pre-existing constellation in the creation of inhibitory control impairment.</p>

<h4>Participants</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>Twenty-six young healthy adults served as participants for partial fulfilment of course credit or a financial reward and constituted the two groups: recreational users of cocaine and cocaine-free controls. Participants were recruited via notes posted on community bulletin boards and by word of mouth. Recreational users of cocaine met the following criteria: 1) a monthly consumption (1 to 4 gram) by snorting route for a minimum of two years; 2) no Axis 1 psychiatric disorder (DSM-IV) <a href="#pone.0001143-American1">[18]</a>, including ‘substance abuse’; 3) no clinically significant medical disease; 4) no use of medication. Cocaine free-controls met the same criteria expect that they reported no history of past or current cocaine use. Subjects were selected by means of a phone interview by a research assistant with the M.I.N.I. <a href="#pone.0001143-Lecrubier1">[31]</a>, a brief diagnostic tool that screens for several psychiatric disorders including, among others, schizophrenia, depression, mania, ADHD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Participants with a known history of psychopathology and those who were taking medication were excluded. Participants were asked to refrain from taking drugs for two days and from all caffeine containing foods and beverages for 12 hours prior to the experimental sessions, not to consume alcohol on the night before the experimental session and to have a normal night rest. Subjects' compliance with the instruction was encouraged by taking a saliva sample (not further analyzed) at the beginning of the session <a href="#pone.0001143-Colzato1">[32]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001143-Colzato2">[33]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001143-AltingvonGeusau1">[34]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2"></a><p>In the last month six of the thirteen recreational users and two of the thirteen cocaine-free users also smoked marijuana, while four recreational users reported to have taken one MDMA (ecstasy) tablet. Participants in the two groups were matched for race (100% Caucasian), age, sex and IQ (measured by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices [SPM] <a href="#pone.0001143-Raven1">[35]</a>) and alcohol consumption. Demographic and drug use statistics are provided in <a href="#pone-0001143-t001">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0001143-t002">2</a>.</p>
