                Figure 1.  TXNL1 and p38MAPK.(A) Rat liver cytosol (RLC, 30 mg) was precipitated in 30% (NH4)2SO4 (P30). The precipitate was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column, and fractions analyzed by western blotting. The lower panel shows the densitometric scan of the gels in the upper panel (red squares: TXNL1; blue triangles: p38MAPK). Arrows point at calibration markers: ferritin 440 kDa; aldolase 156 kDa; albumin 67 kDa. The bulk of GDI is associated with Rab proteins [10] and is thus present as complexes of ≈80 kD [22], which elute in fractions 8-9 on the Superose 12 column. (B) The Superose 12 fractions (A) were pooled 2 by 2 and assayed for their capacity to stimulate 1 µM GST-GDI to extract early endosomal Rab5 [39]. After endosome removal on gradients, GST-GDI with bound Rab5 was retrieved onto glutathione beads and analyzed by western blotting. For comparison, the activity of 100 µg RLC or P30 is shown. The fractionation (A) and analysis (B) was repeated 3 times, and representative examples are shown. (C) HeLa cells were co-transfected with Flag-TXNL1 and His6-p38MAPK. Immunoprecipitation (IP) from lysates (lys: 5% of total) was with (+) or without (−) the indicated antibodies, and analysis was by western blotting. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, and (C) shows a representative example. (D) The outline of TXNL1 is shown with the CPGC motif in the TRX-like N-terminal domain (residues 1–107). Purified recombinant proteins were assayed (5 µM) before or after GST cleavage for their capacity to reduce insulin disulfide bonds in the presence of dithiothreitol, using dithiothreitol alone as a control (CTRL). Data are normalized to values obtained with E.Coli thioredoxin (TRX).
