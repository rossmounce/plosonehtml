(B) Experiments were as in (A), but cells were transfected with Flag-TXNL1 or Flag-TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup>. Open and solid arrows point at Flag-tagged and endogenous TXNL1, respectively. Each experiment in (C) and (D) was repeated at least 5 times, and representative examples are shown. (C) Phospho-p38MAPK present in early endosomal fractions was quantified after lysis in 1% TX100 by sandwich ELISA (expressed as OD units per mg protein). The figure shows the mean of 3 experiments. Error bars represent standard deviations; the observed differences are significant according to Student's <em>t</em> test with p&lt;0.0001 at each H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. (D) HeLa cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against phospho-p38MAPK (pp38) and Rab5, followed by labeled secondary antibodies. Arrows point at examples of endosomes containing both Rab5 and pp38 (see inset). A fraction of pp38MAPK colocalized with Rab5 on early endosomes, but we were unable to unambiguously localize pp38MAPK on the membrane of other organelles using various markers, presumably because detection was limiting. (E) Cells were processed as in (D), except that primary antibodies against phospho-p38MAPK were omitted, and then analyzed in the red channel.</p>
