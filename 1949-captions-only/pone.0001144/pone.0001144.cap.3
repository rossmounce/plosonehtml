In the assay, GST-GDI was incubated with early endosomes in the absence (−) or presence of cytosol prepared from mock-transfected cells (mock), or from cells overexpressing either the Rab5 effector Rabankyrin-5 (RabAnk-5) or TXNL1. Rab5 bound to GDI was then retrieved and analyzed as in <a href="#pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1B</a>. The experiment was repeated 3 times, and a representative example is shown. (B) The capture of early endosomal Rab5 by GDI was analyzed as in (A), except that the assay was in the absence (−) or presence (+) of rat liver cytosol and 500 nM recombinant TXNL1 or TXNL1<sup>C34, 37S</sup> (after GST removal). Recombinant proteins were pre-reduced for 30 min with 1 mM DTT on ice (reducing conditions), or pre-oxidized for 15 min with 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 25°C (oxidizing conditions). In both cases, proteins were then diluted 12 fold in the reaction mixture and the same final DTT or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were used when TXNL1 or TXNL1<sup>C34, 37</sup> were omitted. These experiments were repeated 5 times, and representative examples are shown (C) Pulldown of rat liver cytosol (RLC) using purified GST fusion proteins that were (+) or not (−) pre-oxidized (Ox) as in (B). GST-proteins were retrieved onto immobilized beads and analyzed by western blotting with anti-Rab5 antibodies (all lanes are from the same gel). These experiments were repeated 4 times, and representative examples are shown. All lanes in the panel are from the same experiment. (D) Pulldown of rat liver cytosol (RLC) using purified GST-fusion proteins that were (+) or not (−) pre-reduced (Red) or pre-oxidized (Ox) as in (B). Analysis was by western blotting with anti-GST or anti-GDI antibodies. These experiments were repeated 3 times, and representative examples are shown (E) Pulldowns with GST-fusion proteins (C, and see <a href="#pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1D</a>) were analyzed by western blotting with anti-GDI antibodies. These experiments were repeated 3 times, and representative examples are shown (F) HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with siRNA duplexes for 72 h (MGC2477 hypothetical protein as RNAi control). Total cell-extracts were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.</p>
