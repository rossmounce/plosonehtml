                Figure 3.  Rab5 capture by GDI is modulated by TXNL1.(A) The capture of early endosomal Rab5 by GDI was analyzed. In the assay, GST-GDI was incubated with early endosomes in the absence (−) or presence of cytosol prepared from mock-transfected cells (mock), or from cells overexpressing either the Rab5 effector Rabankyrin-5 (RabAnk-5) or TXNL1. Rab5 bound to GDI was then retrieved and analyzed as in Fig 1B. The experiment was repeated 3 times, and a representative example is shown. (B) The capture of early endosomal Rab5 by GDI was analyzed as in (A), except that the assay was in the absence (−) or presence (+) of rat liver cytosol and 500 nM recombinant TXNL1 or TXNL1C34, 37S (after GST removal). Recombinant proteins were pre-reduced for 30 min with 1 mM DTT on ice (reducing conditions), or pre-oxidized for 15 min with 10 mM H2O2 at 25°C (oxidizing conditions). In both cases, proteins were then diluted 12 fold in the reaction mixture and the same final DTT or H2O2 concentrations were used when TXNL1 or TXNL1C34, 37 were omitted. These experiments were repeated 5 times, and representative examples are shown (C) Pulldown of rat liver cytosol (RLC) using purified GST fusion proteins that were (+) or not (−) pre-oxidized (Ox) as in (B). GST-proteins were retrieved onto immobilized beads and analyzed by western blotting with anti-Rab5 antibodies (all lanes are from the same gel). These experiments were repeated 4 times, and representative examples are shown. All lanes in the panel are from the same experiment. (D) Pulldown of rat liver cytosol (RLC) using purified GST-fusion proteins that were (+) or not (−) pre-reduced (Red) or pre-oxidized (Ox) as in (B). Analysis was by western blotting with anti-GST or anti-GDI antibodies. These experiments were repeated 3 times, and representative examples are shown (E) Pulldowns with GST-fusion proteins (C, and see Fig 1D) were analyzed by western blotting with anti-GDI antibodies. These experiments were repeated 3 times, and representative examples are shown (F) HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with siRNA duplexes for 72 h (MGC2477 hypothetical protein as RNAi control). Total cell-extracts were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.
