                Figure 4.  TXNL1 regulates fluid phase endocytosis.(A) HRP uptake for 5 min at 37°C was quantified in HeLa cells either mock-transfected or transfected with TXNL1-siRNA duplexes. Data are normalized to the uptake in mock-treated cells and are representative of at least three independent experiments (each in duplicate). The error bar represents the standard deviation; the observed differences are significant according to Student's t test with p&lt;0.005 (B) HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with Flag-TXNL1 or Flag-TXNL1C34, 37S. Cells were incubated with HRP for 5 min at 37°C and analyzed as in (A). The figure shows the mean of 3 independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation; the observed differences are significant according to Student's t test with p&lt;0.0001 under each condition (C–D) HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with Flag-TXNL1 or Flag-TXNL1C34, 37S, as in (B), incubated with rhodamine-labeled transferrin (Tf), processed for immunofluorescence using anti-flag antibodies and visualized by double-channel fluorescence microscopy (D). The number of transferrin-containing endosomes was counted in 20 cells of duplicate samples in 3 independent experiments (as in D) and the quantification is shown in (C). Error bars represent the standard deviation; the observed differences after TXNL1C34, 37S overexpression are significant (p&lt;0.01), but not after TXNL1 overexpression (p&lt;0.2).
