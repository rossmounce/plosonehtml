                Figure 5.  The TXNL1 cycle.The model outlines the proposed mechanism by which TXNL1 may regulate fluid phase endocytosis, by modulating GDI function in the membrane-cytosol cycle of Rab5. See text for further explanations. P38, p38MAPK; pP38, phosphorylated p38MAPK; GDI, Guanine nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor; pGDI; phosphorylated GDI; Rab5:GTP or GDP, Rab5 in the GTP- or GDP-bound state, respectively.
