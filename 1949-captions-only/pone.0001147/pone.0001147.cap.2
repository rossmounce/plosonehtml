                Figure 2.  High magnification transmission electron micrographs of amnion collagen fibrils in cross section.No difference in fibril diameter was observed between samples proximal (a) and distal (b) to the placenta. However a marked decrease in fibril packing can be seen in the amnion distal to the placenta. Scale bar = 300 nm.
