                Figure 3.  Radial distribution functions (RDF) calculated from positions of amnion fibrils in cross section from representative images.The primary RDF peak (*) from amnion distal to the placenta was lower and broader than the corresponding peak from amnion proximal to the placenta indicating less regular fibril spacing. The bulk fibril number density (œÅ) was also decreased in distal amniotic tissue (arrows).
