                Figure 1.  Mmp13 expression during non-stabilized fracture healing.(Left column) Safranin-O/Fast Green (SO) and Trichrome (TC) stained sagittal sections through the WT callus at 6 (A), 10 (E) and 14 (I) days post-fracture. Cartilage (red) develops during the soft callus phase of healing (A), is resorbed during the hard callus phase (E) and is replaced by bone (blue, I). (Middle/Right column) In situ hybridization analyses of Mmp13 expression and osteoblast/chondrocyte differentiation markers. (B–D) At 6 days post-fracture, Mmp13 is expressed in the callus and overlaps with Col1-expressing cells (early osteoblasts) but not Mmp9-expressing cells (osteoclasts and inflammatory cells). (F–H) At day 10, Mmp13 mRNA is detected in hypertrophic chondrocytes also expressing Col10 and Vegf. (J–L) At day 14, Mmp13 is expressed in mature osteoblasts co-expressing Col1 and/or Oc. Scale bars: A, E, I = 1mm; B-D, F-H, J-L-200 µm.
