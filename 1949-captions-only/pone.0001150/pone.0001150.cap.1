Cartilage (red) develops during the soft callus phase of healing (A), is resorbed during the hard callus phase (E) and is replaced by bone (blue, I). (Middle/Right column) In situ hybridization analyses of <em>Mmp13</em> expression and osteoblast/chondrocyte differentiation markers. (B–D) At 6 days post-fracture, <em>Mmp13</em> is expressed in the callus and overlaps with <em>Col1</em>-expressing cells (early osteoblasts) but not <em>Mmp9</em>-expressing cells (osteoclasts and inflammatory cells). (F–H) At day 10, <em>Mmp13</em> mRNA is detected in hypertrophic chondrocytes also expressing <em>Col10</em> and <em>Vegf</em>. (J–L) At day 14, <em>Mmp13</em> is expressed in mature osteoblasts co-expressing <em>Col1</em> and/or <em>Oc</em>. Scale bars: A, E, I = 1mm; B-D, F-H, J-L-200 µm.</p>
