                Figure 3.  Integral steps in endochondral ossification are unperturbed during non-stabilized fracture repair in Mmp13−/− mice.(A) Overlay of SO stained sections with in situ hybridization for Col2 (red) indicate no difference in the early differentiation of chondrocytes in WT and Mmp13−/− calluses at day 5. Overlay of SO stained sections with in situ hybridization for Col10 (yellow) shows a delay in hypertrophic chondrocyte removal in the Mmp13−/− callus at day 14. Scale bar = 1 mm (B) Cellular analyses of WT and Mmp13−/− calluses at day 14 show that blood vessels (PECAM) and osteoclasts (TRAP) are present in the Mmp13−/− callus while aggrecan cleavage by MMPs (DIPEN epitope) is reduced in the Mmp13−/− callus. Scale bar = 1 mm
