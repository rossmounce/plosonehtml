Overlay of SO stained sections with in situ hybridization for <em>Col10</em> (yellow) shows a delay in hypertrophic chondrocyte removal in the <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> callus at day 14. Scale bar = 1 mm (B) Cellular analyses of WT and <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> calluses at day 14 show that blood vessels (PECAM) and osteoclasts (TRAP) are present in the <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> callus while aggrecan cleavage by MMPs (DIPEN epitope) is reduced in the <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> callus.
