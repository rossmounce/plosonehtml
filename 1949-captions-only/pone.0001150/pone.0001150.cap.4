                Figure 4.  Mmp13−/− mice display increased bone volume during non-stabilized fracture healing.(A) Trichrome staining of WT and Mmp13−/− non-stabilized fracture calluses shows an increase in the amount of bone in the Mmp13−/− callus compared to WT at days 28 and 56 post-fracture. Scale bar = 1 mm (B) Histomorphometric measurements of total bone volume (BV) and total bone volume as a proportion of total callus volume (BV/TV) in WT and Mmp13−/− mice at days 7 (WT n = 6, Mmp13−/− n = 6), 10 (WT n = 8, Mmp13−/− n = 6), 14 (WT n = 8, Mmp13−/− n = 6), 21 (WT n = 6, Mmp13−/− n = 6), 28 (WT n = 6, Mmp13−/− n = 6) and 56 (WT n = 5, Mmp13−/− n = 4) confirm this observation There is a statistically significant decrease in BV in Mmp13−/− calluses compared with WT at day 7 (*p&lt;0.05), but a statistically significant increase in BV and BV/TV in Mmp13−/− calluses compared with WT at days 28 (**p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05 respectively) and 56 (*p&lt;0.05). Wilcoxon test, bars represent means ± S.D. (C) Histomorphometric measurements indicate a statistically significant difference in total spongy bone volume in Mmp13−/− calluses compared with WT at day 28 (**p&lt;0.01) but no difference is detected in total compact bone volume. (D) Micro-CT analyses show that bone mineral density is significantly increased in the Mmp13−/− callus compared to WT at 21 (**p&lt;0.01) and 28 (*p&lt;0.05) days post-fracture. Bonferroni corrected t-test, bars represent means ± SD.
