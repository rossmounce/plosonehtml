                Figure 6.  MMP13 is required for normal healing by intramembranous ossification.(A, Left column) SO stain of stabilized fracture calluses at day 10 post-fracture show that unlike Mmp9−/− mice, no cartilage is formed during stabilized fracture healing in Mmp13−/−mice (n = 14) compared to WT mice (n = 3). (A, Right column) At day 28, stabilized fracture calluses in Mmp13−/− mice (n = 12) appear to have increased bone volume as compared to WT (n = 14) by histology. (B) Masson's Trichrome staining of cortical defect samples at 21 and 28 days post-surgery suggests an increased amount of bone in Mmp13−/−mice. Labels designate compact (Co) and spongy (S) regions of defect. Histomorphometric analyses (within the boxed area) of WT (d21 n = 5, d28 n = 6) and Mmp13−/− (d21 n = 6, d28 n = 6) cortical defect samples confirm that there is an increase in spongy bone volume (SV/DV) but not compact volume (CoV/DV) in the defect area measured at day 21 and 28 (*p&lt;0.05) in Mmp13−/− as compared to WT. Bonferroni corrected t-test, bars represent means ± SD. Scale bars: A = 1 mm, B = 500 µM.
