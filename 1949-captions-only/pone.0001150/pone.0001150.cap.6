(A, Right column) At day 28, stabilized fracture calluses in <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<em>n</em> = 12) appear to have increased bone volume as compared to WT (<em>n</em> = 14) by histology. (B) Masson's Trichrome staining of cortical defect samples at 21 and 28 days post-surgery suggests an increased amount of bone in <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup>mice. Labels designate compact (Co) and spongy (S) regions of defect. Histomorphometric analyses (within the boxed area) of WT (d21 <em>n</em> = 5, d28 <em>n</em> = 6) and <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> (d21 <em>n</em> = 6, d28 <em>n</em> = 6) cortical defect samples confirm that there is an increase in spongy bone volume (SV/DV) but not compact volume (CoV/DV) in the defect area measured at day 21 and 28 (*p&lt;0.05) in <em>Mmp13</em><sup>−/−</sup> as compared to WT. Bonferroni corrected t-test, bars represent means ± SD. Scale bars: A = 1 mm, B = 500 µM.</p>
