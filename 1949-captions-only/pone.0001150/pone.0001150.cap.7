                Figure 7.  A model for MMP13 action in the cartilage and bone compartments of the non-stabilized fracture callus.MMP13 secreted from hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC) and osteoblasts (OB) acts upon the ECM to produce a pre-processed ECM in both compartments. This pre-processed ECM is then invaded by blood vessels and further modified by osteoclasts (OC) secreting MMP9, leading to the production of a processed ECM. This processed ECM then promotes further steps of callus maturation including hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis, replacement of cartilage by bone and new bone remodeling.
