This pre-processed ECM is then invaded by blood vessels and further modified by osteoclasts (OC) secreting MMP9, leading to the production of a processed ECM. This processed ECM then promotes further steps of callus maturation including hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis, replacement of cartilage by bone and new bone remodeling.</p>
