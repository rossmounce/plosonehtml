                Figure 1.  Green fluorescent cells in the 5HT3A-EGFP mouse brain.Cortex (A) and (F), hippocampus (B) and (G), and olfactory bulb (C) and (H) fixed by LMD-adapted and standard fixation protocol, respectively. (D) and (E) Periglomerular cell layer of olfactory bulb before and after microdissection, respectively. (A)–(E) images were made on a LMD microscope with brain sections mounted on membrane polyester slides. (F)–(H) images were made on an upright fluorescent microscope. For images (A)–(E) LMD microscope-generated scale bars are shown in the left down corner, (A)-50 µm, (B) and (C)-100 µm, (D) and (E)-25 µm. For images (F)–(H) scale bar is 25 µm.
