                Figure 2.  RNA analysis by the Bioanalyzer 2100.(A) RNA isolated from fixed tissue by the optimized proteinase K/acid phenol method described here. (B) RNA isolated from frozen tissue by the optimized proteinase K/acid phenol method. (C) RNA isolated from fixed tissue by TRIzol method. (D) RNA isolated from fixed tissue by RNeasy Micro Kit. (E) One round of amplification of RNA isolated from fixed tissue by the optimized proteinase K/acid phenol method. (F) One round of amplification of Ambion Control RNA. (G) Two rounds of amplification of RNA isolated from fixed tissue by the optimized proteinase K/acid phenol method. (H) RNA ladder: first peak is RNA marker, next mark 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000 nt.
