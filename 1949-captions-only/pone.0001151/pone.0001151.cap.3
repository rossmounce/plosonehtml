(<em>B</em>) Scatter plot between array N1 and array N3. (<em>C</em>) Scatter plot between array N2 and array N3. Diagonal lines represent 2x, 3x, 5x and 10x difference between signal detection values. Red dots = P-P, present in both experiments. Black dots = P-A, present in the first experiment and absent in the second. Green dots = A-P, absent in the first experiment and present in the second. Yellow dots = A-A, A-M, M-A, M-M, absent or marginal in the first and/or second experiment. Blue dots = M-P, P-M, present or marginal in the first or second experiment.</p>
