                Figure 3.  Scatter plots of signal detection values obtained in three independent microarray hybridizations.(A) Scatter plot between array N1 and array N2. (B) Scatter plot between array N1 and array N3. (C) Scatter plot between array N2 and array N3. Diagonal lines represent 2x, 3x, 5x and 10x difference between signal detection values. Red dots = P-P, present in both experiments. Black dots = P-A, present in the first experiment and absent in the second. Green dots = A-P, absent in the first experiment and present in the second. Yellow dots = A-A, A-M, M-A, M-M, absent or marginal in the first and/or second experiment. Blue dots = M-P, P-M, present or marginal in the first or second experiment.
