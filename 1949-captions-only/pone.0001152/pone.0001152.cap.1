                Figure 1.  Identification and mapping of a novel CD8+ response directed against Vif that expanded in two CD8+ cell-depleted EC macaques, r00078 and r01064.MHC class I alleles detected by PCR-SSP are listed for each animal. A) Unknown CD8+ responses from ex vivo ICS assays using SIV peptide pools performed one month prior to (white bars) and four weeks after (black bars) CD8+ cell depletion. Responses to 15-mer pools that did not contain previously identified minimal optimal epitope sequences [64], [73], [82] are summed for each protein. Of particular interest was an unknown SIV-specific CD8+ response directed against Vif, which expanded in two Mamu-B*17-negative ECs r00078 and r01064. B) Ex vivo ICS deconvolution of peptide pool Vif E (positions 161–214) using r00078 PBMC demonstrated that the novel CD8+ epitope was located within two overlapping 15-mers in Vif (positions 165–183). C) Ex vivo IFN-γ ELISPOT using peptide dilutions in r00078 fine-mapped the novel CD8+ epitope to an 8-mer at positions 172–179 in Vif (RRDNRRGL). Mean values from triplicate wells were calculated for each peptide test.
