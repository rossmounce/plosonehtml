A) Unknown CD8<sup>+</sup> responses from <em>ex vivo</em> ICS assays using SIV peptide pools performed one month prior to (white bars) and four weeks after (black bars) CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion. Responses to 15-mer pools that did not contain previously identified minimal optimal epitope sequences <a href="#pone.0001152-Loffredo4">[64]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001152-Mothe1">[73]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001152-Allen3">[82]</a> are summed for each protein. Of particular interest was an unknown SIV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> response directed against Vif, which expanded in two <em>Mamu-B*17</em>-negative ECs r00078 and r01064. B) <em>Ex vivo</em> ICS deconvolution of peptide pool Vif E (positions 161–214) using r00078 PBMC demonstrated that the novel CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope was located within two overlapping 15-mers in Vif (positions 165–183). C) <em>Ex vivo</em> IFN-γ ELISPOT using peptide dilutions in r00078 fine-mapped the novel CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope to an 8-mer at positions 172–179 in Vif (RRDNRRGL). Mean values from triplicate wells were calculated for each peptide test.</p>
