A) Unknown CD8<sup>+</sup> responses from <em>ex vivo</em> ICS assays using SIV peptide pools performed one month prior to (white bars) and four weeks after (black bars) CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion. Responses to 15-mer pools that did not contain previously identified minimal optimal epitope sequences [i.e., Nef<sub>159–167</sub>YY9 and Nef<sub>165–173</sub>IW9] <a href="#pone.0001152-Loffredo4">[64]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001152-Mothe1">[73]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001152-Allen3">[82]</a> are summed for each protein. Of particular interest was an unknown SIV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> response directed against Nef, which expanded in <em>Mamu-B*17</em>-positive EC r98016. B) <em>Ex vivo</em> ICS deconvolution of peptide pool Nef D (positions 125–179) using r98016 PBMC revealed that the novel CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope was located within two overlapping 15-mers in Nef (positions 133–151). C) ICS results using peptide dilutions with a Nef-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell line from r98016 fine-mapped the novel CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope to a 10-mer at positions 137–146 in Nef (RRHRILDIYL).</p>
