                Figure 2.  Identification and mapping of a novel CD8+ response directed against Nef that expanded in the CD8+ cell-depleted EC macaque r98016.MHC class I alleles detected by PCR-SSP are listed for r98016. A) Unknown CD8+ responses from ex vivo ICS assays using SIV peptide pools performed one month prior to (white bars) and four weeks after (black bars) CD8+ cell depletion. Responses to 15-mer pools that did not contain previously identified minimal optimal epitope sequences [i.e., Nef159–167YY9 and Nef165–173IW9] [64], [73], [82] are summed for each protein. Of particular interest was an unknown SIV-specific CD8+ response directed against Nef, which expanded in Mamu-B*17-positive EC r98016. B) Ex vivo ICS deconvolution of peptide pool Nef D (positions 125–179) using r98016 PBMC revealed that the novel CD8+ epitope was located within two overlapping 15-mers in Nef (positions 133–151). C) ICS results using peptide dilutions with a Nef-specific CD8+ T cell line from r98016 fine-mapped the novel CD8+ epitope to a 10-mer at positions 137–146 in Nef (RRHRILDIYL).
