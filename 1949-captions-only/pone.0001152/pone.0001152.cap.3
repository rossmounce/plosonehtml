Peptide-pulsed cells were used in ICS assays with peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell lines. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell lines raised against 15-mers derived from A) Vif (positions 165–183) from animal r00078 and B) Nef (positions 133–151) from animal r98016 were stimulated by the <em>Mamu-B*08</em> stable transfectants pulsed with the relevant peptides. The cytokine reactivity was comparable to levels elicited when autologous BLCL were used as APCs (positive control). No peptide stimulation was observed when using the <em>Mamu-A*01</em> stable transfectants as APCs (negative control). Negative controls without peptide in the presence of APCs also gave negligible cell stimulation. Percentages over each FACS dot plot signify the maximal cytokine response (total of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells, TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells, and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells).</p>
