                Figure 4.  Expansion and persistence of seven SIV-specific Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8+ lymphocyte responses in four EC macaques.MHC class I alleles detected by PCR-SSP are listed for each animal. A) Unknown CD8+ responses from ex vivo ICS assays using SIV peptide pools (containing ten 15-mers overlapping by eleven amino acids) performed one month prior to and four weeks after CD8+ cell depletion. Chronic phase (thirty weeks post-infection) ex vivo ICS data is also shown for responses in r99006 to the seven SIV 15-mer peptide pools that contain the novel CD8+ T cell epitopes. Grayed responses increased &gt;0.1% after CD8+ cell depletion (r00078, r01064, and r98016). B) Ex vivo IFN-γ ELISPOT using one or two overlapping 15-mers containing the minimal optimal Mamu-B*08-restricted SIV-specific epitopes (or the minimal optimal peptide alone, in the case of Vif172–179RL8) demonstrated that these CD8+ responses persist approximately six months post-CD8+ cell depletion in ECs r00078, r01064, and r98016. CD8+ cell responses persist in r99006 at ~3.5 years post-SIV infection. Mean values and SD from triplicate wells were calculated for each ELISPOT assay. Background (the mean of wells without peptide) levels were subtracted from each well. Mean responses &lt;50 SFC per 1×106 cells were not considered positive because these counts were not significantly above background.
