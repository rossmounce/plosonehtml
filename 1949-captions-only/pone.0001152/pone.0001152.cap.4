A) Unknown CD8<sup>+</sup> responses from <em>ex vivo</em> ICS assays using SIV peptide pools (containing ten 15-mers overlapping by eleven amino acids) performed one month prior to and four weeks after CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion. Chronic phase (thirty weeks post-infection) <em>ex vivo</em> ICS data is also shown for responses in r99006 to the seven SIV 15-mer peptide pools that contain the novel CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes. Grayed responses increased &gt;0.1% after CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion (r00078, r01064, and r98016). B) <em>Ex vivo</em> IFN-γ ELISPOT using one or two overlapping 15-mers containing the minimal optimal Mamu-B*08-restricted SIV-specific epitopes (or the minimal optimal peptide alone, in the case of Vif<sub>172–179</sub>RL8) demonstrated that these CD8<sup>+</sup> responses persist approximately six months post-CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion in ECs r00078, r01064, and r98016. CD8<sup>+</sup> cell responses persist in r99006 at ~3.5 years post-SIV infection. Mean values and SD from triplicate wells were calculated for each ELISPOT assay. Background (the mean of wells without peptide) levels were subtracted from each well. Mean responses &lt;50 SFC per 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were not considered positive because these counts were not significantly above background.</p>
