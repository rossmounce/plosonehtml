Samples were taken from the time of necropsy for four <em>Mamu-B*08</em>-positive macaques that were sacrificed with progressive SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 infection (time of necropsy indicated for each animal): r01064 (77 weeks post-CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion, 129 weeks post-SIV infection), 99C093 (127 weeks post-SIV infection), r96104 (60 weeks post-SIV infection), and r96113 (75 weeks post-SIV infection). Virus was sampled from <em>Mamu-B*08-</em>positive EC r00078 78 weeks post-CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion (161 weeks post-infection) after viral breakthrough. Virus was sampled from <em>Mamu-B*08-</em>positive EC r98016 during a transient increase in SIV replication at 48 weeks post-CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion (164 weeks post-infection) during which virus load rose to ~9,000 vRNA copy Eq/ml before returning to &lt;1,000 copy Eq/ml. Viral sequences from <em>Mamu-B*08</em>-positive animals were compared to sequences obtained at the time of necropsy from 34 <em>Mamu-B*08-</em>negative progressors <a href="#pone.0001152-OConnor3">[68]</a>. The frequency of each sequence detected in these 34 animals is listed in parentheses except for Nef 245â€“254 where sequences were available from 33 of the 34 animals. Amino acid residues immediately N-terminal to two Nef epitopes are listed and denoted with a space. Those amino acids identical to the wild-type sequence are shown as dots. Complete amino acid replacements are shown in uppercase; sites of mixed-base heterogeneity are shown in lowercase.</p>
