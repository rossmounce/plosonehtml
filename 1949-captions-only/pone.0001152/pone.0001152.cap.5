                Figure 5.  Amino acid variation in novel epitope sequences is associated with expression of Mamu-B*08.Viral RNA was isolated from cell-free plasma and directly sequenced. Samples were taken from the time of necropsy for four Mamu-B*08-positive macaques that were sacrificed with progressive SIVmac239 infection (time of necropsy indicated for each animal): r01064 (77 weeks post-CD8+ cell depletion, 129 weeks post-SIV infection), 99C093 (127 weeks post-SIV infection), r96104 (60 weeks post-SIV infection), and r96113 (75 weeks post-SIV infection). Virus was sampled from Mamu-B*08-positive EC r00078 78 weeks post-CD8+ cell depletion (161 weeks post-infection) after viral breakthrough. Virus was sampled from Mamu-B*08-positive EC r98016 during a transient increase in SIV replication at 48 weeks post-CD8+ cell depletion (164 weeks post-infection) during which virus load rose to ~9,000 vRNA copy Eq/ml before returning to &lt;1,000 copy Eq/ml. Viral sequences from Mamu-B*08-positive animals were compared to sequences obtained at the time of necropsy from 34 Mamu-B*08-negative progressors [68]. The frequency of each sequence detected in these 34 animals is listed in parentheses except for Nef 245â€“254 where sequences were available from 33 of the 34 animals. Amino acid residues immediately N-terminal to two Nef epitopes are listed and denoted with a space. Those amino acids identical to the wild-type sequence are shown as dots. Complete amino acid replacements are shown in uppercase; sites of mixed-base heterogeneity are shown in lowercase.
