Pre-depletion samples were obtained one month prior to depleting antibody treatment, when virus loads were &lt;500 vRNA copy Eq/ml. An asterisk (*) indicates a Rev sequence obtained five months prior to CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion in animal r00078. Pre-depletion sequence from r98016 containing Rev<sub>44â€“51</sub>RL8 could not be amplified despite repeated attempts and is listed as n.d. (not done). Viral RNA from pre-depletion plasma samples from r01064 could also not be amplified despite repeated attempts due to low concentrations of vRNA. Viral RNA was isolated from cell-free plasma and analyzed by direct sequencing of viral amplicons spanning the SIV genes <em>vif</em>, <em>rev</em>, and <em>nef</em>. Amino acids residues immediately N-terminal to two Nef epitopes are listed and denoted with a space. Those amino acids identical to the wild-type sequence are shown as dots. Complete amino acid replacements are shown in uppercase; sites of mixed-base heterogeneity are shown as lowercase.</p>
