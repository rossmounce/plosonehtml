                Figure 1.  EGCG effectively abrogated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells.RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS in the absence, or presence of EGCG at indicated concentrations. At 16 hours after LPS stimulation, levels of HMGB1 (Panel A), TNF (Panel B), or nitric oxide (NO, Panel C) in the culture medium were determined by Western blotting, ELISA, and Griess reaction, respectively. Note that at concentrations that completely abrogated LPS-induced HMGB1 release (Panel A), EGCG only partially inhibited LPS-induced TNF secretion (Panel B), but preserved suppress LPS-induced nitric oxide release (Panel C).
