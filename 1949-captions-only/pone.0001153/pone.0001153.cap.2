At 16 hours after LPS stimulation, levels of HMGB1 (Panel A, B), nitric oxide (Panel A), TNF (Panel B), or other cytokines (Panel C) in the culture medium were determined by Western blotting analysis (Panel A, B, top), Griess reaction (Panel A, bottom), ELISA (Panel B, bottom), or cytokine array (Panel C), respectively. Note that at concentrations that completely abrogated LPS-induced HMGB1 release, EGCG did not block LPS-induced release of NO (Panel A), G-CSF (Panel C), IL-1α (Panel C), P-selectin (Panel C), or LIX (Panel C). In contrast, EGCG dramatically suppressed LPS-induced release of TNF, sTNF-RII, chemokines (MCP1, MIPs, KC, and RABTES), IL-6, IL-12, and CXCL16 in primary murine macrophages (Panel C). Shown in Panel C was a representative cytokine array of two independent experiments with similar results.</p>
