                Figure 3.  Delayed administration of EGCG still significantly attenuated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release.Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, and EGCG (10 µM) was added at 0, 2, 6, and 12 hours post LPS stimulation. Levels of HMGB1 levels in the culture medium were determined at 16 hours after LPS stimulation, and expressed (in arbitrary unit, AU) as mean±S.D. of two independent experiments (N = 2). Shown in the lower panel was a representative Western blot. *, P&lt;0.05 versus controls (“+ LPS alone”).
