Levels of HMGB1 levels in the culture medium were determined at 16 hours after LPS stimulation, and expressed (in arbitrary unit, AU) as mean±S.D. of two independent experiments (N = 2). Shown in the lower panel was a representative Western blot. *, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 versus controls (“+ LPS alone”).</p>
