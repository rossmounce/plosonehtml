                Figure 4.  EGCG, but not catechin or ethyl gallate, effectively abrogated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release.Macrophage cultures were stimulated with LPS in the absence, or presence of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), catechin (C), or ethyl gallate (G) (Panel A), and assayed for HMGB1 release by Western blotting analysis (Panel B) at 16 h post LPS stimulation. Note that epigallocatechin gallate, but not catechin or ethyl gallate, abrogated LPS-induced HMGB1 release.
