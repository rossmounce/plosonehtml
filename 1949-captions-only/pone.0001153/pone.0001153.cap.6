At 52 hours post the onset of sepsis, serum levels of cytokines (Panel A, B, C), or HMGB1 (Panel C) were determined by cytokine antibody array (Panel A, B), ELISA (Panel C), or Western blotting analysis (Panel C), respectively. In parallel experiments, serum were pooled from 3 normal mice (-CLP), 3 septic mice approaching moribund state (52 h post CLP), 3 septic mice in non-moribund state (52 h post CLP), and assayed for cytokine profile by antibody array (Panel B). Serum levels of HMGB1 or TNF (Panel C) were expressed as mean±SD (n = 8–10). *, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 (ANOVA, Tukey test).</p>
