                Figure 7.  EGCG attenuates HMGB1-induced release of proinflammatory mediators.Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells (Panel A, Panel C) or primary murine peritoneal macrophages (Panel B) were stimulated with HMGB1 (2.0 Âµg/ml) in the absence, or presence of EGCG added at indicated concentrations, and time points post HMGB1 stimulation. At 16 hours after HMGB1 stimulation, levels of TNF (Panel A, B, top), IL-6 (Panel C), nitric oxide (Panel A, B, bottom) in the culture medium were determined by ELISA or Griess reaction (Panel A, B), respectively.
