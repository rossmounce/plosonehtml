                Figure 8.  EGCG prevents HMGB1 accumulation/clustering on macrophage cell surface.Macrophage cultures were incubated with biotin-labeled CBP-HMGB1 fusion protein (“+ HMGB1”, 2 μg/ml), in the absence (Panel A), or presence (Panel B, C) of EGCG (10 µM) for various period of time. To visualize exogenous HMGB1, cells were stained with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 594 (Panel A, “Streptavidin Alexa 594”) or Alexa 488 (Panel B, “Streptavidin Alexa 488” ), or HMGB1-specific rabbit antibodies plus Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (Panel A, “Anti-HMGB1 Alexa 488”). Phase contras images indicate macrophage cell morphology; overlay images show co-localization of red and green fluorescence (as yellow). Note anti-HMGB1 antibody-specific immunostaining revealed the presence of both exogenous (on cell surface) and endogenous HMGB1 (in the nucleus) at 4–6 hours post HMGB1 incubation (Panel A, “Anti-HMGB1 Alexa 488”). To determine the relative content of exogenous HMGB1, streptvidin-pulled down fraction or whole cell lysate were immunoblotted with HMGB1-specific antibodies (Panel C). Note EGCG dramatically decreased levels of exogenous HMGB1 (indicated by the 33 kDa band corresponding to CBP-HMGB1 fusion protein) (“rHMGB1”).
