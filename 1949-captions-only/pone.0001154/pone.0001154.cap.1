When possible, anchor regions were actually the primer binding sites. <em>Step 4</em>: each sequence entered into a database and used as a query sequence. The process is repeated for more species, with promising regions, or with new markers. The PWG suggested primer regions (<a href="http://www.kew.org/barcoding">www.kew.org/barcoding</a>) are used as the example.</p>
