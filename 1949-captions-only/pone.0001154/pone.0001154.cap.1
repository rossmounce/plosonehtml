                Figure 1.  Barcoding optimization workflow.Step 1: genera used for testing all primer pairs, amplification products of each combination of primer pairs, and primer pair combination chosen for testing on more genera (highlighted in blue). Step 2: taxa subject to further testing and success of amplification with chosen primer pairs (highlighted in gray). Step 3: trimming all sequences to highly similar anchor regions. When possible, anchor regions were actually the primer binding sites. Step 4: each sequence entered into a database and used as a query sequence. The process is repeated for more species, with promising regions, or with new markers. The PWG suggested primer regions (www.kew.org/barcoding) are used as the example.
