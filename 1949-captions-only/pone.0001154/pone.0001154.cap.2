                Figure 2.  Success of species and genus level identification using CBoL proposed gene regions.Performance (% correct identification) at genus and species levels is noted for each marker for each of the 10 genera tested. No bar indicates failure of identification (0% success). Values are identical for BLAST and DNA-BAR/DEGENBAR.
