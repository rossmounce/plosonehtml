                Figure 3.  Amplification of PCR producing using published psbA-trnH primers.A: All genera except Cycas showed double bands, some genera had more prominent smaller fragments (e.g. Dioon), while others had more prominent larger fragments (e.g. Macrozamia). B: When more stringent reaction conditions were applied by running the amplification with the primer annealing temperature at 62Â°C, double bands were still evident.
