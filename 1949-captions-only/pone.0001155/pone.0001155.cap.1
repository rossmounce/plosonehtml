Immunostaning for β-Catenin in a control pancreas is confined to the plasma membrane. B. In contrast, cytoplasmic β-catenin expression is observed in PanIN lesions and tumor of a 8-week old <em>Pdx-Cre;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;p53<sup>f/+</sup></em> pancreas. The tumor is outlined in red. Note the accumulation of β-catenin in the epithelial cells (brown staining). Two PanIN lesions are outlined in light blue. The black arrow points at cells that have retained membranous β-catenin, while the red arrows point at areas of accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. C. Tcf4 is expressed at a low level in ductal cells in a wild-type mouse pancreas. D. Elevated expression of Tcf4 in PanIN lesions of a 12-week old <em>Pdx-Cre;Kras<sup>G12D</sup></em> pancreas. E, F. LacZ staining of pancreatic tissue of adult (6 months old) <em>Top-gal</em> (E) and <em>Pdx-Cre;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Top-gal</em> (F) mice. No staining is present in the <em>Top-gal</em> pancreas. ß-galactosidase activity is detected in the PanIN lesions of the <em>Pdx-Cre;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Top-gal</em> pancreas, indicating activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. The black bar represents 35 µm in A-D, 67.5 µm in E, F.</p>
