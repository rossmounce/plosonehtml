                Figure 1.  Active Wnt signaling in a mouse model of PDA.A. Immunostaning for β-Catenin in a control pancreas is confined to the plasma membrane. B. In contrast, cytoplasmic β-catenin expression is observed in PanIN lesions and tumor of a 8-week old Pdx-Cre;KrasG12D;p53f/+ pancreas. The tumor is outlined in red. Note the accumulation of β-catenin in the epithelial cells (brown staining). Two PanIN lesions are outlined in light blue. The black arrow points at cells that have retained membranous β-catenin, while the red arrows point at areas of accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. C. Tcf4 is expressed at a low level in ductal cells in a wild-type mouse pancreas. D. Elevated expression of Tcf4 in PanIN lesions of a 12-week old Pdx-Cre;KrasG12D pancreas. E, F. LacZ staining of pancreatic tissue of adult (6 months old) Top-gal (E) and Pdx-Cre;KrasG12D;Top-gal (F) mice. No staining is present in the Top-gal pancreas. ß-galactosidase activity is detected in the PanIN lesions of the Pdx-Cre;KrasG12D;Top-gal pancreas, indicating activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. The black bar represents 35 µm in A-D, 67.5 µm in E, F.
