RT-PCR analysis for components of the Wnt signaling pathway in 26 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines: 1-MiaPaca2; 2-Panc1; 3-CFPAC1; 4-HPAFII; 5-Capan-2; 6-AsPC1; 7-Hs766T; 8-BxPC3; 9-COLO357; 10-L3.3; 11-L3.6sl; 12-L3.6pl; 13-SW1990; 14-SU86.86; 15-PL45; 16-HPAC; 17-MPanc96; 18-Panc1.28; 19-Panc2.03; 20-Panc2.13; 21-Panc3.27; 22-Panc4.21; 23-Panc5.04; 24-Panc6.03; 25-Panc8.13; 26-Panc10.05. B. Wnt signaling is active in all nine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines tested, as indicated by the activation of the Top-Flash reporter (black) compared to the basal activity of the Fop-Flash reporter (white). Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Error bars are shown as St. Dev. P-values were calculated in comparison to control Fop-Flash activity (white bars). *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.</p>
