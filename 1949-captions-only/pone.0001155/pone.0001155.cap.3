Inhibition of Wnt signaling in four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Cells transfected with Fop-Flash (white) or Top-Flash (light gray) reporter constructs were co-transfected with an empty expression vector or an expression vector containing the Wnt-inhibitors <em>Icat</em> (dark gray) or dominant-negative <em>Lef1</em> (<em>dnLef</em>; black). Fop-Flash activity was not affected by either <em>Icat</em> or <em>dn-Lef</em> co-transfection, thus only one Fop-Flash data point is shown. The significant reduction of Top-Flash activity in cells expressing the inhibitors indicates inhibition of Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. P-values were calculated in comparison to Top-Flash activity (light gray bar). B. Immunofluorescent staining against β-<em>CATENIN</em> in four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines after transfection with a siRNA directed against β-<em>CATENIN</em>. The β-CATENIN protein levels are dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner following β-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA transfection. Control siRNA transfected cells have β-CATENIN levels indistinguishable from those found in untransfected cells (untreated). C. Transfection with an <em>Icat–IRES-eGFP</em> expression vector (<em>Icat</em>, black) or dominant negative Lef – <em>IRES-eGFP</em> (<em>dnLef</em>, gray) strongly inhibits growth of four pancreatic cancer cells lines, measured as the ability to incorporate BrdU. Control cells (white) were transfected with the <em>IRES-eGFP</em> expression vector; all cells were harvested 48 hrs after transfection. P-values are shown in comparison to control transfected cells. D. Proliferation is reduced in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated for 48hrs with anti-ß-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA (dark grey, black,) compared to control cells (white). Untreated (no siRNA), white columns; control siRNA (300 nM), light grey columns; anti-ß-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA (100 nM), dark grey columns; anti-ß-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA (300 nM), black columns. P-values are shown in comparison to untreated controls (white columns). E. Level of apoptosis, measured as cells with DNA content lower than the diploid amount, in control transfected cells (white) or cells transfected with <em>Icat</em> (black) or dominant negative <em>Lef</em> (grey). F. Treatment with anti-ß-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA increases levels of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Error bars are shown as St. Dev.; P-values, #, not significant; *, p&lt;0.05; **,&nbsp;p&lt;0.01.</p>
