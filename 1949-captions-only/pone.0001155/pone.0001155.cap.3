                Figure 3.  Inhibition of Wnt signaling blocks adenocarcinoma cell proliferation.A. Inhibition of Wnt signaling in four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Cells transfected with Fop-Flash (white) or Top-Flash (light gray) reporter constructs were co-transfected with an empty expression vector or an expression vector containing the Wnt-inhibitors Icat (dark gray) or dominant-negative Lef1 (dnLef; black). Fop-Flash activity was not affected by either Icat or dn-Lef co-transfection, thus only one Fop-Flash data point is shown. The significant reduction of Top-Flash activity in cells expressing the inhibitors indicates inhibition of Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. P-values were calculated in comparison to Top-Flash activity (light gray bar). B. Immunofluorescent staining against β-CATENIN in four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines after transfection with a siRNA directed against β-CATENIN. The β-CATENIN protein levels are dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner following β-CATENIN siRNA transfection. Control siRNA transfected cells have β-CATENIN levels indistinguishable from those found in untransfected cells (untreated). C. Transfection with an Icat–IRES-eGFP expression vector (Icat, black) or dominant negative Lef – IRES-eGFP (dnLef, gray) strongly inhibits growth of four pancreatic cancer cells lines, measured as the ability to incorporate BrdU. Control cells (white) were transfected with the IRES-eGFP expression vector; all cells were harvested 48 hrs after transfection. P-values are shown in comparison to control transfected cells. D. Proliferation is reduced in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated for 48hrs with anti-ß-CATENIN siRNA (dark grey, black,) compared to control cells (white). Untreated (no siRNA), white columns; control siRNA (300 nM), light grey columns; anti-ß-CATENIN siRNA (100 nM), dark grey columns; anti-ß-CATENIN siRNA (300 nM), black columns. P-values are shown in comparison to untreated controls (white columns). E. Level of apoptosis, measured as cells with DNA content lower than the diploid amount, in control transfected cells (white) or cells transfected with Icat (black) or dominant negative Lef (grey). F. Treatment with anti-ß-CATENIN siRNA increases levels of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Error bars are shown as St. Dev.; P-values, #, not significant; *, p&lt;0.05; **,&nbsp;p&lt;0.01.
