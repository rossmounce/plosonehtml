Activity of the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in control PDCs and stable clones transfected with dominant-active forms of <em>GLI2</em> (PDC-<em>GLI2</em>). Activation of the Hedgehog pathway in two PDC-<em>GLI2</em> clones (#1, #2) results in significant increase in Wnt signaling activity. B. Activity of the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in control PDCs and PDCs stably transfected with a dominant active form of <em>Lef1</em> (PDC-<em>Lef–da</em>). Activation of the Wnt pathway in the PDC-<em>Lef–da</em> cells does not affect the level of Hedgehog signaling. Error bars are shown as St. Dev. P-values, #, not significant; **p&lt;0.01. C. PDC cells were stably transfected with a myc-tagged version of the constitutive active form of <em>GLI2</em> (GLI2-myc fusion protein). Immunostaining using an anti-myc antibody confirms GLI2 expression in transfected cells. Untransfected PDC cells are shown as negative control. Immunostaining for Tcf4 is not detectable in wt PDC cells, but it is strongly upregulated in PDC-<em>GLI2</em> cells. D. Immunohistochemistry analysis of Panc4.21 and L3.6sl pancreatic cancer cell lines shows that inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway using anti-β-<em>CATENIN</em> siRNA (100nM) results in a strong downregulation of TCF4 expression compared to control cells (transfected with an unrelated siRNA). Similarly, inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway using an anti-<em>GLI1/2</em> siRNA (100 nM) results in TCF4 downregulation; the same effect is observed in cells treated with a combination of anti-β-CATENIN and anti-<em>GLI</em>1/2 siRNA (each 100nM). E. Quantification of Tcf4 expression in PDC (white) and PDC-GLI2 (black) cells. At least 100 cell nuclei were scored for Tcf4 expression and the percentage of positive nuclei is shown in the histogram. F. Quantification of TCF4 positive nuclei following siRNA treatment in human PDA cell lines. At least 100 nuclei were scored for each category: control siRNA (white), anti-β-CATENIN siRNA (light gray), anti-GLI siRNA (dark gray) and a combination of both siRNAs (black). Error bars are shown as St. Dev.; p-values #, not significant; *p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01. G. In wild-type mouse pancreas tissue, β-catenin is only localized at the cell membrane. H. Presence of nuclear β-catenin in a fraction of the tumors cells in an undifferentiated pancreatic tumor of a <em>Pdx-Cre;CLEG2</em> mouse. I. Cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin staining in the PanIN lesions of a <em>Pdx-Cre;CLEG2;Kras<sup>G12D</sup></em> pancreas. The black bar represents 35 µm in G-I.</p>
