(A) the parasite has deceleratingly costly epistasis, (B) the parasite has linear epistasis and (C) the parasite has acceleratingly costly epistasis. In all cases the host has deceleratingly costly epistasis. The dashed lines show the boundary separating the regions where every simulation out of 20 replicates resulted in coevolutionary cycles (below the line) and where at least one of the replicate simulations resulted in a static single-resistance-no-virulence equilibrium (above the line).</p>
