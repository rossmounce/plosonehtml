                Figure 3.  Coevolutionary host and parasite trajectories for different host (cH) and parasite (cP) costs, assuming deceleratingly costly epistasis for both the host and the parasite.The upper and middle panels show the frequency distributions over time of the number of virulence alleles in the parasite population and the number of resistance alleles in the host population, respectively. The bottom panels show the change in frequency of the host resistance alleles at each locus, where different line styles represent different loci. In all cases σ = 0.2, βH = 1, βP = 1 and μ, the mutation rate at each locus, was 2×10−5 per generation.
