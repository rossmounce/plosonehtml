Genomic composition of <em>A. suecica</em>. <em>A. suecica</em> is an allotetraploid hybrid that possesses a 2<em>x</em> chromosome complement from both <em>A. thaliana</em> (1<em>x</em> = 5 chromosomes) and <em>A. arenosa</em> (1<em>x</em> = 8 chromosomes). B. Analysis of rRNA transcripts in cotyledons and leaves. RNA isolated from cotyledons, pooled RNA from the first 4 true leaves to emerge, and fully expanded leaves of mature plants was subjected to S1 nuclease protection using probes specific for either <em>A. thaliana</em> (top row) or <em>A. arenosa-</em>derived (bottom row) rRNA transcripts. Images are from the same exposure of the same autoradiogram. C. Silencing of <em>A. thaliana-</em>derived rRNA genes is accompanied by a euchromatin to heterochromatin transition, observed as the loss of H3K4me3 association and a concomitant increased association with H3K9me2. Aliquots of total input chromatin, or chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for H3K4me3 or H3K9me2 and then captured on protein A beads, was dot-blotted in duplicate rows. Each row was then hybridized to a radioactively labeled probe derived from the rapidly evolving intergenic spacer (IGS) region of an <em>A. arenosa</em> or <em>A. thaliana</em>-rRNA gene repeat (see diagram). No antibody was present in the “beads only” control reactions, revealing the background levels of hybridization in the absence of histone immunoprecipitation. D. Simultaneous detection of <em>A. thaliana</em> NORs (green signals) and H3K9me2 (red signals) by DNA-FISH and immunolocalization, respectively, in nuclei of cotyledons and mature leaves. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (blue signals). For each nucleus, a pair of images is shown; the image on the right includes the DAPI signal in order to reveal the position of the nucleolus, which appears as a black hole due to the paucity of nucleolar DNA.
