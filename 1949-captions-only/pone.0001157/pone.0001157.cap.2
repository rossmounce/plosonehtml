Nucleolar dominance is progressively established in roots, as in leaves. Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using primer pairs that specifically amplify either <em>A. thaliana</em> or <em>A. arenosa-</em>derived rRNA gene transcripts. For each RNA sample, duplicate PCR reactions were conducted. The controls at the left of the figure show that <em>A. thaliana</em>-specific primers fail to yield a PCR product using <em>A. arenosa</em> RNA as the template; likewise <em>A. arenosa</em>-specific primers do not amplify <em>A. thaliana</em> RNA. Remaining reactions utilized total RNA isolated from roots harvested 2 days, 4 days and &gt;3 weeks post-germination. B. Developmentally regulated silencing of <em>A. thaliana-</em>derived rRNA genes is accompanied by alterations in NOR organization. The degree to which NORs in <em>A. suecica</em> root tip cells are condensed and/or associated with histones bearing euchromatic (H3K4me3) or heterochromatic (H3K9me2) marks was assessed by immunolocalization of histones H3K9me2 and H3K4me3 (red signals) in combination with DNA-FISH (green signals). In the top two rows, the DNA-FISH probe is derived from the intergenic spacer of <em>A. thaliana</em> rRNA genes and is specific for <em>A. thaliana</em>-derived NORs. Likewise, in the bottom two rows an analogous probe specific for <em>A. arenosa</em>-derived NORs was used for DNA-FISH. In all nuclei, DNA was counterstained with DAPI (blue signals). For each nucleus, a pair of images is shown; the image on the right includes the DAPI signal. Size bars denote 5 micrometers.</p>
