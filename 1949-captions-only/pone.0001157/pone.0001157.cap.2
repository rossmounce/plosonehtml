                Figure 2.  Establishment of nucleolar dominance in roots.A. Nucleolar dominance is progressively established in roots, as in leaves. Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using primer pairs that specifically amplify either A. thaliana or A. arenosa-derived rRNA gene transcripts. For each RNA sample, duplicate PCR reactions were conducted. The controls at the left of the figure show that A. thaliana-specific primers fail to yield a PCR product using A. arenosa RNA as the template; likewise A. arenosa-specific primers do not amplify A. thaliana RNA. Remaining reactions utilized total RNA isolated from roots harvested 2 days, 4 days and &gt;3 weeks post-germination. B. Developmentally regulated silencing of A. thaliana-derived rRNA genes is accompanied by alterations in NOR organization. The degree to which NORs in A. suecica root tip cells are condensed and/or associated with histones bearing euchromatic (H3K4me3) or heterochromatic (H3K9me2) marks was assessed by immunolocalization of histones H3K9me2 and H3K4me3 (red signals) in combination with DNA-FISH (green signals). In the top two rows, the DNA-FISH probe is derived from the intergenic spacer of A. thaliana rRNA genes and is specific for A. thaliana-derived NORs. Likewise, in the bottom two rows an analogous probe specific for A. arenosa-derived NORs was used for DNA-FISH. In all nuclei, DNA was counterstained with DAPI (blue signals). For each nucleus, a pair of images is shown; the image on the right includes the DAPI signal. Size bars denote 5 micrometers.
