                Figure 3.  Histone deacetylases HDT1 and HDA6 are required for A. thaliana NOR condensation and heterochromatinization during early postembryonic development.A. Establishment of nucleolar dominance is impaired in HDT1-RNAi and HDA6-RNAi lines. RNA was isolated from A. thaliana (A.t.) and A. arenosa (A.a.) controls, as well as from wild-type (non-transgenic) and T3 generation HDT1- and HDA6-RNAi A. suecica lines. Following RT-PCR using primers that flank internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), amplified cDNA was subjected to HhaI digestion, which allows A.t. and A.a.-derived rRNA gene transcripts to be discriminated following agarose gel electrophoresis (see diagram). B. Combined histone immunolocalization (red signals) and DNA-FISH detection of A. thaliana-derived NORs (green signals) in root nuclei of A. suecica HDT1-RNAi and HDA6-RNAi lines. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. The size bars denote 5 micrometers. C. DNA-FISH detection of A. thaliana-derived NORs (green signals) in the meristematic zone of whole-mounted root tips 15 days post-germination. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (grey signals). The image at left shows a stained root tip for which the position of the meristematic zone is indicated. The meristematic zone nuclei of wild-type, HDT1-RNAi and HDA6-RNAi plants that are enclosed by rectangles are shown at higher magnification, with and without the DAPI signals, in the bottom row of images.
