Establishment of nucleolar dominance is impaired in <em>HDT1</em>-RNAi and <em>HDA6</em>-RNAi lines. RNA was isolated from <em>A. thaliana</em> (<em>A.t.</em>) and <em>A. arenosa</em> (<em>A.a.</em>) controls, as well as from wild-type (non-transgenic) and T3 generation <em>HDT1</em>- and <em>HDA6</em>-RNAi <em>A. suecica</em> lines. Following RT-PCR using primers that flank internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), amplified cDNA was subjected to <em>Hha</em>I digestion, which allows A.t. and A.a.-derived rRNA gene transcripts to be discriminated following agarose gel electrophoresis (see diagram). B. Combined histone immunolocalization (red signals) and DNA-FISH detection of <em>A. thaliana</em>-derived NORs (green signals) in root nuclei of <em>A. suecica HDT1</em>-RNAi and <em>HDA6</em>-RNAi lines. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. The size bars denote 5 micrometers. C. DNA-FISH detection of <em>A. thaliana</em>-derived NORs (green signals) in the meristematic zone of whole-mounted root tips 15 days post-germination. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (grey signals). The image at left shows a stained root tip for which the position of the meristematic zone is indicated. The meristematic zone nuclei of wild-type, HDT1-RNAi and HDA6-RNAi plants that are enclosed by rectangles are shown at higher magnification, with and without the DAPI signals, in the bottom row of images.</p>
