                Figure 4.  HDT1 and HDA6 nuclear distributions at different developmental stages in A. suecica roots.Antibodies specific for HDA6 or HDT1 were used to immunolocalize the proteins (green signals) relative to A. thaliana-derived NORs detected by DNA-FISH (red signals). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. The size bar denotes 5 micrometers.
