                Figure 5.  Colocalization of A. thaliana NORs with 5-methylcytosine-enriched chromocenters is disrupted in HDT1- and HDA6-RNAi lines.A. suecica root nuclei isolated from 2, 4 and 15 day-old plants was subjected to simultaneous immunolocalization of 5-methylcytosine (green signals) and DNA-FISH detection of A. thaliana-derived NORs (red signals). DNA was counterstained with DAPI (blue signals). The size bars denote 5 micrometers. Note the nearly perfect colocalization of A. thaliana-derived NORs with 5-methylcytosine-enriched chromocenters in nuclei of 15 day-old wild-type roots; this fails to occur in the knockdown lines.
