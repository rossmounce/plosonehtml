                Figure 1.  Microscopic revelation of numerous MLV particles in FDC network with increased PrP expression after immune-stimulation of a C57Bl/6 mouse with IC.(A) Ultrastructure of splenic FDC revealed by TEM. Large panel displays plastic section 70 nm thin, showing lymphocytes with dark round nuclei (L), and part of an FDC with lobate nucleus (F) and labyrinthine extensions. Small dark spots (arrows) on FDC extensions represent viral particles. Bar, 2.5 µm. Inset shows cryosection 90 nm thin, depicting viral particles on FDC extension. Dot-like gold particles represent immunostaining specific for MLV Env protein. Bar, 0.5 µm. (B) Co-localized immunofluorescence staining of PrP and MLV Env in splenic germinal center. Semithin (400 nm) cryosection was double-stained with rabbit serum specific for PrP and rat monoclonal antibody specific for MLV Env. Bar, 25 µm.
