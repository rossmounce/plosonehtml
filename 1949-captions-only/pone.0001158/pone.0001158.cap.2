                Figure 2.  Immunoblots showing increase of PrP and mature MLV p30 in spleens of immune-stimulated mice.(A) Comparison of PrP and mature p30 abundance following various immune-stimuli. C57Bl/6 mice were infected with VSV or LCMV, or treated with thioglycolate (TG) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Eight days after immune-stimulation spleen homogenates were analyzed by Western blot for PrP (upper panels) and p30 (lower panels). Representative blots are shown. Protein bands revealing mature p30 protein are boxed. (B) Capacity of various inbred mouse strains to respond to VSV infection with increased abundance of PrP and p30. Mice of the strains DBA/2, BALB/c and 129/Sv were infected with VSV. Splenic PrP and MLV p30 were analysed on day 8 after infection. Representative blots are shown. (C) Kinetic of PrP and p30 abundance following VSV infection. Spleens of C57BL/6 mice were analyzed on day 0, 3, 5, 8 and 14, respectively, after infection. In the presented Western blots homogenates of three spleens per time point group were pooled for analysis, in order to obtain averaged results. (D) Different kinetics of PrP and p30 abundance in 129/Sv, C57BL/6 and Prnp−/− (Nagasaki) mice. Spleens were analyzed on day 0, 8 and 30, respectively, after infection. Per experimental group homogenates of three spleens were pooled.
