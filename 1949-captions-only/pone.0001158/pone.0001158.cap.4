                Figure 4.  Quantification of splenic IMERV activity.Open plot symbols represent naïve, filled symbols VSV-infected C57Bl/6 (□,▪), BALB/c (▵,▴), DBA/2 (▿,▾) or 129/Sv (○,•) mice. Short horizontal lines indicate average values of respective experimental categories. (A) RT activity in spleen homogenates on day 8 after VSV infection, as revealed by PERT assay. (B) Relative abundance of RNA with IMERV-1 and IMERV-2 specific sequences on day 8 after VSV infection, as assessed by real-time RT-PCR on total splenic RNA. (C) Relative abundance of mature MLV p30 in spleen homogenates on day 30 after VSV infection, as determined by densitometric quantification of immunoblots. Samples were obtained from C57Bl/6 wild-type mice (+/+), Prnp−/− (Nagasaki) mice (−/−) and F1 offsprings of a crossing of the former two lines (+/−).
