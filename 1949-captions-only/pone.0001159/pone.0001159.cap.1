                Figure 1.  Map of Salinas, CA region showing sample locations.Farm A is marked as a black dot. The circle marked with “X” is coded by positions numbered clockwise 1 to 23 and representing the sampling dates show in the list below the circle. The approximate rainfall in cm for the 5 days prior to sampling is shown in the list. Dates indicated in red text indicate at least one EcO157 strain was isolated on that date. Circles on the map designated “A” through “V” correspond to the locations where samples were obtained; these are also listed in Table S1. Open circles within the “Location circle” designate that no sample was obtained on that date; blue circles designate that a sample was obtained, but no EcO157 strain was isolated; and red circles designate that a sample was obtained, and at least one strain of EcO157 was isolated.
