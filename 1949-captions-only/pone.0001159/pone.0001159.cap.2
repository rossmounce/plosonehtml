EcO157 incidence is calculated as the fraction of the number of positive samples compared to the total samples obtained. The flow rate was obtained from data from the USGS sampling station #11152600 located at position D (see <a href="#pone-0001159-g001">Figure 1</a>). EcO157 incidence and generic <em>E. coli</em> concentration were determined with duplicate samples.</p>
