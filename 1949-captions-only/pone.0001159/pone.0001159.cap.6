                Figure 6.  The persistence and transport of EcO157 in a stream in an elevated area near a point source.The change in stream elevation is indicated as a function of the distance from a corral with cattle. Sampling positions are indicated by: â§«; different MLVA types isolated from each location are indicated. The inset shows a phylogenetic tree designating the relationship among the MLVA types isolated in this study (see Figure 7 and Table S1 for more detail).
