                Figure 7.  A comparison of the phylogenetic relationships among 92 MLVA types.The size of the circles indicate relative number of isolates of each MLVA type (numbers in the circles) recovered from the environment. Those MLVA types shown with the smallest circles were isolated only once. Letters Aâ€“H indicate clusters (colored regions) in which types differ at only 1 of the 10 MLVA loci from a neighbor.
