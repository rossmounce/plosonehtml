                Figure 8.  Dendrogram of selected isolates from PFGE data.Taxa are designated as RMXXXX (##), where RMXXXX is the isolate name and ## is an arbitrary number assigned to that MLVA type [refer to Table S1]. Taxa in red type are identical MLVA types differentiated by PFGE. Colored clusters (labeled Bâ€“H) are similar to labeled MLVA clusters in Figure 7.
