With both methods, two-ways ANOVA showed an effect of age (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001) and housing condition (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) and a significant age×housing condition interaction (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001). Mann-Whitney rank sum test with Bonferroni correction revealed a difference between EC and SC at E18, E20 and P1 (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001) for the tunel method, and at E18 and P1 (<em>p</em> = 0.002) for cresyl violet staining. (B) RGC number was not different between SC and EC adult rats either as estimated by calculating the 50% of total cell number in the RGC layer (A), or by subtracting the number of displaced amacrine cells remaining in the RGC layer 30 days after ipsilateral optic nerve transection from the number of cells counted in contralateral retinas (B) (<em>p</em> = 0.77 and 0.28, t-test). (C) Micrographs of RGC layer of P1 whole mount retinas labeled with B4 isolectin. No qualitative difference was detected in the shape and intensity of microglial cells between SC and EC pups. Scale bar: 20 µm. Graph: microglial cell number in the RGC layer of SC and EC rats. Mann-Whitney rank sum test showed no difference between the two groups (<em>p</em> = 0.429). Bars indicate s.e.m.</p>
