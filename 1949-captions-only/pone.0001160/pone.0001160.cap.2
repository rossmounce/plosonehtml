                Figure 2.  Anticipated migration of retinal neural progenitors in EC fetuses.(A, top) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for double-cortin (DCX) at E15 and E18. DCX expression was increased in EC rats at E15. (A, bottom) Quantitative analysis of DCX immunofluorescence intensity in the outer retinal layers of SC and EC rats. Two-ways ANOVA showed a statistical interaction between animal age and housing condition (p = 0.02). A Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedure (Holm-Sidak method) revealed that the two groups were statistically different at E15 (p = 0.03), but not at E18 (p = 0.19). (B, top) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for double-cortin (DCX) at E15, acquired at 5× (left, scale bar: 100 µm) or 20× (right, scale bar: 50 µm) magnification to count the number of migrating cells. (B, bottom) Number of cells stained for DCX in the outer retinal layers of SC and EC rats. The number of DCX-labeled cells was higher in EC than in SC embryos (Mann-Whitney rank sum Test, p&lt;0.05). Bars indicate s.e.m.
