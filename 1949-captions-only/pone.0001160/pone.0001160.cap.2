DCX expression was increased in EC rats at E15. (A, bottom) Quantitative analysis of DCX immunofluorescence intensity in the outer retinal layers of SC and EC rats. Two-ways ANOVA showed a statistical interaction between animal age and housing condition (<em>p</em> = 0.02). A Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedure (Holm-Sidak method) revealed that the two groups were statistically different at E15 (<em>p</em> = 0.03), but not at E18 (<em>p</em> = 0.19). (B, top) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for double-cortin (DCX) at E15, acquired at 5× (left, scale bar: 100 µm) or 20× (right, scale bar: 50 µm) magnification to count the number of migrating cells. (B, bottom) Number of cells stained for DCX in the outer retinal layers of SC and EC rats. The number of DCX-labeled cells was higher in EC than in SC embryos (Mann-Whitney rank sum Test, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). Bars indicate s.e.m.</p>
