(A, bottom) Number of cells stained for ISLET-1 in the outer retinal layers of SC and EC rats. The number of ISLET-1-labeled cells was higher in EC than in SC embryos (t-test, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). Bars indicate s.e.m. (B) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for calbindin (a marker for horizontal cells) at E15, acquired at 20× (scale bar: 50 µm). The number of calbindin-labeled cells did not differ between EC and SC embryos (t-test, <em>p</em> = 0.253). (C) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections co-immunostained for DCX (red) and ISLET-1 (green) at E15, acquired at 60x. Scale bar: 10 µm.</p>
