Bars indicate s.e.m. (B–C) Enhanced IGF-I expression in the RGC layer of EC rats. (B) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for IGF-I at different ages. Scale bar: 50 µm (C) Quantitative analysis of IGF-I immunofluorescence intensity in the RGC layer of SC and EC rats. Two-ways ANOVA showed an effect of age (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001) and housing condition (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001). t-test with Bonferroni correction revealed a statistical difference between EC and SC groups at E15 (<em>p</em> = 0.009) and E18 (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01).</p>
