                Figure 4.  (A) Increased IGF-I concentration in the maternal milk.RIA determination of IGF-I concentration in the milk of SC and EC suckling pups: two-ways ANOVA showed a significant age×housing condition interaction (p&lt;0.05). Post-hoc Tukey test revealed a difference at P1 (p&lt;0.05), but not at P10 (p = 0.258) between EC and SC groups. Bars indicate s.e.m. (B–C) Enhanced IGF-I expression in the RGC layer of EC rats. (B) Micrographs of EC and SC retinal sections immunostained for IGF-I at different ages. Scale bar: 50 µm (C) Quantitative analysis of IGF-I immunofluorescence intensity in the RGC layer of SC and EC rats. Two-ways ANOVA showed an effect of age (p&lt;0.001) and housing condition (p&lt;0.001). t-test with Bonferroni correction revealed a statistical difference between EC and SC groups at E15 (p = 0.009) and E18 (p&lt;0.01).
