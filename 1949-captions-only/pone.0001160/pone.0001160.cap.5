For both (A) and (B), one-way ANOVA showed an effect of the treatment (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05). A difference was found between EC and SC, between EC and EC anti-IGF-I and between SC and SC IGF-I groups (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05, Post-hoc Tukey test). Neither EC anti-IGF-I and SC groups nor EC and SC IGF-I groups were instead found to differ between each other. (C) Quantitative analysis of IGF-I immunofluorescence intensity in the RGC layer of EC, anti-IGF-I EC, SC and IGF-I SC rats at E18. (D) Pyknotic cell number of EC, anti-IGF-I EC, SC and IGF-I SC rats at E18. After treatment with anti-IGF-I, levels of IGF-I expression and number of pyknotic profiles in the RGC layer of EC fetuses were lowered to those of SC rats while, after chronic IGF-I protein infusion, levels of IGF-I expression and the number of pyknotic profiles in the RGC layer of SC fetuses were enhanced up to those of EC rats. For both (C) and (D), one-way ANOVA showed an effect of the housing treatment (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001). A difference was found between EC and SC, between EC and EC anti-IGF-I and between SC and SC IGF-I groups (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05, Post-hoc Tukey test). Neither EC anti-IGF-I and SC groups nor EC and SC IGF-I groups were instead found to differ between each other. The bars indicate s.e.m.</p>
