                Figure 6.  (A) Increased IGF-I levels in the cerebellum of EC rats.Coronal sections through the cerebellum: IGF-I immunoreactivity is low in cerebellar cells of SC rats, while the cerebellar cells of EC rats show a strong IGF-I staining. Scale bar: 50 Âµm. Graph: quantitative analysis of the pixel intensity of IGF-I immunofluorescence reactivity showed higher levels in the cerebellum of EC (black) compared with SC (grey) rats at P1 (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p&lt;0.05). The bars indicate s.e.m. (B) Prenatal enrichment increases body weight. The weight of EC fetuses was 10% greater at E18 (n = 19 for EC and n = 15 for SC), and 8% greater at P1 (n = 64 for EC and n = 49 for SC). Two ways ANOVA of rat weights for different environmental conditions and ages showed a significant effect of age (p&lt;0.001) and environmental housing condition (p&lt;0.001). Mann-Whitney rank sum test with Bonferroni correction revealed a significant increase in EC animals body weight compared with SC rats at both E18 and P1 (p&lt;0.001 in both cases).
