The activation of NRP-1/EGNP-1 increased p21 expression. EGNP-1 transduced HUVEC or PAEC/NRP-1 were subjected to EGF or VEGF for the indicated times and their lysates were immunoblotted for p21 with PLC-γ as a loading control. b. The activation of EGNP-1 induced p21 phosphorylation at its Tyr<sup>145</sup> and Ser<sup>146</sup> sites. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-p21Tyr and anti-p21Ser in EGNP-1 transduced HUVEC stimulated by EGF for the indicated times. c. Akt mediates the phosphorylation of p21 in EGNP-1-mediated signaling. HUVEC were transfected with EGNP-1 then treated with Ly294002 or co-transfected with EGNP-1 and Akt(DN). Immunoblotting was performed to quantify the expression and activation of p21. p21 and phospho-p21 were quantified as a ratio to the amount of PLC-γ. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.001, **<em>p</em>&lt;0.005, ***<em>p</em>&lt;0.01, ****<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 in a Student's <em>t</em> test.</p>
