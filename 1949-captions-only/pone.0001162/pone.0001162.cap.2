                Figure 2.  Tolerisation of CD4+ T cells improves LCMV-specific antibody response.A: C57BL/6 mice were tolerised with either 100 µg GP61-80-IFA, 100 µg NP309-328-IFA, or both peptides in IFA on days -109, -106, -103. On day 0, mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE and splenocytes were analysed for intracellular IFN-γ expression after re-stimulation with different T cell epitopes in vitro 12 days later. The original dot plots are shown (n = 5). B: C57BL/6 mice were treated with 100 µg GP61-80-IFA or IFA on days -9, -6 and -3. On day 0, mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE and splenocytes were analysed for intracellular IFN-γ after re-stimulation with different T cell epitopes in vitro 12 days later (n = 3, p&lt;0.001). C+D: C57BL/6 mice were tolerized with either 100 µg GP61-80-IFA, 100 µg NP309-328-IFA or both peptides in IFA on days -9, -6, -3. On day 0, mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE and LCMV-nucleoprotein (NP) specific antibodies were measured by ELISA at the indicated time points (n = 5, * p&lt;0.05, C). LCMV-glycoprotein (GP) specific antibodies were measured by ELISA at the indicated time points (n = 5–7, *p&lt;0.001, D). E: BALB/c mice were peptide-tolerised with 100 µg GP61-80-IFA or IFA alone on day -9, -6 and -3. On day 0 mice were infected with 200pfu of LCMV-WE and LCMV-GP specific IgG antibodies were measured in the serum at the indicated time points (n = 8, ns).
