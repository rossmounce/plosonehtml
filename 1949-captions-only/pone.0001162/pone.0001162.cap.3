At day 0 mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE, and GP-specific (tet-gp33<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed in the blood by FACS analysis (n = 4, ns). B+C: 5×10<sup>4</sup> splenocytes from mice transgenic for a T cell receptor recognizing the LCMV helper epitope GP61 (LCMV-glycoprotein<sub>61-80</sub>/I-A<sup>b</sup>-specific TCR, SMARTA mice) and for the T cell marker Thy1.1 were transferred into C57BL/6 mice on day -10. One group of mice was treated with 100 µg GP61 dissolved in IFA, while control mice were treated with IFA alone at days -9, -6, -3. At day 0 mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE or left untreated. GP33 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed for frequencies (<a href="#pone.0001162.s003">Figure S3</a>) and for the expression of the activation markers CD25, CD69, CD44, CD62L, IL-7Rα, CXCR3 and PD-1 (1 of 4 histogram plots is shown, grey area represents staining of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed for expression of the intracellular effector molecules IFN-γ and Granzyme B after restimulation (1 of 4 dot plots is shown, C). D–F: <em>cd8<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice were treated with GP61/NP309-IFA or with IFA alone on days -9, -6 and -3. On day 0 mice were infected with 200pfu LCMV-WE and LCMV-GP1 specific IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA (n = 3–4, *p = 0.03, D) and by neutralisation assay (n = 7–8, *p = 0.04, E) at the indicated time points. Virus blood titers were measured with plaque assay on day 35 after LCMV infection as indicated (n = 7–8, p = 0.0059, F).</p>
