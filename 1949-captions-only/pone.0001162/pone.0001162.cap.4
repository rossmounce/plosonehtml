                Figure 4.  LCMV-GP specific peptide tolerisation does not affect antibody production against third party pathogen.C57BL/6 were tolerised with 100 µg GP61-IFA at day -9, -6 and -3. At day 0, mice were infected with 2×106 PFU of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Neutralizing antibodies against VSV-glycoprotein were measured by VSV neutralisation assay; total neutralizing Ig (A) and neutralizing IgG (B). VSV-glycoprotein binding IgG was measured by ELISA (C).
