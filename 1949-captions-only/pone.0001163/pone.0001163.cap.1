                Figure 1.  Minisatellites in MUC2.A. Structure of the genomic region around MUC2. It is predicted that 49 exons (black boxes) encode MUC2. Approximate positions of minisatellites identified by the Tandem Repeats Finder Program [22], are indicated by asterisks and numbers (MS1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). B. The sequences of nine minisatellite repeat units. Positions of indices (1â€“37,982 bp) were determined using genomic information from the UCL site [21].
