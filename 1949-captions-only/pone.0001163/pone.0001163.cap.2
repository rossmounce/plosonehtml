Polymorphic patterns of MS1 (a), MS2 (b), MS3 (c), MS4 (d), MS6 (e), and MS8 (f). Minisatellites were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of control samples using diagnostic primers. Allele frequency, size of PCR products and repeat number are indicated in <a href="#pone.0001163.s001">Table S1</a>. Haplotype patterns are numbered according to each minisatellite. Size markers (M) are given in kb (1 kb size marker) or bp (100 bp size marker). B. Meiotic inheritance of <em>MUC2</em> minisatellites in a three-generation family: MS1 (a), MS2 (b), MS3 (c), MS4 (d), MS6 (e), and MS8 (f). PCR primers specific to <em>MUC2</em> minisatellites were used to analyze minisatellite length in genomic DNA from family members. The pedigree demonstrates the relationship between family groups used in this study: first generation (lanes 1 and 2, grandfather and grandmother, respectively); second generation (lanes 3 and 7, fathers; lanes 4 and 8, mothers); and third generation (lanes 5 and 6, children from parents 3 and 4; lane 9, child from parents 7 and 8). M corresponds to the size marker.</p>
