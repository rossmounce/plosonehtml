                Figure 2.  Polymorphic patterns of MUC2 minisatellites (MS1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) and their Inheritance.A. Polymorphic patterns of MS1 (a), MS2 (b), MS3 (c), MS4 (d), MS6 (e), and MS8 (f). Minisatellites were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of control samples using diagnostic primers. Allele frequency, size of PCR products and repeat number are indicated in Table S1. Haplotype patterns are numbered according to each minisatellite. Size markers (M) are given in kb (1 kb size marker) or bp (100 bp size marker). B. Meiotic inheritance of MUC2 minisatellites in a three-generation family: MS1 (a), MS2 (b), MS3 (c), MS4 (d), MS6 (e), and MS8 (f). PCR primers specific to MUC2 minisatellites were used to analyze minisatellite length in genomic DNA from family members. The pedigree demonstrates the relationship between family groups used in this study: first generation (lanes 1 and 2, grandfather and grandmother, respectively); second generation (lanes 3 and 7, fathers; lanes 4 and 8, mothers); and third generation (lanes 5 and 6, children from parents 3 and 4; lane 9, child from parents 7 and 8). M corresponds to the size marker.
