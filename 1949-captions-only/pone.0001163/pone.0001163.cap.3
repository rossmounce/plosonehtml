                Figure 3.  MUC2 minisatellites in cancer tissues.A. Rare, cancer-specific alleles are identified in MUC2-MS6. Comparison of rare cancer-specific alleles of MUC2-MS6 between control (Figure 2A-f) and patients with gastric (a), and colon cancer (b). In patients with gastric cancer, four rare cancer-specific alleles were identified (a); and in patients with colon cancer, two rare cancer-specific alleles were identified (b). Haplotype patterns are numbered for MUC2-MS6 in gastric (a) and colon cancer (b). Rare cancer-specific alleles are indicated by arrows in (a) and (b). Size markers (M) are given in kb. B. Instability of MUC2 minisatellites in blood and cancer tissue from patients with gastric tumors. Genomic DNA was analyzed from the blood and gastric cancer tissue of patients. The sizes of minisatellites were analyzed by PCR. Results are shown for MUC2-MS2. Gastric cancer tissue samples are indicated by asterisks and M indicates the size marker. Rearrangements in cancer tissues are indicated by arrows.
