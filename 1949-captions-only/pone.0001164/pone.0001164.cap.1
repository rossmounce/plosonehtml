Samples were taken at specific time points and analyzed on a BD FACSAria. Controls contained beads with no glycine or diglycine beads without Sortase. Error bars showing the standard error in the mean fluorescence are omitted as they are generally smaller than the data symbols. Errors are given in Supplementary <a href="#pone.0001164.s002">Data S2</a>.</p>
