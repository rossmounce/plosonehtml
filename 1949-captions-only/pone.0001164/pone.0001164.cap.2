                Figure 2.  Fluorescence micrographs of labeled solid supports.(a) Diglycine GMA beads and (b) oligoglycine modified Affigel resin were separately labeled with EGFP and DsRed and then mixed. Fluorescence images were recorded as separate gray scale images (see Supplementary Figure S2) with FITC and Cy3 filter sets and then combined and false coloured.
