                Figure 3.  Tus protein ligated to GMA beads is accessible to its cognate DNA ligand (Ter).The sequence specific DNA-binding protein Tus was ligated to diglycine GMA beads. The Tus-labeled beads were incubated with varying proportions of fluorescein labeled Ter DNA and Cy5 labeled non-specific DNA and the bead fluorescence analysed by FACS. The curve is a model fit for a single binding process with a KD of 29Â±8 nM. Error bars showing the standard error in the mean fluorescence are omitted as they are generally smaller than the data symbols. Errors are given in Supplementary Data S2.
