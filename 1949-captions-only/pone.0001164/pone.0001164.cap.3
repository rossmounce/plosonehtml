The Tus-labeled beads were incubated with varying proportions of fluorescein labeled <em>Ter</em> DNA and Cy5 labeled non-specific DNA and the bead fluorescence analysed by FACS. The curve is a model fit for a single binding process with a <em>K</em><sub>D</sub> of 29Â±8 nM. Error bars showing the standard error in the mean fluorescence are omitted as they are generally smaller than the data symbols. Errors are given in Supplementary <a href="#pone.0001164.s002">Data S2</a>.</p>
