The negative control reaction contained EGFP-LPETGG-His<sub>6</sub> and no Sortase. After washing with buffer pictures were taken with a white light (a) and UV transilluminator (b, 312 nm). (câ€“f) Ligation of EGFP to a glass surface. Microscope coverslips were modified with triethoxy(aminopropyl) silane and oligoglycine before incubation with EGFP-LPETGG-His<sub>6</sub>. The slides were washed with Sortase buffer containing 1% SDS and photographed using the FITC filter set on an Axiovert 200 microscope. (c) Glycine modified surface with EGFP-LPETGG-His<sub>6</sub> but no Sortase, (d) amino modified surface (i.e. without glycine) with EGFP-LPETGG-His<sub>6</sub> and Sortase, (e) Glycine modified surface with EGFP-LPETGG-His<sub>6</sub> and Sortase with same exposure settings as negative controls, (f) same as (e) with five-fold reduced exposure time.</p>
