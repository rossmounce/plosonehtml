Chromosomes are stained with propidium iodide (red), and kinetochores with CREST serum <a href="#pone.0001165-Furuta1">[30]</a>. Shown are one euploid and one aneuploid metaphase II spread of <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes. (B) Quantification of aneuploid oocytes in metaphase I and II harboring more or less than 20 chromosomes. n indicates the number of interpretable metaphase spreads obtained. 8 <em>mad2+/−</em> mice were analysed in four independent experiments. (C) 21% of female mad2+/− mice are sterile. (D) <em>mad2−/−</em> embryos are not viable and therefore the litter size is expected to be 25% lower in the heterozygote crosses. The average litter size from <em>mad2+/−</em> crosses is reduced to 43% compared to wild type crosses, and to 57,6% compared to the expected litter size.</p>
