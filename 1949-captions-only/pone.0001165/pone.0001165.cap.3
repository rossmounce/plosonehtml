Anaphase onset can sometimes be observed in the timepoint before PBE. (B) Quantitation of GFP-Cyclin B in <em>mad2+/+</em> and <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes relative to anaphase onset and PBE. Live video analysis shows that GFP-Cyclin B (quantifications of the fluorescence signal are shown as a graph, arbitrary units set to maximal levels of 100) reaches its lowest levels before PBE. Timepoints were taken every 20 minutes, chromosomes were labelled with Hoechst. A representative oocyte is shown and the number of successfully analyzed oocytes is indicated. No differences between anaphase onset, PBE and GFP-Cyclin B degradation were detected between control and <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes. (C) Quantifications of Securin-YFP fluorescence signal intensities in <em>mad2+/+</em> and <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes relative to anaphase onset and PBE, as described in (B). No differences between anaphase onset, PBE and Securin-YFP degradation were detected. (D) Kinase assays to assess MPF activity during meiosis I in <em>mad2+/+</em> and <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes. Histone H1 (H1) was used as a substrate. Control (ctrl): GVBD+8 h (-PB) without substrate addition. (E) Endogenous Securin levels in <em>mad2+/+</em> and <em>mad2+/−</em> oocytes 3 hours after GVBD. 20 oocytes each were used.</p>
