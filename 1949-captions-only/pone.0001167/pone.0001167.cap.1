Images of a representative mouse from each group taken on post-injury days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 are shown. b. Wound sizes at the indicated time points in NAS and wild-type control mice (WT). c. Wound sizes at the indicated time points in control, GSI-treated and Jagged peptide-treated mice. Values are the mean and SEM (n = 6 mice per group). *p&lt;0.001, #p&lt;0.01 compared to the control value. Scale bar = 4 mm.</p>
