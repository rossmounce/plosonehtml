                Figure 2.  Histological features of wound healing in mice with decreased or increased Notch activity.Images of skin tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showing histological changes during the wound healing process in non-transgenic control mice, NAS mice, GSI (100 µM DAPT) treated mice and 15 µM Jagged peptide-treated mice at post-injury days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13. NAS and DAPT-treated mice exhibited delayed wound healing, and Jagged peptide-treated exhibited enhanced wound healing, compared to control mice. See Supplementary histological evaluation (Text S2) for a detailed description of histological changes in the different groups of mice. Scale bar = 0.5 mm
