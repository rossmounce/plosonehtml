NAS and DAPT-treated mice exhibited delayed wound healing, and Jagged peptide-treated exhibited enhanced wound healing, compared to control mice. See Supplementary histological evaluation (<a href="#pone.0001167.s002">Text S2</a>) for a detailed description of histological changes in the different groups of mice. Scale bar = 0.5 mm</p>
