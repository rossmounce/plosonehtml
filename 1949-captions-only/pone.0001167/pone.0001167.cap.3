                Figure 3.  Notch activity in skin cells is decreased in NAS mice and in response to γ-secretase inhibition (10 µM), and is increased in response to Jagged peptide treatment (15 µM).a and b. Representative immunoblot (a), and results of densitometric analysis of blots (b), showing relative levels of NICD (80 kDa) and actin (42 kDa) in lysates (40 µg/lane) of cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), mouse keratinocytes (KC) and in mouse fibroblasts (MF) that had been treated for 6 h with vehicle or Jagged peptide. c and d. Representative immunoblot (c), and results of densitometric analysis of blots (d), showing relative levels of NICD in skin tissue samples from NAS and control mice taken at the indicated post-wounding time points. *p&lt;0.01 compared to the control value. e and f. Representative immunoblot (e), and results of densitometric analysis of blots (f), showing relative levels of NICD in skin tissue samples from control and γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-treated mice taken at the indicated post-wounding time points. g and h. Representative immunoblot (g), and results of densitometric analysis of blots (h), showing relative levels of NICD in skin tissue samples from control and Jagged peptide-treated mice taken at the indicated post-wounding time points. *p&lt;0.01 compared to the control value (ANOVA p = and Newman-Keuls post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons).
