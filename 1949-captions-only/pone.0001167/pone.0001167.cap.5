Monolayers of cultured keratinocytes (a–d) or fibroblasts (e–h) were treated with vehicle (Control), GSI (10 µM DAPT), 15 µM SCP or 15 µM Jagged peptide, and were then subjected to scratch wounding. Eighteen hours after wounding, images of the wound area were acquired and the number of cells per field that had migrated into the cell-free wound zone were determined for each culture. Representative images (a, c, e, g) and quantitative data (b, d, f, h) are shown. Values are the mean and SEM (n = 3 separate experiments). *p&lt;0.001. i and j. Cultured keratinocytes (i) and fibroblasts (j) were treated with vehicle (Control), GSI (10 µM DAPT), 15 µM SCP or 15 µM Jagged peptide for the indicated time periods and relative cell numbers were estimated. Values are the mean and SEM (n = 4–6 experiments).</p>
