                Figure 1.  Differential rostro-caudal pattern of Delta-1 expression in the prospective chick spinal cord and its spatial correlation to neurogenesis.A. ISH of Delta-1 in a HH11 chick embryo showing expression in the caudal neural plate (CNP), the last formed caudal somites (NS), the prospective spinal cord (SC), and the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). B. Higher magnification of the framed area in A showing Delta-1 expression in scattered cells along the prospective spinal cord. C. Immunofluorescent TUJ1 labelling of a HH11 chick embryo in a region equivalent to panel B. Note that very few labelled cells are detected in the region of the prospective spinal cord around the last formed caudal somites (PNTZ, proliferation to neurogenesis transition zone). In contrast there is a large number of Delta-1-expressing cell in the equivalent region of panel B. D,E. Transverse sections at approximately the positions indicated in panel A. Note the different apico-basal positions of labelled cells between the rostral and caudal sections.
