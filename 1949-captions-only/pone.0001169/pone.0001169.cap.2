                Figure 2.  Delta-1 is expressed in cycling neural progenitor cells.Double immunolabelling of Delta-1 mRNA and cell cycle markers in transverse sections of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the last five caudal somites in HH10 chick embryos. Confocal optical sections of 6 µm are shown and double labelled cells are indicated by arrows. A. Several cells co-expressing Delta-1 mRNA and PH3 are located near the ventricle lumen B–B″. Higher magnification of the boxed cell in A. C. A large proportion of Delta-1 expressing cells incorporate BrdU after a single pulse. Also note that practically no BrdU labelled cells are located within 1/3rd of the apical-basal distance from the ventricle (dotted line). An example of a Delta-1/BrdU-double labelled cell is shown at higher magnification in D–D″. E. Cells co-expressing Cyclin B and Delta-1 can be found within 1/3 of the apical-basal distance from the ventricle (dotted line). F–F″. Higher magnification of the boxed cell in E. G,G′. Confocal projection (dorsal view) over 20 µm taken from the prospective spinal cord of an HH10 embryo at the level of somites 7–8th showing expression of Delta-1 and TUJ1. Note that very few double labelled cells (arrows) can be seen.
