Confocal projection over 50 µm from a dorsal aspect of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> somites counted from rostral of a HH13 chick embryo that was electroporated with NICD at stage HH10 when that region was part of the PNTZ. Transfected cells express the c-myc reporter. Note the clear decrease in the number of <em>Delta-1</em> expressing cells within the electroporated area compared to the contralateral side and to the control transfected embryo (B–B′). C–C′. Transversal optical section of a double FISH of <em>Delta1</em> and <em>Hes5.1</em> taken at the level of the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> somite. Notice that <em>Delta-1</em> and <em>Hes5.1</em>-expressing cells are mutually exclusive and that a few cells lack expression of both genes. D–D′. Confocal projection over 50 µm taken from a dorsal view point of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12th–14<sup>th</sup> somites counted from rostral of an embryo that was electroporated with pCIG-<em>Delta1</em> at HH10 stage and allowed to develop until HH12/13 stage. Transfected cells express the reporter GFP protein. Notice the clear decrease in <em>Hes5.1</em> expression in <em>Delta-1</em> transfected cells while <em>Hes5.1</em> expression is maintained in most non transfected cells. In contrast, control pCIG transfected cells do not altere <em>Hes5.1</em> expression (E–E′). F–F′. Confocal projection over 50 µm taken from a dorsal view point of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12th–14<sup>th</sup> somites counted from rostral of an embryo which was electroporated with the antisense morpholino oligo Mo2-cDelta1 at HH10 stage and allowed to develop until HH12/13. Notice the decrease in the expression level of Hes5.1 in the transfected side. as compared to the non-transfected contralateral side. In contrast, the pattern of <em>Hes5.1</em> expression is not altered in an embryo transfected with the control morpholino(G–G′).</p>
