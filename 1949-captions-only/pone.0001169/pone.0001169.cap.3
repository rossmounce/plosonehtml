                Figure 3.  DELTA-1/NOTCH signaling in the caudal spinal cord of chick embryos.A–A′. Confocal projection over 50 µm from a dorsal aspect of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12th and 13th somites counted from rostral of a HH13 chick embryo that was electroporated with NICD at stage HH10 when that region was part of the PNTZ. Transfected cells express the c-myc reporter. Note the clear decrease in the number of Delta-1 expressing cells within the electroporated area compared to the contralateral side and to the control transfected embryo (B–B′). C–C′. Transversal optical section of a double FISH of Delta1 and Hes5.1 taken at the level of the 12th and 13th somite. Notice that Delta-1 and Hes5.1-expressing cells are mutually exclusive and that a few cells lack expression of both genes. D–D′. Confocal projection over 50 µm taken from a dorsal view point of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12th–14th somites counted from rostral of an embryo that was electroporated with pCIG-Delta1 at HH10 stage and allowed to develop until HH12/13 stage. Transfected cells express the reporter GFP protein. Notice the clear decrease in Hes5.1 expression in Delta-1 transfected cells while Hes5.1 expression is maintained in most non transfected cells. In contrast, control pCIG transfected cells do not altere Hes5.1 expression (E–E′). F–F′. Confocal projection over 50 µm taken from a dorsal view point of the prospective spinal cord at the level of the 12th–14th somites counted from rostral of an embryo which was electroporated with the antisense morpholino oligo Mo2-cDelta1 at HH10 stage and allowed to develop until HH12/13. Notice the decrease in the expression level of Hes5.1 in the transfected side. as compared to the non-transfected contralateral side. In contrast, the pattern of Hes5.1 expression is not altered in an embryo transfected with the control morpholino(G–G′).
