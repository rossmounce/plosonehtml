Confocal projection over 50 µm at the level of the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> somites of an HH13 embryo that was electroporated with NICD at stage HH10. Note the clear decrease in the number of TUJ1-labelled cells within the electroporated area when compared to the contralateral side. A1–2. A high magnification of a single confocal section of the cell framed in A shows that in fact is not double labelled. B. Single 5 µm transversal confocal section of an embryo that was pulsed with BrdU 16 h after electroporation with NICD. Notice the large proportion of transfected cells that incorporated BrdU. B′,B″. High magnification of the framed area in B showing several double labelled cells. C. Partial confocal transverse projection (10 µm) of an embryo pulsed with BrdU 11 h after being electroporated with pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em>. C′. High magnification of the framed area in B showing the lack of GFP/BrdU positive cells. D. Confocal projection (50 µm) from a dorsal aspect of an embryo electroporated with pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em> at the HH10 stage and allowed to develop to the HH12/13 stage. Note the low incidence of GFP/TUJ1 positive cells (arrows). D′. Higher magnification of a single confocal optical section within the framed area in D showing two TUJ1+cells that lack GFP in their nuclei (asterisks) and two GFP labelled nuclei lacking TUJ1 in their soma. E. Partial confocal transverse projection (20 µm) of an embryo electroporated at the PNTZ with pCIG-<em>DeltaDN</em> allowed to develop further 18 h. E′ and E″ higher magnification of the boxed region showing that transfected cells lack p27KIP1 immunostaining. F. Confocal transverse projection (50 µm) of an embryo electroporated at the NZ with pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em> and allowed to develop further 18 h. F′–F″. Higher magnification of a single optical section (5 µm) of the boxed region of F showing two double labelled cells. G and H. Statistical analysis of embryos transfected with NICD, <em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em>, and control vectors.</p>
