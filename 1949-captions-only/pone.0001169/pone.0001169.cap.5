                Figure 5.  Spatio-temporal analysis of neuronal generation induced by Delta-1 expression.A–I Confocal projections (40–50 µm) from a dorsal point of view of the prospective spinal cord of embryos transfected with pCIG-Delta-1, pCIG-Delta-1/pCIG-DeltaDN, pCIG (controls), Delta-1 anti-sense (MO1-cDelta1 and MO2-cDelta1) and control morpholinos at the stages and times indicated. Arrows point to double labelled cells. J and K. Confocal transverse projections (50 µm) of two embryos electroporated at the NZ with pCIG-Delta-1 and pCIG, respectively, and allowed to develop for 18 h. J′ and J″, higher magnification of a single optical section (5 µm) of the boxed area in J showing two GFP/TUJ1 labelled cells. L. Statistical analysis of the GFP/TUJ1 double labelled cells at the indicated stages and times after transfection with pCIG-Delta-1, pCIG-Delta-1/pCIG-DeltaDN and pCIG (controls). Notice that a consistent increment in the proportion of double labelled cells are only obtained at 26 h postransfection with pCIG-Delta-1 in PNTZ independently of the transfected embryonic stage
