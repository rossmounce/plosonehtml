Arrows point to double labelled cells. J and K. Confocal transverse projections (50 µm) of two embryos electroporated at the NZ with pCIG-<em>Delta-1</em> and pCIG, respectively, and allowed to develop for 18 h. J′ and J″, higher magnification of a single optical section (5 µm) of the boxed area in J showing two GFP/TUJ1 labelled cells. L. Statistical analysis of the GFP/TUJ1 double labelled cells at the indicated stages and times after transfection with pCIG-<em>Delta-1,</em> pCIG<em>-Delta-1</em>/pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em> and pCIG (controls). Notice that a consistent increment in the proportion of double labelled cells are only obtained at 26 h postransfection with pCIG-<em>Delta-1</em> in PNTZ independently of the transfected embryonic stage</p>
