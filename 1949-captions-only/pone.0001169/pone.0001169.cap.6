                Figure 6.  Effects of Delta1 in proliferation of spinal cord NP progenitor cells.A–D. HH10 embryos were transfected with either pCIG-Delta-1, pCIG-Delta-1/pCIG-DeltaDN or empty pCIG vector (controls) and allowed to develop for the indicated time. One hour before dissection, embryos were pulsed for 1 h with BrdU. Images show 5 µm optical sections from transversal vibratome sections taken at the level of somites 12th–16th counted from rostral. E. Statistical analysis of GFP/BrdU double labelled cells in the transfected embryos, as indicated. F,G. Double immunolabeling with PH3/GFP and Cyclin B/GFP in embryos transfected with pCIG-Delta-1 at 18 h postransfection. F′,G′. High magnification of the framed areas in F and G showing double labelled cells. Notice the Cyclin B is mainly in the cytoplasm (G′) of this cell and also according to its apico-basal position is in G2 phase (G).
