HH10 embryos were transfected with either pCIG-Delta-1,</em> pCIG<em>-Delta</em>-1/pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em> or empty pCIG vector (controls) and allowed to develop for the indicated time. One hour before dissection, embryos were pulsed for 1 h with BrdU. Images show 5 µm optical sections from transversal vibratome sections taken at the level of somites 12th–16th counted from rostral. E. Statistical analysis of GFP/BrdU double labelled cells in the transfected embryos, as indicated. F,G. Double immunolabeling with PH3/GFP and Cyclin B/GFP in embryos transfected with pCIG-<em>Delta-1</em> at 18 h postransfection. F′,G′. High magnification of the framed areas in F and G showing double labelled cells. Notice the Cyclin B is mainly in the cytoplasm (G′) of this cell and also according to its apico-basal position is in G2 phase (G).</p>
