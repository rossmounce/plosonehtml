                Figure 7.  Relation of DELTA-1/NOTCH signalling and Tis21 expression in the prospective spinal cord.A–A″. Confocal projection (25 µm) of double ISH for Delta-1 and Tis21 in the transition zone of a HH10 embryo showing several double labelled cells (white arrows) and cells expressing either Tis21 (magenta arrows) or Delta-1 (green arrows). B,C. Confocal projection (50 µm) over the PNTZ of embryos electroporated with NICD and control vector at HH10 and allowed to develop until HH12/13. D–F. Confocal projection (25 µm) around the 6 most caudal somites of embryos electroporated with pCIG-Delta-1, pCIG (controls) and pCIG-DeltaDN at HH10 and allowed to develop until HH12/13. G,H. Confocal projection (50 µm) around the PNTZ of embryos electroporated with MO2-cDelta1 anti-sense and control morpholinos. Notice the decrease in the number of cells expressing Tis21 and their expression level in the side transfected with MO2-cDelta1 as compared to the contralateral one.
