Confocal projection (25 µm) of double ISH for <em>Delta-1</em> and <em>Tis21</em> in the transition zone of a HH10 embryo showing several double labelled cells (white arrows) and cells expressing either <em>Tis21</em> (magenta arrows) or <em>Delta-1</em> (green arrows). B,C. Confocal projection (50 µm) over the PNTZ of embryos electroporated with NICD and control vector at HH10 and allowed to develop until HH12/13. D–F. Confocal projection (25 µm) around the 6 most caudal somites of embryos electroporated with pCIG-<em>Delta-1</em>, pCIG (controls) and pCIG-<em>Delta<sup>DN</sup></em> at HH10 and allowed to develop until HH12/13. G,H. Confocal projection (50 µm) around the PNTZ of embryos electroporated with MO2-c<em>Delta1</em> anti-sense and control morpholinos. Notice the decrease in the number of cells expressing <em>Tis21</em> and their expression level in the side transfected with MO2-c<em>Delta1</em> as compared to the contralateral one.</p>
