Then, GFP-expressing cells were counted every 4 hours in the spinal cord region around the 12thâ€“13th somites counted from the rostral side. Results are presented as the increment of the percentage of labeled cells related to the number at 12 h posttransfection. Error bars correspond to standard deviation. Notice that data points of <em>Delta1</em>-expressing and control cells mostly fall within the respective error bars. Therefore, there is no statistically significant difference between the two curves.</p>
