                Figure 8.  Analysis of the effect of Delta-1 expression on cell cycle duration of spinal cord progenitor cells.HH10 chick embryos (n = 7) were transfected by electroporation with either pCIG-Delta-1 or empty pCIG vectors and incubated for 12 hours. Then, GFP-expressing cells were counted every 4 hours in the spinal cord region around the 12thâ€“13th somites counted from the rostral side. Results are presented as the increment of the percentage of labeled cells related to the number at 12 h posttransfection. Error bars correspond to standard deviation. Notice that data points of Delta1-expressing and control cells mostly fall within the respective error bars. Therefore, there is no statistically significant difference between the two curves.
