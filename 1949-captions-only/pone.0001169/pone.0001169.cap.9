As a consequence of the caudal to rostral decreasing FGF gradient, <em>Delta-1</em> expression decreases in those cells that leave the stem zone (light blue) and move into the PNTZ where they intermingle with cells that do not express <em>Delta-1</em> <a href="#pone.0001169-Akai1">[21]</a>. This can generate differences in DELTA/NOTCH signalling between adjacent cells that may initiate lateral inhibition. This results in the upregulation of <em>Delta-1</em> in single NP cells which signal (blue arrows) and activate NOTCH signalling in adjacent cells, which as a consequence express <em>Hes5</em> and are maintained in a proliferating state. Subsequently, the <em>Delta-1</em> expressing NP cell divides into two cells that express <em>Tis21</em>. These double <em>Delta-1</em>/<em>Tis21</em> labelled NP down regulate the expression of <em>Delta-1</em> as they reach the NZ and begin to divide in a neurogenic manner. One of the daughter cells upregulates <em>Delta-1</em> expression and differentiates as a neuron while the other one, which receives NOTCH signalling (blue arrows), remains as neurogenic NP.
