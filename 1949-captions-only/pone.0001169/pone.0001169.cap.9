                Figure 9.  A working model for the involvement of DELTA-NOTCH signalling in the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis in the developing chick spinal cord.Schematic model of the embryonic rostro-caudal gradient of neurogenesis along the prospective spinal cord from the stem zone to the neurogenic neural tube summarising the cellular processes that seem to occur during the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis and how DELTA-NOTCH signalling may be involved in these processes. As a consequence of the caudal to rostral decreasing FGF gradient, Delta-1 expression decreases in those cells that leave the stem zone (light blue) and move into the PNTZ where they intermingle with cells that do not express Delta-1 [21]. This can generate differences in DELTA/NOTCH signalling between adjacent cells that may initiate lateral inhibition. This results in the upregulation of Delta-1 in single NP cells which signal (blue arrows) and activate NOTCH signalling in adjacent cells, which as a consequence express Hes5 and are maintained in a proliferating state. Subsequently, the Delta-1 expressing NP cell divides into two cells that express Tis21. These double Delta-1/Tis21 labelled NP down regulate the expression of Delta-1 as they reach the NZ and begin to divide in a neurogenic manner. One of the daughter cells upregulates Delta-1 expression and differentiates as a neuron while the other one, which receives NOTCH signalling (blue arrows), remains as neurogenic NP.
