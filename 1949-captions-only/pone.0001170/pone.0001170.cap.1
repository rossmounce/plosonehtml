                Figure 1.  Up-regulation of Dctn5, Vdac1, Ubb, Actb, Eef2 and Eef1a1 in 59QTBP-GFP transfected Neuro-2a cells compared to vector transfected controls observed by cDNA-microarray analysis.X-axis depicts transcript name. Z-ratio of each transcript was plotted on Y axis. Error bar represents meanÂ±SEM of at least two independent microarray experiments.
