Mouse 18s rRNA was used as an endogenous reference. N3 was used as a calibrator for determining relative expression. (B) Expression levels of reporter (Gfp) in transfected Neuro-2a cells determined by Real time PCR: similar levels of expression of TBPGFP in 16Q and 59Q transfected cells. N3: tranfected construct contains GFP; 16Q, 59Q: transfected construct contains GFP tagged hTBP with CAG repeat length 16 and 59 respectively. Data shown are the meanÂ±SEM of two to four independent experiments. (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t-test)</p>
