                Figure 3.  Differential expression of Vdac1 gene, Dctn5 and Ubb in Neuro-2a cells transfected with N3, 16QTBPGFP and 59Q TBPGFP.(A &amp; C) Northern blot using Vdac1 (A), Dctn5 and Ubb as a probe (C), Gfp probe was used to show expression levels of Gfp and TbpGfp in transfected cells (A, C), 18s rRNA was used as a loading control (lower panels in A &amp; C); (B, D &amp; E) The intensity of Vdac1 (B), Dctn5 (D) and Ubb (E) band were quantified and each band intensity was normalised to the band of 18s rRNA. N3 band intensity was used for determining relative expression. N3: tranfected construct contains GFP; 16Q, 59Q: transfected construct contains GFP tagged hTBP with CAG repeat length 16 and 59 respectively.
