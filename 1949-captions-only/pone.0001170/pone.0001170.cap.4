(A &amp; B) schematic representation of regulatory sites in Vdac1 promoter [predicted (16)] (A) and Actb promoter (B); SRE1: Sterol repressor element 1, Sp1: specificity protein 1. Cells transfected with 16QTBPGFP and 59Q TBPGFP were treated with 1% formaldehyde and chromatin prepared as described earlier <a href="#pone.0001170-Sampson1">[15]</a>. Anti TBP antibody (N-12, Santa cruz) was used for immuno-precipitation. PCR was performed from immunoprecipitates, total input chromatin (Input). Samples treated without antibody (No Ab) did not show any product after PCR. PCR product for SRE1 (upper), Sp1 (lower) (C) and Actb promoter (D) were resolved on agarose gel. (E &amp; F) intensity of band for SRE1 (E) and Actb promoter (F) were quantified and normalized to input band. Data represented relative to the N3 transfected control. Data shown are meanÂ±SEM of three independent experiments performed. (*, p&lt;0.01, Student's t-test).</p>
