PCR products were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gel, stained with vista green. (A) Unspliced and spliced Xbp1 PCR products detected in vector (N3), 16QTBPGFP and 59QTBPGFP transfected Neuro-2a cells (B) Vista green stained bands were quantified and ratio (spliced/unspliced) was calculated. Higher ratio in DTT treated positive control indicates ER stress. 59QTBPGFP and 16QTBPGFP transfected cells were showing similar ratio as observed in vector (N3) transfected control. Data represent meanÂ±SEM of two independent experiments.</p>
