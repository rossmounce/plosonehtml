                Figure 6.  Expression of VDAC1 protein in Neuro-2a cells transfected with vector (N3), 16QTBPGFP and 59QTBPGFP.(A) Western blotting with VDAC1 specific antibody (N-18, Santa cruz) [upper panel], TBP specific antibody (N-12, Santa cruz) [middle panel]. Equal sample loading was verified by staining the blot with Ponceau S. DNA was isolated from transfected cells (see materials &amp; methods) and equivalent amount of plasmid transfection was checked by PCR amplification using GFP specific primers (Table 1) (B) Immunoreactive band intensity was quantified and plotted. Data presented relative to the vector (N3) transfected control. Data shown are meanÂ±SEM of three independent experiments performed. (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t-test)
