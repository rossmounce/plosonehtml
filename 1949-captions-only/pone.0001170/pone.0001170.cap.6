Equal sample loading was verified by staining the blot with Ponceau S. DNA was isolated from transfected cells (see <a href="#s4">materials &amp; methods</a>) and equivalent amount of plasmid transfection was checked by PCR amplification using GFP specific primers (<a href="#pone-0001170-t001">Table 1</a>) (B) Immunoreactive band intensity was quantified and plotted. Data presented relative to the vector (N3) transfected control. Data shown are meanÂ±SEM of three independent experiments performed. (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t-test)</p>
