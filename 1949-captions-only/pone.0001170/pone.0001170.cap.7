                Figure 7.  Quantitative analysis of cytochrome c release into the cytosol of transfected Neuro-2a cells.(A) Scheme for isolation of cytosol from cultured cells; (B) Time dependent release of cytochrome c in the cytosol was measured by using a solid phase ELISA assay. Data represents mean±SEM (n = 2). (C) Apoptosis in 16Q TBPGFP and 59Q TBPGFP transfected cells were analyzed by counting annexinV-PE positive cells in a flow cytometer. Data represents mean±SEM of four independent experiments performed. (*, p&lt;0.01, Student's t-test).
