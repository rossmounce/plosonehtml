(Scale bar,100 um). (E) Expression of mVdac1Gfp in Neuro-2a cells was confirmed by Reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from cDNA using a Vdac1 specific forward primer and GFP specific reverse primer (Upper panel). Expression of GFP was checked in N3 and mVdac1GFP transfected cells by RT-PCR using GFP specific forward and reverse primers. RT+: with reverse transcriptase, RT-: without reverse transcriptase. (F) Release of cytochrome c into cytosol in mVdac1 transfected cells was determined by using a solid phase ELISA method 65H after transfection. Data is presented relative to vector transfected control (N3). Data represents mean±SEM of two independent experiments each in replicate. (*, p&lt;0.01, Student's t-test) (G) Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis in mVdac1GFP and N3 transfected cells (65H after transfection) was determined by counting annexinV-PE positive cells. Data represents mean±SEM of two independent experiments, each in replicate. (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's t-test).</p>
