                Figure 1.  Altered WNV pathogenesis mediated by prior host exposure to uninfected mosquito feeding.(A) Survival of BALB/c mice infected with WNV by the bite of a single Ae. aegypti mosquito. Mosquitoes were infected 7 days prior to feeding via intrathoracic inoculation and the infection of each mosquito was confirmed immediately after feeding via real-time RT-PCR. Prior to infection, mice were exposed to 15–20 mosquitoes once weekly for a total of 0, 2, or 4 times. Data are the pooled results of 3 separate replicates of this experiment (n≥5 mice/group/replicate). Difference in survival is significant (Fisher's exact test; p&lt;0.05). (B) Levels of IL-10 (left) and WNV (right) RNA in mosquito feed site (ear) and draining LN at 36 h post-infection as detected by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression. * indicates a p-value of less than 0.05.
