Protein standards and SGE proteins visualized by silver stain are shown in lane 1 and 5, respectively. (B) Survival following WNV infection in naïve, pre-exposed (4 times), and passively immunized BALB/c mice (via intraperitoneal inoculation of 200 µL of mosquito-sensitized serum 12 h prior to infection). Mortality was significantly different between naïve and passively immunized mice (p&lt;0.05).</p>
