                Figure 3.  Cell influx into early sites of WNV replication.Dermal site of Ae. aegypti feeding 36 h post-exposure in mosquito-sensitized (A) and mosquito-naïve (B) mice. Sections are representative of observations (3 mice per group). (C) Number of cells per retromaxillar LN 36 h post infection initiated via the feeding of a single infected mosquito on the pinna of the ear (n = 6); ** represents a significant difference compared to mice previously naïve to Ae. aegypti by paired t-tests among each replicate (p&lt;0.01).
