                Figure 4.  Identification of differential cell influx into mosquito feed site and draining LN.(A) Proportion of the skin cell population composed of CD11c+, CD11b+, and MHC class II+ cells 36 h post infection as assessed by flow cytometry. Mice were pre-exposed or not to Ae. aegypti feeding prior to infection and a control uninfected group was examined as well to assess baseline cell proportions. (B) Histograms illustrating the quantity of LN cells with the indicated intensity of CD8, CD4, or CD3 staining at 36 h post infection; the x-axis corresponds to the cell surface expression level the indicated membrane protein. Percent of CD8+, CD4+, or CD3+ cells in the LN draining the site of virus inoculation is specified. Asterisks signify a statistically significant difference compared to mice previously na√Øve to Ae. aegypti via paired t-tests among each replicate: ** p&lt;0.01. Groups of mice (n = 3) were exposed 0, 2, or 4 times to mosquito feeding prior to the feeding of a WNV-infected mosquito. Results consist of a pool of cells from three individual mice and are representative of a total of three replicates.
