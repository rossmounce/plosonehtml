                Figure 5.  Identification of cell population in draining LN.(A) Histograms representing the quantity of LN cells with a given intensity of CD11b or MHC class II staining at 36 h post infection; the x-axis corresponds to the level of cell surface expression of the indicated membrane protein. The percentage of the LN cell population positive for CD11b or MHC class II is denoted. Asterisks denote a statistically significant difference compared to mice previously na√Øve to Ae. aegypti: * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01. (B) CD3 expression in the DX5+ subpopulation of the draining LN of mice 36 h after infection. Groups of mice (n = 3) were exposed 0, 2, or 4 times to mosquito feeding prior to the feeding of a WNV-infected mosquito. Results consist of a pool of cells from three individual mice and are representative of two (B) or three (A) independent replicates.
