The percentage of the LN cell population positive for CD11b or MHC class II is denoted. Asterisks denote a statistically significant difference compared to mice previously na√Øve to <em>Ae. aegypti</em>: * <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01. (B) CD3 expression in the DX5<sup>+</sup> subpopulation of the draining LN of mice 36 h after infection. Groups of mice (n = 3) were exposed 0, 2, or 4 times to mosquito feeding prior to the feeding of a WNV-infected mosquito. Results consist of a pool of cells from three individual mice and are representative of two (B) or three (A) independent replicates.</p>
