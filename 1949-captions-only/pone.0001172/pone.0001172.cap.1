Parameters for SNP mining were set to include only SNPs for which both alleles were observed at least twice and SNPs not being part of homopolymers larger than 3 bases. The threshold for minimal distance to a neighboring SNP was initially set at one base, i.e. all SNPs were selected irrespective of their distance to (a) neighboring SNP(s). In addition, and importantly, SNPs were mined according to sample origin, i.e. only SNPs “segregating homozygously” between the two maize lines were included. By doing so, a strong filter was created to select against “false” SNPs resulting from alignment of highly homologous duplicated sequences as opposed to genuine SNPs derived from single-copy sequences in the sequenced genome fraction (<a href="#pone-0001172-g002">Fig. 2</a>). As a result, 1262 putative SNPs, including 37 putative indels were mined (<a href="#pone-0001172-t001">Table 1</a>).</p>
