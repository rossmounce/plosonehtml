                Figure 2.  Example of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with SNP and sample related properties.SNP properties include sequence depth (sd), the count on the number of reads at the polymorphic position, the relative position of the SNP on the consensus sequence, the distance to the neighboring SNP, flanking sequence size and homopolymeric region information. Sample related properties were derived from the Oracle database. The ratio sample sequence depth to MSA sequence depth is calculated.
