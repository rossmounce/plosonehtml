(A) Schematic representation of observed homoduplex and heteroduplex fragment types containing expected tags and “mixed fragments”. (B) “Mixed fragments” are formed when (1) a heteroduplex is formed between complementary strands of samples 1 and 2, (2) 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase removes the sequence tags at the 3′ ends, (3) polymerase activity of T4 DNA polymerase extends the 3′ ends using the opposite strand as template, resulting in incorporation of the “wrong” sequence tag, i.e. the observation of “mixed fragments”.</p>
