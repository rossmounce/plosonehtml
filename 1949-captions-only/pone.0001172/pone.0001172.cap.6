(B) T/A ligation as applied in the CRoPS protocol. Amplification using a polymerase lacking 3′-5′ exonuclease (proofreading) activity is performed resulting in A-addition to the AFLP fragments, after which the T-adapters can be ligated. (C) Flowcharts of the original GS 20 library preparation protocol and the CRoPS library preparation protocol.</p>
