<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7"></a><p>All the cultures isolated in MODS were confirmed to be <em>M. tuberculosis</em> by spoligotyping (data not shown). Isolation of atypical mycbacteria from CSF is extremely rare and optimal treatment has never been determined in clinical trials. Classical cording of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in MODS is thought to be specific for identification in the hands of an experienced microscopist, however a rapid confirmatory test such as a nitrate strip test may be appropriate. This issue requires evaluation in a larger study.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p8" name="article1.body1.sec3.p8"></a><p>In summary, MODS is an extremely promising technique for the rapid diagnosis of TBM, isolating <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from CSF within 10 days in the majority of cases at low cost (0.53 USD per sample). It is cheap, simple, sensitive, specific and applicable in low-technology laboratories. Its main advantage is the cheap, rapid microbiological isolation of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from CSF and the potential to perform DST within a clinically useful timeframe.</p>

<h4>Patient recruitment and sample collection</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>CSF samples were collected from consecutive patients (aged over 14 years) with clinically suspected TBM (defined as a combination of nuchal rigidity and CSF abnormalities) presenting to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam between June 1st and November 1st 2006. TBM was defined as “definite” if acid-fast bacilli were seen in the CSF. It was defined as “probable” in patients with one or more of the following: suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis on chest radiography; acid-fast bacilli found in any specimen other than the cerebrospinal fluid; clinical evidence of other extra-pulmonary tuberculosis; radiological features of TBM on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. TBM was defined as “possible” in patients with at least four of the following: a history of tuberculosis, predominance of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, illness duration of more than five days, a ratio of cerebrospinal fluid glucose to plasma glucose of less than 0.5, altered consciousness, yellow cerebrospinal fluid, or focal neurological signs. All patients who fulfilled the above diagnostic criteria were treated for TBM with standard antituberculous chemotherapy and adjunctive dexamethasone. All patients were tested for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as part of routine care. Those who were found to be HIV-infected were screened for inclusion in an ongoing randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of immediate versus deferred antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis. In addition to routine biochemical tests, all CSF samples were also examined by Gram-stain and India ink stain, and cultured on blood, chocolate and sabouraud dextrose agar, to exclude bacterial and cryptococcal meningitis respectively. All samples included in this study were taken as part of routine clinical care and the study did not involve any change to routine patient care and therefore consent and ethical review was not deemed necessary.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2"></a><p>The volume of each CSF sample was recorded, the sample centrifuged at 3,000g for 15 mins, the supernatant removed and the deposit aliquoted into 4 parts. ZN smear, LJ and MGIT culture were performed on each specimen according to methods previously described <a href="#pone.0001173-Thwaites3">[3]</a>.</p>


<h4>MODS</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1"></a><p>MODS testing was performed by a technician who was unaware of the clinical diagnosis, smear and other culture results. The method was performed as described in Moore <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001173-Moore2">[10]</a> with 2 minor modifications; 48 well plates were used in place of 24 and a plate sealer (Biorad optical tape, Biorad, Hercules CA, USA) was used to avoid evaporation and cross-contamination in the plate.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p2"></a><p>MODS media was prepared with 5.9 g Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Sparks, MD), 3.1 mls glycerol and 1.25 g bacto casitone (Difco, Sparks, MD) in 880 mls sterile distilled water. The media was autoclaved and stored in 22 ml aliquots at 4°C. Each new batch was tested for sterility by incubating one aliquot at 37°C for 1 week. One MODS plate was set up each day with the addition of 2.5 mls OADC (Becton Dickinson) and 500 µl PANTA antibiotic (Becton Dickinson). Nine hundred µl media was aliquoted to each well and 100 µl CSF deposit added. One positive control (H37Rv) and one negative control well (sterile distilled water) were inoculated each day. Plates were examined daily (on weekdays) for evidence of growth (<a href="#pone-0001173-g004">figure 4</a>).</p>
