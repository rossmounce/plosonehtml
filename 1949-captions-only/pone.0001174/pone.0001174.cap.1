                Figure 1.  Topographical subdivisions of the human caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (Put) and general pattern of distribution and volume measurements of striatal cholinergic interneurons.A, Drawing of a sagittal view of the striatum illustrating the various territories of the CN and Put examined in this study. Continuous lines indicate the boundaries between adjacent territories. a–d, Neurolucida drawings illustrating the distribution of the cholinergic neurons in four coronal sections of the striatum depicted in an anteroposterior order. The anteroposterior levels of these sections are indicated by dashed lines in A, and the various sectors in which each striatal territory was subdivided in the present study are depicted by dashed lines in a–d. B–E, photomicrographs showing various cholinergic interneurons with an ovoid (B), globular (C), fusiform (D) and triangular (E) perikaryon. F, bar graph illustrating the mean volume of the cell bodies of the cholinergic cells in the different striatal territories. Significant (*, 0.05&gt;P&gt;0.01) and highly significant (**, P&lt;0.01) differences are indicated. CN, caudate nucleus; n, number of cells analyzed in each striatal region; Put, putamen. Scale bar in B, 40 µm.
