                Figure 2.  Variation in the density of the cholinergic interneurons throughout the striatum.A ¸ line graph showing the mean density of the cholinergic neurons (cells/mm3) in the various striatal territories of the CN and Put. B–E, bar graphs illustrating the mean density of cholinergic cells in the various sectors (i.e. dm, vm, dl, vl) of the following striatal territories: CN precommissural head (B), CN postcommissural head (C), precommissural Put (D) and postcommissural Put (E). Significant (*, 0.05&gt;P&gt;0.01) and highly significant (**, P&lt;0.01) differences are indicated. dl, dorsolateral; dm, dorsomedial; pv, posteroventral; vl, ventrolateral; vm, ventromedial.
