                Figure 3.  Neuronal density of the cholinergic interneurons in the different functional territories of the human CN and Put.A, tridimensional schema showing the associative, sensorimotor and limbic territories of the CN and Put [1], [2]. a–d, drawings illustrating the functional striatal territories in the coronal plane. The anteroposterior level of each coronal drawing is indicated in the tridimensional schema of the striatum. B, table indicating the functional territory represented in each topographical region in which the striatum was subdivided. The functional domains overlap in some sectors of the CN head, in the CN tail and in the precommissural Put. C, bar graph showing the mean density of cholinergic interneurons (mean±SEM) estimated in the associative, sensorimotor and limbic territories of the dorsal striatum. Please note that the data shown in this bar graph were obtained by analyzing only those sectors of the striatum that were exclusively associative, sensorimotor or limbic, as shown in B. D, graph illustrating the cholinergic neuronal density in the various functional territories that are present in every topographical region of the CN and Put. The legend indicates the single or convergent nature of the functional territories. Highly significant (**, P&lt;0.01) differences are indicated in C. CN, caudate nucleus; dl, dorsolateral; dm, dorsomedial; Put, putamen; pv, posteroventral; vl, ventrolateral; vm, ventromedial.
