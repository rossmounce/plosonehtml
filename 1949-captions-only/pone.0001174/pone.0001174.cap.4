                Figure 4.  Distribution patterns of the cholinergic interneurons within the striosomes in the various territories of the CN and Put.A–F, photomicrographs and camera lucida drawings depicting the distribution of the cholinergic interneurons in six enkephalin-immunoreactive striosomes located in the precommissural head (A), postcommissural head (B), body (C) and gyrus (E) of CN, and in the precommissural (D) and postcommissural (F) Put. The light and dark gray shadings in A, D and F indicate the center and periphery of the striosomes, respectively. The inset on the bottom right of each drawing indicates the location of the depicted striosome. Scale bar, 650 µm (A), 1000 µm (B), 260 µm (C), 1500 µm (D), 700 µm (E), 1000 µm (F).
