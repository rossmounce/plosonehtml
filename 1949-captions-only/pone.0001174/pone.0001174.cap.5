Within each territory, the density of cholinergic neurons is higher in the quadrants indicated by the asterisks. <em>B</em>, variation in the distribution of the cholinergic interneurons within the striosomes in the various striatal territories. The bar graph illustrates the percentage of striosomes that fulfil the condition indicated by each color in the legend. <em>ENK+ region</em> comprises homogeneous striosomes and the periphery of heterogeneous striosomes. <em>n</em> in the X-axis indicates the number of striosomes (homogeneous/heterogeneous) analyzed in each territory. <em>C</em>, color photomicrograph taken from a double ENK/ChAT immunostained section showing one striosome and numerous ChAT-ir neurons in the precommissural head of CN. Observe that the periphery of the striosome is more intensely stained for ENK than its center, and that the ChAT-ir neurons occur within the striosome and in the surrounding matrix. CN, caudate nucleus; ENK, enkephalin; Put, putamen. Scale bar, 250 Âµm (<em>C</em>).</p>
