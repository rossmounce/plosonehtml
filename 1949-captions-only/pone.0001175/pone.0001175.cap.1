                Figure 1.  Illustration of the experimental procedure.A. Illustration of the experimental sequence for each language, highlighting the underlying structure of the artificial language. The “_” represents the 25 ms pause between words. After a learning phase lasting four minutes, an online test (violation phase) was administered in which new-words, either following the rule or violating it, appeared at random positions in the stream. B. Illustration of the recognition phase. In order to determine whether the participants had learned the words and rules of the language, an offline behavioural test (recognition phase) was administered after the violation phase. Half of the streams were tested for word acquisition; rule-learning was evaluated in the other half using a two alternative forced-choice test. Event-related responses were recorded throughout the whole sequence (learning, violation and recognition phases). Each participant was presented with a total of eight languages, thus eight sequences as the one presented here.
