                Figure 2.  Grand average ERPs at frontal (Fz) and central (Cz) electrode locations for language streams.A. ERP averages comparing the first and second minute of exposition. The ERP signature of the average of words from their onset for the first and second-minute blocks pooled across the four languages is shown. Words in the language streams developed an N400 component during the second minute relative to the first minute. The topography of the difference waveform (subtracting the second from the first minute) showed a central scalp distribution at 50 ms, around the peak of the component (370–420 ms). B. ERP averages comparing the third and first minute. An increase in the amplitude of the P2 component was observed from the third minute. The corresponding difference waveform (third minute minus the first minute) showed a right frontal distribution at 50 ms around the peak of the component (140–190 ms). C. Mean voltage at 50 ms around the peak of the components for the N400 and P2 effects (370–420 and 140–190 ms, respectively) as a function of time at Fz (where both modulations were significant).
