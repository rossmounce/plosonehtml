                Figure 3.  Modulation of the ERP components as a function of rule learning performance.A. Correlation between the mean amplitude of the P2 component at Fz in the third minute of learning (at the 120–220 ms time-window) and the performance on the rule-learning test (N = 20). B. Percentage (± s.e.m.) of correct recognition in the word-learning and rule-learning tests for the groups of good and poor learners (n = 8, in each group). C. ERP averages of the language conditions for each group at a frontal location (Fz), showing the evolution of the differences between groups over the time of exposition (first, second and third minute). While a noticeable increase in the P2 component is shown across time for the good-learners, no modulation is observed for the poor-learners.
