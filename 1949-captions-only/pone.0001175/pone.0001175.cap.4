                Figure 4.  Illustration of the ERP results for the violation phase.A. Left panel: ERP averages from the onset of the presentation of words and new words that violated the previously acquired rule (non-words). An early Mismatch Negativity (MMN) appears, which indicates automatic detection of the rule violation. This negativity is followed by a late positive component (LPC) that could be assimilated into a P600 syntactic component. Right panel: ERP averages from the onset of the presentation of words and new words that violated the previously acquired rule (non-words). B. The difference waveform (subtracting non-words from words) has an MMN effect peaking around 190 ms after the onset of the non-word presentation and a fronto-central distribution. The LPC shows a more left lateralised parieto-occipital distribution that peaks around 720 ms after onset.
