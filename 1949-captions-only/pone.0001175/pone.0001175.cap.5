While a clear long lasting N400 effect is observed when comparing words and non-words, rule-words did not differ from words. B. Scalp distribution of the N400 effect for non-words compared to words and compared to rule-words. The same topographical distribution of the N400 effect is observed between 350 and 550 ms peaking at fronto-central locations.</p>
