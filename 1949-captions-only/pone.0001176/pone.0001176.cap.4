                Figure 4.  The effect of amino acids on the solubility of Aβ1-42.The amino acids are indicated by single letter code. Data are given as mean±SE of four experiments in duplicates with 0.2 M amino acids. Diagonal upward bar - 0.5 M proline; vertical bar - 1.0 M proline (mean of 2 experiments). With arginine, dark shade - 0.3 M arginine; diagonal downward bar - 0.4 M arginine; horizontal bar - 0.5 M arginine (mean of 2 experiments).
