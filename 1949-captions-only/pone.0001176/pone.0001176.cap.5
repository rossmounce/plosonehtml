Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> was incubated in PB at 25°C for 24 h. (A) Inhibition of aggregation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> by 0.2 M arginine. (B) Inhibition of aggregation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> by 0.2 M proline. (C) Complete solubilization of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> at pH 10.5. No fibrils were observed. (D) Control experiment in which the fibrils formed. (Inset) Transmission electron micrograph of 24 h control sample at higher magnification (22,000×) showing spherical aggregating units.</p>
