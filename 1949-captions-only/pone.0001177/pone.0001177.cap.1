These four deletions were cloned together with <em>LdTopIS</em> into the biscistronic pESC -URA for expression in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. Six micrograms of yeast extracts were assayed in a plasmid DNA relaxation assay for 30 min at 37°C (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Reaction products were resolved in agarose gel and subsequently visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The relative position of the negatively supercoiled DNA substrate is indicated by Sc, whereas the ladder of relaxed DNA topoisomer bands is labeled R. B) Scheme of the <em>LdTopIL</em> and <em>LdTopIS</em> deletions made on the non conserved extensions of each subunit and the combinations made between them. Deletions were named according to the amino acid position where the protein was truncated. Distances represented in the drawings are not in scale. C) 10% SDS-PAGE showing the purity of the different truncations used in the study.</p>
