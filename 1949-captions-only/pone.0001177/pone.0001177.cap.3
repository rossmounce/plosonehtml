B) Time-course experiment of topoisomerase activity using 0.2 µg of truncation LdTopIΔ<sup>548</sup>ΔL/ΔS per reaction 0.2 Micrograms of purified protein and a two-fold dilution series were incubated with 0.3 µg of RfI Φ X174 supercoiled DNA for 30 min at 37°C. Relaxation rate was compared with lane RfII which includes 0.3 µg of Φ X174 relaxed DNA C) Spot tests showing the sensibility to CPT of MBY3 yeast strain transformed with the “empty” pESC-URA vector (“mock”) or carrying the wild type LdTopIL/S genotype and deletion LdTopIΔ<sup>548</sup>ΔL/ΔS D) Dose-response curves of these transformed yeast to different concentrations of CPT. A, B and C are pictures representatives of multiple experiments. D is the average of four independent experiments.</p>
