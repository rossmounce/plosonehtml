B) Time-course experiment of topoisomerase activity using 0.2 µg of truncation LdTopIΔ<sup>561</sup>ΔL/ΔS per reaction C) Spot tests showing the sensibility to CPT of MBY3 yeast strain transformed with the “empty” pESC-URA vector (“mock”) or carrying the wild type LdTopIL/S genotype and deletion LdTopIΔ<sup>561</sup>ΔL/ΔS D) Dose-response curves of these transformed yeast to different concentrations of CPT. A, B and C are pictures representatives of multiple experiments. D is the average of four independent experiments. Relaxation rate was compared with lane RfII which includes 0.3 µg of Φ X174 relaxed DNA. The “c” lane corresponds to an activity control, using a commercial topoisomerase.</p>
