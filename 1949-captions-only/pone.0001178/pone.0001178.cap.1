                Figure 1.  Loss-of-function mutants of NFκB/Rel genes display both loss and gain of macrochaetes on the notum.(A), a schematic representation of a wild-type heminotum, with the medial domain shaded yellow and the lateral domain orange. Large grey circles represent the positions of the eleven macrochaetes found on each heminotum. (B–D), heminota of flies homozygous mutant for dorsal (dl4/dl1), Dif (Dif1/Dif1) and Relish (RelE20/RelE20); white arrows indicate ectopic bristles. Below, pie charts represent the percentage of heminota displaying ectopic bristles from a total of 200. Red sectors indicate the percentage with one ectopic macrochaete, yellow sectors two or more ectopic macrochaetes (p&gt;0.001 when compared with wild type). (E, F), heminota of Ore-R and dl4/+ animals respectively, showing the lateral notum. Red arrows mark the pSA bristle, which is missing in a large fraction of dl4/+ (and also dl4/Df(2L)TW119, dl− dif− animals) (p&gt;0.001). (G), the percentage of flies trans-heterozygous for various mutant combinations that display ectopic bristles (p&gt;0.001).
