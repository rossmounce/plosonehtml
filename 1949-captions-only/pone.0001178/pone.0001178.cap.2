                Figure 2.  Over-expression of NF-κB/Rel proteins can result in both loss and gain of macrochaetes.scabrous[537.4]Gal4 was used to over-express Relish (A, B) Dorsal (C–F) and Dif (G) in proneural clusters. This resulted in a loss of bristles in lateral regions (red arrows in B, D, F and G). Ectopic bristles were present in medial regions of animals after over-expression of Relish and Dorsal (white arrows in A, E).
