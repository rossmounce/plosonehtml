                Figure 3.   Toll-8 is expressed at varying levels in the disc epithelium and expression is extinguished in the neural precursors.(A–B'), GFP expression driven by the Toll-8[MD806]Gal4 driver in discs from third instar larvae (A, A') and white prepupae (B, B') respectively. Expression is strong over the lateral notum but is excluded from the sensory organ precursors, which are stained for neuralized activity (A101, anti-β galactosidase; red). At the third larval instar, expression is clearly missing from the aPA precursor, and by prepupal stages, additional “holes” corresponding to the posterior supraalar (pSA) and sensilla trichoidea 1 (tr1) precursors are obvious in the lateral notum. (A') and (B') are higher magnifications of boxed areas in (A) and (B). (C), the expression of Toll-8 as revealed by in situ hybridisation with a Toll-8 RNA probe. Expression is strong in the lateral notum. (D), thorax of a fly of the genotype y f36a abx&gt;f+&gt;Gal4; UAS Flp; Toll-8-Gal4. All MD806-positive cells in these flies simultaneously express flipase which induces high levels of FRT-mediated recombination. Consequently, all bristles marked with f36a arise from cells expressing Toll-8. As can be seen in (3D), f36a bristles can be seen even in the medial region of the notum. (E), thorax of a neurGal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m8 fly showing a complete loss of bristles. (F), thorax of Toll-8Gal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m8 fly showing a full complement of bristles, indicating that Toll-8 is not expressed in the precursors.
