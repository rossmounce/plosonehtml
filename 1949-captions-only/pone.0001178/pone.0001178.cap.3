Expression is strong over the lateral notum but is excluded from the sensory organ precursors, which are stained for <em>neuralized</em> activity (A101, anti-β galactosidase; red). At the third larval instar, expression is clearly missing from the aPA precursor, and by prepupal stages, additional “holes” corresponding to the posterior supraalar (pSA) and sensilla trichoidea 1 (tr1) precursors are obvious in the lateral notum. (A') and (B') are higher magnifications of boxed areas in (A) and (B). (C), the expression of <em>Toll-8</em> as revealed by <em>in situ</em> hybridisation with a <em>Toll-8</em> RNA probe. Expression is strong in the lateral notum. (D), thorax of a fly of the genotype <em>y f<sup>36a</sup> abx&gt;f<sup>+</sup>&gt;Gal4; UAS Flp; Toll-8-Gal4.</em> All <em>MD806</em>-positive cells in these flies simultaneously express flipase which induces high levels of FRT-mediated recombination. Consequently, all bristles marked with <em>f<sup>36a</sup></em> arise from cells expressing <em>Toll-8</em>. As can be seen in (3D), <em>f<sup>36a</sup></em> bristles can be seen even in the medial region of the notum. (E), thorax of a <em>neurGal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m8</em> fly showing a complete loss of bristles. (F), thorax of <em>Toll-8Gal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m8</em> fly showing a full complement of bristles, indicating that <em>Toll-8</em> is not expressed in the precursors.</p>
