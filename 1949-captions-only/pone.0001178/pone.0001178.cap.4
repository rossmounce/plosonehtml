                Figure 4.  A protein composed of a fusion of Relish and VP16 can bind to the scute SOP-enhancer and activate transcription in vivo.(A–C), expression of sc-SOPE-lacZ in wild type (A), Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-RelVP16 (B) and Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-ase discs (C). Over-expression of asense results in activation of the reporter gene over a larger area than over-expression of RelVP16. (D–F), expression of sc-SOPEα3−-lacZ (a version of the enhancer construct in which one of the NF-κB/Rel binding sites, α3, has been mutated) in wild type (D), Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-RelVP16 (E) and Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m7VP16 (F) discs. Expression is decreased in wild-type flies and after over-expression of RelVP16, but strongly increased in the presence of E(spl)m7VP16 whose activity does not rely on the same binding sites.
