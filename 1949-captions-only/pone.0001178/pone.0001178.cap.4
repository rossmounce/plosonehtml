Over-expression of <em>asense</em> results in activation of the reporter gene over a larger area than over-expression of <em>RelVP16</em>. (D–F), expression of <em>sc-SOPEα3<sup>−</sup>-lacZ</em> (a version of the enhancer construct in which one of the NF-κB/Rel binding sites, <em>α3</em>, has been mutated) in wild type (D), <em>Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-RelVP16</em> (E) and <em>Bx-Gal4&gt;UAS-E(spl)m7VP16</em> (F) discs. Expression is decreased in wild-type flies and after over-expression of RelVP16, but strongly increased in the presence of E(spl)m7VP16 whose activity does not rely on the same binding sites.</p>
