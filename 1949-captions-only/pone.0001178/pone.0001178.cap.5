                Figure 5.  Expression of neuronal genes in Toll-8 and Relish mutants.(A–I), in situ hybridisation with probes for scute, asense and senseless in wild type and in Toll-81 and RelE20 mutant discs. Each set of three discs was processed in the same way and stained for the same length of time. scute transcripts are present at higher levels in the proneural clusters and the clusters themselves appear enlarged (A–C). Expression of asense (D–F) and senseless (G–I) is also much stronger in the mutant discs in bristle precursors, the cells to which they are confined in the wild type. Staining in the mutants was already strong before any staining in the wild type had become visible. Arrows in (E) and (F) point to the precursors arising from the dorsocentral cluster and insets in (D) and (G) show SOPs in wild-type discs stained for 40 minutes. In addition, asense and senseless transcripts can be seen to accumulate ectopically over most of the epithelium at very high levels. (J–L), staining with an antibody against Senseless. The protein is present only in sensory organ precursors.
