The ribosomal RNA RP49 was used as a loading control. Levels of <em>scute</em> and <em>asense</em> but not <em>ac</em> transcripts are elevated in the mutant. In addition levels of GFP transcript are elevated. (B), a sequence motif similar to that described in <em>Sox9</em> and <em>MyoD</em> (ACTAGA) is present in <em>scute, asense, senseless</em> and a number of other genes involved in patterning the notum. The central five core element nucleotides, CTACA, are conserved in all cases. The 3′-most nucleotide, G, is replaced in most cases by a T or an A. The 5′-most nucleotide, A, is replaced by a G in three cases (shown in grey). The final base, G, is mostly substituted by A or T. (C), the sequence of <em>scHw<sup>Ua</sup></em> is presented. Transcription stops within the <em>copia</em> element whose sequence is given in red. The two <em>MyoD</em> motifs are outlined in grey; one, M2, is predicted to be absent from the truncated transcript. (D), a photograph of a <em>scHw<sup>Ua</sup></em> mutant fly showing the presence of an ectopic dorsocentral bristle (white arrow). (E), pie charts representing the percentage of heminota displaying ectopic bristles from a total of 200. Red sectors indicate the percentage with one ectopic macrochaete, yellow sectors two or more ectopic macrochaetes (p&gt;0.001 when compared with wild type).</p>
