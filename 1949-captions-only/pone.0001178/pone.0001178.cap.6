                Figure 6.  Transcript stability in Relish mutants correlates with the presence of a heptamer sequence in the coding regions of target genes.(A), levels of heterologous (UAS) achaete, scute, asense and GFP transcripts driven by sca-Gal4 in wild-type (left column) and RelE20 (right column) flies. The ribosomal RNA RP49 was used as a loading control. Levels of scute and asense but not ac transcripts are elevated in the mutant. In addition levels of GFP transcript are elevated. (B), a sequence motif similar to that described in Sox9 and MyoD (ACTAGA) is present in scute, asense, senseless and a number of other genes involved in patterning the notum. The central five core element nucleotides, CTACA, are conserved in all cases. The 3′-most nucleotide, G, is replaced in most cases by a T or an A. The 5′-most nucleotide, A, is replaced by a G in three cases (shown in grey). The final base, G, is mostly substituted by A or T. (C), the sequence of scHwUa is presented. Transcription stops within the copia element whose sequence is given in red. The two MyoD motifs are outlined in grey; one, M2, is predicted to be absent from the truncated transcript. (D), a photograph of a scHwUa mutant fly showing the presence of an ectopic dorsocentral bristle (white arrow). (E), pie charts representing the percentage of heminota displaying ectopic bristles from a total of 200. Red sectors indicate the percentage with one ectopic macrochaete, yellow sectors two or more ectopic macrochaetes (p&gt;0.001 when compared with wild type).
