                Figure 7.  A model for the role of NF-κB proteins in buffering levels of the neural genes scute and asense.Epidermal cells express high levels of Toll-8, which promotes high nuclear levels of NF-κB/Rel. Relish activates the transcription of an unknown target gene, whose activity results in the degradation of scute and asense transcripts. This activity extends throughout the neuro-epithelium of the disc. Once mature precursors are chosen, they stop expressing Toll-8 and low levels of the NF-κB/Rel proteins might be recruited to the scute SOPE, where they would synergize with the bHLH protein Scute to activate transcription of high levels of scute.
