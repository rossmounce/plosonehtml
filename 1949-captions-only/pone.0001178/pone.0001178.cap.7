Relish activates the transcription of an unknown target gene, whose activity results in the degradation of <em>scute</em> and <em>asense</em> transcripts. This activity extends throughout the neuro-epithelium of the disc. Once mature precursors are chosen, they stop expressing Toll-8 and low levels of the NF-κB/Rel proteins might be recruited to the <em>scute</em> SOPE, where they would synergize with the bHLH protein Scute to activate transcription of high levels of <em>scute</em>.</p>
