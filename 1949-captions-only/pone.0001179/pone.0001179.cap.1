                Figure 1.  Schematic diagram of PCR mediated Genomic DNA Splicing (GDS) strategy.Individual exons are amplified in the first PCR (exon PCR) following standard PCR protocol with software-optimized primers. A second PCR (overlapping PCR) is then carried out to join the exons and produce the full-length coding sequence. ATG and TAG indicate the start and stop codons, respectively.
