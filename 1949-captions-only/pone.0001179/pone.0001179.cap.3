Amplification of <em>PIGR</em> coding exons by standard PCR protocol with exon primers. The sizes of the amplified fragments of exon 2 through 11 are 400 bp, 795 bp, 989 bp, 599 bp, 855 bp, 486 bp, 395 bp, 387 bp, 369 bp, 461 bp, respectively. B. Amplification of full-length <em>PIGR</em> coding sequence. The size of the amplified full-length sequence is 2549 bp, including 2295 bp <em>PIGR</em> ORF and two short flanking sequences. C. Exon assembly of <em>PIGR</em> coding sequence. The start and stop codons are boxed. Exon-exon junctions are marked by vertical lines. The point mutations mentioned in the text are indicated by the mutated bases in parenthesis under the wild type ones. DL2000, DNA molecular weight marker (Takara).</p>
