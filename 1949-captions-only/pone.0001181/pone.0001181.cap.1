                Figure 1.  Map of West Africa.Panel A: The Sahara desert and the savannah occupy the northern and southern landscape, respectively, while the Sahel comprises the intermediate fringe zone. Mali lacks access to the ocean; its capital, Bamako, is indicated with a red pointer; and, the district of Niono is located inside the red demarcation, which is enlarged in panel B. Panel B: The black line on the top of this panel corresponds to the southeastern Mauritanian border; the depicted segment of the Niger River runs along the southwest-northeast direction; the district of Niono, which is located 330 km northwest of Bamako and 100 km north of the Niger River along the Canal du Sahel, is located within the red rectangle. This satellite image places the district of Niono in the Sahelian zone: poverty is extensive in the northern (semi-desert) and central (irrigated) regions; contrarily, poverty diminishes southward (savannah) where mixed crops prevail.
