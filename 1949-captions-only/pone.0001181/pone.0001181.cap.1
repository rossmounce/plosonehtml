Mali lacks access to the ocean; its capital, Bamako, is indicated with a red pointer; and, the district of Niono is located inside the red demarcation, which is enlarged in panel B. Panel B: The black line on the top of this panel corresponds to the southeastern Mauritanian border; the depicted segment of the Niger River runs along the southwest-northeast direction; the district of Niono, which is located 330 km northwest of Bamako and 100 km north of the Niger River along the <em>Canal du Sahel</em>, is located within the red rectangle. This satellite image places the district of Niono in the Sahelian zone: poverty is extensive in the northern (semi-desert) and central (irrigated) regions; contrarily, poverty diminishes southward (savannah) where mixed crops prevail. <em>Image source</em>: adapted with permission from Globalis, <a href="http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu">http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu</a> (08/2007).</p>
