(1) Prior time-series observations and pseudo-parameter initialization are inputted into (2) the program that executes the multiplicative Holt-Winters (MHW) forecasting method, according to Equations 1–4 in the <a href="#s4"><em>Methods</em></a> section. (3) The program cycles (red arrow) through hundreds of residual bootstraps (Equation 5 in the <a href="#s4"><em>Methods</em></a> section) to produce (4) median forecasts and their 95% prediction interval bounds. Subsequently, (5) these forecasts plus (6) contemporaneous time-series observations are supplied to (2, 3) the MHW execution program, which revises (4) median forecasts and their prediction interval bounds. The automatic supply of contemporaneous time-series observations into (2–6) yields <em>on-line</em> forecasts.</p>
