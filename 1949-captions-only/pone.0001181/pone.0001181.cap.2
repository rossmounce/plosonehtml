                Figure 2.  On-line forecast flow-chart.On-line forecasts imply that historical records are automatically and continuously supplied to the program, which revises forecasts. (1) Prior time-series observations and pseudo-parameter initialization are inputted into (2) the program that executes the multiplicative Holt-Winters (MHW) forecasting method, according to Equations 1–4 in the Methods section. (3) The program cycles (red arrow) through hundreds of residual bootstraps (Equation 5 in the Methods section) to produce (4) median forecasts and their 95% prediction interval bounds. Subsequently, (5) these forecasts plus (6) contemporaneous time-series observations are supplied to (2, 3) the MHW execution program, which revises (4) median forecasts and their prediction interval bounds. The automatic supply of contemporaneous time-series observations into (2–6) yields on-line forecasts.
