                Figure 3.  Forecasts for diarrhea consultation rate time-series.Observed diarrhea consultation rate time-series are depicted as black lines while red and blue traces correspond to contemporaneous 2- and 3-month horizon forecasts, respectively; their 95% prediction interval bounds are symbolized by dots of the same colors. Forecasts and prediction interval bounds are calculated with a bootstrap-coupled seasonal multiplicative Holt-Winters method (Methods). In each panel, the abscissa spans 102 months (01/1996–06/2004) while the ordinate represents the number of newly diagnosed cases per 1000 age category-specific individuals. Panel A: 0–11 months; Panel B: 1–4 years; Panel C: 5–15 years; and, Panel D: &gt;15 years. Forecasting accuracy is greater for younger age categories where seasonality dominates and mortality is highest. Of note, age category-specific 2- and 3-month horizon diarrhea consultation rate forecasts roughly overlap because of slowly shifting level and negligible trend time-series components. Consequently, 2- and 3-month horizon 95% prediction interval bounds also overlap.
