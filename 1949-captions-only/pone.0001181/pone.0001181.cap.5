                Figure 5.  Forecasts for malaria consultation rate time-series.Observed malaria consultation rate time-series are depicted as black lines while red and blue traces correspond to contemporaneous 2- and 3-month horizon forecasts, respectively; their prediction interval bounds are symbolized by dots of the same colors. Forecasts and prediction interval bounds are calculated with a bootstrap-coupled seasonal multiplicative Holt-Winters method (Methods). The abscissa spans 102 months (01/1996–06/2004) while the ordinate represents the number of newly diagnosed cases per 1000 age category-specific individuals. Panel A: 0–11 months; Panel B: 1–4 years; Panel C: 5–15 years; and, Panel D: &gt;15 years. Forecasts ameliorate towards older age categories owing to seasonality accentuation. Visual inspection suggests a resemblance between ARI (Fig. 4) and malaria time-series, as well as forecasts, for the youngest age category (Panel A: 0–11 months), which might reflect misdiagnosis and or co-morbidity between these two diseases. Clinical diagnosis among infants suffers from two major limitations. Infants are i) immunologically complex and ii) unable to effectively communicate symptoms. Of note, age category-specific 2- and 3-month horizon malaria consultation rate forecasts roughly overlap because of slowly shifting level and negligible trend time-series components. Consequently, 2- and 3-month horizon 95% prediction interval bounds also overlap.
