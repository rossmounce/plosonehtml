Forecasts and prediction interval bounds are calculated with a bootstrap-coupled seasonal multiplicative Holt-Winters method (<a href="#s4"><em>Methods</em></a>). The abscissa spans 102 months (01/1996–06/2004) while the ordinate represents the number of newly diagnosed cases <em>per</em> 1000 age category-specific individuals. Panel A: 0–11 months; Panel B: 1–4 years; Panel C: 5–15 years; and, Panel D: &gt;15 years. Forecasts ameliorate towards older age categories owing to seasonality accentuation. Visual inspection suggests a resemblance between ARI (<a href="#pone-0001181-g004">Fig. 4</a>) and malaria time-series, as well as forecasts, for the youngest age category (Panel A: 0–11 months), which might reflect misdiagnosis and or co-morbidity between these two diseases. Clinical diagnosis among infants suffers from two major limitations. Infants are <em>i</em>) immunologically complex and <em>ii</em>) unable to effectively communicate symptoms. Of note, age category-specific 2- and 3-month horizon malaria consultation rate forecasts roughly overlap because of slowly shifting level and negligible trend time-series components. Consequently, 2- and 3-month horizon 95% prediction interval bounds also overlap.</p>
