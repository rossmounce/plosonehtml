After centrifugation, fractions were collected and their DNA (top) and RNA (bottom) content determined as in <a href="#pone-0001182-g001">Figure 1</a>. Fraction numbers are indicated. Lane M, corresponds to molecular weight markers. B) The histone content of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lanes 1-P). As controls, H1 from calf thymus and hydroxylapatite-purified core histones from chicken liver are also presented. The gel was stained with silver.</p>
