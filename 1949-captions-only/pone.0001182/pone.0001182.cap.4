                Figure 4.  Treatment with RNase A alters the sedimentation behavior of chicken liver chromatin at specific genomic regions.The effect of treatment with RNase A on the sedimentation behavior of chromatin was determined for bulk chicken liver chromatin (left panels) and for chromatin at specific genomic locations (right panels) by Northern analysis of the gels on the left using specific probes for the Pax3 locus A) and the chicken 41–42 bp centromeric satellite B). Fraction numbers are indicated. Lanes M, correspond to molecular weight markers. Quantitation of the results is shown on the right of each panel: (°) bulk chromatin, (▴) chromatin of the Pax3 locus A) or the chicken 41–42 bp centromeric satellite B).
