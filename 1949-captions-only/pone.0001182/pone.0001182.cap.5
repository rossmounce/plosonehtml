                Figure 5.  Treatment with RNase A alters the sedimentation behavior of purified Drosophila S2 chromatin.The effect of treatment with RNase A on the sedimentation behavior of chromatin prepared from Drosophila S2 cells was determined for bulk chromatin (left panels) and for chromatin at specific genomic locations (right panels) by Southern analysis of the gels on the left using specific probes for the Trl locus A) and the centromeric Drosophila dodeca-satellite B). Fraction numbers are indicated. Lanes M, correspond to molecular weight markers. Quantitation of the results is shown on the right of each panel for bulk chromatin and chromatin of the Trl locus A) or the centromeric dodeca-satellite B): untreated chromatin (°); chromatin treated with RNase A in the presence of anti-RNase (Ambion) (▴) or in the absence of any added inhibitor (•).
