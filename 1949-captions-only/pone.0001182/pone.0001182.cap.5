Fraction numbers are indicated. Lanes M, correspond to molecular weight markers. Quantitation of the results is shown on the right of each panel for bulk chromatin and chromatin of the <em>Trl locus</em> A) or the centromeric dodeca-satellite B): untreated chromatin (°); chromatin treated with RNase A in the presence of anti-RNase (Ambion) (▴) or in the absence of any added inhibitor (•).</p>
