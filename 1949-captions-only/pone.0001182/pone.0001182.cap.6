A) S2 chromatin from untreated (top) and treated cells (bottom) was purified by micrococcal nuclease digestion of purified nuclei and subjected to sedimentation through linear 5%–30% sucrose gradients as described above. Quantitation of the results is shown on the right where the average molecular weight (M) of the chromatin fragments contained in each fraction, expressed as bp of DNA, is presented as a function of the fraction number for chromatin prepared from untreated (▴) and treated cells (Δ). B) Chromatin fractions 4, 5 and 6 of the gradients shown in A) obtained from cells treated with α-amanitin (lanes 2 and 4) or not (lanes 1 and 3), were subjected to RNA extraction and analised in a glyoxal-1% agarose-sodium phosphate gel before (lanes 1 and 2) and after treatment with RNase A (lanes 3 and 4). Lane M corresponds to molecular weight markers. C and D) Analysis of the efficiency of treatment with α-amanitin. D) Total RNA was prepared from treated (lane 1) or untreated cells (lanes 2), and 5 µg of each were analysed in a 1% agarose-TBE native gel. Lane M corresponds to molecular weight markers. C) Determination of the levels of nascent transcripts encoding GAGA (<em>Trl</em>), actin 5C and RP-49. Increasing amounts of total RNA (0,1, 0,2 and 0,5 µg, lanes 1-3), prepared from untreated (lanes -) and treated cells (lanes +), were analysed by RT-PCR (Omniscript® RT Kit, QIAGEN) as indicated under <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> using appropriate primers to specifically amplify fragments of the Actin 5C (585 bp), <em>Trl</em> (662 bp) and RP-49 (702 bp) genes. Amplified fragments were analysed in a 1% agarose-TBE gel. Lanes M correspond to molecular weight markers.</p>
