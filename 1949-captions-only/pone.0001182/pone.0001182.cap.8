Fraction numbers are indicated. Lane M corresponds to molecular weight markers. B) Fraction 13 of the gradient shown in A) was treated RNase A (lanes 8 to 14) or not (lanes 1–7), and, then, digested at 37°C with 0,4 units of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) at increasing times as indicated. After micrococcal nuclease digestion, samples were deproteinized and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose-TBE gels. Lane M corresponds to molecular weight markers. C) Quantitation of the results shown in B). The ratio of mononucleosomal DNA versus total DNA is presented as a function of the digestion time for untreated chromatin (°) and chromatin treated with RNase A (•).</p>
