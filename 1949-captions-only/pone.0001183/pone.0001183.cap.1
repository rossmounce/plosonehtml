Amino acid sequence of human, mouse and rat DOR proteins (sequences 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Multi-alignment done using the CLUSTALW Sequence Alignment programme <a href="#pone.0001183-Thompson1">[52]</a>. Amino acids differing from the consensus are inverse. The amino acid residues used to generate the polyclonal antibodies are shown in bold. The C-terminal basic motif, indicated by a line of “+”, is predicted to form an alpha-helix structure whereas the N-terminal half is unstructured (GLOBPLOT 2). Panel B. PolyA<sup>+</sup>-RNA membrane containing human adult tissues was probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled rat <em>DOR</em> cDNA and washed in stringent conditions. The probe hybridises to a transcript of approximately 4.5 kb. Hybridisation with human glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) cDNA was used as a control probe. Br, brain; He, heart; SK, skeletal muscle; Co, colon; Th, thymus; Sp, spleen; Ki, kidney; Li, liver; Sl, small intestine; Pl, placenta; Lu, lung; Leu, leukocytes. Panels C. Total RNA was purified from several rat tissues and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal 28S subunit was used as a control of the relative amounts of RNA loaded in each lane and to check the integrity of RNA in each sample. SK, skeletal muscle; He, heart; WAT, white adipose tissue; Ki, kidney; Br, brain; Lu, lung. Panel D. Total RNA was purified from skeletal muscle from non-diabetic and ZDF rats, and RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. The mean±SD of 6 separate observations is shown. * difference compared to the control group, at P&lt;0.01 (Student's <em>t</em> test).</p>
