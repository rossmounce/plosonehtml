                Figure 2.  DOR protein is localized in nuclear bodies.Panel A. HeLa cells were transfected with a DOR expression vector or with the empty vector and with GFP. After 48 h, cells were fixed and stained to view DOR, GFP or with the DOR pre-immune serum (negative control). Cells were also counterstained with Hoescht. The arrow indicates a GFP-positive cell, also DOR-positive. DOR shown in red; GFP in green; nuclei counterstained in blue. Panel B. After DOR transfection in HeLa cells (48 h), cytosolic (Cyt), nuclear soluble (NuS) or nuclear nonsoluble (NuM) fractions were obtained by an osmotic-shock method. Fractions were subjected to Western Blot assays with anti-DOR, anti-Np62 or anti- Î²-actin antibodies. Panel C. DOR-transfected HeLa cells or wild-type mouse 1C9 myoblasts were fixed and stained to view DOR and markers of subnuclear domains, such as the splicing speckles (SC-35), PML bodies (PML) or transcriptionally active sites (RNA Pol. II). DOR is shown in red in the images on the left, and SC-35, PML or RNA Polymerase II are shown in green in the middle. Merging is shown on the right.
