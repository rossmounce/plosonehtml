                Figure 3.  DOR transactivates nuclear hormone receptors.Panel A. HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding TRα1 (TR), DOR, the empty vector pcDNA3 as a control vector, and the reporter vectors containing TRα1 response elements linked to CAT. Cells were treated for 18 h in the presence or absence of ligands (100 nM T3) and assayed for reporter expression. Results are mean±SD of 6 independent experiments. * significant difference compared to the nuclear hormone receptor group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc t test). Panel B. Reporter assays were done as in previous panels but the amounts of DOR (ranging from 200 to 600 ng) used for transfection differed and these assay were done in the presence of ligands. Results are mean±SD of 6 independent experiments. * significant difference compared to the nuclear hormone receptor group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc t test).
