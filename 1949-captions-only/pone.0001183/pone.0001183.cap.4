                Figure 4.  DOR shows transcriptional activity when tethered to a target gene promoter.DOR or fragments corresponding to the amino acids indicated were fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4 DBD) and transfected in HeLa cells (panel A) or in HEK293T cells (panel B). Transcription was assayed with a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the UAS linked to luciferase. Results are meanÂ±SD of 6 independent experiments. * difference compared to the Gal4 DBD-DOR group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc t test).
