C2C12 myoblasts previously infected with lentiviruses encoding scrambled RNA (open bar) or DOR siRNA (black bar) were cultured. Cell extracts and total RNA were obtained and DOR protein and mRNA levels were assayed by Western blot and real-time PCR. Relative amounts of proteins in each sample were checked by expression of the nonmuscle-specific protein β-actin. * difference compared to the scrambled group, at P&lt;0.05 (Student's <em>t</em> test). Panel B. Scramble (open bars) or DOR siRNA C2C12 muscle cells (black bars) were transfected with a reporter vector driven by a TRE, and with or without a expression vector for TR<sub>α1</sub>. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of thyroid hormone for 16 h. Results are mean±SD of triplicates and are representative of three independent experiments. * difference compared to the scrambled group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc <em>t</em> test). Panels C–H. Scrambled (open bars) or DOR siRNA C2C12 muscle cells (black bars) were incubated in 5% horse serum-containing medium either in the absence or in the presence of 100 nM T<sub>3</sub>. Total RNA obtained at 48 h of T<sub>3 t</sub> treatment were assayed by real-time PCR to measure the expression of several genes. Results are mean±SD of a representative experiment. * difference compared to the control group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc <em>t</em> test).</p>
