                Figure 6.  DOR loss-of-function alters myogenesis.Panels A–F. Confluent C2C12 myoblasts previously infected with lentiviruses encoding scrambled RNA (squares) or DOR siRNA (triangles) were allowed to differentiate in 5% horse serum-containing medium for 4 days. Total RNA was purified and the expression of DOR, myogenin, caveolin-3, actin α1, creatine kinase, IGF-II and HPRT was assayed by real-time PCR. Values were expressed as relative to HPRT. Results are mean±SD of four independent experiments. Scrambled and DOR siRNA groups were significantly different as analyzed by two-way ANOVA, at P&lt;0.05. Panel G. DOR and muscle-specific protein expression (myogenin, caveolin 3, and glycogen synthase) were analyzed by Western blot of total cell lysates (20 µg) from each condition. Relative amounts of proteins in each sample were checked by expression of the nonmuscle-specific protein β-actin.
