GST protein or TR<sub>α1</sub> fused to GST (TR-GST) were immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads and incubated with the DOR protein containing an N-terminal histidine tag (HisDOR), with or without the ligand (1 µM T<sub>3</sub>). Bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE and further Western blot using an antibody against the histidine tag (to visualize HisDOR) or against GST (to visualize GST or TR-GST). Panel B. HeLa cells over-expressing His-tagged DOR (left), TRα-1 (middle), or both (HisDOR+TR<sub>α1</sub>) (right) were exposed to T<sub>3</sub> or were left untreated. After 1 h of treatment, cells were collected and DOR was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear fractions. The input control (10% input) and the immunoprecipitates (IP) were assayed by Western blot with specific antibodies. Panel C. ChIP analysis over a T<sub>3</sub> responsive promoter. DOR and TR<sub>α1</sub>-transfected HeLa cells were treated with T<sub>3</sub> for 1 h or left untreated. Cross-linked chromatin prepared from cells was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated. As negative controls, the samples were subjected to ChIP in the absence of antibody or in the presence of an irrelevant antibody (anti-hemaglutinin, HA). Aliquots of chromatin taken before immunoprecipitation (input) and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to PCR analysis with primers directed to the dio1 promoter. DOR immunoprecipitates were used to amplify <em>IL-2</em> (an additional negative control group).</p>
