HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with DOR and TR<sub>α1</sub> expression vectors. The intranuclear positioning of DOR relative to PML nuclear bodies was determined before and after T<sub>3</sub> addition. Antibodies and immunofluorescence legend: Anti-DOR, stained red (column 1); anti-PML, stained green (column 2); merged images (column 3). Panel B. Full length DOR was fused in frame with the fluorescent protein GFP. To determine whether DOR-GFP retained the capacity to coactivate TR<sub>α1</sub>, experiments were done as in <a href="#pone-0001183-g003">Figure 3A</a>. * significant difference compared to the nuclear hormone receptor group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc <em>t</em> test). Panel C. HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with DOR-GFP and TR<sub>α1 </sub>expression vectors. The intranuclear positioning of DOR relative to PML nuclear bodies and TR<sub>α1 </sub>was determined before and after a range of times after T<sub>3</sub> addition. Antibodies and immunofluorescence legend: Anti-DOR, stained red (column 1); anti-PML, stained green (column 2), anti-TR<sub>α1</sub> cyan. Merged images: DOR/PML (column 3), DOR/TR<sub>α1</sub> (column 4).</p>
