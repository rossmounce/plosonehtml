                Figure 8.  DOR rapidly delocalizes from PML nuclear bodies in response to thyroid hormones.Panel A. HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with DOR and TRα1 expression vectors. The intranuclear positioning of DOR relative to PML nuclear bodies was determined before and after T3 addition. Antibodies and immunofluorescence legend: Anti-DOR, stained red (column 1); anti-PML, stained green (column 2); merged images (column 3). Panel B. Full length DOR was fused in frame with the fluorescent protein GFP. To determine whether DOR-GFP retained the capacity to coactivate TRα1, experiments were done as in Figure 3A. * significant difference compared to the nuclear hormone receptor group, at P&lt;0.05 (post hoc t test). Panel C. HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with DOR-GFP and TRα1 expression vectors. The intranuclear positioning of DOR relative to PML nuclear bodies and TRα1 was determined before and after a range of times after T3 addition. Antibodies and immunofluorescence legend: Anti-DOR, stained red (column 1); anti-PML, stained green (column 2), anti-TRα1 cyan. Merged images: DOR/PML (column 3), DOR/TRα1 (column 4).
