                Figure 1.  Sketch of the division strategies.We split U&amp;M-CGIs into several fragments with equal width of 200 bp. As the median length of U-CGIs are much longer than M-CGIs, there are 6 fragments of U-CGIs (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1) whereas there are only 2 fragments of M-CGIs (A2 and F2), and such fragments could cover most of the sequences of U&amp;M-CGIs. Applying the same division strategy to the flanking sequences corresponding to both U&amp;M-CGIs, we extended 800 bp upstream and downstream of CGIs, and got fragments of J1, I1, H1, G1, K1, L1, M1, N1, and J2, I2, H2, G2, K2, L2, M2, N2 respectively. We further define 400 bp upstream and downstream of U-CGIs (O1, P1) as the boundary sequences since there are few significant TFBSs outside such regions.
