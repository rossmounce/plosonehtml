                Figure 2.  The number of significantly over-represented TFBSs in each fragment of U-CGIs and their flanking sequences.The x-axis indicates the location of fragment relative to the 5′ or 3′ end of U-CGIs. Fragments insides the two ‘0’s correspond to A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and F1 of Figure 1, and fragments that are in the 800 bp upstream and downstream of U-CGIs represent J1, I1, H1, G1 and K1, L1, M1, N1 of Figure 1 respectively. The y-axis is the number of significantly enriched TFBSs in each fragment. We applied the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value cutoff 0.01 here. The sequences that are 400 bp upstream and downstream of U-CGIs are defined as the boundary sequences.
