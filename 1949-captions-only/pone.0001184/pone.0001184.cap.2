Fragments insides the two ‘0’s correspond to A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and F1 of <a href="#pone-0001184-g001">Figure 1</a>, and fragments that are in the 800 bp upstream and downstream of U-CGIs represent J1, I1, H1, G1 and K1, L1, M1, N1 of <a href="#pone-0001184-g001">Figure 1</a> respectively. The <em>y</em>-axis is the number of significantly enriched TFBSs in each fragment. We applied the Bonferroni-adjusted <em>p</em>-value cutoff 0.01 here. The sequences that are 400 bp upstream and downstream of U-CGIs are defined as the boundary sequences.</p>
