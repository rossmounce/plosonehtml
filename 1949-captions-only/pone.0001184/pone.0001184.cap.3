                Figure 3.  The number of significantly over-represented TFBSs in each fragment of promoter related CGIs and their flanking sequences.The x-axis indicates the location of fragment relative to the 5′ or 3′ end of CGIs. The y-axis is the average number of significant TFBSs in each fragment in the 10 experiments. One can see that there is no clear boundary in the flanking region of promoter related CGIs.
