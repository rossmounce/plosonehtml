                Figure 4.  The average differences of histone modifications between U and M fragments.The x-axis indicates the location of fragment relative to the 5′ or 3′ end of CGIs. The y-axis is the differential average intensity in each fragment. One can see that H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K9me1are enriched in boundary regions, and H3K4me3 is enriched both in the U-CGIs and their boundaries.
