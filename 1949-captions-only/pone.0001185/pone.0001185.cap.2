                Figure 2.  Viscosity and elasticity of the pure digestive fluid of N. rafflesiana.(a) Shear viscosity η as a function of the shear rate  (same mixing of fluids as in retention experiments). (b) Typical transient extensional viscosity ηE as a function of the extensional strain E, obtained from the thinning dynamics of a liquid filament in a capillary break-up geometry (see inset, the solid line materializes the elasto-capillary exponential regime giving the elastic relaxation time λ). The high increase of the extensional viscosity with strain is a signature of fluid elasticity. Arrows in (a) and (b) indicate the typical values of shear viscosity and extensional viscosity corresponding to insect motion in the fluid (~40 s−1 and  with τ~0.1 s the typical time scale for insect motion).
