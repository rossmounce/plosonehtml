(a) Extensional viscosity (white squares) and shear viscosity (white circles) of the pure fluid and diluted solutions, normalized by the shear viscosity of water (solid line, <em>η</em><sup>water</sup> = 0.0012 Pa.s, measured in the same condition). Shear viscosity is plotted for <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001185.e004&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> = 40 s<sup>−1</sup> and extensional viscosity is plotted for <em>E</em> = 4, the typical shear rate and extensional strain of the fluid imposed by insect motion respectively. (b) Elastic relaxation time <em>λ</em> of the pure fluid and diluted solutions (M±min-max of 10 fluids from 10 pitchers of 7 plants).</p>
