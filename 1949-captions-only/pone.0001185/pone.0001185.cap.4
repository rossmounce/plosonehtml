The Deborah number (<em>De</em>) is defined as the ratio of the fluid elastic relaxation time <em>λ</em> (see <a href="#pone-0001185-g003">Fig. 3b</a>) to the typical half-period of the swimming stroke of insects in the fluid <em>τ.</em> For each insect category, the capture rate decreases rapidly when <em>De</em>&lt;1, suggesting that trapping occurs when the elastic forces created by the insect's movements have no time to relax.</p>
