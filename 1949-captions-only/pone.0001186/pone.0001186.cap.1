Superoxide is sensed by SoxR, which enhances the expression of the transcription factor SoxS, which in turn stimulates other downstream targets. One of the SoxS-regulated genes, <em>sodA</em> (superoxide dismutase), converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, which acts as a signal to enhance transcription of genes through OxyR. <em>katG</em> (catalase), a hydrogen peroxide scavenger is an OxyR-regulated gene. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide also directly affect IscR modulation of a set of genes involved in iron sulfur cluster biogenesis.</p>
