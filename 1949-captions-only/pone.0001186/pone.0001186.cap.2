<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4"></a><p>To identify putative regulatory networks within the antioxidant response, clustering methods were used to partition the data according to RNA expression patterns through time. The prominent paraquat induced genes could easily be identified in the clustering results. However, there is no generally accepted procedure for determining the biologically relevant number of clusters and cluster analysis is not able to confirm the validity of these groupings. To overcome these problems we developed an approach called “Biological Relationship Analysis”.</p>


<h4>Biological Relationship Analysis can be used to validate clustering results</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Biological Relationship Analysis consists of four steps: (1) Formatting biological relationship data files derived from <em>E. coli</em> research databases and published data sets. (2) Partitioning the microarray data results into groups of genes with similar expression patterns using clustering methods. (3) Applying a statistical test to determine whether genes having a relationship are over represented in a group. (4) Repeating steps #2 and #3 to determine the appropriate clustering method and number of clusters.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>The biological relationship data sets are derived from the <em>E. coli</em> research databases and published data sets including; regulatory interactions <a href="#pone.0001186-Salgado1">[20]</a>, gene functional categories <a href="#pone.0001186-Keseler1">[21]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001186-Riley1">[22]</a>, operons <a href="#pone.0001186-Bockhorst1">[23]</a>, metabolic interactions <a href="#pone.0001186-Keseler1">[21]</a>, protein-protein interactions <a href="#pone.0001186-Butland1">[24]</a>, and protein complex associations <a href="#pone.0001186-Keseler1">[21]</a> by extracting information on relationships between genes using custom Perl programs. The information captured is of the form “gene” “relationship” “gene”. Here are a few examples of the data types: 1) “SoxS” “transcriptionally regulates” “<em>sodA</em>”. 2) “<em>sufS</em>” “iron sulfur cluster synthesis” “<em>sufD</em>”. 3) “<em>sufS</em>” “operon” “<em>sufD</em>”. 4) “<em>rpsE</em>” “tandem affinity purification with” “<em>rpsF</em>”. 5) “<em>rpsE</em>” “part of ribosome with” “<em>rpsF</em>”.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>Several standard clustering methods were evaluated using a range of cluster numbers from 25 to 500 including the expression values calculated from all MG1655 specific probe sets. We then tested whether a cluster contained more of a particular biological relationship than would be expected by random chance using the hypergeometric distribution with a modified Bonferroni correction as implemented in GeneMerge <a href="#pone.0001186-CastilloDavis1">[25]</a>. Based on this test, we chose to present the K-means clustering results using Euclidean distance metrics and a relatively small number (50) of clusters. This method grouped together the previously identified SoxS-regulated genes, and did not include a cluster containing RpoH-regulated genes which are likely to be the result of secondary regulation mediated by SoxS through RpoH (see below).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>Clusters 1, 2 and 3 (<a href="#pone-0001186-g003">Fig. 3</a>) included 22 of the 23 previously described SoxS-regulated genes. The lone exception is <em>rob</em>, which is negatively regulated by SoxS. These three clusters include 138 genic regions, including 112 putative protein-coding genes, 3 sRNAs and 23 other intergenic regions. The genes in each cluster shown in <a href="#pone-0001186-g003">Figures 3</a> are listed in <a href="#pone.0001186.s003">Supplemental Table S1</a>. Many SoxS targeted genes are also regulated by MarA and Rob and thus MarA and Rob appeared as significant transcription factors for these groups. In our biological relationship analysis, the only common biological attributes for genes in cluster 1, 2 and 3, other than “regulated by SoxS, MarA and Rob”, were that some genes are on the same operon and form transporter complexes (see <a href="#pone.0001186.s004">Supplemental Table 2</a>).</p>
