It is a synthesis of our microarray results, interactions in RegulonDB, genome annotation and the primary literature related to the regulation of these primary paraquat responsive genes. Thus, it does not show other genes regulated by these transcription factors, nor does it include all regulatory factors that may govern these genes. Regulatory proteins are represented by ovals, sRNAs are represented by rounded rectangles and mRNAs are represented by boxes. SoxR-dependent transcripts that increase are shaded magenta, SoxR-independent transcripts are shaded blue, transcripts that are SoxR-dependent, but still have some residual paraquat response are shaded green, transcripts that decrease are shaded red. Regulatory proteins and sRNAs that appear on the right side of the figure are derived from transcripts present in the boxes. Boxes that are directly attached to each other represent chromosomally adjacent genes. Many of the transcripts are also connected as part of common protein complexes, metabolic pathways and in other biological processes. However, this level of biological detail could not be represented clearly in this model.</p>
