Therefore, a strain having <em>wild type</em> final optical density levels and exponential growth levels in the presence and absence of paraquat would have a value of 100 on both the x and y-axis. A minimum of six replicate growth curves were run for each deletion strain. The results for the <em>ΔsoxR and ΔsoxS</em> strains are circled. The following strains were not included because the corresponding genes are essential or are not part of the Keio collection: b1052, <em>fldA, hemB, ligA, lpxC, map, mdl, ribA, rpoH, yadR, ygiA, yhbN, yraL</em>, and <em>yrbK</em>.</p>
