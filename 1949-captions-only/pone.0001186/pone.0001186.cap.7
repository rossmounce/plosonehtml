                Figure 7.  Effect of paraquat on strains carrying deletions in SoxR-modulated genes relative to the wild type.The values represent the percent difference in final optical density and exponential growth rate in 94 precise deletion strains relative to the wild type in presence of paraquat normalized by the change in the deletion strains relative to the wild type in absence of paraquat. Therefore, a strain having wild type final optical density levels and exponential growth levels in the presence and absence of paraquat would have a value of 100 on both the x and y-axis. A minimum of six replicate growth curves were run for each deletion strain. The results for the ΔsoxR and ΔsoxS strains are circled. The following strains were not included because the corresponding genes are essential or are not part of the Keio collection: b1052, fldA, hemB, ligA, lpxC, map, mdl, ribA, rpoH, yadR, ygiA, yhbN, yraL, and yrbK.
