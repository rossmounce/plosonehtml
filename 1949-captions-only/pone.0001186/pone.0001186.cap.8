                Figure 8.  Significant two-block motifs in SoxR-dependent clusters.The two block algorithm implemented in Bioprospector finds a motif with two blocks separated by a variable length gap. The median gap for cluster 1 is 7 with a range of 5 to 9. The median gap for cluster 2 is 6 with a range of 4 to 8. The median gap for cluster 3 is 6 with a range of 5 to 8.
