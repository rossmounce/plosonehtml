For all genes detected on the Affymetrix Human Genome HGU133 A &amp; B Chip Set, each point represents a gene plotted as a function of fold-change (Log (fold change), y-axis) and statistical significance (-Log (<em>p</em>-value), x-axis). Vertical lines represent <em>p</em> values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. The upper and lower horizontal lines represent fold changes of +1.3 and −1.3, respectively. Green represents downregulation, while red illustrates upregulation in group comparisons. <em>B,</em> Clustered Image Map (left panel) of the relative change in gene expression between the control and cocaine exposure groups. The color change reflects relative change according to the scale shown; red indicates positive fold change and blue indicates negative fold change. B) Representative genes (left panel): RECK, OPHN1, CTGF, EPHB4 and PCDH8 (from left to right). <em>C,</em> Principal Components Analysis (PCA) reveals separation between groups for the 242 differentially expressed genes. Red represents the cocaine abusers (COC, n = 8) and blue illustrates the control subjects (CTRL, n = 8).</p>
