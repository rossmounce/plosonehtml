                Figure 3.  Confirmation of cocaine-regulated transcripts.A, RT-PCR confirmation of a sample of four genes (RECK, PCDH8, CTGF, EPHB4) in human hippocampus. Representative cases are shown. All genes were normalized to an endogenous control gene cyclophilin. B, Graphical representation of the relative mRNA levels (% of cyclophilin) in control and cocaine groups (n = 8, respectively). **p = 0.01 (one-tailed t-test), *p = 0.05 (one-tailed t-test)
