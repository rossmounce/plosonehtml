                Figure 4.  Western blot analysis of RECK, CTGF, and EphB4 protein expression in human postmortem hippocampus.A, Representative immunoblots with antibodies against human RECK, CTGF, and EPHB4 demonstrate elevated RECK and decreased CTGF, EPHB4 immunopositive bands in the human hippocampus from cocaine overdose subjects as compared with age-matched, drug-free control subjects (n = 8, respectively). B, Quantitation of protein expression. Optical density measurements are shown as percent control (y-axis). Data are meansÂ±SEM. **p = 0.01 (one-tailed t-test), *p = 0.05 (one-tailed t-test).
