                Figure 5.  Regulation of MMP9 in human hippocampus with cocaine exposure.A, Representative Western immunoblots with antibodies against human MMP2 and MMP9 demonstrate down-regulation of MMP9 protein expression in cocaine abusers compared to age-matched controls subjects (n = 8, respectively). The relative optical densities for active 92 kDa MMP9 and 72 kDa MMP2 illustrate quantitative fold change of MMP2 and MMP9 protein expression. Equal amount of total protein loading was confirmed by α-tubulin. B, Representative gel zymography. MMP9 activity in cocaine abusers compared with age-matched drug-free control subjects demonstrate decreased activity. The graphs illustrate quantitative zymography of MMP2 and MMP9. Levels of MMP2 activity were unchanged. Data are means±SEM. **p = 0.01 (one-tailed t-test).
