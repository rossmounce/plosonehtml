                Figure 6.  Schematic representation of coordinated gene expression changes and signaling pathways activated in the hippocampus of cocaine abusers compared to age-matched and drug-free control subjects.The biological network was identified by incorporating the gene expression results into Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD). Oval-shaped symbols represent regulated transcripts, square symbols illustrate cellular or molecular functions and arrows denote some of their possible interactions. Upregulated transcripts are shown in red; purple illustrates downregulated genes. Matrix metalloproteinases (hexagonal symbol, center) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade numerous extracellular matrix proteins. MAP kinases and other essential kinases play roles in the expression of long-term potentiation. Many of the dysregulated genes associated with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling are involved in memory and learning processes. Changes in MMP9 activity are a requirement for remodeling of extracellular matrix cell adhesion molecules occurring with synaptic plasticity, which in turn is necessary for memory consolidation.
