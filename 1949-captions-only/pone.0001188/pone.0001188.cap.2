                Figure 2.  (A) Infectious Leptospira species produce a protein similar to L. interrogans LenD.Immunoblot of bacterial lysates using polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant L. interrogans serovar Pomona LenD. Lanes 1, 2, and 3 contained 0.5 Âµg of recombinant LenA, LenC, and LenD, respectively, demonstrating the specificity of the antiserum. Lanes 4-11 contained whole-cell lysates from several different species of Leptospira: (4) L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130; (5) L. interrogans serovar Pomona strain PO-01; (6) L. kirschneri; (7) L. noguchii; (8) L. santarosai; (9) L. borgpetersenii; (10) L. weilii; (11) L. biflexa. Locations of molecular size standards (in kDa) are shown to the left. Note that the recombinant LenD protein includes a fusion partner and is not lipidated, so exhibits a different mobility than do the native proteins. (B) LenD localizes to the L. interrogans outer membrane, as assessed by Triton X-114 extraction. L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni LI-130 whole-cell lysate (lane W), the aqueous fraction (lane A, containing periplasmic proteins), the insoluble pellet (lane P, containing cytoplasmic cylinders and intact bacteria) and the detergent fraction (lane D, containing outer membrane proteins) were subjected to immunoblot using polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against LenD and FlaA1, a component of the inner membrane-associated endoflagella.
