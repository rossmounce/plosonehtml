                Figure 4.  LenB binds human factor H. Ligand affinity blot analyses of recombinant LenB, with recombinant LenA and B. burgdorferi ErpC proteins included as positive controls [71].Carbonic anhydrase, soybean trypsin inhibitor and lysozyme were loaded onto the same lane and served as both negative controls and molecular mass standards. Positions of those standards are indicated to the left of the panel (in kDa).
