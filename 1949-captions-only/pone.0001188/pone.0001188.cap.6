(A) Saturable laminin binding by LenB compared to the weaker binding by LenA. Average of two independent experiments (bars equal 1 standard deviation), as representative of additional assays performed with different preparations of Len proteins. Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between LenA and LenB are indicated by asterisks The mean K<sub>d</sub> for LenB binding is 118 +/− 39 nM (n = 4). (B) Laminin binding by LenA and LenB is dependent on ionic strength. (C) Heparin competes with LenA and LenB for laminin binding. The activity of 1 µM LenA was measured with heparin added to the binding buffer. The higher avidity of LenB was challenged by preincubation of laminin with heparin prior to adding 0.25 µM LenB plus varying concentrations of heparin.</p>
