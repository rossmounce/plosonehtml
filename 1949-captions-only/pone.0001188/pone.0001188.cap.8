                Figure 8.  ELISA results of LenA and LenB interactions with fibronectin or its proteolytic fragments.(A) Saturable binding of LenB to intact fibronectin, with calculated Kd 106±8 nM (means and standard deviations from three experiments). Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between LenA and LenB binding are indicated with asterisks. (B) Binding of fibronectin by LenB is not affected by heparin. Fibronectin was preincubated with heparin, then binding by 1 µM LenB was analyzed in the presence of additional heparin. (C) Interaction with the 70-kDa N-terminal fragment of fibronectin (70 kDa) can account for complete LenB binding to intact fibronectin (Fn). (D) High avidity binding of LenB to the NTD of fibronectin, with calculated Kd 69.5 nM (means and ranges from two experiments). LenB did not appreciably bind the fibronectin GBD.
