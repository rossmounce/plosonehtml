                Figure 2.  Frequencies of binned RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans orthologs of B. malayi targets.Observed frequencies were all statistically over- or under-represented relative to expected frequency in the whole genome based on a hypergeometric distribution (P values&lt;1e-3). The entire set of observed values was statistically different from the background (expected) values as measured by a G-test (two sided P value = 5.9e-21).
