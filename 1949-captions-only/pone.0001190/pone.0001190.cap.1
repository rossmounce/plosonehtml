<h4>Influenza A virus sequence data collection and processing</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>A dataset of influenza A protein sequences annotated with isolate name, country and year of isolation, host organism, subtype, and protein name, was derived from all available sequences (as of September 2006) from the NCBI GenBank and GenPept databases, including entries mirrored from the UniProt database. Collection and cleaning of a total of 85,873 records was performed the Aggregator of Biological Knowledge (ABK) <a href="#pone.0001190-Miotto1">[64]</a>, which applied structural and semantic rules to automate the aggregation and annotation task. The final set of 36,343 protein sequences was manually verified by two independent curators. Most human influenza subtypes were represented by more than 100 sequences of each viral protein, the count varying depending on the protein. The H1N2 subtype had a lower number of sequences (ranging from 22 to 66) because of its recent emergence <a href="#pone.0001190-Cox1">[65]</a>. Separate multiple sequence alignments of the 11 proteins were carried out with MUSCLE 3.6 <a href="#pone.0001190-Edgar1">[66]</a>. Because of the great variability exhibited by the HA and NA proteins, separate alignments were obtained for each subtype (16 subtypes for HA and 9 for NA). The subtype alignments were subsequently merged using the MUSCLE tool, to obtain the final HA and NA alignments. The introduction of gaps in the resulting alignments was minimized by merging sequences based on sequence similarity between subtypes, as reported in phylogenetic studies <a href="#pone.0001190-Obenauer1">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001190-Fouchier1">[67]</a>. The in-house developed Antigenic Variability Analyser tool (AVANA) was subsequently used to extract alignments of several subsets of the collected sequences, based on annotation values, such as viral subtype, host, and year of isolation.</p>


<h4>Information entropy analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The diversity of the influenza A virus proteome was studied by creating subsets of the influenza A protein sequence alignments, comprising (1) avian sequences, subdivided into 3 decades (1977–1986, 1987–1996, and 1997–2006); (2) H5N1 viruses, subdivided into avian and human isolates; (3) circulating human subtypes, namely H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2. Assuming that each sequence represents an independent isolate, the information entropy methodology <a href="#pone.0001190-Shannon1">[68]</a> was used to measure the variability of influenza A virus proteomes in the context of overlapping nine-amino acid peptides spanning the length of each influenza A protein. The rationale of this selection was the length of peptides that are bound by HLA molecules for presentation to T-cell receptors, typically from 8–20 amino acids, with nine amino acids being the predominant length of class I peptides and the core of class II peptides <a href="#pone.0001190-Rammensee2">[69]</a>. Applying Shannon's formula <a href="#pone.0001190-Shannon1">[68]</a>, the nonamer peptide entropy <em>H</em>(<em>x)</em> at any given position <em>x</em> in the alignment is computed by<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001190.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where <em>p</em>(<em>i</em>,<em>x</em>) is the probability of a particular nonamer variant <em>i</em> being centered at position <em>x</em>. The entropy value increases with <em>n</em>(<em>x</em>), the total number of variants observed at position <em>x</em>; it is also sensitive to the relative frequency of the variants, such that it decreases when one variant is clearly dominant (<em>i.e.</em> the position is conserved). Only sequences that contain a valid amino acid at position <em>x</em> were used for the entropy computation, and alignment gaps were ignored. Although gaps tend to occur in high-diversity regions, proteins that have a high fraction of gaps have reduced statistical support, yielding an artificially low entropy value; for this reason, positions where more than 50% of sequences contained a gap were discarded. Because of the statistical nature of the entropy measure, both complete protein sequences and shorter fragments were used in this computation.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>In theory, nonamer entropy values can range from 0, a completely conserved nonamer sequence in all proteins analyzed, to 2<sup>9</sup>; in practice, however, the upper bound is very much lower for alignments of closely related sequences. For finite-size sets of sequences, entropy computations are affected by the sequence count in the alignment. The effects of alignment size bias are especially noticeable for alignments containing fewer than about 100 sequences, and must be accounted for when making direct comparisons between sequence alignments of different sizes. It has been shown that, for an alignment of <em>N</em> sequences, alignment size bias is proportional to 1/<em>N</em> <a href="#pone.0001190-Paninski1">[70]</a>. This relationship allows a correction for size bias by applying to each alignment a statistical adjustment that estimates entropy values for an infinitely-sized alignment with analogous variant distribution. To obtain such estimate, the alignment was repeatedly randomly sampled to create smaller alignments of varying size, whose entropy was measured. At each alignment position, the entropy of these subset alignments of size <em>N</em> was plotted against 1/<em>N,</em> using a linear regression to extrapolate the entropy estimate for <em>N</em>→∞. The regression's coefficient of determination (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup>) was used as a goodness-of-fit of the resulting estimate, confirming the validity of our method (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.9 in most cases). In this study, size bias correction was applied to all entropy calculations, so that alignment sequence counts could be ignored in comparisons. All entropy values reported are therefore infinite-size set estimates, rather than the values directly computed from the alignments.</p>


<h4>Conserved influenza A virus sequences</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Collected and cleaned influenza A virus records were grouped based on (a) subtype: the circulating human subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H1N2), H5N1, and other subtypes in avian reservoir; (b) host: human and avian; and (c) year of isolation. The method gave equal weight to all groups and obviated the problem of particular groups being over-represented (such as human H3N2). Six subgroups were derived: (1) human H1N1, (2) human H3N2, (3) human H1N2, (4) human H5N1, (5) avian H5N1, and (6) other avian subtypes. The eleven influenza A proteins of each subgroups were individually aligned using MUSCLE 3.6 <a href="#pone.0001190-Edgar1">[66]</a>. The AVANA tool was used to select nonamers with conservation of ≥80% in each alignment. The minimum length of a conserved sequence was nine amino acids and conserved contiguous nonamers were joined as a single sequence. A consensus sequence (the most frequent sequence) for each conserved sequence in the alignments was generated for each of the 6 subgroups. Corresponding consensus sequences of the subgroups were then aligned and those sequences that were identical in each of the six subgroups and present in at least 80% of all recorded viruses were selected as the highly conserved sequences.</p>


<h4>HLA supertype-restricted T-cell epitopes</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>The <em>in silico</em> prediction of HLA supertype-restricted HLA class I and class II T-cell epitope sequences in the conserved region<em>s</em> was performed through four computational systems: NetCTL MULTIPRED, ARB, and TEPITOPE. The NetCTL 1.2 algorithm <a href="#pone.0001190-Larsen1">[25]</a> (<a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL/</a>) predicts peptides restricted to 12 HLA class I supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58 and B62), integrated with predictions of HLA binding, proteasomal C-terminal cleavage and transport efficiency by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules. HLA binding and proteasomal cleavage predictions are performed by an artificial neural networks (ANN) method and TAP transport efficiency is predicted using a weight matrix method. The parameters used for NetCTL prediction were: 0.15 weight on C terminal cleavage (default), 0.05 weight on TAP transport efficiency (default), and 0.5 threshold for HLA supertype binding.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>The Average Relative Binding (ARB) matrix binding prediction method (<a href="http://epitope.liai.org:8080/matrix/matrix_prediction.jsp">http://epitope.liai.org:8080/matrix/matr​ix_prediction.jsp</a>) <a href="#pone.0001190-Bui1">[27]</a> is allele specific and estimates a matrix of coefficients based upon the association of each of the 20 amino acids at each possible position along the peptide sequence. In this study the data were selected for representative alleles within studied supertypes and predictions are shown for 8 HLA class I alleles of the supertypes A1 (A*0101), A2 (A*0201), A3 (A*0301), A24 (A*2402), A26 (A*2601), B7 (B*0702), and B44 (B*4402, B*4403).</p>

Hidden Markov model (HMM) and ANN methods are the predictive engines with sum thresholds of: A2, 31.33 (ANN; SN = 0.80 and SP = 0.83) and 47.08 (HMM; SN = 0.80 and SP = 0.78); A3, 24.53 (ANN; SN = 0.90 and SP = 0.95) and 37.58 (HMM; SN = 0.80 and SP = 0.87); and DR, 23.42 (ANN; SN = 0.90 and SP = 0.92) and 51.08 (HMM; SN = 0.90 and SP = 1.00). TEPITOPE predicts 25 HLA class II (DR) alleles are HLA allele-specific; however, sequences predicted to bind to ≥5 alleles were considered supertypic.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4"></a><p>The TEPITOPE software <a href="#pone.0001190-Bian1">[24]</a> (2000 beta version; obtained by the courtesy of J. Hammer) utilizes quantitative matrix-based motifs, obtained from experimental scanning of the binding of P1-anchored designer peptides to soluble HLA-DR molecules in <em>in-vitro</em> competition assays, to predict peptides binding to 25 common HLA-DR alleles (DRB1*0101, *0102, *0301, *0401, *0402, *0404, *0405, *0410, *0421, *0701, *0801, *0802, *0804, *0806, *1101, *1104, *1106, *1107, *1305, *1307, *1311, *1321, *1501, *1502 and DRB5*0101). The parameters for TEPITOPE predictions were: 5% quantitative threshold and putative determinants with a 10-fold inhibitory residue excluded. Predictions were performed for all 25 HLA-DR alleles and nonamer core peptides predicted to bind &gt;5 HLA-DR alleles were selected as supertype-restricted.</p>


<h4>Experimentally identified influenza A T-cell epitopes</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>T-cell epitope sequences within the conserved sequences were identified by matching the highly conserved sequences and the curated influenza epitope sequences obtained from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (<a href="http://www.immuneepitope.org/">www.immuneepitope.org/</a>) <a href="#pone.0001190-Peters1">[71]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001190-Peters2">[72]</a>. These epitope sequences data were derived from reported HLA binding assays (IC50≤500 nM) or T-cell assays that included <sup>51</sup>Cr release, HLA tetramer staining, and ELISPOT assays. Only epitope data from unique sequences and containing HLA restriction information were included.</p>

<h4>Avian and human influenza A virus isolates</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>The collected and cleaned influenza A virus protein sequences were catalogued in two groups. The recently circulating (1997–2006) influenza A viruses, both avian and human comprising 25,812 sequences of the 11 influenza proteins, both full- and partial-length, from human H1N1 (2,466 sequences), H3N2 (12,199), H1N2 (405), H5N1 (1,055), avian H5N1 (4,361), and all other avian subtypes except H5N1 (5,326) (<a href="#pone-0001190-t001">Table 1</a>). There were over 100 sequences of each protein of every virus with exceptions for the most recent human viruses, H1N2 and H5N1, and the PB1-F2 protein. The second group comprised an additional 10,531 sequences of human H1N1 and H3N2 isolated prior to 1997, and all avian viruses isolated from 1977 to 1986, and 1987 to 1996 (<a href="#pone-0001190-t002">Table 2</a>). The H1N2 sequences before 1997 were excluded because the number of sequences that were available for analysis was insufficient.</p>
