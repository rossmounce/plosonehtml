                Figure 6.  Highly conserved sequences of influenza A viruses in human H1N1, H3N2, H1N2, H5N1, avian H5N1, and other avian subtypes circulating between 1997 and 2006.A region in the viral proteome is considered as highly conserved when it has identical sequence conservation of at least 9 contiguous amino acids in 80% or more of the protein sequences of the analyzed dataset. The index of virus colored symbol is as shown at the top of the figure.
