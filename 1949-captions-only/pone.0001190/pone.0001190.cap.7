Only conserved sequences containing predicted alleles are shown. NetCTL predicts all of the listed class I supertypes; MULTIPRED predictions cover A2 and A3; and ARB predicts each of the class I except B8, B27, B39, B58, and B62. Predictions of HLA class II supertypes by MULTIPRED AND TEPITOPE is described in Materials and <a href="#s2">Methods</a>.</p>
