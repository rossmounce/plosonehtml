                Figure 7.  Highly conserved sequences of influenza A viruses and their predicted HLA class I and II supertype-restricted T-cell epitopes by NetCTL, ARB, TEPITOPE, and MULTIPRED systems.The color symbols corresponding to the prediction systems are as shown at the top of the figure. Only conserved sequences containing predicted alleles are shown. NetCTL predicts all of the listed class I supertypes; MULTIPRED predictions cover A2 and A3; and ARB predicts each of the class I except B8, B27, B39, B58, and B62. Predictions of HLA class II supertypes by MULTIPRED AND TEPITOPE is described in Materials and Methods.
