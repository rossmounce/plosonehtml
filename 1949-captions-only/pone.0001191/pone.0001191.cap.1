                Figure 1.  Schematic view of the experimental set up for in-vivo translation of light into an MR-image.The laser pulses are projected onto the pigment-treated animal placed inside the MRI magnet. The illuminated display is physiologically translated in the tissue into a chemical signature and reproduced as an image on the MRI monitor.
