                Figure 1.  (a) Ex vivo pD2 and pD3/4 tetramer staining of PBMC from patient BC307.Freshly thawed cryopreserved PBMCs from BC307 were stained with A11 pD3/4 and pD2 tetramers and CD8 antibody. The plots are gated on CD8 positive lymphocytes. The majority of cells in the acute sample (left) are specific for pD3/4 but there is a significant population cross-reactive with this and pD2. The convalescent sample (right) shows only pD3/4 specific cells. (b,c,d) Highly cross-reactive T cells can be expanded from acute but not convalescent PBMC from dengue patients. Short term CTL lines were generated by pulsing PBMC with 2 ÂµM of pD2 and stained with pD2 and pD3/4 tetramers on either the 14th (BC307) or 20th (MD856, MD893) day after stimulation. The highly cross-reactive populations apparent in the acute sample are not detectable in the convalescent sample taken one month later when more serotype specific populations have appeared.
