                Figure 2.  Highly cross-reactive CTL are more activated than partially cross-reactive CTL.Frozen PBMC from patient BC307 on day 21 of illness were stained with pD1 and pD3/4 tetramers together with CD38 and CD8. (a) CD38 staining of the whole CD8+ population acutely and at day 21. (b) Lymphocytes gated on CD8+ cells and co-stained with pD1 and pD3/4 tetramers. Highly cross-reactive cells (R7) show higher levels of expression of CD38 (d) than partially cross-reactive cells (c).
