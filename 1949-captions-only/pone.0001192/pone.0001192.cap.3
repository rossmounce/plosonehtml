                Figure 3.  Clones differ in specificity and cytolytic efficacy in chromium-release assays.(a) Summary of clones giving the patient from whom they were generated and the variants of the dengue GTS epitope recognised by each. Peptide recognition is classified by the percentage of specific lysis of B cells loaded with 0.1 µM of peptide in a standard chromium release assay. +++ 50% or greater lysis, ++ between 20 and 50% lysis, + less than 20% lysis, − no lysis. Cross-reactive clones (b) varied in the extent to which they recognised the epitope variants on pulsed B-cells in CTL lysis assays. Serotype specific clones (c) recognising pD2 were generated from patient MD1413 and those recognising pD3/4 from patient BC307 – all showed less lytic effect at low peptide concentrations than cross-reactive clones.
