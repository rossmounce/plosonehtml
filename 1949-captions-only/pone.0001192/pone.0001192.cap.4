                Figure 4.  Most cross-reactive clones show significantly better staining with CD8-null tetramers than serotype-specific clones.Clones were stained with CD8-null and wild-type A11 tetramers refolded with the DEN3 variant of the GTS epitope. Cross-reactive clones (a) generally showed a smaller drop in fluorescent intensity than DEN3 specific clones which showed much poorer staining with the CD8-null tetramer than with the wild-type (b). The exception was cross-reactive clone 10H5 which showed negligible binding to pD3/4 CD8-null tetramer. No clones showed significant background staining with an unrecognised tetramer (c). pD3/4 tetramer dissociates more rapidly from serotype specific clone D9 than cross-reactive clones E5 or 9F5 (d) in a tetramer dissociation assay.
