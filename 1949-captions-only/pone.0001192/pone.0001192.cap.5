Cross-reactive clones produced slightly higher levels of each cytokine when stimulated with pD1 or pD3/4 than with pD2. Only pD2 data is shown here to allow comparison of the cross-reactive response with the DEN2 specific clones. (b) Cytokines produced by cross-reactive (E5, C48) and DEN3-specific (D9) clones derived from patient BC307 stimulated with B cells pulsed with 1 micM pD3/4 at an E:T ratio of 10:1. pD2 consistently resulted in a lower level of effector function than the same stimulation with pD1 or pD3/4. Black bar: peptide pulsed B cells, white bar: RPMI control pulsed B cells. Data is representative of three experiments. (c, d) IFN-γ and TNF-α production by clones E5 and D9 at an E:T ratio of 5:1. Both produce similar quantities when stimulated by cognate peptide at high concentrations. At lower concentrations cross-reactive clone E5 produces up to 4 times more IFN-γ than serotype specific D9. A similar phenomenon is seen with GM-CSF (data not shown). This figure is representative of three independent experiments.</p>
