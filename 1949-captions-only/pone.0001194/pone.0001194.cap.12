                Figure 12.  Heatmap obtained with clusters with p-values&lt;0.05.Each column in the heatmap corresponds to a spectrum, each row to a cluster (or a potential biomarker), and each cell to a peak, with the colour indicating intensity of expression (green: low expression, red: high expression). Related spectra are sorted and grouped according to similarity, resulting in the dendrogram. The length of a branch is inversely proportional to the relatedness of the spectra. Average normalised mass (m/z) of the 4 clusters with p-values&lt;0.05 are indicated on the right of the heatmap.
