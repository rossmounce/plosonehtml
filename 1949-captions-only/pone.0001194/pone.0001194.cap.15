                Figure 15.  Hybrid SDS-PAGE venom profiles from snakes captured in Hérault (code no. 34) and Haute-Garonne (code no. 31).Venoms 504, 505, and 509 from Hérault, 459 from Haute-Garonne, Vaz-type venoms 508, 516, 519, 527, 528 from Hautes-Pyrénées and Vaa-type venom 303 from Loire-Atlantique were separated by a 20% SDS-PAGE under denaturating and reducing condtitions. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. Arrows indicate protein bands specifically found in Vaa venoms.
