                Figure 4.  Selective capture of PLA2 using SELDI ProteinChip Array.Individual venoms (2.5 µg) were applied to the surface of a WCX2 ProteinChip as described in the Methods section. Unbound proteins and interfering substances were washed away and matrix was added and allowed to dry. The captured proteins were detected using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Normalised mass (m/z) for each peak (in Daltons (Da)) is demonstrated on the X-axis, while intensity (μA) is plotted on the Y-axis. m/z ratios from different spectra that are within 0.2% of each other are considered as potentially the same protein.
