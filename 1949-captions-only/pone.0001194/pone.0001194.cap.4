Unbound proteins and interfering substances were washed away and matrix was added and allowed to dry. The captured proteins were detected using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Normalised mass (m/z) for each peak (in Daltons (Da)) is demonstrated on the X-axis, while intensity (μA) is plotted on the Y-axis. m/z ratios from different spectra that are within 0.2% of each other are considered as potentially the same protein.</p>
