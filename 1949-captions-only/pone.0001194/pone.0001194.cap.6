                Figure 6.  PLA2 analysis by SELDI and SDS-PAGE.A) Vaa and Vaz PLA2 fractions isolated from pooled venoms as shown in Figure 5 were spotted on WCX2 ProteinChips. Normalised mass (m/z) for each peak (in Daltons (Da)) is demonstrated on the X-axis, while intensity (Î¼A) is plotted on the Y-axis. B) Venoms 406 and 508 were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 20% homogeneous acrylamide gel under reducing conditions. N-terminal and internal sequences were determined as described in the Material and Methods section.
