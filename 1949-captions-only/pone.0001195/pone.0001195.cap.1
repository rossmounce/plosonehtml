Marker genes of each candidate subclass in A (A<em><sub>i</sub></em>) are selected, and mapped onto a gene list ranked according to their differential expression with respect to a subclass of B (B<em><sub>j</sub></em>). Their over-representation at the top of the ranking is evaluated using the enrichment score (ES<sub>A<em>i</em>B<em>j</em></sub>), and significance is assessed as a nominal p-value, p<sub>A<em>i</em>B<em>j</em></sub>, by randomly permuting sample class labels in B. This process is repeated by interchanging the role of A and B to compute ES<sub>B<em>j</em>A<em>i</em></sub> and p<sub>B<em>j</em>A<em>i</em></sub>. (b) Mutual enrichment information, p<sub>A<em>i</em>B<em>j</em></sub> and p<sub>B<em>j</em>A<em>i</em></sub>, are combined using the Fisher inverse chi-square statistic, <em>F<sub>ij</sub></em>. Its significance is estimated based on a null distribution for the <em>F<sub>ij</sub></em> generated by randomly picking the nominal-p from corresponding null distributions for ES<sub>A<em>i</em>B<em>j</em></sub> and ES<sub>B<em>j</em>A<em>i</em></sub>. After multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) correction, p-values for <em>F<sub>ij</sub></em> are summarized in the subclass association (SA) matrix. Clustering of the SA matrix reveals subclasses common to A and B.</p>
