                Figure 2.  Example 1: Multiple tissue types.(a) SubMap was applied to two data sets, Multi-A and Multi-B, containing multiple tissue types: breast (Br), prostate (Pr), lung (Lu), and colon (Co). Bonferroni-corrected p-values for breast, prostate, lung, and colon tissues were 0.002, 0.002, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively. (b) Each tissue type in Multi-B was removed before applying SubMap. Only subsets of the same tissue type were significantly associated (Bonferoni-corrected p&lt;0.05). The p-values for “Multi-A-Br and Multi-B-Lu (left-upper)”, “Multi-A-Lu and Multi-B-Br (left-bottom)”, and “Multi-A-Co and Multi-B-Br (right-bottom)” are 0.330, 0.547, and 0.517, respectively
