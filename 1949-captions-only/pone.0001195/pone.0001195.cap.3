                Figure 3.  Example 2: Common subtypes of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).SubMap was applied for three subclasses of DLBCL pre-determined in DLBCL-A and DLBCL-B data sets. Bonferroni-corrected p-values for “oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)”, “B-cell response (BCR)”, and “host response (HR)” subtypes were 0.008, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively. The association for the pair of DLBCL-A-BCR and DLBCL-B-OxPhos was not significant (p = 0.362).
