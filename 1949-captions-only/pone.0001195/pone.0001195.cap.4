(b) Subclass association (SA) matrix for Breast-A and Breast-B. Bonferroni-corrected p-values for the combinations of “A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>”, “A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>“, “A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>1</sub>”, “A<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>1</sub>”, and “A<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>3</sub>” were 0.070, 0.002, 0.023, 0.001, and 0.055, respectively (FDR-corrected p-values of 0.014, 0.001, 0.008, 0.001, and 0.014, respectively). *: ER status is missing for one case.</p>
