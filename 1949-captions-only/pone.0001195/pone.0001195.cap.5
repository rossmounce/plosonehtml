                Figure 5.  Example 4: Survival prediction in Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) data sets.(a) Subclass association (SA) matrix for the comparison between DLBCL-C and DLBCL-D data sets. Bonferroni-corrected p-values for the pairs of “C3 and D2” and “C4 and D3” were 0.002 and 0.002, respectively, (b) Survival prediction models were built using DLBCL-C and applied to DLBCL-D. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the predicted groups in DLBCL-D are shown. Left: Prediction model was trained using all cases in DLBCL-C (n = 58), and tested on all cases in DLBCL-D (n = 129). Middle: Survival prediction using only cases from “matched” subclasses. Model was trained using C3 ∪ C4 samples (n = 25) and tested in D2 ∪ D3 (n = 61). The survival separation was better than that in the left panel in spite of having fewer samples. Right: survival prediction using only cases from “unmatched” subclasses. Model was trained using C1 ∪ C2 (n = 33) and tested in D1 ∪ D4 (n = 68). The numbers of events were 61, 22, and 39 for all (D1 ∪ D2 ∪ D3 ∪ D4), “matched” (D2 ∪ D3), and “unmatched” (D1 ∪ D4) patients, respectively. p-values were calculated using the log-rank test. DFS: disease free survival.
