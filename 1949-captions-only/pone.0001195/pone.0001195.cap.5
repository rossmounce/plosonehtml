Bonferroni-corrected p-values for the pairs of “C<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>” and “C<sub>4</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>” were 0.002 and 0.002, respectively, (b) Survival prediction models were built using DLBCL-C and applied to DLBCL-D. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the predicted groups in DLBCL-D are shown. Left: Prediction model was trained using all cases in DLBCL-C (n = 58), and tested on all cases in DLBCL-D (n = 129). Middle: Survival prediction using only cases from “matched” subclasses. Model was trained using C<sub>3</sub> ∪ C<sub>4</sub> samples (n = 25) and tested in D<sub>2</sub> ∪ D<sub>3</sub> (n = 61). The survival separation was better than that in the left panel in spite of having fewer samples. Right: survival prediction using only cases from “unmatched” subclasses. Model was trained using C<sub>1</sub> ∪ C<sub>2</sub> (n = 33) and tested in D<sub>1</sub> ∪ D<sub>4</sub> (n = 68). The numbers of events were 61, 22, and 39 for all (D<sub>1</sub> ∪ D<sub>2</sub> ∪ D<sub>3</sub> ∪ D<sub>4</sub>), “matched” (D<sub>2</sub> ∪ D<sub>3</sub>), and “unmatched” (D<sub>1 </sub>∪ D<sub>4</sub>) patients, respectively. p-values were calculated using the log-rank test. DFS: disease free survival.</p>
