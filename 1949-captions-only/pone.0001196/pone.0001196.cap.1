Each infusion step was primed with a bolus. Blood glucose was monitored every 5â€“10 min between minute 0 and minute 180, and a variable glucose infusion was titrated to maintain euglycemia (blood glucose 5 mmol/l). Cerebrocortical activity was measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the baseline period and during the last 30 minutes of each insulin infusion step. In the control experiment, a comparable volume of saline solution (S) was infused instead of HI, D and glucose. The MEG measurement, glucose monitoring and blood sampling were performed analogously to the clamp experiments.</p>
