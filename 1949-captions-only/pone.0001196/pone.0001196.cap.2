Similar profiles of plasma/serum levels (Mean±SE) of human insulin and insulin detemir were achieved with both insulins. Approximately 98% of serum insulin detemir is bound to albumin. Therefore, total insulin detemir concentrations are substantially higher than human insulin concentrations at corresponding time points. Human insulin was determined by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) and insulin detemir by a modified radioimmunoassay (Capio Diagnostik, Copenhagen, Denmark). B: Blood glucose concentrations. Blood glucose was measured twice at baseline and every 5–10 minutes during the infusion of human insulin, insulin detemir or saline. Blood glucose concentrations were not different between the experiments at baseline (all p&gt;0.1) and did not change significantly during the experiments (all p&gt;0.2). C: Glucose infusion rates. In the saline experiment no glucose was infused. Despite much higher insulin detemir concentrations, the glucose infusion rate was lower in the detemir experiment, indicating a lower peripheral effect (1<sup>st</sup> step: insulin 11±1 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, insulin detemir 9±1 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, p = 0.01; 2<sup>nd</sup> step: insulin 36±3 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, insulin detemir 26±3 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, p = 0.003), as intended by the experimental protocol. D: Changes in beta activity during the experiments. During human insulin (HI) and saline (S) infusion, beta activity decreased slightly (p = 0.70, HI vs. S). During insulin detemir (D) infusion beta activity increased compared to HI (p = 0.001, repeated measures ANOVA, adjusted for multiple testing in all frequency bands).</p>
