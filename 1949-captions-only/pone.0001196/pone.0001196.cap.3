                Figure 3.  Insulin effects on beta activity in lean and overweight subjects.A: Comparison of the insulin detemir effect on beta activity with the effects human insulin in lean and overweight subjects. The figure shows beta activity from human insulin experiments in 12 lean and 34 overweight subjects and from insulin detemir experiments in 10 overweight subjects. Data from corresponding saline experiments have been subtracted. In the second step of the clamps beta activity was significantly higher in lean than in overweight subjects (p = 0.031) and higher with insulin detemir than with human insulin in overweight subjects (p = 0.040). B: Relationship between body-mass-index (BMI) and cerebral effects of insulin. The change in beta activity induced by human insulin (filled circles and open rhombs) was negatively correlated with BMI (r = âˆ’0.38, p = 0.0086) under hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamped conditions as previously published [15]. The open rhombs represent the data obtained from the insulin experiment of 10 overweight subjects who additionally participated in the insulin detemir experiment. The change in beta activity induced by insulin detemir infusion is shown as open squares. An arrow indicates the corresponding values of each subject and illustrates the enhancement of cerebrocortical action of insulin detemir compared to human insulin. To account for lower glucose disposal in the insulin detemir experiments, the effect of insulin detemir on beta activity has been multiplied with the individual ratio of the glucose infusion rates (GIRhuman insulin/GIRinsulin detemir).
