                Figure 1.  Differences in plasma concentrations between patients suffering from periodontitis (N = 80) and age-matched unaffected controls (N = 48).Boxes refer to the 25th (bottom) and 75th (up) percentiles and the median is the large horizontal line, fences refer to the 10th (lower) and 90th (upper) percentiles respectively. Open circles represent outliers whereas asterisks stand for extreme observations with the subject number. Statistical differences are computed with Mann-Whitney U-test.
