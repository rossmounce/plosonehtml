Subjects who received intensive periodontal therapy (open circles, N = 40) showed greater plasma concentrations of HSP10 at each time visit when compared to control therapy group subjects (filled circles, N = 40). No other changes were observed. Asterisks refer to statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.05) between groups as computed with analysis of covariance.</p>
