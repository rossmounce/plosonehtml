                Figure 1.  Cbf1 and Met31 sequence logos.Sequence logos were made as described in Materials and Methods. The height of each letter is proportional to the frequency of that base at that position. The height of the letter stack is the information content at that position. The cosine wave represents the helical twist of B-form DNA. The sequence logos were generated using the standard Delila programs [19], [21].
