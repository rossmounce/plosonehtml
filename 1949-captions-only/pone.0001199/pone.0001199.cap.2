We then ranked all genes in the genome based on the strength of their strongest upstream binding site, and we present here the corresponding expression changes as determined by microarrays. The experiments that each column represent correspond to those in <a href="#pone-0001199-g006">Fig. 6</a>. For columns 1–9 (marked with a gray box) we expect regulated genes to have increased expression and therefore to be red. For columns 10–13 (marked with a blue box) we expect regulated genes to have a decreased expression and therefore to be green. Since the Met31 matrix is asymmetric, it could bind with two different orientations. Those circles labeled “Met31” have the same orientation as the Met31 logo in <a href="#pone-0001199-g001">Fig. 1</a>. Those circles labeled “Inverted” have the opposite orientation (see <a href="#pone-0001199-g005">Fig. 5</a>). The optimal combination in the lower right corner allows for either orientation of Met31. The arrow signifies the gene start. The average expression change for the top 30 genes was calculated for each combination of sites for both the induced (columns 1 to 9) and repressed (column 10 to 13) experiments and are reported next to their respective columns.</p>
