A) We plotted the average expression change of the top 30 hits in the genome for different maximum spacings from the gene start. The top line corresponds to data from experiments where we expected increased expression (columns 1 to 9 in B), and the lower line is from experiments where we expected decreased expression (columns 10 to 13 in B). The microarray data that corresponds to our gene-ranking are shown in B. The conditions for each column in the microarrays correspond to the labeled columns in <a href="#pone-0001199-g006">Fig. 6</a>.</p>
