                Figure 4.  The optimal spacing range between Cbf1 and Met31 is 9 to 68 bases.We varied the minimum (X axis) and maximum (Y axis) distance that Cbf1 and Met31 could be from each other in our model, and calculated the average expression change within the corresponding top 30 hits, according to these ranges. We show here the average expression change for only those experiments that we expected to have a decreased expression (columns 10 to 13 in Fig. 6). The colors correspond to the key in lower portion of the plot.
