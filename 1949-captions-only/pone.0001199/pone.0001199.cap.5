                Figure 5.  The Met4 activation model based on our analysis.We summarize here the spacing, ordering, and orientation constraints we used to define functional Met4 binding sites. Since Met31 can bind with either orientation, we show logos for both Met31 orientations. The distances between each set of Cbf1 and Met31 sites were plotted with red boxes on a cosine wave for 23 high-ranking genes to show helical preferences. The arrow represents the translational start, and the allowed distance between the Met4 stabilization complex and the translational start is written above it. The expression data on the right is what was predicted by this model, and is described in Fig. 6.
