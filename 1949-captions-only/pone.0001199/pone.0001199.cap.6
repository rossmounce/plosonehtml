The first 9 columns are data for experiments that should induce the expression of Met4 regulated genes and give a red pattern. The last 4 columns we expect to see a decrease in expression of Met4 regulated genes and give a green pattern. Experiment information for each column is reported vertically above each column. Each row corresponds to a different gene followed by its common name, its flexible information (<em>R<sub>i</sub></em>), the coordinate of the Met31 binding site in the <em>S. cerevisiae</em> genome, the orientation of the Met31 matrix, the distance Cbf1 is upstream of Met31, the distance the gene start is downstream of Met31, the gene name according to its annotation in the yeast genome, and a description of its function.</p>
