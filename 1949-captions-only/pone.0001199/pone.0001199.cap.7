                Figure 7.  Ri vs. expression change.The flexible information (Ri) of the strongest site for each gene is on the abscissa and the average induction or repression expression change is on the ordinate. For each gene, induction data were averaged from the first nine experiments in Fig. 6 (red circles), and repression data were averaged from the last four experiments in Fig. 6 (black circles).
