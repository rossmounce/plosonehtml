B: cDNA Quantitation Upper: A typical yeast plasmid for cDNA expression, indicating the flanking targets (red) for PCR amplification. Lower: Comparison of transcriptional profiling to SPI. Both procedures generate biotinylated cRNAs using T7 RNA polymerase. In SPI, 30 cycles with the reverse primer are designed to yield linear single-stranded products, which are converted into a double-stranded copy in a single final step upon addition of the forward primer. C: GC Content of Subsets of cDNAs Having determined which of 933 cDNAs are detected on the microarrays, we subdivide the group into true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives. As shown, each group has nearly the same GC content. False negatives therefore are not due to difficulties in copying sequences of high GC content. D: Proportionality of Readout Two groups of 1000 strains were mixed in different proportions and then analyzed. The mean signal ratio between the groups is a near linear function of the relative DNA input, with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.986. The rectangular insert at the bottom of the figure represents the strategy of mixing different proportions of two pools of transformants.</p>
