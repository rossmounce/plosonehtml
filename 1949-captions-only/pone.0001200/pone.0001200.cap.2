                Figure 2.  Differential cDNA Enrichment and Depletion (Fold Change) Upon Growth Replicate data sets were used to calculate fold-enrichment for six comparisons (see Methods).In each case, the horizontal axis (gene index) displays all cDNAs in order of their relative fold change. A: Cells grown at 30°C in glucose vs the initial sample. B: Cells grown at 37°C in glucose vs the initial sample. C: Fold-changes (B) divided by fold-changes (A). D: Cells grown at 30°C in galactose vs 30°C in glucose. E: Cells grown at 37°C in galactose vs 37°C in glucose. F: Fold-changes (E) divided by fold-changes (D).
