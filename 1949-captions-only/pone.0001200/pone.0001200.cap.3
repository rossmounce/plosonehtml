                Figure 3.  Validations on Solid Media Five control strains (#1–3, 18–19) which show little or no SPI enrichment/depletion and 27 SPI extreme strains including representatives from Table 3 were streaked on glucose dropout plates (Glc: A) or galactose dropout plates (Gal: B) and allowed to grow at 30°C.Strains which show SPI depletion are in the inner circle, while strains which show enrichment are in the outer circle. Growth of all strains is comparable on the glucose plates. On the galactose plate, the colony sizes of the strains often parallels expectations, both for increases and decreases. Among those illustrated, the concordance is modest, but more extensive surveys raise it to ~80% (see text). The strains which do not conform to expectations could reflect differences between the requirements for growth in liquid vs solid media. The identities of the strains are given in Table 3. Strains #1–3 and #18–19 are controls whose SPI values range from −0.6 to 1.19
