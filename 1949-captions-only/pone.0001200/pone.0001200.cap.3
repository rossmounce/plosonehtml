Growth of all strains is comparable on the glucose plates. On the galactose plate, the colony sizes of the strains often parallels expectations, both for increases and decreases. Among those illustrated, the concordance is modest, but more extensive surveys raise it to ~80% (see text). The strains which do not conform to expectations could reflect differences between the requirements for growth in liquid vs solid media. The identities of the strains are given in <a href="#pone-0001200-t003">Table 3</a>. Strains #1–3 and #18–19 are controls whose SPI values range from −0.6 to 1.19</p>
