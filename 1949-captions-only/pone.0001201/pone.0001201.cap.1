                Figure 1.  Example of canonical and modified stimuli.The original image (Doryphoros by Polykleitos) is shown at the centre of the figure. This sculpture obeys to canonical proportion (golden ratio = 1:1.618). Two modified versions of the same sculpture are presented on its left and right sides. The left image was modified by creating a short legs:long trunk relation (ratio = 1:0.74); the right image by creating the opposite relation pattern (ratio = 1:0.36). All images were used in behavioral testing. The central image (judged-as-beautiful on 100%) and left one (judged-as-ugly on 64%) were employed in the fMRI study.
