                Figure 3.  Brain activation in the contrast canonical vs. modified stimuli.a, Main effect of canonical vs. modified sculptures across conditions rendered onto the MNI brain template. b, Parasagittal and coronal view showing activations of the right insular region in the main effect. c, Activity profile of the right insula. For each condition (O, AJ, PJ) the signal plots show the difference between canonical (C) minus modified (M) sculptures in arbitrary units (a.u), +/âˆ’ 10% confidence intervals (P-corrected&lt;0.05).
