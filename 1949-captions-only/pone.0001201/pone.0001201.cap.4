For each condition (O = observation, AJ = aesthetic judgment, PJ = proportion judgment) the signal plots show the difference between beautiful (B) minus ugly (U)-as judged sculptures in arbitrary units (a.u), +/− 10% confidence intervals. c, Statistical parametric maps rendered onto the MNI brain template showing activity within left somatomotor cortex in the contrast of ugly <em>vs.</em> beautiful stimuli averaged across the three conditions. d, Activity profile (ugly-beautiful) of the left motor cortex. For each condition (O, AJ, PJ) the signal plots show the difference between ugly (U) minus beautiful (B)-as judged sculptures in arbitrary units (a.u), +/− 10% confidence intervals (<em>P</em>-corrected&lt;0.05).</p>
