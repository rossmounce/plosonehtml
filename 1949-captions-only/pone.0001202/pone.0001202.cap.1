                Figure 1.  BCAS3 expression in human ES cells.Human ES cell cultures stained with (A) anti-BCAS3 antibody or (E) isotype control antibody and co-immunostained with (B, F) SSEA4. (C, G) show nuclei stained with DAPI. (D, H) are merged images of all three respective panels on their left. Arrows indicate nuclei of some feeder layer fibroblasts. (I) Flow cytometry analysis of human ES cells expressing Rudhira. Graphs show counts for Isotype control (shaded) and Rudhira positive (unshaded) cells. Scale bar: 50 Âµm.
