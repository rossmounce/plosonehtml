                Figure 2.  Expression of BCAS3 in embryoid bodies at day 8 of differentiation.Human EBs at day 8 of differentiation immunostained for (A, E, I) BCAS3 (green), (M) isotype control (green), (B) Vimentin (red) and (F, J, N) VEGFRII (red). (C, G, K, O) show nuclei stained with DAPI. (D, H, L, P) are merged images of respective panels to their left. Arrowheads indicate groups of cells expressing BCAS3. Arrows indicate (E–H) blood islands or (I–L) nascent vessels. Scale bar: 50 µm.
