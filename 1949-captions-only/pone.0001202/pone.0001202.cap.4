                Figure 4.  Expression of BCAS3 in embryoid bodies at day 14 of differentiation.Human EBs at day 14 of differentiation immunostained for (A, E, I, M) BCAS3 (green), (Q) isotype control (green), (B) PECAM (red) and (F, J, N, R) ICAM2 (red). (C, G, K, O, S) show nuclei stained with DAPI. (D, H, L, P, T) are merged images of respective panels to their left. Boxed area in (E–H) imaged at higher magnification shown in (I–L) respectively. Scale bar: (A, M, Q) 50 µm (E, I) 100 µm.
