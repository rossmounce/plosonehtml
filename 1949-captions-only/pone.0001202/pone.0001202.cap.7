                Figure 7.  BCAS3 expression in human brain lesions.(Aâ€“H) Cryosections immunostained for BCAS3 (green). Fluorescent image with DAPI (blue) marking the nucleus or DIC image of the same field is shown as indicated. Panels to the far right show adjacent sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. BCAS3 positive tumor cells are indicated by arrows and vessel cells by arrowheads. (I) Graph showing percent BCAS3-expressing cells in normal brain and tumor samples. Sample numbers indicated on X axis are described in Table 1.
