Fluorescent image with DAPI (blue) marking the nucleus or DIC image of the same field is shown as indicated. Panels to the far right show adjacent sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. BCAS3 positive tumor cells are indicated by arrows and vessel cells by arrowheads. (I) Graph showing percent BCAS3-expressing cells in normal brain and tumor samples. Sample numbers indicated on X axis are described in <a href="#pone-0001202-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
