                Figure 1.  Enriched GO BP terms for cDNAs representing positively regulated genes.Size of dots corresponds to the number of cDNAs that were tested (minimum = 6 and maximum = 1025) and color codes indicate tissue type. Only significant (Pâ‰¤0.01) GO-BP terms represented by 50 or more cDNAs on the array were included.
