                Figure 2.  KEGG pathways for cDNAs representing differently expressed genes across tissues.Size of dots corresponds to the number of cDNAs (minimum = 10 and maximum = 253) that were tested to have a positive influence on the expression levels and color codes indicate tissue type. Only significant (Pâ‰¤0.05) KEGG pathways represented by 50 or more cDNAs on the array were included.
