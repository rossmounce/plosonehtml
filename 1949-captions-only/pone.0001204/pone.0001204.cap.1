To disrupt cell conjugates, the collected cells were treated with 5 mM EDTA/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>-free PBS on ice for 30 min, vortexed, stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD56 mAbs, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSAria™). Dot plots on the left depict the total live-cell gate, and plots on the right show gating of mostly NK cells, as determined by FSC and SSC. Values represent the relative percentages of events occurring within each quadrant. Results shown are from a typical experiment out of &gt;10 performed in duplicates (data collected from ~10 000 single cell events). (b) Co-cultures of CD56+ PBL and B721−GFP-G12V cells were sorted by FACSAria™ into GFP-labeled (GFP<sup>high</sup>; upper panel) and unlabeled (GFP<sup>negative</sup>; lower panel) NK cells. Left and middle plots show the FSC/SSC gating strategy used to obtain these two NK cell populations, each composed of &gt;99% singlet-cell events. Values in the right plots represent the MFI of the green filter. Data are from a typical experiment out of &gt;5 performed.</p>
