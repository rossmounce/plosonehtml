The cells were collected and cytospun onto slides, fixed, stained with anti-CD45-phycoerythrin-Cy5 (red) mAbs, and then subjected to dual-image confocal microscopy (red for T cells; green for GFP). (g–i) Overlay of Nomarski and confocal green fluorescence of freshly isolated NK cells (* denotes smaller cells) co-cultured with B721−GFP-H-RasG12V (g, h) or with B721−GFP (i) larger green cells. (j) Green fluorescence image of a B721−GFP-G12V cell conjugated with two NK cells. The two insets depict the reconstituted Z scans. (k–m) Merged epifluorescence microscopy of red NK cells (CD45 phycoerythrin-Cy5+) and green B721 cells, co-cultured and processed as above. Panel k depicts B721−GFP-H-RasG12V conjugated with two NK cells that captured GFP-H-RasG12V and a non-conjugated NK cell that did not take up GFP. In panel l, in contrast, the NK cell conjugated with B721−GFP did not acquire any GFP. Panel m represents a sorted GFP-H-RasG12V<sup>high</sup> singlet-NK cell (as described in <a href="#pone-0001204-g001">Fig. 1b</a>) cytospun onto a slide. Arrows indicate GFP-H-RasG12V captured by the NK cells. Data are from a typical experiment out of &gt;5 performed.</p>
