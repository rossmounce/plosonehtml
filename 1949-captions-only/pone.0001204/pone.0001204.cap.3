                Figure 3.  GFP-H-RasG12V is also transferred from B721 cells into T cells.Fresh CD3+ PBLs isolated from healthy blood donors (upper panel) or CD4+HVS cells (lower panel) were co-cultured with B721−GFP cells (left panel) or B721−GFP-G12V (right panel) for 3 hours. Cells were collected and treated as described in figure 1a, stained with anti-CD3-allophycocyanin, and then analyzed by FACSCalibur™. Results represent a typical experiment out of &gt;10 independent experiments (data from ~10 000 single cell events).
