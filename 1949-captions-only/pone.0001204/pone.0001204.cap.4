The co-cultures were treated as indicated or left untreated. In the trans-well experiments, T cells were separated from B721 cells by a 0.4-µm-pore membrane. Acquisition of GFP-H-RasG12V by T cells under the different experimental conditions was then determined by FACS, as described in Methods. (b) The different cell types were co-cultured with B721−GFP-H-RasG12V for 3 h, and GFP acquisition by T cells was determined as above. The same cell types were co-cultured for 45 min with B721-transfectants at a ratio of 1:1, and the percentage of cell conjugates was then determined by FACS analysis (double-positive cells, as shown in inset). Experiments were performed in duplicates and repeated &gt;3 times. Data was from ~10,000 single cell events and the FlowJo V6.4.7 population comparison platform (probability binning Chi(T) algorithm) was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference observed between the indicated treatments and control group.
