                Figure 5.  The acquisition of oncogenic H-RAS at the IS results in ERK phosphorylation within the acquiring lymphocytes.(a–c) NK cells were co-cultured with B721−GFP-H-RasG12V for 2 hours. The collected cells were fixed/permeabilized, stained for intracellular pERK and analyzed by FACS. Dot plots a+b depict the careful gating strategy used to distinguish singlet NK cells (green) from duplets and B721 cells (blue), and dot plot c shows GFP-H-RasG12V vs. pERK levels. The NK population was divided into three subpopulations (red, dark green and bright green) according to their GFP content. Bold numbers indicate the MFI of pERK. Shown is a representative experiment out of the five performed (data from ~20,000 events). (d) T and NK lymphocytes from various co-cultures of B721-GFP-H-RasG12V (G12V) or B721-GFP (GFP) were either isolated using the MACS® cell separation system or sorted (as described in Fig. 1b) into GFP-H-RasG12Vhigh and GFP-H-RasG12Vlow cells. The cells were then lysed and pERK levels were determined by ELISA. Total pERK levels in lysates of B721-H-RasG12V relative to B721-GFP were also determined in parallel as controls for test performance (inset). Assays were performed in duplicates and bars represent the mean±SD from a typical experiment out of &gt;5 performed. (e) NK cells were co-cultured with B721 cells stably expressing either GFP-H-RasG12V, GFP-H-Ras(wt) or GFP for 2 hours. The upper overlay histogram depicts total pERK levels within GFP-H-RasG12Vhigh NK cells compared to control NK cells. The middle overlay histogram compares total p-ERK levels in NK cells co-cultured with B721-GFP versus control NK cells. The lower overlay histogram shows p-ERK levels within GFP-H-Ras(wt)+ NK cells compared to control NK cells. (f) NK cells were co-cultured with HEK293 transfected with either GFP-H-RasG12V or GFP-tH constructs for 2 hours. The overlay histograms depict total p-ERK levels within GFPhigh NK cells in the two co-cultures (red lines) compared to control NK cells (green lines). The FlowJo V6.4.7 population comparison platform was used to calculate %Positive cells found in the sample compared to control (super enhanced D-Max algorithm), and the probability binning Chi(T) algorithm was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference between samples (P value).
