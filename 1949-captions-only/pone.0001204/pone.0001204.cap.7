Next, the various B721 transfectants were distributed into U-bottom 96-well plates to which the NK cells were added to obtain different effector to target ratios. The percentage of cell lysis was measures by flow cytometry by computing the relative number of viable (unlysed) GFP+ target cells, as determined by propidium iodide exclusion (see <a href="#s3">Materials and Methods</a> for further details). Assays were performed in triplicates and data points represent meanÂ±SD (error bars). This result is representative of four independent experiments.</p>
