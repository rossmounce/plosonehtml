G93A mice at about 13 weeks of age showed initial signs of disease such as weight loss and reduced hindlimb extension. Terminal stage of disease was observed at 17â€“18 weeks of age, as demonstrated by complete hindlimb paralysis, significant reduction of body weight and absence of hindlimb extension. Arrows indicate the age of mice when euthanatasia was performed. The five pointed star in A indicates difference (p = 0.06) in body weights between G93A mice at 13 weeks of age and 18 weeks of age; the four pointed star indicates a significant difference (p = 0.007) in body weights between G93A and C57BL/6J mice at 18 weeks of age. The four pointed star in B indicates a significant difference in extension reflex (p&lt;0.001) between G93A mice at 13 weeks of age and 18 weeks of age.</p>
