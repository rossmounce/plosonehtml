                Figure 10.  Immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells (CD146) and astrocytes (GFAP) in the lumbar spinal cord of G93A mice at early and late stages of disease.(A, B, C) Similar to cervical spinal cord, endothelial cells (green, arrowheads) and astrocytes (red, asterisk) in C57BL/6J mice at 19–20 weeks of age appeared normal. In G93A mice at (D, E) early or (F, G) end-stage of disease, decreased CD146 antigen expression by endothelial cells (green, arrowheads) was observed. Note: increased astrocyte activation in the lumbar spinal cord (F, G, asterisks) was detected in G93A mice at late stage of disease. The nuclei in A, C, D, and F are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in A, C, D, F is 50 µm; B, E, G is 25 µm.
