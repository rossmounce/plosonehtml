In G93A mice, numerous motor neurons with vacuolization (asterisks) were found at (C) 13 weeks of age and (D) decreased numbers of motor neurons were noted in 17–18 week old mice. Motor neurons of various sizes displayed vacuolization (asterisks). Scale bar on left side is 200 µm, right side is 50 µm.</p>
