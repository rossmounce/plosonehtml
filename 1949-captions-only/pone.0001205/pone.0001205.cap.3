                Figure 3.  Motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of G93A mice at early and late stage of disease (cresyl violet staining).In the lumbar spinal cord, C57BL/6J mice at (A) 12–13 weeks of age and (B) 19–20 weeks of age showed numerous motor neurons with strong Nissl body staining. Most degenerated or swollen motor neurons (asterisks) were found in G93A mice at (C) early (13 weeks of age) and (D) late (17–18 weeks of age) stages of disease; most surviving motor neurons were small. Scale bar on left side is 200 µm, right side is 50 µm.
