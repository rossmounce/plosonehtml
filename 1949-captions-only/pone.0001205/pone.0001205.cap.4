                Figure 4.  Evans Blue fluorescence in the cervical spinal cord of G93A mice at early and late stages of disease.In the cervical spinal cord, EB was clearly detected within the blood vessels (red, arrowheads) in the control C57BL/6J mice at (A, B, C) 12–13 weeks of age or (D, E) in the lumen of vessels (brilliant green) at 19–20 weeks of age. In G93A mice, vascular leakage of EB (red, arrows) was detected (F, G) at early (13 weeks of age) disease symptoms and (H, I, J) at end-stage of disease (17–18 weeks of age) when more EB extravasation was seen. Arrowheads in F and I indicate vessel permeability. Scale bar in A–J is 25 µm.
