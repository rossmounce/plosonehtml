EB extravasation abnormalities were found in G93A mice at (E, F) 13 weeks of age (red, arrows). (G, H) Significant EB diffusion (red, arrows) into the parenchyma of the lumbar spinal cord from many blood vessels was detected in G93A mice at end-stage of disease (17–18 weeks of age). Arrowheads in F and G indicate vessel permeability. Scale bar in A–H is 25 µm.</p>
