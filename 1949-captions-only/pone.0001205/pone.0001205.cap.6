                Figure 6.  Immunofluorescence staining for laminin in the cervical spinal cord of G93A mice at early and late stages of disease.Many blood vessels of different diameter were immunoreactive for laminin-1 (red) in the control C57BL/6J mice at (A) 12–13 weeks of age and (B) 19–20 weeks of age. In G93A mice at (C) initial or (D) late stages of disease, capillaries appear to be less numerous. In some early symptomatic G93A mice, (C) blurry spots around capillaries were found. The nuclei in A–D are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in A, B, C, D is 200 µm; inserts a, b, c, d is 50 µm.
