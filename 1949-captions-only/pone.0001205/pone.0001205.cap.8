                Figure 8.  Immunofluorescence staining for Glut-1 in the cervical and lumbar spinal cords of G93A mice at early and late stages of disease.Cervical spinal cord. High expression of Glut-1 (red) was determined in endothelial lining of many blood vessels of various diameters in the cervical spinal cord of the control C57BL/6J mice at (A), (B) 12–13 weeks of age and (C) 19–20 weeks of age. In G93A mice at (D), (E) initial or (F), (G) late stages of disease, immunoreaction for Glut-1 in the endothelial cells appear to be low, or nonexistent. The nuclei in A–G are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in A and E is 50 µm; B, C, D, F, G is 25 µm. Outline of white dots indicates configuration of blood vessels. Lumbar spinal cord. Similar to the cervical spinal cord, most Glut-1-positive endothelial cells (red) were observed in the control C57BL/6J mice at (H), (I) 12–13 weeks of age and (J) 19–20 weeks of age. Less Glut-1 expression was found in G93A mice at (K), (L) early or (M), (N) end-stage of disease. The nuclei in H–N are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in J, M, N is 50 µm; H, I, K, L is 25 µm.
