In G93A mice at (D), (E) initial or (F), (G) late stages of disease, immunoreaction for Glut-1 in the endothelial cells appear to be low, or nonexistent. The nuclei in A–G are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in A and E is 50 µm; B, C, D, F, G is 25 µm. Outline of white dots indicates configuration of blood vessels. <em>Lumbar spinal cord.</em> Similar to the cervical spinal cord, most Glut-1-positive endothelial cells (red) were observed in the control C57BL/6J mice at (H), (I) 12–13 weeks of age and (J) 19–20 weeks of age. Less Glut-1 expression was found in G93A mice at (K), (L) early or (M), (N) end-stage of disease. The nuclei in H–N are shown with DAPI. Scale bar in J, M, N is 50 µm; H, I, K, L is 25 µm.</p>
