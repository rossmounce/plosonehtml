                Figure 1.  Age-specific risk of developing the disease.Women's cumulative risk of developing breast cancer (dashed line, Fb(x)), ovarian cancer (dotted line, Fo(x)) or either (solid line, Fbo(x)) in a population free of any other causes of death. The two functions Fb(x) and Fo(x) are fitted 2-parameter cumulative gamma distributions from data from [9]. For breast cancer, Fb(x), α = 7.93 and β = 7.54; and for ovarian cancer, Fo(x), α = 8.20 and β = 9.86. The cumulative gamma function associated with this risk Fbo(x) has parameters α = 9.97 and β = 5.54.
