                Figure 2.  Demographic scenarios.Adult women's survival (A) and fertility (B) from ages 10 to 50 for the population of early Quebec (solid line), the Ache (dashed line) and the modeled population (dotted line). These populations differ by their growth (respectively high, intermediate and stationary, see [12], [13], [14]). Female adults' age-specific survivals were modeled by a Gompertz-Makeham. For Quebec, a = 4.69×10−4, b = 7.28×10−2, Δ = 0 and c = 1.49×10−3. For the Ache, a = 3.00×10−5, b = 1.10×10−1, Δ = 0 and c = 6.33×10−3. For the modeled population, a = 1.99×10−3, b = 5.82×10−2, Δ = 10 and c = 1.2×10−2. Female adults' fertilities were modeled by a Hadwiger function. For Quebec, TFR = 12.25, θ1 = −246.92, θ2 = 18.72, θ3 = 272.77. For the Ache, TFR = 8.032, θ1 = −36.82, θ2 = 4.79, θ3 = 68.29. For the modeled population TFR = 2.578, θ1 = −7.61, θ2 = 3.31, θ3 = 34.31.
