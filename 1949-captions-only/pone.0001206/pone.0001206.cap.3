This was achieved by altering parameters <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> of the cumulative gamma. We calculated the minimum effective population size <em>Ne<sub>min</sub></em> = 10/2s necessary for negative selection to dominate over drift <a href="#pone.0001206-Whitlock1">[18]</a> corresponding to <em>BRCA1</em>-alleles associated with each of these curves. These <em>Ne<sub>min</sub></em> are shown in (C) for the Quebec population. The point represents values estimated from <a href="#pone.0001206-Antoniou1">[9]</a> for the cumulative risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer given a mutation in <em>BRCA1</em> (mean = 55; variance = 306; <em>Ne<sub>min</sub></em> = 92).</p>
