                Figure 3.  Selection on late-onset diseases.To explore a range of patterns of age of onset, we altered the observed cumulative risk with age Fbo(x) of developing either breast or ovarian cancer for females carrying a BRCA1 susceptibility allele estimated from [9] (red line) by changing the mean from age 40 to 70 (A) and the variance from 100 to 800 (B). This was achieved by altering parameters α and β of the cumulative gamma. We calculated the minimum effective population size Nemin = 10/2s necessary for negative selection to dominate over drift [18] corresponding to BRCA1-alleles associated with each of these curves. These Nemin are shown in (C) for the Quebec population. The point represents values estimated from [9] for the cumulative risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer given a mutation in BRCA1 (mean = 55; variance = 306; Nemin = 92).
