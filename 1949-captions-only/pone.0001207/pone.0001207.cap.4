In this case, the main components remain (the points in the same color are in the same component). (B) The case of deleting mDHs and their network motifs. Deleting the mDHs and their motif proteins causes the main components to disappear (the points in the same color are in the same component). (C) Deleting hubs one by one. The <em>HC<sup>fyi</sup></em> network is tolerant for the deletion of mPHs with their motifs. However, it is not tolerant for the deletion of mDHs with their motifs. (D) Deleting a randomly chosen set of 98 hubs with their motifs. We repeat the removal of 98 hubs with their motifs randomly for 1000 times. The sizes of the largest remaining components are all less than 555 that are the size of the largest component after removing the mPHs with their motifs. The sizes of the largest remaining components are all larger than 47 that are the size of the largest component after removing the mDHs with their motifs. Empirical P values are both less than 10<sup>âˆ’3</sup>. Biolayout <a href="#pone.0001207-Enright1">[53]</a> has been used to produce the figures in (A) and (B).</p>
