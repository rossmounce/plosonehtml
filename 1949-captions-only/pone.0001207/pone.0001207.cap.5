                Figure 5.  Network motifs linking up pathways with mDHs and mPHs.In the middle of the panel, the red circles are abstract representations of pathways, where 14 smaller ones only connect with 6 mDHs (circles in light blue), and 26 larger ones connect with not only mDHs in blue circles (except the light blue one at the top of the panel) but also mPHs in orange circles. If more than one motif proteins of an mDH or an mPH are involved in one pathway, we connect the mDH or mPH with the pathway by an edge. Biolayout [53] has been used to produce the figure.
