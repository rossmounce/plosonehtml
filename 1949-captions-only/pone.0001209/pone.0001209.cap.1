                Figure 1.  Effect of excitatory media on the firing of L5 pyramidal neurons.45 minutes of whole-cell recordings in the control condition, application of modified ACSF (marked by solid bar above Ai, Bi and Ci) and washout. Columns A, B and C show, respectively, application of ACSF1, ACSF2 and ACSF3 with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (see table 1). To observe the spiking events, Aii, Bii and Cii in the middle row are enlarged from the application period of Ai, Bi and Ci, with further enlargement given in Aiii, Biii and Ciii.
