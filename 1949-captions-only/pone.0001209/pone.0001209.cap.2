The instantaneous firing rate histograms were calculated from continuous recording of the membrane potential following the application of ACSF<sub>1</sub> (A), ACSF<sub>2</sub> (B) and ACSF<sub>3</sub> with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (C). The histograms were fitted with a sum of two Gaussian distributions in A and C. The histograms in B were fitted only with one Gaussian distribution. In each subfigure the histograms were compiled from a single neuron.</p>
