                Figure 2.  Instantaneous firing rate histograms in excited brain slices.Room temperature of 22°C (blue) and physiological temperature of 35°C (red). The instantaneous firing rate histograms were calculated from continuous recording of the membrane potential following the application of ACSF1 (A), ACSF2 (B) and ACSF3 with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (C). The histograms were fitted with a sum of two Gaussian distributions in A and C. The histograms in B were fitted only with one Gaussian distribution. In each subfigure the histograms were compiled from a single neuron.
