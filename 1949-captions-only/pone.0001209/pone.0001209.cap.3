                Figure 3.  All-point histograms of subthreshold membrane potential in excited brain slices.Control (blue), application of modified ACSF (red), after adding synaptic blockers (black), and washout (green). A, B and C show, respectively, application of ACSF1, ACSF2 and ACSF3 with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (see table 1). In each subfigure the histograms were compiled from a single neuron.
