                Figure 4.  Effect of slice excitation on average membrane potential and variance.Membrane potential and membrane potential variance were measured under control conditions, application of modified ACSF and addition of synaptic blockers. The values of the membrane potential variance are displayed normalized to their control values. A, average membrane potential with ACSF1 (left) and ACSF2 (right). B, membrane potential variance with ACSF1 (left) and ACSF2 (right). C, average membrane potential with various concentrations of ACSF3. D, membrane potential variance with various concentrations of ACSF3.
