The values of the membrane potential variance are displayed normalized to their control values. A, average membrane potential with ACSF<sub>1</sub> (left) and ACSF<sub>2</sub> (right). B, membrane potential variance with ACSF<sub>1</sub> (left) and ACSF<sub>2</sub> (right). C, average membrane potential with various concentrations of ACSF<sub>3</sub>. D, membrane potential variance with various concentrations of ACSF<sub>3</sub>.</p>
