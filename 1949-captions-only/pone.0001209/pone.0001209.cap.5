                Figure 5.  Effect of slice excitation on action potential amplitude and threshold.AP amplitude and threshold were measured under control conditions, ACSF application and addition of synaptic blockers. A, AP amplitude with ACSF1 (left) and ACSF2 (right). B, AP amplitude with various concentrations of ACSF3. C, AP threshold with ACSF1 (left) and ACSF2 (right). D, AP threshold with various concentrations of ACSF3.
