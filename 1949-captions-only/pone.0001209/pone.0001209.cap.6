A and B, data taken in the control condition (open circles), application of modified ACSF (open triangles) and application of modified ACSF with synaptic blockers (filled rightward triangles). A, voltage-current curves with ACSF<sub>1</sub>. B, voltage-current curves with ACSF<sub>2</sub>. C, voltage-current curves with ACSF<sub>3</sub> in which the applications are generalized to ACSF<sub>3</sub> with 4 µM NMDA and 0.4 µM AMPA (open triangles) ACSF<sub>3</sub> with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (filled leftward triangles).</p>
