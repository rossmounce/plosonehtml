                Figure 6.  Modified ionic composition of ACSF changes Rin of L5 pyramidal neurons.Input resistance (Rin) was extracted by a linear fit. A and B, data taken in the control condition (open circles), application of modified ACSF (open triangles) and application of modified ACSF with synaptic blockers (filled rightward triangles). A, voltage-current curves with ACSF1. B, voltage-current curves with ACSF2. C, voltage-current curves with ACSF3 in which the applications are generalized to ACSF3 with 4 µM NMDA and 0.4 µM AMPA (open triangles) ACSF3 with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (filled leftward triangles).
