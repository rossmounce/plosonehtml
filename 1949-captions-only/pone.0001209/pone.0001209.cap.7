                Figure 7.  Modified ionic composition of ACSF changes response of L5 pyramidal neurons to injected current.Lines plotted by exponential fitting to curves from AP frequency vs. injected current. A and B, control (blue circles), application of modified ACSF (red upward triangle) and addition of synaptic blockers (black triangle). A, ACSF1; B, ACSF2; C, ACSF3 with 6 µM NMDA and 0.6 µM AMPA (red triangles) and ACSF3 with 8 µM NMDA and 0.8 µM AMPA (green triangles).
