ESI mass spectrum showing mono- (<em>m/z</em> 465.25), di- (<em>m/z</em> 472.26) and tri-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 479.26) at K27 of H3.1. B. ESI mass spectrum showing mono- (<em>m/z</em> 480.25), di- (<em>m/z</em> 487.26) and tri-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 494.27) at K27 of H3.2. C. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at <em>m/z</em> 479.26 for determining tri-methylation at K27 of H3.1. D. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at <em>m/z</em> 494.27 for determining tri-methylation at K27 of H3.2. E. ESI-MS spectrum showing mono- (<em>m/z</em> 675.34), di- (<em>m/z</em> 682.36) and tri-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 689.36) at K36 in H3.2 and tri-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 674.33) at K36 of H3.1. F. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at <em>m/z</em> 689.36 for determining tri-methylation at K36 of H3.2. G. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing non- (<em>m/z</em> 704.4) mono- (<em>m/z</em> 718.4), di- (<em>m/z</em> 732.4) and tri-methylation (746.4) at K4. H. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing di-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 929.6) at K9, acetylation at K14 or tri-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 943.6) at K9, acetylation at K14 and mono-methylation (<em>m/z</em> 957.6) at K9. I. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing no methylation at K79. J. Sequence alignment of H3 isoforms (H3.1 and H3.2). K in green color: acetylation; K in yellow color: methylation; K in olive color: both acetylation and methylation. Note: All peptides in A–F were released from trypsin digestion and peptides in G–I were released from Arg-C digestion.</p>
