                Figure 3.  Identification of H3 methylation sites.A. ESI mass spectrum showing mono- (m/z 465.25), di- (m/z 472.26) and tri-methylation (m/z 479.26) at K27 of H3.1. B. ESI mass spectrum showing mono- (m/z 480.25), di- (m/z 487.26) and tri-methylation (m/z 494.27) at K27 of H3.2. C. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at m/z 479.26 for determining tri-methylation at K27 of H3.1. D. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at m/z 494.27 for determining tri-methylation at K27 of H3.2. E. ESI-MS spectrum showing mono- (m/z 675.34), di- (m/z 682.36) and tri-methylation (m/z 689.36) at K36 in H3.2 and tri-methylation (m/z 674.33) at K36 of H3.1. F. MS/MS spectrum of the doubly-charged precursor ion at m/z 689.36 for determining tri-methylation at K36 of H3.2. G. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing non- (m/z 704.4) mono- (m/z 718.4), di- (m/z 732.4) and tri-methylation (746.4) at K4. H. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing di-methylation (m/z 929.6) at K9, acetylation at K14 or tri-methylation (m/z 943.6) at K9, acetylation at K14 and mono-methylation (m/z 957.6) at K9. I. MALDI-TOF mass spectrum showing no methylation at K79. J. Sequence alignment of H3 isoforms (H3.1 and H3.2). K in green color: acetylation; K in yellow color: methylation; K in olive color: both acetylation and methylation. Note: All peptides in A–F were released from trypsin digestion and peptides in G–I were released from Arg-C digestion.
