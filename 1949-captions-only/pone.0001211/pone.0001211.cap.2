The border of the bundle-like structure was highlighted using the brush tool of Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, CA, USA). i) A cross-section of native rat skeletal muscle tissue (Hematoxylin-eosin staining, HE). Each bundle exhibits a polygonal shape and the morphology resembles that in the cross-section of the strained fibrin gel shown in (h) j) The cross-sectional area of individual bundle-like structures was measured using image-analysis software (Lumina Vision, Mitani, Japan) and extrapolated to circular cross-sections to calculate the average diameter of the bundles under strains of specific magnitudes. The red arrow in the figure indicates the strain direction.</p>
