                Figure 4.  HUVECs in strained fibrin gels.a) Alignment of HUVECs in a strained fibrin gel. b) Aligned vessel-like structure in a fibrin gel (arrows). c) HUVECs in a control fibrin gel. d) Cells that developed lumens in a fibrin gel system. Asterisks indicate significant difference (p&lt;0.01). The red arrow in the figure indicates the strain direction. The scale bars are 100 Âµm for b and c.
