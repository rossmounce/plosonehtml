                Figure 1.  HIV-1 Nef triggers intracellular accumulation of Lck and prevents Lck recruitment to sites of T cell receptor engagement.(A) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with expression plasmids for GFP or Nef.GFP after staining for endogenous Lck. Depicted is a representative confocal section through the middle of the cell. White bar = 10 µM. (B) Quantification of cells displaying pronounced intracellular Lck accumulation. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition. (C) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with expression plasmids for GFP or Nef.GFP after 5min incubation on anti-CD3 coated coverglasses and subsequent staining for endogenous Lck. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy and representative z-sections directly above the coverglass are presented. White bar = 10 µM. (D) Projection of a z-stack series of confocal sections of Jurkat T lymphocytes on stimulatory coverglasses after staining for Lck. The asterisk denotes a Nef.GFP expressing cell. (E) Side projection of a confocal z-stack series of the cells depicted in D. (F) Quantification of the pixel intensity of the Lck signal at the z-section near the coverglass surface relative to the total pixel intensity in all z-sections from the same cell. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.e.m. in which over 10 randomly selected cells were analyzed per condition. Control, incubation of cells on non-stimulatory coverglasses; αCD3, incubation of cells on anti-CD3 coated coverglasses.
