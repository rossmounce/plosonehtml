Depicted is a representative confocal section through the middle of the cell. Asterisks denote GFP positive cells. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition.</p>
