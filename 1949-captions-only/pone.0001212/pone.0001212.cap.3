                Figure 3.  Intracellular Lck accumulation requires membrane attachment and the SH3 binding motif of Nef.(A) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with the indicated expression plasmids after staining for endogenous Lck. Depicted is a representative confocal section through the middle of the cell. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition.
