                Figure 4.  Inhibition of TCR induced actin remodeling depends on the protein interaction motif surrounding F195 in Nef.(A) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with the indicated expression plasmids after 5min incubation on anti-CD3 coated coverglasses and subsequent staining for F-actin. Depicted is a representative confocal section near the coverglass. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Shown is the percentage of cells exhibiting pronounced actin ring formation relative to the mean value of GFP expressing control cells that was arbitrarily set to 100%. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition.
