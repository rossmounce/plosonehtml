Depicted is a representative confocal section near the coverglass. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Shown is the percentage of cells exhibiting pronounced actin ring formation relative to the mean value of GFP expressing control cells that was arbitrarily set to 100%. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition.</p>
