Depicted is a representative confocal section near the coverglass. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Shown is the relative pixel intensity of the Lck.GFP signal at the z-section near the coverglass surface relative to the total pixel intensity in all z-sections from the same cell. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.e.m. in which over 10 randomly selected cells were investigated per condition.</p>
