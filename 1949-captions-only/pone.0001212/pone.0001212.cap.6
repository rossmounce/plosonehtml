                Figure 6.  Analysis of Nef determinants for its association with cellular Pak2 activity.(A) Analysis of Pak2 association for various Nef mutants. Jurkat T lymphocytes were transfected with the indicated Nef.GFP expression plasmids and an in vitro kinase assay (IVKA) following anti-GFP immunoprecipitation was performed. Nef associated Pak2 activity is revealed by the phosphorylated 62 kDa band (IVKA, pPak2). WB αGFP depicts a western blot monitoring the amounts of Nef.GFP present in the IVKA reaction. (B) Quantification of the Nef associated Pak2 activity. Intensities of autophosphorylated Pak2 signals were quantified relative to the amounts of immunoisolated Nef.GFP. The relative associated Pak activity for Nef.GFP was arbitrarily set to 100%. Data are mean±s.d. of at least 5 independent experiments.
