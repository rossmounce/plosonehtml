                Figure 7.  Sustained Nef induced Lck accumulation requires microtubule integrity.(A) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with GFP or Nef.GFP expression plasmids and stained for endogenous Lck after 30min incubation with the indicated drugs (CytD 5 µM; LatB 0.5 µM; Lck Inh. 3 µM; Noco. 10 µM; control, solvent control). Depicted is a representative confocal section through the middle of the cell. White bar = 10 µM. (B) Quantification of the experiment shown in A. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition.
