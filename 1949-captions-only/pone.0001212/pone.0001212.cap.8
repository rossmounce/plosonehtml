                Figure 8.  Effects of Nef on TCR induced actin dynamics are microtubule independent.(A) Confocal microscopy analysis of Jurkat T lymphocytes transfected with GFP or Nef.GFP expression plasmids after 5min incubation on anti-CD3 coated coverglasses and subsequent staining for F-actin (red). Prior to incubation with TCR stimulatory surfaces, cells were incubated for 30min with the indicated drugs (CytoD 5 µM, LatB 0.5 µM, Lck Inh. 3 µM, Noco. 10 µM). Depicted is the merge picture of a representative confocal section near the coverglass. White bar = 10 µM. (B) Confocal microscopy analysis of microtubules in Jurkat cells after 5min incubation on uncoated or CD3 stimulatory coverglasses (αCD3), respectively. Cells depicted on the right were incubated for 30min with 10 µM nocodazole. (C) Quantification of actin ring formation of the cells shown in A. Values are the arithmetic means of at least three independent experiments+s.d. in which over 100 cells were counted per condition. (D) Quantification of cells carrying actin rich protrusions after anti-CD3 stimulation in the presence of Lck inhibitor.
