(A) Distribution of p-Tyr and GFP 5min after TCR stimulation. Results depict images representative for at least three independent experiments. White bar = 10 ÂµM. (B) Quantification of overall p-Tyr levels of the transfected cells shown in A. Values represent the mean of three independent experiments+s.e.m. from at least 10 cells representing the phenotypes depicted in (A).</p>
