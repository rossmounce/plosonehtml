The <em>hcf-1</em> gene is shown in the middle with gray boxes indicating coding segments. Genomic distances from the start to end of the coding sequence along with deletion end points are indicated. The 782 amino acid Ce HCF-1 protein is shown illustrated above the <em>hcf-1</em> gene schematic showing conserved Kelch domain, fibronectin type 3 (Fn3) repeats, and nuclear localization signal <a href="#pone.0001213-Izeta2">[35]</a>. The residues flanking the deletions (454 and 1910 for <em>pk924</em>, and 49 and 1168 for <em>ok559</em>) are indicated below. The <em>ok559</em> deletion is in frame whereas the <em>pk924</em> deletion creates an in frame stop codon 27 bp after the deletion junction creating the predicted polypeptides illustrated at the top. (B) Immunoblot analysis of Ce HCF-1 expression in N2 (lane 1), <em>pk924</em> (lane 2), and <em>ok559</em> (lane 3) L1-stage worms using the anti-Ce HCF-1 antisera. The lanes are from a single immunoblot in which intervening lanes have been removed. (C) The absence of HCF activity in the deletion mutant tested by electrophoretic mobility retardation assay. Electrophoretic mobility retardation analysis of VP16-induced complex formation with probe alone (lane 1) or with added Oct-1 POU domain, VP16, and <em>pk924</em> or wild-type N2 worm extracts as indicated (lanes 2â€“4). Mobilities of the free probe, and Oct-1 POU domain (Oct-1 POU) and VP16-induced (CeVIC) complexes are indicated.</p>
