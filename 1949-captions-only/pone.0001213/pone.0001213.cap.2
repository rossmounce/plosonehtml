The X-axis of the graphs represents the brood size, which is the number of progeny of one worm. The Y-axis represents the percentage of viable embryos in the progeny of one worm (% hatched). A filled circle represents a <em>pk924</em> worm and an open circle represents a wild-type (N2) worm. Arrows indicate the average brood size and hatching rate of either <em>pk924</em> worms (solid arrows) or wild-type worms (open arrows).</p>
