                Figure 2.  pk924 mutant worms have small brood sizes and cold-sensitive embryonic lethal phenotypes.The results of brood size and progeny analysis at three different temperatures are shown: (A) 25°C, (B) 20°C, and (C) 15°C. The X-axis of the graphs represents the brood size, which is the number of progeny of one worm. The Y-axis represents the percentage of viable embryos in the progeny of one worm (% hatched). A filled circle represents a pk924 worm and an open circle represents a wild-type (N2) worm. Arrows indicate the average brood size and hatching rate of either pk924 worms (solid arrows) or wild-type worms (open arrows).
