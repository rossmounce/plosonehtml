                Figure 3.  The hcf-1 mutant phenotype is more penetrant at 12°C and is reproduced by hcf-1 RNAi.Side-by-side comparison of the phenotypes of pk924 worms (A) and N2 wild-type worms fed with hcf-1 RNAi (B) at 12°C. (A) The number (brood size on the X axis) and viability (hatched % on the Y axis) of progeny were analyzed in pk924 (solid circles) and wild-type (open circles) worms at 12°C. Arrows indicate the average brood size and hatching rate of either pk924 worms (solid arrows) or wild-type worms (open arrows). (B) Analysis as in (A) of wild type worms fed with either hcf-1 RNAi bacteria (solid circles and arrows) or bacteria transformed with the control empty pGN1 RNAi vector (open circles and arrows). Analyses represented in A and B were performed in parallel.
