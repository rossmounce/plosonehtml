(A) The number (brood size on the X axis) and viability (hatched % on the Y axis) of progeny were analyzed in <em>pk924</em> (solid circles) and wild-type (open circles) worms at 12°C. Arrows indicate the average brood size and hatching rate of either <em>pk924</em> worms (solid arrows) or wild-type worms (open arrows). (B) Analysis as in (A) of wild type worms fed with either <em>hcf-1</em> RNAi bacteria (solid circles and arrows) or bacteria transformed with the control empty pGN1 RNAi vector (open circles and arrows). Analyses represented in A and B were performed in parallel.</p>
