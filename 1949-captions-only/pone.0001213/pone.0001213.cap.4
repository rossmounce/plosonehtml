                Figure 4.  CeHCF-1 is a nuclear protein widely expressed in embryos.Immunofluorescence analysis of Ce HCF-1 expression in wild-type embryos at four progressive embryonic stages (a–d). Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining (blue labeling, left). Ce HCF-1 (green labeling, right) was detected using the monoclonal αCe HCF-1 antibody.
