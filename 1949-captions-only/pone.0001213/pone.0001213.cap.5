Embryos were prepared from adult hermaphrodites grown at 12°C and kept at 12°C during the observation. The lower right corresponds to the anterior pole of each embryo. The time in minutes is indicated at the top-right corner of each panel. (A) Wild-type embryo. Under these conditions, wild-type embryos undergo slow but normal cell division and develop into normal adults. <em>a</em> to <em>c</em>, pronuclear migration; <em>d</em>, pronuclear fusion and rotation; <em>e</em>, nuclear envelope breakdown; <em>f</em>, first mitotic spindle formed along the A-P axis; <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, first cytokinesis; <em>i</em>, two-cell stage embryo. (B) <em>pk924</em> embryo with subtle mitotic defect. Panels as in (A), note the abnormal cell division in panel <em>h′</em> (white solid arrow). (C) <em>pk924</em> embryo with severe mitotic defect. Panels as in (A) except that panel <em>f″</em> displays an inappropriate spindle, panels <em>g″</em> and <em>h″</em> display failed cytokinesis, and panel <em>i″</em> displays the multinucleated single cell embryo product.</p>
