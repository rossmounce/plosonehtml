                Figure 5.  hcf-1 mutant embryos have cell-division defects.Excerpts from embryo movies (see Supporting Information). Embryos were prepared from adult hermaphrodites grown at 12°C and kept at 12°C during the observation. The lower right corresponds to the anterior pole of each embryo. The time in minutes is indicated at the top-right corner of each panel. (A) Wild-type embryo. Under these conditions, wild-type embryos undergo slow but normal cell division and develop into normal adults. a to c, pronuclear migration; d, pronuclear fusion and rotation; e, nuclear envelope breakdown; f, first mitotic spindle formed along the A-P axis; g and h, first cytokinesis; i, two-cell stage embryo. (B) pk924 embryo with subtle mitotic defect. Panels as in (A), note the abnormal cell division in panel h′ (white solid arrow). (C) pk924 embryo with severe mitotic defect. Panels as in (A) except that panel f″ displays an inappropriate spindle, panels g″ and h″ display failed cytokinesis, and panel i″ displays the multinucleated single cell embryo product.
