The percentages of N2, <em>pk924</em>, and <em>ok559</em> embryos displaying reduced H3S10P staining at 12°C and 20°C are indicated below for each condition. The percentages for mutant worms were determined with the following sample sizes: N2 at 20°C, n&gt;150; <em>pk924</em> at 20°C, n = 141; <em>ok559</em> at 20°C, n = 140; N2 at 12°C, n&gt;150; <em>pk924</em> at 12°C, n = 150; and <em>ok559</em> at 12°C, n = 189, where n is the total number of embryos observed.</p>
