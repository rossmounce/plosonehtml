                Figure 6.  hcf-1 mutant embryos display a reduced staining of H3S10P.The nuclei of wild-type N2, pk924, and ok559 embryos collected from worms grown at either 20°C (panels a, b, e, f, i, j) or 12°C (panels c, d, g, h, k, l) were stained with DAPI (left) and anti-H3S10P antibody (right). The percentages of N2, pk924, and ok559 embryos displaying reduced H3S10P staining at 12°C and 20°C are indicated below for each condition. The percentages for mutant worms were determined with the following sample sizes: N2 at 20°C, n&gt;150; pk924 at 20°C, n = 141; ok559 at 20°C, n = 140; N2 at 12°C, n&gt;150; pk924 at 12°C, n = 150; and ok559 at 12°C, n = 189, where n is the total number of embryos observed.
