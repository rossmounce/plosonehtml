Cells were grown at permissive (33.5째C; panels <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>) and nonpermissive (40째C; panels <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>) temperatures. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue labeling) and anti-H3S10P antisera (red labeling). (B) Percentage of mitotic BHK21 and tsBN67 cells displaying a reduced H3S10P staining at the permissive (33.5째C) and nonpermissive (40째C) temperatures. The results are the average of three independent samples in which for each sample 50 mitotic cells were analyzed.</p>
