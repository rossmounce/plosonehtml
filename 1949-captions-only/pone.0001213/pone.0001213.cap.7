                Figure 7.  H3S10P status in mammalian cells defective for HCF-1 function.H3S10P status in BHK21 (panels a and b) and tsBN67 (panels c and d) cells visualized by immunostaining. Cells were grown at permissive (33.5째C; panels a and c) and nonpermissive (40째C; panels b and d) temperatures. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue labeling) and anti-H3S10P antisera (red labeling). (B) Percentage of mitotic BHK21 and tsBN67 cells displaying a reduced H3S10P staining at the permissive (33.5째C) and nonpermissive (40째C) temperatures. The results are the average of three independent samples in which for each sample 50 mitotic cells were analyzed.
