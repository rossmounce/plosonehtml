Lymphocytes collected before and after immunization were stimulated with various concentrations of control B1 peptide, cA1 peptide or recombinant gp120 protein added to the culture media. (B) Proliferation response of PBMCs from HIV-1-infected individuals. Cells were obtained from 10 HIV-1-infected individuals (1-10) and their proliferation response was measured after stimulation with 1 Âµg/ml of control B1 peptide, cA1 peptide or after incubation without (-) peptide, as indicated. The incorparation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine into DNA was measured 6 days after the stimulation. Tests were performed on triplicate samples.</p>
