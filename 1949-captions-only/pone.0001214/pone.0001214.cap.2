                Figure 2.  CTL activities derived from cell cultures of 4 HIV-infected individuals (I, II, III and IV) directed against autologous target-cells presenting cA1 peptide, control B1 peptide, or target-cells infected with either wild type vaccinia virus or recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp160MN.The CTL cultures were generated by polyclonal activation with the irradiated autologous cells. After a 10 day incubation the effector cells were tested for CTL activity as described in materials and methods. The data are representative of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicates. Standard errors of the mean (s.e.m) from triplicate wells were 5% of the mean.
