                Figure 3.  CTL activity of cA1-stimulated cell cultures of 4 HIV-infected individuals (I, II, III and IV) directed against autologous target-cells presenting cA1 peptide, control B1 peptide, or target-cells infected with either wild type vaccinia virus or recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp160MN.The secondary cultures of the effector cells were obtained by incubating the PBMCs with the cA1 peptide and their CTL activity was tested after 10 days of incubation. The data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicates. Standard errors of the mean from triplicate wells were &lt; 5% of the mean.
