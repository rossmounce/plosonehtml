                Figure 4.  CTL activity of effector cells derived from the BI donor vaccinated with IIIB-env-recombinant protein and from the SH donor vaccinated with SIMI-env-recombinant directed against autologous target-cells presenting cA1 peptide and HIV-1 env proteins.The secondary cultures of the effector cells were generated in vitro after incubation with V3 loop P18 peptide ( panels I, III) and cA1 peptide (panels II, IV). The data are representative of four independent experiments performed in triplicates. Standard errors of the mean from triplicate cultures were all &lt;7% of the means.
