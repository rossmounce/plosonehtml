                Figure 6.  Phenotype of cA1 peptide-specific CTLs derived from gp160IIIB-immunized individual BI (panel I) and from gp160SIMI-immunized subject SH (panel II).Autologous B-LCLs, sensitized by cA1 peptide, were cultured with effector cells pre-treated with anti-CD8, anti-CD4 or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. The control group was not treated with antibodies. Standard errors of the mean, from triplicate wells, were less than 5% of the mean.
