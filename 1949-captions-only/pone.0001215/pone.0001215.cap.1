Reference range of data obtained from each of the 25 significantly different variables in symptomatic patients. An individual patient's data (represented as white dots) are superposed onto the color-coded quartile distribution. B. The same individual patient's color-coded empiric clinical disease profile of arteriosclerosis. The color-coded profile can be transformed into numbers: green = 0, yellow = 1, orange = 2 and red = 3. The arithmetic mean of these numbers is equivalent to the disease activity score. C. The color- or number-coded profiles can be transformed into a barcode. D. The individual patient's quantitative percentile profile.</p>
