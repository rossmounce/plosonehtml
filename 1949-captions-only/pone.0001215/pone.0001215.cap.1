                Figure 1.  Empiric clinical profiles of arteriosclerosis and disease activity score.A. Reference range of data obtained from each of the 25 significantly different variables in symptomatic patients. An individual patient's data (represented as white dots) are superposed onto the color-coded quartile distribution. B. The same individual patient's color-coded empiric clinical disease profile of arteriosclerosis. The color-coded profile can be transformed into numbers: green = 0, yellow = 1, orange = 2 and red = 3. The arithmetic mean of these numbers is equivalent to the disease activity score. C. The color- or number-coded profiles can be transformed into a barcode. D. The individual patient's quantitative percentile profile.
