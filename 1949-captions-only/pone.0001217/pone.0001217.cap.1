                Figure 1.  Confirmation of PRAS40 and PRR5L binding to mTOR.A. PRAS40 is associated specifically with mTORC1. mTOR, Rictor, Raptor and mock IPs were performed with HeLa and HEK293 extracts and analyzed by immunoblotting. PRAS40 was found specifically in mTOR and Raptor IPs. 1 h rapamycin treatment of cells dissociated a Raptor-PRAS40 subcomplex from mTOR. B. PRR5L is associated specifically with mTORC2. HeLa or HEK293 cells were transfected with GST-PRR5L or the empty plasmid. mTOR, Rictor, Raptor and mock IPs and GST pull downs were analyzed by immunoblotting. GST-PRR5L is detected specifically in mTOR and Rictor IPs. mTOR, Rictor and SIN1, but not Raptor, are detected specifically in GST-PRR5L pull downs.
