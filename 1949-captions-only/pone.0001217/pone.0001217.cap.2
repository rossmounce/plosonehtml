                Figure 2.  PRAS40 interacts with mTORC1. A. PRAS40 binds mTOR via Raptor.HEK293 cells were transfected with Raptor or control siRNA vectors and incubated for 4 days, followed by mTOR IP and immunoblotting. mTOR IPs and cell extracts were probed with antibodies directed against the indicated proteins. Since knock down of Raptor reduced the cellular amount of PRAS40, the PRAS40 signal in the IPs was quantified relative to PRAS40 levels in the corresponding extract. Quantitations were averaged over three independent experiments. Raptor knock down reduced the amount of PRAS40 associated with mTOR by 50%, as compared to control cells. B. mTOR kinase domain is involved in PRAS40 binding. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing wild type (WT) HA-mTOR or kinase dead (KD) HA-mTOR or an empty control plasmid, and incubated for 48&nbsp;h followed by extract preparation and IP with an anti-HA antibody. PRAS40 levels in the extracts remained unaltered. PRAS40 association with mTORC1 containing HA-mTOR KD was moderately reduced as compared with mTORC1 containing HA-mTOR WT.
