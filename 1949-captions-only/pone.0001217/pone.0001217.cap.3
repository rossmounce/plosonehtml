Rapamycin (100&nbsp;nM) and purified FKBP12 were added directly to the reaction. Both PRR5L and PRAS40 are phosphorylated <em>in vitro</em> by both mTORCs. Phosphorylation by mTORC1 was rapamycin-sensitive. B. PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity toward 4E-BP and PRAS40 itself. Kinase assays were performed using mTORC1 immunopurified from HEK293 cells, purified 4E-BP as a substrate, and increasing concentrations of PRAS40. PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 autophosphorylation and mTORC1 phosphorylation of 4E-BP and PRAS40, in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>
