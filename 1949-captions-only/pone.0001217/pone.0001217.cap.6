Cells were cotransfected with GST-PRR5L vector and incubated for 2 days, followed by GST pull downs and immunoblots with the indicated antibodies. GST-PRR5L was detected with an anti-GST antibody. B. TSC1/2 knock down facilitates apoptosis. TSCsi293 and T-REx-293 (control) cells were treated with tetracycline for 4 days. Apoptosis was induced by 1.5 h treatment with TNFÎ± and cycloheximide. Extracts were probed with the indicated antibodies.</p>
