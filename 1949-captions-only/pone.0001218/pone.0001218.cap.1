                Figure 1.  Representative protein expression pattern of mouse embryonic cell lines as revealed by large-gel 2D-electrophoresis.Over 5500 proteins (including protein isoforms) were resolved on a single gel. Highlighted spots correspond to spot ID of candidate balancer proteins detailed in Table 2.
