(B) Amount of proteins that underwent altered expression in each cell line, represented as percent of total spot volume that was up or down-regulated in transgenic cell lines. Dose alteration of 14 genes could no longer be balanced by an equivalent number of variant proteins. However, a balance remained at the level of protein concentration.</p>
