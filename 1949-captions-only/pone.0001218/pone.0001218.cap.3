                Figure 3.  Comparison of observed number of co-changed proteins against a theoretical calculation of co-changed proteins across six different transgenic cell lines.It was assumed that a total of 800 protein spots were investigated, among which 10% of the proteins change in their expression profile. This comparison shows that the occurrence of the same protein alteration in more than three cell lines is unlikely to be coincidental.
