                Figure 4.  Cumulative fraction plots of “balancer”-“cell line-specific protein” comparison.(A) Entropic contribution.; (B) Number of direct protein interaction partners. Compared to cell line-specific proteins, balancers possess significantly higher values of entropic contribution and a low number of direct interaction partners.
