Raw EMG signal filtered in the band 25–450 Hz, converted in RMS, sampled at 1 khz and smoothed by averaging in bins of 50 ms. Feedback bar: width 2 cm, maximal height 20 cm, distance from the eyes 60±10 cm, refresh rate 20Hz. <em>b)</em> Feedback calibration. Before calibration, the bar represents the voltage of the smoothed RMS signal in the range 0–750 ms. After calibration, the bar represents the signal normalized in the range <em>L, H</em>. <em>c)</em> Pointing task. Feedback bar represented before- and after the reach in the sustained modality. <em>A, W</em>: amplitude and width of the target. For normalization, we considered that <em>L</em> was at distance W/2 from the rest level, i.e., for target k, <em>A = W/2+(k−1)W+W/2 = kW</em>. Horizontal progress bar: time elapsed in the target.</p>
