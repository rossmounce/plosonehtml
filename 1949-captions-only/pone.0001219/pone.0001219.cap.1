                Figure 1.  Experimental setup.a) Signal capture. Raw EMG signal filtered in the band 25–450 Hz, converted in RMS, sampled at 1 khz and smoothed by averaging in bins of 50 ms. Feedback bar: width 2 cm, maximal height 20 cm, distance from the eyes 60±10 cm, refresh rate 20Hz. b) Feedback calibration. Before calibration, the bar represents the voltage of the smoothed RMS signal in the range 0–750 ms. After calibration, the bar represents the signal normalized in the range L, H. c) Pointing task. Feedback bar represented before- and after the reach in the sustained modality. A, W: amplitude and width of the target. For normalization, we considered that L was at distance W/2 from the rest level, i.e., for target k, A = W/2+(k−1)W+W/2 = kW. Horizontal progress bar: time elapsed in the target.
