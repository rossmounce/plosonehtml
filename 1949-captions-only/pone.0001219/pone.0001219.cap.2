                Figure 2.  Performance indicators for young and aged participants.A: sustained modality, reach time R (light grey) and complete stabilization time S (dark grey). B: sustained modality, rate of failure; C: impulsion modality, reach time R. Note that the vertical axes of the graphs in A and C differ given the different ranges of response latencies in the sustained and impulsion modalities. D: impulsion modality, rate of failure.
