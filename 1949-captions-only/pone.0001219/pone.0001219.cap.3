Each graph contains four curves, one per combination of Age and Precision. <em>A</em>: reach time R in the sustained modality. <em>B</em>: complete stabilization time S in the sustained modality. <em>C</em>: rate of failure F in the sustained modality. <em>D</em>: reach time R in the impulsion modality. <em>E</em>: rate of failure in the impulsion modality. Note that the horizontal scale for the reach time in the sustained modality (<em>A</em>) is Fitts' index of difficulty Id = log<sub>2</sub>(2A/W). This depicts how the curves in high and low precision can be fitted by a regression line. For the remainder (<em>B, C, D, E</em>), the horizontal scale is the amplitude.</p>
