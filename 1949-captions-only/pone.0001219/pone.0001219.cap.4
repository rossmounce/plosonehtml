The triangles that are in the middle of the group of squares represent old participants whose performance is indistinguishable from that of young people. <em>Vertical</em>: rate of failure F. <em>Horizontal</em>: time (ms). <em>A</em>: low precision, reach time R vs. F. <em>B</em>: low precision, total stabilization time S vs. F. <em>C</em>: high precision, reach time R vs. F. D: high precision, total stabilization time S vs. F. Note that the vertical axes of the graphs differ given the different ranges of rate of failure in low and high precision conditions. In addition, in <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, the rate of failure is bounded to 0.1 for clarity.</p>
