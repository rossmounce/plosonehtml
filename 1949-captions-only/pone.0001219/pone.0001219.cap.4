                Figure 4.  Scatter plot of performance for the sustained modality.Each dot represents the performance of one participant. Black triangles: old participants. Grey squares: young participants. The triangles that are in the middle of the group of squares represent old participants whose performance is indistinguishable from that of young people. Vertical: rate of failure F. Horizontal: time (ms). A: low precision, reach time R vs. F. B: low precision, total stabilization time S vs. F. C: high precision, reach time R vs. F. D: high precision, total stabilization time S vs. F. Note that the vertical axes of the graphs differ given the different ranges of rate of failure in low and high precision conditions. In addition, in A, B, the rate of failure is bounded to 0.1 for clarity.
