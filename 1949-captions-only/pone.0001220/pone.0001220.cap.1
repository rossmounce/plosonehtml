                Figure 1.  Flexible Influenza Model.Each compartment corresponds to a class of individuals in the population, and the arrows indicate the flows of individuals from class to class over time. As a result of exposure to the force of infection (λ), susceptible individuals (S) flow through two exposed classes of latent infection (E1 and E2). A proportion (α) then become infective and symptomatic (I), and a proportion 1-α become asymptomatic (A). Both I and A pass to the recovered class (R) from which a proportion ρ develop longer-lasting protection (L), while the remainder eventually return to the susceptible class after passing through a temporary state (T).
