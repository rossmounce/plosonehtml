As a result of exposure to the force of infection (<em>λ</em>), susceptible individuals (<em>S</em>) flow through two exposed classes of latent infection (<em>E1</em> and <em>E2</em>). A proportion (<em>α</em>) then become infective and symptomatic (<em>I</em>), and a proportion 1-<em>α</em> become asymptomatic (<em>A</em>). Both <em>I</em> and <em>A</em> pass to the recovered class (<em>R</em>) from which a proportion <em>ρ</em> develop longer-lasting protection (L), while the remainder eventually return to the susceptible class after passing through a temporary state (<em>T</em>).</p>
