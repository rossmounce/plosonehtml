                Figure 1.  Generation of Neur1 and Neur2 double knockout mice and their dispensable role in mammalian cerebral development.(A) Targeted disruption of the murine neuralized-2 (Neur2) locus. Schematic drawings of the wild-type (wt) and recombinant (mt) loci and the targeting vector (tv) are shown. The homologous recombination event deletes exons 2-3 and places the IRES-LacZ gene within the exon 2. H, HindIII. (B) Schematic drawing of the Neur1 and Neur2 proteins with the deleted region (green). (C) Southern blot analysis showing the recombination event. The RT-PCR analysis shows the loss of Neur1 and Neur2 transcripts in each mutant indicated. β-actin was used for normalization. wt, wild-type band; mt, Neur2 mutant band. (D) Heterozygote intercrosses of Neur1+/−;Neur2+/− mice. (E) H&amp;E sections of the neocortex (left panel) and hippocampus (right panel) of wild-type and Neur1&amp;2DKO mice. Note that there is no difference between the wild-type and Neur1&amp;2DKO mice.
