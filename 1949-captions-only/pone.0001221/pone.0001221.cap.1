Schematic drawings of the <em>wild-type</em> (wt) and recombinant (mt) loci and the targeting vector (tv) are shown. The homologous recombination event deletes exons 2-3 and places the <em>IRES-LacZ</em> gene within the exon 2. H, <em>Hind</em>III. (B) Schematic drawing of the Neur1 and Neur2 proteins with the deleted region (green). (C) Southern blot analysis showing the recombination event. The RT-PCR analysis shows the loss of <em>Neur1</em> and <em>Neur2</em> transcripts in each mutant indicated. <em>β-actin</em> was used for normalization. wt, <em>wild-type</em> band; mt, <em>Neur2</em> mutant band. (D) Heterozygote intercrosses of <em>Neur1<sup>+/−</sup>;Neur2<sup>+/−</sup></em> mice. (E) H&amp;E sections of the neocortex (left panel) and hippocampus (right panel) of <em>wild-type</em> and <em>Neur1&amp;2<sup>DKO</sup></em> mice. Note that there is no difference between the <em>wild-type</em> and <em>Neur1&amp;2<sup>DKO</sup></em> mice.</p>
