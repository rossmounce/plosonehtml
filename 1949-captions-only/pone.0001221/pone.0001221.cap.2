                Figure 2.  Generation of Mib2−/− mice and its dispensable role for mammalian development.(A) Gene targeting of the murine Mib2 locus. The homologous recombination event deletes exons 5–15 and places the IRES-LacZ gene within exon 5. Schematic structures of the wild-type (wt) and recombinant loci (mt) and the targeting vector (tv) are shown. E, EcoRI; B, BamHI; K, KpnI; spe, SpeI. (B) Southern blot analysis of tail DNA after EcoRI digestion with the flanking probe shown in (A). The positions of the wild-type (23kb) and the targeted (6.3kb) allele are indicated. (C) Northern blot analysis of Mib2 gene expression in adult brain mRNA from wild-type (+/+) and Mib2−/− (−/−) mice. Loading and integrity of the RNA were assessed by ethidium bromide staining of the 28S RNA in the gel prior to membrane transfer. (D) RT-PCR analysis of adult brain using Mib2-specific primers. No PCR product was detected from Mib2−/− cDNA. β-actin was used for the normalization. (E) H&amp;E sections of the hippocampus of wild-type (left) and Mib2−/− (right) mice. Note that there is no difference between the wild-type and Mib2−/− mice. (F) Whole-mount images of E9.5 embryos. Mib1+/−;Mib2−/− (i), Mib1−/−;Mib2+/− (ii), and Mib1−/−;Mib2−/− (iii).
