                Figure 3.  Conditional inactivation of Mib1 in endothelial cells generates a Dll4 mutant phenotype.(A, B) External view of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) yolk sacs (A) and embryos (B). The Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f yolk sac (A, right) has failed to remodel the primary vascular plexus to form large vitelline blood vessels. The Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f embryo (B, right) exhibits growth retardation and pericardial effusion. (C–F) Whole-mount PECAM staining of E9.5 wild-type (C, E) and Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f (D, F) embryos. The large cranial vessels appear truncated and degenerated in the mutants (D, arrows). Intersomitic vessels are present, but the angiogenic sprouts are disorganized in the mutants (F). (G, H) Sections of PECAM-1 stained embryos. The dorsal aortas of Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f embryos are reduced in diameter (H). ACV, anterior cardinal vein; DA, dorsal aorta. Scale bar, 200 µm. (I–L) Sections of ephrinB2 (I,J) and CD44 (K,L) stained embryos. The dorsal aortas of Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f (J,L) embryos are negative for the arterial markers, ephrinB2 and CD44. (M–P) Sections of sm22 (M,N) and αSMA (O,P) stained embryos. The smooth muscle cell markers, sm22 and αSMA, are lost in the dorsal aortas of Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f embryos (N,P). (Q) Semiquantitative RT-PCR in the yolk sac (ys) and para-aortic splenchnopleura (P-Sp) of wild-type (wt) and Tie2-cre;Mib1f/f (mt). Hey1 is down-regulated in the mt yolk sac (left panel). Dll4 expression in the mt P-Sp is similar to that of wt (right panel). β-actin was used for normalization.
