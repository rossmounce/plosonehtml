                Figure 5.  Conditional inactivation of Mib1 in cerebellum generates a Jag1 mutant phenotype.(A, B) Western blot analysis of P15 vermis (A) and whole-mount images of P9 vermis (B). wt, wild-type; mt, hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f. β-actin was used for normalization. (C–F) Nissle stained sections of P15 (C, D) and P17 (E, F) vermis from wild-type (C, E) and hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f (D, F) mice. hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f sections show the accumulation of granule cells (D, F, bracket). (G–J) DNA staining by Hoechst (G, H) and Ki67 immunostaining (I, J) of wild-type (G, I) and hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f (H, J) sections of P4 mice. Note that the hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f EGL has a similar level of proliferation as compared to the wild-type EGL. (K–N) DNA staining by Hoechst (K, L) and NeuN immunostaining (M, N) of wild-type (K, M) and hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f (L, N) sections of P15 mice. Note that the hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f mouse shows delayed migration of postmitotic granule cells in EGL (arrow) and ML (arrowhead). (O–R) BLBP (O, P) and GFAP (Q, R) immunostaining of wild-type (O, Q) and hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f (P, R) sections of P15 mice. The hGFAP-cre;Mib1f/f mouse shows truncated Bergmann glial fibers that fail to extend to the pial surface (P, R, arrowhead). EGL, external germinal layer; ML, molecular layer; IGL, internal granule cell layer; PC, Purkinje cell layer. Scale bars, 50 µm.
