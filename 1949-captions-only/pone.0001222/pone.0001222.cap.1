The structural network has 20 genes and we identified 50 links. Using the structural network as a template and the experimental dataset (gene expression levels of the 20 genes from 104 subjects quantified by real time-PCR), we reconstructed the T-cell activation network. The network contains the 20 genes and we identified 31 links (see <a href="#pone-0001222-t001">Table 1</a> for information about the weight, direction and previous biological knowledge of the links).</p>
