                Figure 1.  Network analysis of the human T-cell activation network:The structural network was obtained from co-expression analysis using the Ingenuity database. The structural network has 20 genes and we identified 50 links. Using the structural network as a template and the experimental dataset (gene expression levels of the 20 genes from 104 subjects quantified by real time-PCR), we reconstructed the T-cell activation network. The network contains the 20 genes and we identified 31 links (see Table 1 for information about the weight, direction and previous biological knowledge of the links).
