                Figure 4.  Comparison of the T-cell activation network after in vitro stimulation with jagged1, IFN-ß or Jagged1+IFN-ß:A) untreated patients versus stimulation with the Jagged1 agonistic peptide for 24 h; B) untreated patients versus stimulation with IFN-B for 24 h; C) untreated patients versus stimulation with JGA1+IFN- ß for 24 h. Comparisons between gene interaction weights are described using the following colour code: black: no change; green: decreased; red: increased. See Table 5 for statistical analysis.
