(n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) from day 0 to day 30 in two different experiments. Twelve animals (6 from each treatment group) were sacrificed by day 9 in order to perform immunological studies. Animals treated with the Jagged1 agonist peptide have a clinical (A) and histological (B) score lower than placebo animals. C) Representative spinal cord sections from placebo (a) and jagged1 (b) treated animals stained with Luxol-fast blue showing a decrease in the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and the extend of demyelination in the Jagged1 treated animals. FACS analysis assessing the percentage of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells (D) ELISPOT studies assessing the in vitro secretion of Th1 (INFγ), Th2 (IL-4) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines (E) and real-time PCR (F) studies in splenocytes from Jagged1 treated and untreated mice. D) Mice treated with Jagged1 peptide have higher percentage of Treg cells than placebo animals by day 9 p.i. (p = 0.032), and such difference disappeared by day 30. E) Splenocytes from Jagged1 treated mice expressed higher levels of IL-4, lower levels of IFNγ and similar levels of Il-17 than placebo animals at day 9 p.i. F) Jagged1 treated animals expressed higher levels of IL-10 and lower levels of TNFα and IL-17 than placebo animals at day 9 p.i. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM</p>
