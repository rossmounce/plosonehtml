There is a clear advantage for familiar face matching according to gender or identity, as well as a small but significant advantage for orientation matching. (b) The mean RT advantage by task for both the Experimental and Control groups. The speed advantage conferred by familiarity for Gender and Identity matching is significantly larger in the Experimental group. The Orientation speed advantage for the Control group is not significantly greater than zero, but is also not significantly smaller than the speed advantage seen in the Experimental group. In both panels, error bars represent +/âˆ’ 1 S.E.M.</p>
