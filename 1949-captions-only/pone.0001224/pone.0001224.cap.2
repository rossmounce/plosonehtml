                Figure 2. (A) MgZ in trans. Shown here is a specific combination of substrate and MgZ variant that generates the largest signal enhancement upon substrate cleavage. (B) Kinetic analyses. □ refers to the left y-axis (% cleavage); ○, +(−Mg) and×(−MgZ) refer to the right y-axis (F/Fo). The % cleavage vs. time data were fitted to Y = Yf(1–e−kct). Fitting-curve is shown as ---. Y, cleavage yield; Yf, final cleavage yield; kc, observed cleavage rate. The F/Fo vs. time data were fitted to F/Fo = initial F/Fo+(final F/Fo−initial F/Fo)×(1−e−kst); initial F/Fo = 1.0. Fitting curve is shown as —. F/Fo, fluorescence enhancement; ks, signal-enhancement rate. Cleavage rate = 1 min−1 with Yf = 91%. Signaling rate = 0.8-fold min−1 with final F/Fo = 26-fold. Reaction condition: 5 nM substrate, 1 µM DNAzyme, 70 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 40 mM MgCl2, 0.001% Tween-20, 30°C.
