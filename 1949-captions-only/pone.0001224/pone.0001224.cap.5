                Figure 5.  Initial rate of fluorescence enhancement vs. ATP concentration.Fitting curve: vo = (vmax√ó[ligand])/(Kd+[ligand]). vo, initial rate of signal enhancement (see Materials and Methods); vmax, maximal rate of signal enhancement; Kd, dissociation constant. Error bar represents the standard deviation of three independent assays. vo with 2 mM ATP was omitted in the curve fitting process due to substantial fluorescence quenching by high [ATP] (Figure S10). Inset: vo vs. low [ATP].
