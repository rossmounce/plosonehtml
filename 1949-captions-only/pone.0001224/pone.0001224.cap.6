(B) Phosphorimage of the radioactive cleavage assays. Cleavage reactions were carried out with 5 nM ADP-ASAP, 1 µM MgZ and 1 mM ADP (in the case of ADP-induced cleavage) in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.001% Tween-20 at room temperature. ▸, substrate; ▹, 3′ cleavage fragment. (C) Fluorescence kinetics in response to various ADP concentrations. Similar reaction conditions in panel B were applied.</p>
