                Figure 7.  Sensitivity and specificity of ADP sensor.(A) Initial rate of fluorescence enhancement vs. ADP concentration. Fitting curve: vo = (vmax×[ligand])/(Kd+[ligand]). Error bar: standard deviation of three independent assays. vo with 2 mM ADP was omitted in the curve fitting process due to fluorescence quenching by high [ADP] (Figure S10). Inset: vo vs. low [ADP]. (B) Fluorescence kinetics in response to non-cognate ligands. ado, adenosine; ×, 1 mM ado; +, 1 mM AMP; □, no ligand; ▵, 200 µM ATP; ▿, 300 µM ATP; ○, 400 µM ATP; •, 1 mM ATP.
