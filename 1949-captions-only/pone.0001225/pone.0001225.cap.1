(A,B and C, left portion) Signal intensity and SNP karyograms for each corresponding patient; the blue line represents the average fluorescent signal intensity of each SNP and oscillates around the diploid marker line; green tics represent heterozygous calls for each individual SNP. Areas of UPD are associated with the absence of heterozygous calls and are highlighted by blue and pink bars. Extraneous calls in regions of UPD occur as a result of contamination by non-clonal cells. UPD was confirmed by microsatellite analysis (data not shown). (C) In addition to chromosome 9, patient #36 also exhibited a segmental deletion in chromosome 12 as indicated by decreases in the copy number and frequency of heterozygous calls. (A,B, and C, right portion) Corresponding ARMS-PCR analysis of the JAK2 V617F mutation in each patient confirms heterozygous (A) and homozygous (B,C) mutational status (gel images are cropped and enhanced).</p>
