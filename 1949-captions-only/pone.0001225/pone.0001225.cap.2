                Figure 2.  SNP-A can be used to identify lesions acquired during AML evolution.SNP-A karyograms demonstrate that before transformation (A), patient #38 showed only UPD9p at initial diagnosis as a sole abnormality (consistent with a homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation) along with normal chromosomes 4 and 19. However, after transformation to AML (B), repeated SNP-A analysis showed the presence of a V617F- leukemic clone with a normal chromosome 9 and newly-acquired micro-deletions on both chromosomes 4 and 19.
