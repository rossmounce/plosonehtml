                Figure 3.  Karyotypic analysis of AML evolution in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation.Karyograms illustrate the contributing lesions in patient #34 (A, B) and patient #29 (D, E). In panels C and F, microsatellite analysis confirms the UPD for patients #34 and #29, respectively. In patient #34 (A,B,C), only one distinct clone was identified: in both granulocytes (A) and blasts (B), loss of heterozygosity calls on chromosome 9 confirms UPD9p, consistent with the homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation. In addition, both cell types also possess UPD on 7q. (C, left portion) Microsatellite analysis of blasts and granulocytes confirms LOH on 9p in both cell types. (C, right portion) Electrophoresis gel of ARMS-PCR in patient #34 also shows a homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation in both granulocytes and blasts (gel image is cropped and enhanced). In patient #29 (D,E,F), two distinct clones were identified using DNA isolated from both granulocytes and CD34+ blasts. In granulocytes (D), UPD9p is consistent with a homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation while analysis of chromosome 6 did not reveal any abnormalities. LOH on chromosome 9 was not completely resolved in the karyogram obtained; however, comparative analysis of granulocytes and lymphocytes confirmed allelic imbalance (red line: lymphocytes, green line: granulocytes). In contrast, when CD34- selected blasts were analyzed (E), UPD9p was not identified while a segmental deletion on chromosome 6 was found. In panel F, microsatellite analysis and electrophoresis gel of ARMS-PCR demonstrate the presence of homozygosity for the JAK2 V617F mutation in granulocytes but heterozygosity in CD34+ cells.
