                Figure 2.  Identification of a mutant EGFR gene expression profile.(A) A 194-gene signature that distinguishes EGFR-wild-type (WT) from -mutant NSCLC cell lines (treated with [+] or without [âˆ’] gefitinib) is aligned with the expression profiles from (B) the Michigan cohort (86 patients) and the Harvard cohort (84 patients) and (D) MCF-7 cells transfected with the indicated genes. A list of the genes that overlapped in all three data sets is indicated on the far right. (C) Numbers of patients in the Michigan and Harvard cohorts manifesting the mutant EGFR expression patterns (P&lt;0.05, Pearson's correlation), along with the number manifesting a randomly generated pattern (SD based on 100 simulations). (E) Venn diagram illustrating the overlap between signatures from the EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells and EGFR-transfected MCF-7 cells.
