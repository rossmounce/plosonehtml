A list of the genes that overlapped in all three data sets is indicated on the far right. (<em>C</em>) Numbers of patients in the Michigan and Harvard cohorts manifesting the mutant <em>EGFR</em> expression patterns (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05, Pearson's correlation), along with the number manifesting a randomly generated pattern (SD based on 100 simulations). (<em>E</em>) Venn diagram illustrating the overlap between signatures from the <em>EGFR</em>-mutant NSCLC cells and <em>EGFR</em>-transfected MCF-7 cells.</p>
