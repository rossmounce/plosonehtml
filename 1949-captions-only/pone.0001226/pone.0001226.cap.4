                Figure 4.  Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition decreases NSCLC anchorage-independent growth.Representative images of colonies of NSCLC cell lines (upper panels) were quantified (lower panels) after growing them in soft agar in the presence or absence of celecoxib. Results are the means of at least three independent experiments.
