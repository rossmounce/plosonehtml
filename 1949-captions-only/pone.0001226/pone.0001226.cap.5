                Figure 5.  Expression signature that distinguishes two types of EGFR mutations.A 194-gene signature present in EGFR-mutant but not EGFR–wild-type cell lines distinguishes L858R (P.M. [point mutation]) from Δ746–750 (deletion). Cells were treated with (+) or without (−) gefitinib. A partial list of the genes that are differentially expressed in the two groups is indicated on the right.
