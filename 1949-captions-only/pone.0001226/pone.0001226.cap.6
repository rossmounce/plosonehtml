                Figure 6.  Reciprocal regulation of EphA2 and EFNA1 in NSCLC cell lines.Quantitative PCR analysis (A, B) and western blotting (C) of EphA2 (A, C) and EFNA1 (B, C) in cell lines treated for 6 h with (+) or without (âˆ’) gefitinib. Quantitative PCR results represent the means of at least three independent experiments and were normalized based on expression of the housekeeping gene L32. The numbers under the bands are the results of densitometric analysis after normalizing for loading differences based on actin.
