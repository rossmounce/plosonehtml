                Figure 7.  EGFR TKI-induced changes in expression of EphA family members.Cells were treated for 6 h with vehicle, 1 µM gefitinib (A–E), or 1 µM erlotinib (F). RNA was extracted and subjected to quantitative PCR. Results represent the means of at least three independent experiments and were normalized based on L32 expression.
