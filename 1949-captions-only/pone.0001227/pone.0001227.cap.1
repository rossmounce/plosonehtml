                Figure 1.  Axolotl TGF-β1 protein sequence and domains.Alignment of axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) TGF-β1 amino acid sequence with TGF-β1 sequences of human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus) and TGF-β5 of Xenopus (Xenopus laevis). In blue are residues of the axolotl sequence that are conserved in the other three sequences. In red are the 9 conserved cysteine residues found in every TGF-β1 sequence. The red box identifies the pro-domain of the protein. The green box identifies the mature TGF-β domain of the protein.
