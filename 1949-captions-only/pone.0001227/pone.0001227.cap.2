                Figure 2.  Expression of TGF-β1 during axolotl limb regeneration.A) Expression of TGF-β1 determined by whole-mount in situ hybridization in axolotl forelimbs. Limbs were amputated distally through radius/ulna. Samples were fixed at various times after amputation: 6 hours (6 h), 48 hours (48 h), early bud (EB), late bud (LB) and early differentiation (ED) stage. TGF-β1 expression is found as a dark purple precipitate. The 3 stages on the upper row are part of the preparation phase of limb regeneration. The 2 stages on the lower row are part of the redevelopment phase of limb regeneration. B) Northern blot showing expression of TGF-β1 at various stages of forelimb regeneration. TGF-β1 was detected as a 3.4 Kb transcript. RNA was extracted from regenerating blastemas at various times after amputation: 6 hours (6 h), 24 hours (24 h), 48 hours (48 h), early bud (EB), late bud (LB), palette (PAL) and early differentiation (ED) stage. T = 0: RNA was extracted from an unamputated mature limb. The dotted line marks a distinction between regeneration stages included in the preparation phase and those included in the redevelopment phase of regeneration.
