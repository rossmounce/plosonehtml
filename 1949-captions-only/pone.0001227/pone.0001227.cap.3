                Figure 3.  Detection of TGF-β receptors and target genes in axolotl cells.A) Presence of TGF-β receptors after affinity labeling of axolotl AL-1 cell line with [125I]-TGF-β1. Lane 1: (NIP): Cell lysates were not immuno-precipitated. A band corresponding to TGF-β RI around 65 kDa can be observed. Lane 2: Proteins were immuno-precipitated with anti-TGF-β RI antibody. A band corresponding to TGF-β RI at 65 kDa is also observed in this lane. Two other bands were observed in this lane. These bands correspond to unspecified proteins that co-immuno-precipitated with TGF-β RI. Lane 3: Proteins were immuno-precipitated with anti-TGF-β RII antibody. No band was detected. Lane 4: Proteins were immuno-precipitated with anti-TGF-β RIII/betaglycan antibody. A diffuse band of high molecular weight (200–350 kDa) corresponding to TGF-β RIII/betaglycan was detected. B) Western blot experiment showing the presence of TGF-β RII in axolotl AL-1 cells. Ctl lane represents TGF-β RII protein expression in control axolotl cells not exposed to U.V. light. Other lanes present diminished expression of TGF-β RII in axolotl cells exposed to 500 J/m2 U.V. and collected after 6 h, 12 h and 24 h. Expression of TGF-β RII in control cells at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h was stable (data not shown). Loading control (tubulin) confirms equal loading of protein samples. C) RT-PCR results of PAI-1 and fibronectin expression in AL-1 cells after stimulation with human recombinant TGF-β1. Strong up-regulation of both genes was observed after stimulating cells with 25 or 100 pM TGF-β1. Up-regulation was detected 3 h and 72 h after stimulation for PAI-1 and fibronectin respectively. The human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was used as a positive control for fibronectin induction at 72 h. Ctl: control cells treated only with 4 mM HCl, 0,1% bovine serum albumin buffer (TGF-β1 carrier solution) . L: 100 base-pair DNA ladder with the most intense band at 600 bp. GAPDH was used as a control gene. D) RT-PCR results showing PAI-1 expression in AL-1 cells after stimulation with DMSO, human recombinant TGF-β1 and human recombinant TGF-β1 in the presence of SB-431542. The TGF-β1 stimulated expression of PAI-1 was significantly inhibited by SB-431542.
