                Figure 4.  Inhibition of limb regeneration by SB-431542.A) Morphology of axolotl regenerating forelimbs treated with SB-431542. Top row: morphology of a regenerating control limb treated with DMSO. All limbs were distally amputated on the same day. Limbs were photographed when control limbs reached each of the stages indicated on top: early bud (EB), late bud (LB), early differentiation (ED). Complete: regeneration of control limb ended after 30 days. Middle row: morphology of an axolotl limb treated with 25 µM SB-431542 from the time of amputation until the control had regenerated (30 days). Complete inhibition of regeneration and absence of blastema formation were observed in these limbs. Bottom row: morphology of an axolotl limb treated with 25 µM SB-431542 from early bud stage until the control had regenerated. Growth of the blastema was observed in these limbs until it resembled a late bud blastema. B) Inhibition of regeneration with SB-431542 cannot be rescued after 7 or 14 days of treatment. In this panel, limbs were treated with DMSO or SB-431542 from the moment of amputation for the first 7 or 14 days only. Results show that limbs treated with SB-431542 for the first 7 or 14 days after amputation do not regenerate even if treatment was stopped. Control limbs treated for 7 and 14 days with DMSO regenerated normally.
