Samples treated with 25 ÂµM SB-431542 from time of amputation were fixed at B) 45 minutes, D) 2 hours, F) 6 hours, H) 48 hours, J) 72 hours and L) 7 days after amputation. Masson's trichrome staining method was used to stain cell cytoplasm in red, collagen in blue and nuclei in black. Note the delayed closure of the wound epithelium in SB-431542 treated limbs at 45 minutes and 2 hours post-amputation. Also note that there is no blastema formation or accumulation of cells between the tip of the bone and the wound epithelium in SB-431542 treated limbs.</p>
