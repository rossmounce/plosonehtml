                Figure 6.  Inhibition of cellular proliferation in regenerating limbs treated with SB-431542.A) Control regenerating limb treated with DMSO and assessed for BrdU incorporation at 7 days post-amputation (medium bud stage). Red arrowhead marks a cell positive for BrdU. Note the accumulation of BrdU-positive cells in the regenerating blastema. Cells positive for BrdU are also found (at a lower frequency) in the epidermis of the non-regenerating part of the limb. B) SB-431542 treated limb assessed for BrdU incorporation 7 days post-amputation. No accumulation of BrdU-positive cells at the tip of the limb is observed. Only a few positive cells are found mostly in the epidermis of the limb (red arrowhead). Dotted lines in panels A and B represent the level of amputation. C) Graph comparing percentage of BrdU-positive cells in the regenerating blastema of control limbs (n = 3 animals) and in SB-431542 treated limbs (n = 3 animals). A statistically significant difference in the percentage of BrdU positive cells between control (38%±6.2%) and SB-431542 treated limbs (7%±2.1%) was observed (*** p&lt;0.001).
