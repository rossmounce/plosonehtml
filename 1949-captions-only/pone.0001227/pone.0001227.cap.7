                Figure 7.  Inhibition of TGF-β1 target genes expression in regenerating limbs treated with SB-431542.A) RT-PCR showing expression of fibronectin and Runx 2 in axolotl regenerating forelimbs. RT-PCR reactions were performed on at least 4 separate RNA samples extracted from pools of 6 blastemas of animals treated with DMSO or SB-431542. Fibronectin and Runx 2 were strongly expressed in control limbs and significantly down-regulated in limbs treated with SB-431542. GAPDH was used as a control. B) Graph representing the relative value of fibronectin/GAPDH and Runx 2/GAPDH expression in control and SB-431542 treated limbs. Fibronectin and Runx 2 relative expression in control limbs were fixed to 1±0.37 and 1±0.09 respectively. The relative expression values in SB-431542 treated limbs were 0.29±0.23 with a p&lt;0.05 (*) for fibronectin and 0.07±0.01 with a p&lt;0.001 (***) for Runx 2.
