                Figure 2.  Percentage of mitotic cells in ventral mesoderm population.A) Numbers of mitotic cells scored in 19 embryos from HH4-10. For HH4-5 embryos, cells in the lateral half of the mesoderm population from the posterior half the embryo are scored. For HH6-10 embryos, mesoderm cells in blood-island forming lateral region are scored. B) Statistical representation of mitotic index in ventral mesoderm population from HH4-10.
