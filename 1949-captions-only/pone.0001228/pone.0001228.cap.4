                Figure 4.  Summary of mitoses observed during time-lapse imaging.A) Three examples of scored mitoses throughout 11-hour live imaging. Images were captured with the frequency of one frame per minute. Multiple dots in a given frame represent multiple mitoses. B) Division rate (as a percentage of total labeled cells) in any given 100 frames (100 minutes). C) Summary.
