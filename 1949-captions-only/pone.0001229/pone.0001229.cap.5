                Figure 5.  ELISPOT splenocyte responses.These include responses to peptide pools (A, J and L), the peptide epitope F9.1 (sequence GFAEINPIA) and rec.AhpC following prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination in A) low dose (105) and B) high dose (108) MAP K37 infection. C = Vector only control, V = Vaccine. Low dose prophylactic results correspond to Control (Grp12) and Vaccine (Grp13); Low dose therapeutic results correspond to Control (Grp17) and Vaccine (Grp18); High dose prophylactic results correspond to Control (Grp14) and Vaccine (Grp15); High dose therapeutic results correspond to Control (Grp19) and Vaccine (Grp20) as shown in Fig. 2.
