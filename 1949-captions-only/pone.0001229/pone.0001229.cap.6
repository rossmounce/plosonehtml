                Figure 6.  Antibody responses to vaccination.A) ELISA IgGtotal responses in naïve uninfected mice, to peptide pools (A–N), the peptide epitope F9.1 (sequence GFAEINPIA) and recombinant vaccine antigens (AhpC, Mpa) 4 weeks after Ad5.HAV-prime/MVA.HAV-boost vaccination. C = Control (Grp3), V = Vaccine (Grp4) from Experiment 1B. B) ELISA IgGtotal responses to peptide pool A, the peptide epitope F9.1 (sequence GFAEINPIA) and rec.AhpC following prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination in low dose (105) and high dose (108) MAP K37 infection. C = Vector only control, V = Vaccine. Low dose prophylactic results correspond to Control (Grp12) and Vaccine (Grp13); Low dose therapeutic results correspond to Control (Grp17) and Vaccine (Grp18); High dose prophylactic results correspond to Control (Grp14) and Vaccine (Grp15); High dose therapeutic results correspond to Control (Grp19) and Vaccine (Grp20) as shown in Fig. 2.
