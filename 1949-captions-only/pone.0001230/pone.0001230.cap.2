                Figure 2.  Crown form, wear pattern, and microstructure in Nigersaurus taqueti.Wear facets and surface detail is from a worn crown (MNN GAD513), and enamel and dentine microstructure is from left premaxillary teeth in cross-section (MNN GAD514). (A)-Crown in lingual (interior) view showing low-angle wear facet. Magnified views of a cast of the lingual wear facet showing (B)-wear striations in the dentine and (C)-the edge of the facet. (D)-Crown in labial (exterior) view showing high-angle wear facet. Magnified views of a cast of the labial facet showing (E)-coarse scratches on the dentine and (F)-fine scratches on the edge of the facet. (G)-Transverse thin section of two successive premaxillary crowns showing thickened labial enamel and circumferential incremental lines of von Ebner in the dentine. (H)-Magnified view of the older (left) crown showing approximately 60 incremental lines of von Ebner. Scale bar in A and D equals 5 mm; scale bar below F equals 0.5 mm in B, E and F and 1.11 mm in C. Abbreviations: de, dentine; en, enamel; fe, facet edge; g, gouge; s, scratch.
