                Figure 4.  Calibrated phylogeny of diplodocoid sauropods.The diagram is based on strict consensus of five minimum-length trees using 13 ingroup taxa and 102 unordered characters (CI = 0.76; RI = 0.78) (Text S5). Scaled icons represent a diplodocid (Apatosaurus) [11], dicraeosaurid (Dicraeosaurus) [51], and a rebbachisaurid (Nigersaurus). Geographic distributions include Laurasian diplodocoids (western North America—Apatasaurus, Diplodocus, Suuwassea; Europe—Histriasaurus, Spanish rebbachisaurid) and Gondwanan diplodocoids (South America—Cathartesaura, Limaysaurus, Zapalasaurus; Africa—Rebbachisaurus, Nigersaurus). Temporal boundaries based on a recent timescale [52]. Color scheme: Laurasia (orange); Gondwana (blue); North America (solid orange); Europe (striped orange); South America (blue); Africa (striped blue).
