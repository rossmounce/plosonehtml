                Figure 1.  Schematic of the CIRES concept.The expression patterns of about 1000 glycan-related genes were profiled in a set of six different cell lines (A–F) by comparing the microarray binding of cellular cDNA and reference polyA(+) RNA and calculating the relative expression values (Table S1). The polygons in the left web graphs represent the relative gene expression profiles of eight glycan-related genes selected as examples. In these graphs, the difference in relative gene expression is expressed on a log scale, where the edge of the polygon corresponds to the strongest expression in each cell line (A–F). The same set of six cell lines were examined for cell-surface glycan expression using fluorescently labeled plant lectins and flow cytometry; the strength of the glycan expression is plotted as relative values among the six lines, where the edge of the polygon represents the strongest expression (web graph on top right). The glycan expression profiles were analyzed for correlations with the glycan-related gene expression profiles. Similarities and dissimilarities between the profiles were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, which has values ranging from -1 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation). A complete list of the genes found to be positively or negatively correlated with plant lectin staining patterns is presented in Table S2. Genes known to affect the biosynthesis of an epitope were selected from among the correlated genes (shown for each lectin in the tables on the right in Figures 2–6). A correlated gene identified by CIRES was confirmed as the gene responsible for regulating the biosynthesis of a particular glycan by transferring the gene into another cell line of the set, via gene transfer techniques such as retrovirus-mediated overexpression, and looking for a related change in epitope expression.
