The correlation orders of the glycan-related genes selected from the complete list of correlated genes (<a href="#pone.0001232.s002">Table S2</a>) are indicated as numbers in parentheses in the box for each gene, with a smaller number indicating a stronger correlation between gene expression and glycan expression profiles. Genes with a negative correlation are indicated by an N before the order number. The lectins used were (A) PHA-L4, (C) SSA, and (D) PNA. Lectin epitopes shown in the figures are taken from the literature unless otherwise specified <a href="#pone.0001232-Kuno1">[17]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001232-Cummings1">[51]</a>. (B) Namalwa cells were infected with MSCV harboring <em>MGAT5-IRES-EGFP</em>. Control cells were infected with empty vector (<em>IRES-EGFP</em>) or the same vector encoding <em>B3GNT2</em> or <em>MGAT3</em>. Flow cytometry results for PHA-L4 staining were compared between EGFP-positive cells (solid line) and EGFP-negative cells (dashed line).</p>
