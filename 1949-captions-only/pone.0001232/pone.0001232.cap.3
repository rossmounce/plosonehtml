                Figure 3.  CIRES analyses of staining profiles obtained using lectins that recognize terminal glycan structures and have unknown epitope-expression-regulating enzymes.Presentation is the same as in Fig. 2 except that the plant lectins used were (A) LCA, (B) UEA-I, and (C) RCA 120. N.D. in the gene order list indicates that no gene was determined to have a correlation with the lectin staining.
