N.D. in the gene order list indicates that no significant correlation was detected. (B, D) Flow cytometric staining patterns for EGFP-positive Namalwa cells are shown in bold lines, and those for EGFP-negative (control) cells are shown in gray dashed lines. The overexpression of <em>MGAT5</em> resulted in a subtle (60%) increase in DSA staining. The overexpression of <em>MGAT3</em> resulted in a 2-fold increase in PHA-E4 staining. (E) PHA-E4 lectin blotting was performed using the membrane fraction of the same set of cell lines. A plot of the quantified signals reveals differences in the PHA-E4 staining profile among the six cell lines (C, E), as discussed in the text.</p>
