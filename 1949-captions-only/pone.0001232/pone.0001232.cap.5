The epitopes of the two different lectins of MAM, MAL and MAH, are illustrated separately. WGA essentially recognizes a cluster of N-acetyl groups, as indicated, and thus required Neu5Ac as a Sia species. Con-A recognizes mannose-containing glycans with varying affinities. High-mannose-type glycans (upper diagram in (D)) bind best to this lectin. (B) Namalwa cells were infected with retroviruses encoding various GlcNAc transferases. The MAM staining patterns of the EGFP-positive populations of each infectant are shown. <em>MGAT5</em> overexpression did not shift the staining pattern in comparison with the vector control (data not shown).</p>
