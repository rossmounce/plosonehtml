                Figure 6.  CIRES analyses of staining profiles obtained using the lectin ABA.(A) Presentation is the same as in Fig. 2 except that ABA was used. (B) Effect of sialidase treatment on the binding of ABA and PNA in B cells. (See text for the specificity of the sialidase and Fig. 2D for the PNA epitope.) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for the staining with each lectin (bold lines) are shown at the top. Dashed lines indicate the results from the non-staining control.
