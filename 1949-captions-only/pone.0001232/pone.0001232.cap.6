(B) Effect of sialidase treatment on the binding of ABA and PNA in B cells. (See text for the specificity of the sialidase and <a href="#pone-0001232-g002">Fig. 2D</a> for the PNA epitope.) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for the staining with each lectin (bold lines) are shown at the top. Dashed lines indicate the results from the non-staining control.</p>
