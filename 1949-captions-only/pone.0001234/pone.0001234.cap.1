Exons are represented by blue bars. The rs numbers of the SNPs typed in the present study are shown. SNPs genotyped by Liu et al. <a href="#pone.0001234-Liu3">[22]</a> are indicated by arrowheads (those SNPs that showed significant association with schizophrenia are shown in red arrowheads). The association observed with the three SNPs at the 3â€²end of <em>RTN4R</em> was independent from the association observed more proximally in the vicinity of the <em>ZDHHC8</em> gene <a href="#pone.0001234-Liu3">[22]</a>. (B) Complete amino acid sequence of <em>RTN4R</em>. Rare coding variants identified in the U.S. schizophrenia sample are shown in blue (synonymous) or red (missense). Two missense variants reported by Sinibaldi et al. <a href="#pone.0001234-Sinibaldi1">[31]</a> are shaded in grey. (C) Evolutionary conservation across species of the missense variants identified in this study at amino acid positions 134 (top) and 347 (bottom). (D) Surface (left) and cartoon (right) representation of the crystal structure of the ligand-binding ectodomain of RTN4R. The variant at residue 134, drawn in red, is shown as the wild-type threonine (top) and the mutated methionine (bottom). Prepared using Pymol (DeLano Scientific, LLC, San Francisco, CA).</p>
