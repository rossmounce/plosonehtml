(B) Exon II of <em>Rtn4r</em> was replaced by the self-excisable pACN cassette including the <em>neo</em> gene for selection. Genomic DNA was digested with <em>Xba</em>I and the 3′ probe was used for southern blot analysis. A PCR strategy was designed to genotype offspring using primer sets A1/A2 and B1/B2. (C) Genomic southern blot of ES cell DNA and tail biopsies. Wild-type fragments were 14.6-kb, recombinant fragments from ES cells were 7.4-kb, and recombinant fragments from tail biopsies after pACN cassette excision were 3.8-kb. (D) PCR genotyping of tail biopsies using primer sets A1/A2 and B1/B2. Wild-type mice yielded 2.2-kb and 0.5-kb fragments from sets A1/A2 and B1/B2 respectively; homozygotes yielded 0.7-kb and no fragment, respectively; and heterozygotes yielded 0.7-kb and 0.5-kb fragments, respectively. (E) Northern blot of total brain RNA using a <em>Rtn4r</em> 3′UTR probe. (F) RT-PCR of total brain RNA using isoform-specific primers for <em>Rtn4r</em> exon II.</p>
