                Figure 2.  Targeting the Rtn4r locus for homologous recombination.(A) Gene map of the Rtn4r locus at mouse chromosome 16. (B) Exon II of Rtn4r was replaced by the self-excisable pACN cassette including the neo gene for selection. Genomic DNA was digested with XbaI and the 3′ probe was used for southern blot analysis. A PCR strategy was designed to genotype offspring using primer sets A1/A2 and B1/B2. (C) Genomic southern blot of ES cell DNA and tail biopsies. Wild-type fragments were 14.6-kb, recombinant fragments from ES cells were 7.4-kb, and recombinant fragments from tail biopsies after pACN cassette excision were 3.8-kb. (D) PCR genotyping of tail biopsies using primer sets A1/A2 and B1/B2. Wild-type mice yielded 2.2-kb and 0.5-kb fragments from sets A1/A2 and B1/B2 respectively; homozygotes yielded 0.7-kb and no fragment, respectively; and heterozygotes yielded 0.7-kb and 0.5-kb fragments, respectively. (E) Northern blot of total brain RNA using a Rtn4r 3′UTR probe. (F) RT-PCR of total brain RNA using isoform-specific primers for Rtn4r exon II.
