                Figure 3.  Behavioral characterization of Rtn4r-deficient mice.(A) Total distance traveled, (B) mean number of rears, and (C) ratio of center traveled distance/margin traveled distance in a 20-min open field test. (D) Number of dark-to-light transitions in a 10-min dark/light transition test. (E) PPI using combinations of one startle level (120 dB) and three prepulse levels (70, 80 and 85 dB). (F) Startle response at 120 dB. (G) Contextual and cued fear-conditioning paradigm. Activity (beam breaks) was measured at baseline, after reintroduction into the same context where training occurred (context), at baseline in an altered context (altered), and after presentation of the cued conditioned stimulus in the altered environment (cue). (H) Accuracy in a working memory test after a 5-sec or 20-sec inter-trial delay using a delayed alternation T-maze assay. (I) Mean time spent immobile in a tail suspension test. All results shown are from combined sexes. All data are represented as meanÂ±S.E.M.
