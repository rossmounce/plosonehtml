Animals were injected with MK-801 or saline for 4 consecutive days during either P7–10 or P11–14; behavioral testing was conducted at P62 and P63. (C) Relative effect of MK-801 injection normalized to saline injection on time spent moving. (D) Average percentage of PPI (measured at P91) in animals injected during either P7–10 or P11–14. (E) Mean startle response to a 40 ms, 120 dB acoustic stimulus in animals injected during either P7–10 or P11–14. Startle response was measured at P91.</p>
