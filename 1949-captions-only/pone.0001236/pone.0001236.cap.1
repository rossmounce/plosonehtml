                Figure 1.  Hazard Ratios of PrP Genotypes.Comparison of hazard ratios and their s.e. for lambs with different PrP genotypes during three postnatal periods. S1-14: survival from 1 d to 14 d; S15-120: survival from 15 d to 120 d; S121-180: survival from 121 d to 180 d. Genotypes ARR/ARR, ARR/AHQ, ARQ/ARQ and ARQ/AHQ were compared relative to ARR/ARQ genotype. Hazard ratios with “*” are significantly different from 1 (P&lt;0.05) after adjustment for multiple tests using Bonferroni correction.
