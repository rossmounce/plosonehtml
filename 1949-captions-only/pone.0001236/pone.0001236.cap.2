                Figure 2.  Test of Dominance between ARR and ARQ Alleles.The ratios are for testing dominance interaction between ARR and ARQ alleles by comparing the hazard ratios between the geometric mean of the homozygous genotypes (ARR/ARR and ARQ/ARQ) relative to the ARR/ARQ genotype during three postnatal periods. S1-14: survival from 1 d to 14 d; S15-120: survival from 15 d to 120 d; S121-180: survival from 121 d to 180 d. Periods with “*” indicate significant (P&lt;0.05) dominance effect.
