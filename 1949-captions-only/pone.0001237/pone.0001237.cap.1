                Figure 1.  Evaluation of 4OHT-induced Cre recombination in R26CreERT; R26R mice.After 10 days of 4OHT or vehicle control (DMSO) injection, LacZ reporter activity in the systemic organs including brain, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, intestine and reproductive tracts of R26CreERT;R26R mice (2 males and 2 females) were examined by X-gal staining and compared with those of the control mice. The representative X-gal staining patterns in the systemic organs of a DMSO-treated control male mouse and the reproductive organs of a control female mouse are shown in the left panels. Representative X-gal positive (blue) patterns reflecting inducible Cre activity are shown in the other panels (middle, 4OHT-treated R26CreERT;R26R female; right, 4OHT-treated R26CreERT;R26R male). A, adrenal gland; AP, anterior prostate; B, bladder; O, ovary; Ov, oviduct; SV, seminal vesicle; U, uterus; VD, vas deferens
