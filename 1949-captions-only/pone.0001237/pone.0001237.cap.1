The representative X-gal staining patterns in the systemic organs of a DMSO-treated control male mouse and the reproductive organs of a control female mouse are shown in the left panels. Representative X-gal positive (blue) patterns reflecting inducible Cre activity are shown in the other panels (middle, 4OHT-treated <em>R26CreER<sup>T</sup>;R26R</em> female; right, 4OHT-treated <em>R26CreER<sup>T</sup>;R26R</em> male). A, adrenal gland; AP, anterior prostate; B, bladder; O, ovary; Ov, oviduct; SV, seminal vesicle; U, uterus; VD, vas deferens</p>
