The <em>CreER<sup>T</sup></em> fusion protein (inactive) was initially expressed under a ubiquitous promoter ROSA26. The 4OHT inducer was used to temporally active the CreER<sup>T</sup> recombinase activity, which resulted in the excision of the DNA fragment containing the <em>Pten exon 5.</em> (B). PCR genotyping of the Pten floxed allele and Cre-mediated exon 5 excision; After one week of 4OHT injection, genomic DNA was isolated individually from multiple organs including the lung, the liver, the intestine, the kidney, the spleen, the thymus, the tail, the anterior prostate and the uterus of mice carrying different genotypes (C, <em>Pten<sup>fx/+</sup></em>; 1, <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/+</sup></em> male; 2, <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/+</sup></em> female; 3, <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> male; 4, <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> female). PCR genotyping is shown that allows the identification of the Pten floxed allele (~1100-bp), the wild-type (~1000-bp) and the exon 5 excised alleles (Δ5; ~400-bp) from the 4OHT-treated mice. (C). Immunostaining of PTEN in the prostate and the colon. Representative merged images of the immunofluorescence analysis reveal the expression level of PTEN in the anterior prostate lobe (at 7 weeks post-4OHT treatment) and the colon (at 37 weeks post-4OHT treatment) of the <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/+</sup></em> and <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> mice. Antibody against PTEN (green) and TROMA-I antibody against cytokeratin 8 (CK8; red) were used to study the expression of PTEN in the simple epithelial subsets. Arrows indicated the coexpression of PTEN and CK8 (yellow) in anterior prostate gland and colon epithelium of <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/+</sup></em> mice (left panels), whereas the hyperplastic epithelial subsets (middle panels; red) of the <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> mice showing PTEN loss (arrowheads). In addition, the immunofluorescence images in the right panels reveal PTEN loss in the tumor lesions of prostate and colon of <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> males (at 13 and 39 weeks, respectively).
