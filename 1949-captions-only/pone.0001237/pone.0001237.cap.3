Tumor-free survival, tumor spectrum and tumor incidence of R26-Ptenfx/fx mice.(A) Tumor-free survival of Ptenfx/fx, R26-Ptenfx/+ and R26-Ptenfx/fx mice; (B) Tumor-free survival of male and female R26-Ptenfx/fx mice; (C) Tumor spectrum and incidence of male and female R26-Ptenfx/fx mice; Lym, lymphomas; PC, prostate cancer; EC, endometrial cancer; IC, intestinal cancer; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; The percentage of each tumor type is shown on the right of bar graph. (D) Tumor latency of the R26-Ptenfx/fx mice; each dot represents an individual malignant tumor in the R26-Ptenfx/fx mice. ⧫, Lymphoma (Lym); ▪, Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); ▴, Intestinal cancer (IC); •, prostate cancer (PC); Bars represent the mean tumor latency.
