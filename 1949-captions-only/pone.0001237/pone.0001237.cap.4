                Figure 4.  Characterization of R26-Ptenfx/fx lymphomas.(A) Gross morphology of a R26-Ptenfx/fx thymic tumor enlarged compared to the control (ctrl) thymus. H&amp;E stained section of a R26-Pten fx/fx thymic tumor reveals the morphology of the small lymphocytic cells in comparison to the control (ctrl). C, cortex; M, medulla; Scale Bar, 200 µm (B) Infiltrated lymphocytic tumor cells (arrows) in the liver of a R26-Ptenfx/fx mouse characterized by H&amp;E (left) and IHC antibodies against CD3 (middle; positive stained brown cells) and B220 (right; negative stained blue cells), which allow the assessment of the origin of the tumor. Scale bar, 200m; High-power views of CD3 or B220 IHC are inserted (scale bar, 100 µm). (C) Flow cytometry analysis of thymocyte suspensions from a control and a R26-Ptenfx/fx mouse stained with antibodies against CD4 and CD8. Percentage of cells is indicated in each quadrant.
