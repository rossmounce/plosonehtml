H&amp;E stained section of a <em>R26-Pten<sup> fx/fx</sup></em> thymic tumor reveals the morphology of the small lymphocytic cells in comparison to the control (ctrl). C, cortex; M, medulla; Scale Bar, 200 µm (B) Infiltrated lymphocytic tumor cells (arrows) in the liver of a <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> mouse characterized by H&amp;E (left) and IHC antibodies against CD3 (middle; positive stained brown cells) and B220 (right; negative stained blue cells), which allow the assessment of the origin of the tumor. Scale bar, 200m; High-power views of CD3 or B220 IHC are inserted (scale bar, 100 µm). (C) Flow cytometry analysis of thymocyte suspensions from a control and a <em>R26-Pten<sup>fx/fx</sup></em> mouse stained with antibodies against CD4 and CD8. Percentage of cells is indicated in each quadrant.</p>
