                Figure 5.   R26-Ptenfx/fx epithelial malignancies.Representative histology (middle panels; H&amp;E) and E-cadherin IHC (right panels; E-cad; NovaRed) of malignant tumors of R26-Ptenfx/fx prostate, uterus, colorectum and skin tissue are showed to compare with the normal corresponding organs (left panels; H&amp;E) from control mice. Red arrowheads indicated the invasive border of the prostatic, endometrial and colorectal cancers. High-magnification views of E-cadherin IHC revealing intense membranous staining are shown in the inserted photos (Bars, 100 µm). Bidirectional arrows indicated the endometrial portions. M, myometrium; E, endometrium; Scale bars, 200 µm.
