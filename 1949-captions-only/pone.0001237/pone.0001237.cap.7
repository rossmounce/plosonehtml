                Figure 7.  Prostate tumor progression of the R26-Ptenfx/fx prostate.(A) Gross view (upper panels) and H&amp;E staining (lower panels) of the anterior prostate of control (at 27 weeks 4OHT post-treatment) and of R26-Ptenfx/fx mice (at 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 30 weeks after 4OHT post-treatment); B, bladder; SV, seminal vesicle; AP (encircled in upper panels), anterior prostate; Arrows indicate the invasive border of the prostate epithelium and stroma. (B) IHC of p-AKT (Ser473) reveal the strong membranous localization of p-AKT in the BPH, PIN and prostate cancer samples of the R26-Ptenfx/fx mice compared to the normal epithelium of the control mice. (C) IF with antibodies against CK5 (green) and CK8 (red) reveal stratification and expansion of the basal and lumen epithelium in the BPH, PIN and prostate cancer samples of the R26-Ptenfx/fx mice compared to the normal epithelium of the control mice. Arrows indicate the focal CK5/CK8 (K5/K8) double-positive cells.
