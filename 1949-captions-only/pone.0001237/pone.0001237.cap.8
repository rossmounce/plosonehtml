                Figure 8.  Suppressive effect of LY294002 on the Pten-deficient prostate enlargement.(A) The bar graph represented the relative weight (mean) of the anterior prostate lobe (AP weight in mg/body weight in g) of each group (n&gt; = 3). The p value was calculated by Student's t-test. Error bars represent the standard derivation. (B) Dissected anterior prostates of control (Ptenfx/fx) and of R26-Ptenfx/fx mice in the absence or presence of LY294002 for 4 weeks; these are shown as a gross view (upper panels) and with H&amp;E staining (middle panels). IHC of p-AKT(Ser473) is shown in the lower panels. Arrow indicates the focal positive for p-AKT in the LY294002-treated R26-Ptenfx/fx prostate.
