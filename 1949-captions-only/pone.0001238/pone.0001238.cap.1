(A) Isolated rat lungs were perfused for 1 h with 40 or 60 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>with pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4 or pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.2 and alveolar fluid reabsorbtion (AFR) was measured as described in the experimental procedures. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). (B) Passive movement of Na<sup>+</sup> (closed bars) and <sup>3</sup>H-Mannitol (open bars) was measured as described in detail in the supplementary methods. Graph represents the mean±SEM (n = 5). Differences among groups were not statistically significant. (C) Albumin flux from the pulmonary circulation into the alveolar space was determined from the fraction of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled albumin, placed in the perfusate that appeared in the alveolar instillate during the experimental protocol. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). Differences among groups were not statistically significant. (D) A three hour experiment was performed in isolated rat lungs. Lungs were perfused for 1h with 40 mmHg CO<sub>2</sub>, switched to 60 mmHg CO<sub>2</sub> for the second hour, and back to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2</sub> for the third hour (pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4). Alveolar fluid reabsorption (AFR) was measured as described in the experimental procedures. Graph represents the mean±SEM of 5 independent experiments. Bars in panels A, B and C represent the mean from different groups of animals. Bars in panel D represent the mean of single samples from the same group of animals. pH<sub>e</sub>: extracellular pH. *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01.</p>
