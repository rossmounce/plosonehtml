                Figure 2.  Na,K-ATPase function is impaired in rat lungs exposed to hypercapnic acidosis.(A) Basolateral membranes (BLM) were purified from the peripheral lung tissue of rat lungs exposed to 40 mmHg CO2 (pHe: 7.4) or 60 mmHg CO2 (pHe: 7.2), and Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 3). (B) BLM and total membranes were purified from the peripheral lung tissue of rat lungs treated as (A), and Na,K-ATPase protein abundance was assessed by Western blot. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 3). Representative blots of Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit at the BLM and total membrane protein abundance are shown. pHe: extracellular pH. * p&lt;0.05.
