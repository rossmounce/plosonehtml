Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). (B) ATII cells were treated as described in (A) and the Na,K-ATPase protein abundance at the plasma membrane (PM) was determined by biotin-streptavidin pull down and subsequent Western blot. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). Representative blots of Na,K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub>-subunit at the PM and total protein abundance are shown. (C) Live cell imaging of GFPα<sub>1</sub>-A549. Cells were exposed to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 10 min (left panels) and then switched to 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) (right, upper panel) or to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.2) (right, lower panel) for 30 min. White arrows indicate the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase. (D) Live cell imaging of GFPα<sub>1</sub>-A549. Cells were exposed to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 10 min (left panel), switched to 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) (middle panel) for 30 min and switched back to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 60 min (left panel). White arrows indicate the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.</p>
