                Figure 4.  Effects of high CO2 and extracellular acidosis on intracellular pH.Intracelluar pH (pHi) was measured in real time as the change in fluorescence intensity of ATII cells loaded with BCECF/AM and exposed approximately 3 min to 40 mmHg, and then for the indicated time to 60, 80 and 120 mmHg CO2 with pHe: 7.4, or 40 mmHg with pHe: 7.2. pHe: extracellular pH.
