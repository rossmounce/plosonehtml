Representative blots for PKCα, PKCε and PKCζ are shown (n = 3). (B) ATII cells were incubated with vehicle, 5 µM PKCε inhibitory peptide or 0.1 µM PKCζ inhibitory peptide 1 h prior to being exposed to 40 or 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 30 min. Na,K-ATPase protein abundance at the PM was determined by biotin-streptavidin pull down and subsequent Western blot. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). Representative blots of Na,K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub>-subunit at the PM and total protein abundance are shown. (C) A549 cells expressing an empty vector or a DN-PKCζ were exposed to 40 or 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 30 min. The Na,K-ATPase protein abundance at the PM was determined as above. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). Representative blots of Na,K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub>-subunit at the PM and total protein abundance are shown. (D) Isolated rat lungs from rats infected with Sham-surfactant, with null adenoviral vector (Ad-null), and adenoviral vector with DN PKCζ construct (Ad-DN-PKCζ) were perfused for 1 h with 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) or with 60 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.2), and AFR was measured as described in the <a href="#s4">Methods</a> section. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). (E) Lungs from rats infected with Sham, Ad-null and Ad-DN-PKCζ were thoroughly rinsed with ice-cold PBS, tissue was homogenized, and the abundance of PKCζ protein abundance was determined by Western blot. Representative Western blots of PKCζ and actin (loading control) are shown. (F) Lung tissues from rats infected with Sham, Ad-null and Ad-DN-PKCζ were thoroughly rinsed with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed as described in the Online Data Supplement. Magnification x40. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.</p>
