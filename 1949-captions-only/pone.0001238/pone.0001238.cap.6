Upper panel shows a representative autoradiography. Lower panel depicts a representative Western blot (n = 3; p&lt;0.05 when comparing 40 mmHg vs 120 mmHg). (B) A549 cells expressing the rat GFPα<sub>1</sub>-subunit Na,K-ATPase (WT) or the rat GFP-S18A α<sub>1</sub>-subunit (S18A) were exposed to 40 or 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 30 min. The Na,K-ATPase protein abundance at the plasma membrane (PM) was determined by biotin-streptavidin pull down and subsequent Western blot. Graph represents the mean±SEM, (n = 5). Representative blots of Na,K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub>-subunit at the PM and total protein abundance are shown. (C) Live cell imaging of A549 cells expressing the rat GFPα<sub>1</sub>-subunit Na,K-ATPase (WT) or the rat GFP-S18Aα<sub>1</sub>-subunit (S18A). Cells were exposed to 40 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 10 min (left panels) and then switched to 120 mmHg CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH<sub>e</sub>: 7.4) for 30 min (right panels). White arrows indicate the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase. * p&lt;0.05.</p>
