                Figure 1.  Comparison of the molecular organisation of the gene tra of C. capitata, B. oleae and A. obliqua (A) and the transcripts encoded by the A. obliqua tra gene (B).Exons (boxes) and introns (lines) are not drawn to scale. The numbers inside the boxes indicate the number of the exon; ms1, ms2 and ms3 stand for the male-specific exons. The beginning and the end of the ORF are indicated by ATG and TAA respectively. The longest female mRNA is shown. The male-specific transcripts show the stop codons in the mature mRNA; these depend on the male-specific exons incorporated.
