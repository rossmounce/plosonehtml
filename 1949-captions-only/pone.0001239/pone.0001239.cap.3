                Figure 3.  Comparison of the predicted Tra polypeptides of C. capitata [18], B. oleae [19] and A. obliqua (taken as the reference for the twelve Anastrepha species here studied).The shadowed regions correspond to the domains that show 100% similarity among the three species (similarity refers to identical plus conservative amino acids)
