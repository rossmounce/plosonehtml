                Figure 4.  Comparison of the molecular organisation of the tra genomic region (encompassing the male-specific exons and their flanking introns) involved in sex-specific splicing regulation of the tra pre-mRNA, in the twelve Anastrepha species, in C. capitata (unpublished sequence) and in B. oleae (accession number AJ715414). Boxes represent exons, lines represent introns (not drawn to scale).In B. oleae, exon 1 is split into exons 1A and exon 1B [19]. The male-specific exons are denoted by ms1, ms2 and ms3, and the introns corresponding to the compared tra genomic region by is1, is2 and is3. The locations of the Tra-Tra2, RBP1 and Tra2-ISS binding sites are shown, along with their consensus sequences, together with those found in D. melanogaster (bottom of the Figure). The numbers and the letters (a) and (b) underneath the small rectangle and ellipsoids representing these binding sequences refer to the exact same sequences described in the Supporting Material.
