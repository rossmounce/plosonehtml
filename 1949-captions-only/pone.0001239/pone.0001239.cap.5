The confidence levels for the groups are indicated in the corresponding nodes as bootstrap (BP, normal type) and interior branch test results (CP, bold type) based on 1000 replications. Values are shown only when either the BP or CP values are higher than 50%. (B) Proportion of nucleotide sites at which two sequences being compared are different (<em>p</em>, nucleotide substitutions per site) and ratio between the numbers of non-synonymous (<em>pN</em>) and synonymous (<em>pS</em>) substitutions per site across the coding regions of <em>tra</em> in the tephritids. These values were calculated using a sliding-window approach with a window length of 40 bp and a step size of 10 bp. The relative positions of the RS and SR dipeptides across <em>tra</em> are represented in the white boxes below the graph.</p>
