                Figure 6.  Proposed explanation of the dual role-played by the tephritid Tra protein in sex determination.For the sake of simplification, the tra pre-mRNA is shown as containing a single male-specific exon (yellow box); the white boxes represent common exons. The dsx pre-mRNA shows only the one common exon (white box), a female-specific exon (grey box) and a male-specific exon (yellow box). The lines represent introns. AAA stands for polyadenylation. The black, yellow and red rectangles represent the Tra-Tra2, the RBP1 and the Tra2-ISS binding sites respectively. The X-SR factor refers to the unknown factor mentioned in the text. The green part of the Tra protein corresponds to the amino terminal region of the tephritid Tra protein, which is not present in the Tra protein of the drosophilids. The complex made up by Tra, Tra2, RBP1 and X-SR inhibits splicing, whereas the complex formed by Tra, Tra2 and RBP1 promotes splicing. For details see text.
