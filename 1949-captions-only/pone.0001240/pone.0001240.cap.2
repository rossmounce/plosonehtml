                Figure 2.   daf-2 mutations suppressed DR-induced FIRE response.(A, B) Representative images showing FIRE response induction in eat-2(ad465) animals and suppression in two different eat-2; daf-2 double mutants. (B) FIRE response suppression was stronger in daf-2(e1370) animals than in daf-2(e1368) animals. Quantification of the FIRE response in the same strains shown in (A); n = 22–30 animals examined per strain, results are from one representative of three or more experiments. Assays were conducted at 20°C for daf-2(e1368) and relevant controls or at 15°C for daf-2(e1370) and controls. (C) daf-16 activity is required for resistance to FIRE-inducing conditions in daf-2 mutants but not wildtype animals. Graph shows the fraction of animals displaying a strong FIRE response during a time course of fasting; wildtype (diamonds), daf-16(mg242); daf-2(e1368) (open triangles) and daf-2(e1368) (filled triangles). Results are for one representative of 4 experiments; n = 7–23 animals (average, 16 animals) examined per time point per strain; total number of animals examined per strain, wildtype (102 animals), daf-2(e1368) (65 animals), daf-16(mg242); daf-2(e1368) (72 animals). Consistent results were also observed after let-363/TOR RNAi.
