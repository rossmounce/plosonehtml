(B) FIRE response suppression was stronger in <em>daf-2(e1370)</em> animals than in <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> animals. Quantification of the FIRE response in the same strains shown in (A); n = 22–30 animals examined per strain, results are from one representative of three or more experiments. Assays were conducted at 20°C for <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> and relevant controls or at 15°C for <em>daf-2(e1370)</em> and controls. (C) <em>daf-16</em> activity is required for resistance to FIRE-inducing conditions in <em>daf-2</em> mutants but not wildtype animals. Graph shows the fraction of animals displaying a strong FIRE response during a time course of fasting; wildtype (diamonds), <em>daf-16(mg242); daf-2(e1368)</em> (open triangles) and <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> (filled triangles). Results are for one representative of 4 experiments; n = 7–23 animals (average, 16 animals) examined per time point per strain; total number of animals examined per strain, wildtype (102 animals), <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> (65 animals), <em>daf-16(mg242); daf-2(e1368)</em> (72 animals). Consistent results were also observed after <em>let-363</em>/TOR RNAi.</p>
