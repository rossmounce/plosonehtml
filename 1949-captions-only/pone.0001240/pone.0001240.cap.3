(A) Under food-replete conditions (fed), fluorescence from <em>hsp16.2:</em>GFP was undetectable in the pharynx region of most animals. After a 4 hour fasting regimen, elevated <em>hsp-16.2:</em>GFP fluorescence was observed in many animals, as it was for animals under thermal stress (35°C, 3.5–6 hours). (B) Relative GFP fluorescence in the pharynx region of animals carrying the <em>hsp-16.2:GFP</em> reporter. Fluorescence intensity was measured as average pixel intensity in same-sized regions of the pharynx. Fluorescence intensity measurements under food-replete conditions were set as baseline. Duplicate bars indicate results from two independent experiments; n = 14–19 animals scored per condition in each experiment. In both experiments, 35°C heat stress induced a statistically significant increase in <em>hsp-16.2</em>:GFP fluorescence intensity (p≤0.001 compared to fed controls). Nutrient stress was not correlated with reproducible statistically significant changes in <em>hsp-16.2</em>:GFP fluorescence intensity (p≤0.001 in one trial only). All conditions were tested on the same day and images were collected using identical acquisition parameters. Three additional experiments also gave similar results.</p>
