                Figure 4.  Small body size caused by DR was partially suppressed in daf-2 mutants.(A, B) Body length increased over the first 3 days of adulthood under both DR and non-DR conditions. Wildtype animals under DR conditions were approximately 30% shorter than under non-DR conditions (diamonds). Under non-DR conditions, daf-2(e1368) and daf-2(e1370) adults were slightly longer than wildtype animals (dark shapes) and daf-2 mutant body size was also reduced under DR (triangles). However, eat-2;daf-2 animals grew to larger sizes than eat-2 animals (open triangles vs open diamonds). (C) Composite graph of adult body length of wildtype and daf-2 mutants under DR and non-DR conditions on adult day 1 (24-hours post-molt), plotted relative to wildtype non-DR adults. All body length measurements were conducted at 15°C and animals were synchronized by chronological age from hatching. For each time point, measurements of 10–14 animals for each strain were averaged from 3 independent experiments, except for eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1368) animals for which 2 experiments were conducted. Statistical significance was evaluated by t-test and indicate significance in at least 3 of 4 timepoints, *p&lt;0.01 vs wildtype in all trials, #p&lt;0.01 vs eat-2(ad465) in all trials, ˆp&lt;0.01 vs daf-2(e1368) (A) or daf-2(e1370) (B) in all trials ; p&lt;0.0001 (t-test) for all 3 strains at each time point except for eat-2(ad465) vs eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1370) at 0 and 8 hours (p = 0.076 and 0.089, respectively). In addition, in (A) eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1368) vs eat-2(ad465) body lengths were statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) at only the 48 and 72 hour timepoints of all trials.
