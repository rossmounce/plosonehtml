Wildtype animals under DR conditions were approximately 30% shorter than under non-DR conditions (diamonds). Under non-DR conditions, <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> and <em>daf-2(e1370)</em> adults were slightly longer than wildtype animals (dark shapes) and <em>daf-2</em> mutant body size was also reduced under DR (triangles). However, <em>eat-2;daf-2</em> animals grew to larger sizes than <em>eat-2</em> animals (open triangles vs open diamonds). (C) Composite graph of adult body length of wildtype and <em>daf-2</em> mutants under DR and non-DR conditions on adult day 1 (24-hours post-molt), plotted relative to wildtype non-DR adults. All body length measurements were conducted at 15°C and animals were synchronized by chronological age from hatching. For each time point, measurements of 10–14 animals for each strain were averaged from 3 independent experiments, except for <em>eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1368)</em> animals for which 2 experiments were conducted. Statistical significance was evaluated by t-test and indicate significance in at least 3 of 4 timepoints, *p&lt;0.01 vs wildtype in all trials, #p&lt;0.01 vs <em>eat-2(ad465)</em> in all trials, ˆp&lt;0.01 vs <em>daf-2(e1368)</em> (A) or <em>daf-2(e1370)</em> (B) in all trials ; p&lt;0.0001 (t-test) for all 3 strains at each time point except for <em>eat-2(ad465)</em> vs <em>eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1370)</em> at 0 and 8 hours (p = 0.076 and 0.089, respectively). In addition, in (A) <em>eat-2(ad465); daf-2(e1368)</em> vs <em>eat-2(ad465)</em> body lengths were statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) at only the 48 and 72 hour timepoints of all trials.</p>
