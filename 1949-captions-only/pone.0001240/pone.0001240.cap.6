                Figure 6.  Model for the interactions between DR and DAF-2/IIS on growth, FIRE response and lifespan.Food intake and nutrient signaling have dramatic effects on growth, FIRE response and longevity in C. elegans. This paper reports that levels of DAF-2/IIS can modify these three nutrient-dependent processes. We propose that levels of DAF-2/IIS may be under control of environmental cues that modulate insulin ligand production.
