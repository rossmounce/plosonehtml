                Figure 2.  Subcellular distribution of mitochondrion-specific heat shock protein 70 in the mouse oocytes and zygotes.MtHSP70 is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (A and D). Anti-á-tubulin (B) and Hoechst 33342 (C) fluorescence indicate an orientation of the oocyte as simultaneously visualized with anti-mtHSP70 immunofluorescence (A). Anti-mtHSP70 immunofluorescence is still evenly distributed the cytoplasm of zygote, except pronucleus where immunofluorescence is devoid (E). The immunofluorescence begins to aggregate in some places of the cytoplasm after the first cleavage (F). Bar = 10 µm
