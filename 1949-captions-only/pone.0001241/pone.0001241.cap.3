                Figure 3.  Localization of 16S rRNA at a sub-endoplasmic organelle level.The electron microscopic visualization of the ISH reveals the localization of 16S rRNA in MII oocyte at a sub-endoplasmic organelle level. Since the specimens are sectioned, only exposed interior of the organelle can be seen as concave structures in a SEM image. Gold colloidal particles (15 nm, small black dots) are visualized via a backscatter electron detector and seen to accumulate on the cristae (chevrons) of a mitochondrion (A). Surrounding cytoplasm is almost deserted by such particles. In certain area of the MII oocyte, the gold colloidal particles, however, spread extra-mitochondrially (B). The cytoplasm is more abundant in the particles than the interior of mitochondrion (chevron). In contrast to a structured interior surface of the mitochondrion, the endoplasmic reticulum has a smooth surface of interior (asterisk), which is devoid of the particle. Bars = 0.5 Âµm
