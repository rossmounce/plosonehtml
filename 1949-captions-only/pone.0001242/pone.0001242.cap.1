(A) The nick-at Chi model <a href="#pone.0001242-Smith1">[6]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001242-Smith2">[7]</a> suggested that RecBCD unwinds and rewinds the DNA until it encounters Chi, at which point it nicks the 3′-ending strand which invades a homologous duplex DNA molecule (red), creating patches exclusively in the 3′-ending strand. (B) The split-end model <a href="#pone.0001242-Rosenberg3">[21]</a> proposed that RecBCD degrades both strands until an encounter with Chi, effectively translocating the DSE to the Chi site. At Chi, RecBCD was proposed to lose its nuclease activity, retain helicase activity, and unwind the DNA. This split-end intermediate might be acted on by single-strand-dependent exonucleases of one polarity or the other, creating single-strand ends of either polarity that could invade a homologous duplex DNA molecule <a href="#pone.0001242-Razavy1">[12]</a>. 5′-end invasions were proposed to lead to 5′ patches, and 3′-end invasions to lead to 3′ patches. (C) The asymmetric DNA degradation model <a href="#pone.0001242-Kowalczykowski2">[8]</a> incorporates the proposal of <a href="#pone.0001242-Rosenberg3">[21]</a> that RecBCD degrades one or both (depicted here) DNA strands until an encounter with Chi, at which point this model specifies that the nuclease activity is altered and only the 5′-ending strand is degraded. This creates a 3′ end that invades a homologous duplex DNA molecule leading to patches exclusively in the 3′-ending strand. All of these models include endonucleolytic resolution of the strand-exchange intermediate, such as a Holliday junction (HJ), as the final step, a prediction that has been upheld for “break-join” splices <a href="#pone.0001242-Motamedi1">[77]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001242-Magner1">[78]</a>, but that will be called into question for patch formation by data presented below. We will suggest that none of these models can explain patch formation and consider alternatives. DNA ends with a half arrowhead represent 3′ ends, and plain ends represent 5′ ends.</p>
