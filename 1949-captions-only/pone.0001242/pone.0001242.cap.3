                Figure 3.  Strategy for heteroduplex analysis of patches formed in vivo in λ by λdv “crosses”.Red, 18 nt insertion marker; green box, region of the λdv plasmid DNA that is not homologous with λ; blue parallel lines, strands of DNA; hexagon, phage λ capsid and packaging proteins which bind the λ chromosome left end during cleavage of λ DNA for packaging. This leaves only the right end free for RecBCD-initiated recombination [102].
