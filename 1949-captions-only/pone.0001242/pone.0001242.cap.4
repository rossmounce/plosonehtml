Lanes labeled “wild-type” are two different amounts of DNA from a <em>rec</em><sup>+</sup> cross (SMR6726×λSR542), lanes labeled “mock cross 1–3” contain two different amounts of DNA from each of three mock crosses (JC11450×λSR542 mixed with SMR6726 without λ infection, as described in text). The last lane also contains an artificial het control. (B) RecA dependence of het patches. Strains used are: <em>rec</em><sup>+</sup> (SMR6726–JC11450 [pLGR5]), <em>recA</em> (SMR10154-JC11450 Δ(<em>srlR-recA</em>)<em>306</em>::Tn<em>10</em> [pLGR5]), and <em>topB</em> (SMR10207-JC11450 Δ<em>topB</em>::FRT [pLGR5]) each crossed with λSR542. Numbers above the lanes indicate the relative amounts of DNA loaded (<em>i. e</em>. a lane marked “4” indicates that lane contains four times the amount of DNA than was loaded in the lane marked “1” for the same cross). No het bands are visible for <em>recA</em> on the exposed film, but the scan of the film gives the appearance of bands present. The last lane is an artificial het control. (C) RecB dependence of het patches. Strains used are: <em>rec</em><sup>+</sup> as in B., and <em>recB</em> (SMR9579–JC11450 <em>recB21</em> [pLGR5]). Plasmid controls are artificial het controls as in <a href="#pone-0001242-g002">Figure 2</a>. The homoduplex band was run off of the gel for the control lanes, but because the homoduplex fragment was 50–100x more prevalent in the cross DNAs, the homoduplex band was much broader and the upper portion of that band remained visible.</p>
