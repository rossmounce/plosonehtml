When the marker is in the λ, Het I corresponds to a 5′ patch and Het II to a 3′ patch. Red lines represent the 18 bp marker insert. (B) Plasmid DNAs isolated from <em>orf</em><sup>+</sup> <em>rap</em><sup>+</sup> crosses. Two crosses are shown. For each set of crosses, the lane marked “pls” denotes that the insertion marker was present in the plasmid (SMR6721×λSR539), and the lane marked “λ” denotes that the marker was present in the λ (FS1607×λSR538). See text for quantification. (C) Plasmid DNAs from <em>orf</em><sup>−</sup> <em>rap</em><sup>−</sup> crosses. One cross of each type is shown (marker present in the plasmid [SMR6720×λSR542] or in the λ [SMR6205×λSR543]), and two different amounts of DNA were loaded for each cross. Numbers above the lanes are relative amounts based on the estimated DNA concentration. Plasmid controls, artificial heteroduplexes made by melting and reannealing 604 bp fragments with and without the 18 bp marker insert as for <a href="#pone-0001242-g002">Figure 2</a>. See text for quantification from multiple crosses.</p>
