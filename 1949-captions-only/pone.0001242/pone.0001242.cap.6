                Figure 6.  Crosses in a recD strain show a slight 5′ bias in patch polarity.Lanes marked “rec+” are two different amounts of DNA from a rec+ cross (SMR6726×λSR542). Lanes marked “recD cross 1” are two amounts of DNA from a recD cross (SMR10215×λSR542), and lanes marked “recD cross 2” are from a second recD cross. Control het is as for Fig. 2. For all crosses the 18 bp marker was present on the λdv plasmid, (SMR6726-JC11450 [pLGR5], SMR10215-JC11450 recD1903::mini-tet [pLGR5]).
