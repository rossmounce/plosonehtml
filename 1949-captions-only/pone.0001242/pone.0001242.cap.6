Lanes marked “<em>recD</em> cross 1” are two amounts of DNA from a <em>recD</em> cross (SMR10215×λSR542), and lanes marked “<em>recD</em> cross 2” are from a second <em>recD</em> cross. Control het is as for <a href="#pone-0001242-g002">Fig. 2</a>. For all crosses the 18 bp marker was present on the λdv plasmid, (SMR6726-JC11450 [pLGR5], SMR10215-JC11450 <em>recD1903</em>::mini-<em>tet</em> [pLGR5]).</p>
