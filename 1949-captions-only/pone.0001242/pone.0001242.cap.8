                Figure 8.  An SDSA model for the formation of 3′ and 5′ patches.(A) A DSB occurs to the left of the marker. 5′ ends are resected, and one of the resulting 3′ ends invades a homologous duplex. DNA synthesis (dotted lines), strand displacement, and reannealing lead to heteroduplex-patch formation with new DNA in the 3′-ending strand. Only the 3′ end that leads to heteroduplex formation across from the marker is shown. (B) A DSB occurs to the right of the marker. 5′ end resection, strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and reannealing all occur as in A, but result in heteroduplex patch formation with new DNA in the 5′-ending strand. Again, only the 3′ end that leads to heteroduplex formation across from the marker is shown. Adapted from Allers and Lichten [92].
