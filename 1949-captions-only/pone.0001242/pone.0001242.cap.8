DNA synthesis (dotted lines), strand displacement, and reannealing lead to heteroduplex-patch formation with new DNA in the 3′-ending strand. Only the 3′ end that leads to heteroduplex formation across from the marker is shown. (B) A DSB occurs to the right of the marker. 5′ end resection, strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and reannealing all occur as in A, but result in heteroduplex patch formation with new DNA in the 5′-ending strand. Again, only the 3′ end that leads to heteroduplex formation across from the marker is shown. Adapted from Allers and Lichten <a href="#pone.0001242-Allers1">[92]</a>.</p>
