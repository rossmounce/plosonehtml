                Figure 9.  A single-strand-assimilation model for the formation of 5′ and 3′ patches.RecBCD loads onto λ at a DSE, and degrades both strands of DNA into ssDNA fragments. When these fragments are present in a cell at the same time as a replicating λdv plasmid (with which some fragments have homology) some of the fragments may be assimilated into the plasmid during replication. Fragments may also form RecA-dependent paranemic joints with the plasmid, as depicted in Leung et al [96] before replication begins. Once a replication fork passes over the region of the joint, the ssDNA fragment will be incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA strand. Fragments that are assimilated across from the 18 bp insert marker (which is not present in the λ phage) will result in a heteroduplex patch at that site. This assimilation might occur with ssDNA from either DNA strand of λ being assimilated across from its complementary DNA in either the leading or lagging strand of a replication fork, creating heteroduplex patches of either polarity (drawn). Adapted from Leung et al. [96] and Ellis et al. [97]; Court et al. [98]. Alternatively, assimilation might occur preferentially into the lagging strand, as for Red-mediated recombination [96]–[98] (not drawn), but because λdv has no replication terminus, replication might proceed in either direction in vivo, such that both strands are sometimes lagging strands. Thick blue lines represent DNA from the λ molecule, medium blue lines represent DNA from the λdv plasmid, thin blue lines represent newly synthesized λdv DNA, and pink lines represent the 18 bp insert marker. ori indicates the origin of replication for the λdv plasmid, but is not drawn to scale. RecBCD is depicted as in Figure 1, as a notched circle.
