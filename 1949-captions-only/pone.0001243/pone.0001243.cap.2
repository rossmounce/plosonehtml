Countries where the most rare haplotypes (<em>i.e.</em> frequency &lt;0.5%) were found are also reported. Mutational steps are represented by lines with the indication of the mutation from the immediate ancestral haplotype (<em>kdr</em> mutations in bold). Dashed lines represent reticulation ambiguities (see <a href="#s4">Discussion</a>). White circles: haplotypes carrying the wild-type 1014L allele. Gray circles: haplotypes carrying the 1014S allele at the <em>kdr</em> locus (T-1104-C). Black circles: haplotypes carrying the 1014F allele at the <em>kdr</em> locus (A-1105-T).</p>
