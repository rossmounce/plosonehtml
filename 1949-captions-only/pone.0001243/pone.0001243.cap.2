                Figure 2.  TCS network showing the genealogical relations among kdr haplotypes of A. gambiae.Each haplotype is represented by a circle with a size proportional to its frequency in the sample (in parenthesis, 2N = 576). Countries where the most rare haplotypes (i.e. frequency &lt;0.5%) were found are also reported. Mutational steps are represented by lines with the indication of the mutation from the immediate ancestral haplotype (kdr mutations in bold). Dashed lines represent reticulation ambiguities (see Discussion). White circles: haplotypes carrying the wild-type 1014L allele. Gray circles: haplotypes carrying the 1014S allele at the kdr locus (T-1104-C). Black circles: haplotypes carrying the 1014F allele at the kdr locus (A-1105-T).
