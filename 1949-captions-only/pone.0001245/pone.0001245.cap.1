<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>For each of the two dynamic traits, <em>z</em>(<em>t</em>) and <em>y</em>(<em>t</em>), functional mapping has established a general statistical framework for mapping its underlying QTLs with molecular markers <a href="#pone.0001245-Ma2">[47]</a>. In this study, we will incorporate the allometric scaling law (Equation 1) into functional mapping. But different from the previous treatment for bivariate functional mapping by Wu and Hou <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu4">[45]</a>, we will found functional mapping on the dependent trait, connected with the independent trait by the allometric equation. To simplify the description of our model, we assume that one single QTL is involved in the allometric control. The derivation of a more realistic multiple-QTL model is conceptually straightforward with the idea of the one QTL model, but this extension raises many statistical issues, such as model selection for the optimal number of QTL involved (see ref. <a href="#pone.0001245-Broman1">[33]</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>Similar to Ma et al. <a href="#pone.0001245-Ma2">[47]</a>, we formulate the likelihood function for one dynamic trait, y, controlled by a QTL bracketed by a pair of marker (M), as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e005&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(3)</span></span><br>where y<em><sub>i</sub></em> = (<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>),…,<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>))′ is the observation vector, (<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>,…,<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>)′ denote the time points when the observations are measured, <em>f</em>(y<em><sub>i</sub></em>;u<em><sub>j</sub></em>, Σ) is the multivariate density function for different QTL genotypes (subscripted by <em>j</em> = 1 for <em>QQ</em> or 2 for <em>qq</em>) with mean vector u<em><sub>j</sub></em> = (<em>u<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>),…<em>u<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>))′ and time-dependent covariance matrix Σ, and ω<sub>1|<em>i</em></sub> and ω<sub>2|<em>i</em></sub> are the conditional probabilities of a QTL genotype, 1 or 2, given the genotype of progeny <em>i</em> for two flanking markers. The conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of the recombination fractions (for the backcross design) or the proportions of recombinant homozygotes (for the RIL design) <a href="#pone.0001245-Jiang2">[48]</a> between the left marker and QTL (<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>) and between the QTL and right marker (<em>r</em><sub>2</sub>).</p>


<h4>Modelling the Mean Vector</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>If the allometric relationship between two biological traits is controlled by a QTL, the linearized power equation (2) can be used to model the genotypic mean vector in the likelihood (3) with genotype-specific parameter sets (α<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>1</sub>) or (α<sub>2</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>). Thus, by testing the difference between these two parameter sets, we can conclude whether there is a specific QTL for allometric scaling and how the QTL controls the scaling relationship. Wu and Hou <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu4">[45]</a> modeled the allometric scaling relationship by incorporating the genotypic vectors of the two traits, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, i.e.,<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e006&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(4)</span></span><br>where <em>u<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t</em>) and <em>v<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t</em>) are the genotypic values of traits <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> for QTL genotype <em>j</em> at time point <em>t</em>. This treatment needs to simultaneously estimate the genotypic vector of traits <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, expressed as (<em>u<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>),…, <em>u<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>), <em>v<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>),…, <em>v<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>)). More importantly, the time-dependent covariance matrix for each trait and the time-dependent covariance matrix between the two traits need to be specified at a time, leading to a double-sized covariance matrix of dimension 2T×2T. All these will largely increase the number of parameters to be estimated, making the computation quickly prohibitive and the parameter estimation imprecise.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>To overcome this problem, we will formulate a different model for the allometric relationship. Given that the allometric change of one trait is not only regulated by the underlying genes, but also by physiology-and metabolism-related characteristics that contain the influences of both genes and environments <a href="#pone.0001245-Niklas1">[7]</a>, we model the genotypic vector of a trait with the phenotypic value of a second allometrically related trait. Thus, Equation 4 is changed as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e007&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(5)</span></span><br>where <em>u<sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub>(<em>t</em>) = E[<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>t</em>)|<em>Z<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), QTL genotype <em>j</em>]. This can be explained from genetic and statistical perspectives. In genetics, Equation 5 states how the genotypic value of trait <em>y</em> for QTL genotype <em>j</em> scales as, or responds to, the phenotypic change of trait <em>z</em> during ontogeny. If parameter set (α<em><sub>j</sub></em>, β<em><sub>j</sub></em>) is not different between QTL genotypes, this means that this QTL does not determine the allometric scaling between traits <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>. Equation 5 indicates that given the QTL genotype we can regress <em>y</em> on the covariate <em>z</em> using a linear regression model.</p>


<h4>Modeling the Time-Dependent Covariance</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>The residual covariance matrix, Σ, generally follows an autocorrelation structure, which can be mathematically modeled. A number of statistical models, such as autoregressive <a href="#pone.0001245-Diggle1">[49]</a> and antedependent <a href="#pone.0001245-NezAntn1">[50]</a> models, have been formulated to model such a structure. In Zimmerman and Núñez-Antón <a href="#pone.0001245-Zimmerman1">[51]</a>, the advantages of structured antedependent (SAD) model have been extensively discussed, which include (1) the assumptions of variance and correlation stationary are not needed, and (2) closed forms exist for the inverse and determinant of the SAD matrix.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>For first order SAD models with an antedependence parameter ρ, if we assume the innovation variances σ<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) to be a constant σ<sup>2</sup> over time, explicit forms of variance and correlation functions can be obtained as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e008&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>for <em>t<sub>k</sub></em>≥<em>t<sub>j</sub></em>. For this simplest SAD(1) model, the variance and correlation functions are non-stationary. They change as time and time interval change.</p>


<h4>Computational Algorithm</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>When Equation 5 is substituted into the likelihood of Equation 3, the likelihood function is now expressed as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e009&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(6)</span></span><br>where u<sub><em>j</em>|<em>i</em></sub> = (<em>u<sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>),…, <em>u<sub>j</sub></em><sub>|<em>i</em></sub>(<em>t<sub>T</sub></em>))′(<em>j</em> = 1, 2) are the QTL genotype-specific mean vectors which also depend on the trait <em>z</em> (see Equation 5).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>The underlying unknown parameters are composed of (<em>r</em><sub>1</sub> or <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>, α<em><sub>j</sub></em>, β<em><sub>j</sub></em>, ρ, σ<sup>2</sup>). In the <a href="#pone.0001245.s001">Appendix S1</a>, we derive the EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of these unknown parameters. The estimates of the sampling errors of the MLEs can be obtained from Louis’ <a href="#pone.0001245-Louis1">[52]</a> approach derived within the context of a mixture model.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3"></a><p>The heritability of trait <em>y</em> at time <em>t</em> is calculated as follows:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e010&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e011&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>and<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e012&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>with<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e013&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>Here <em>u</em><sub>z</sub>(<em>t</em>) and σ<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) are the mean and variance for trait <em>z</em> at time <em>t</em>, respectively, which can be estimated from observations.</p>


<h4>Hypothesis Testing</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>As shown in our previous publications <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu1">[26]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu3">[43]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001245-Ma2">[47]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu5">[53]</a>, functional mapping is advantageous for the tests of biologically meaningful hypotheses regarding genetic actions and organ development. Here, we outline several important hypotheses for the genetic control of allometric scaling. The first hypothesis is about the existence of QTL, which can be tested by formulating the null hypothesis,</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2"></a><p>H<sub>0</sub>: α<sub>1</sub> = α<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> = β<sub>2</sub></p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3"></a><p>H<sub>1</sub>: At least one of the equalities in H<sub>0</sub> does not hold.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4"></a><p>The log-likelihood ratio statistic is calculated as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001245.e014&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(7)</span></span><br>where the tildes and hats are the MLEs of parameters under the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. The LR value is then compared with the critical threshold determined from permutation tests, as advocated by Churchill and Doerge <a href="#pone.0001245-Churchill1">[54]</a>, to test the significance of the QTL hypothesized.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p5"></a><p>We are also interested in the genetic cause for the differentiation in ontogenetic allometric scaling. This can be investigated by testing the normalization (α) and exponent constant (β) individually. Some study suggests that α is a characteristic of species or populations <a href="#pone.0001245-Niklas2">[10]</a>, whereas a recent survey by Niklas and Enquist <a href="#pone.0001245-Niklas3">[55]</a> shows that all plants have a similar normalization constant and, therefore, comply with a single allometric formula. This debate can be solved by testing whether α equals to a specific constant for different plant species.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p6"></a><p>In practice, the exponent coefficient β can be considered as a constant if the allometric relationship of the two traits studied is known. For example, body length scales as the 1/4-power of body mass <a href="#pone.0001245-West3">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001245-West4">[16]</a>. In this case, β = 1/4 can be directly substituted into Equation 5 to obtain estimates for the remainder of the unknown parameters. Owing to the reduced number of the unknowns to be estimated, such a substitution can potentially increase the precision and power of parameter estimation.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p7"></a><p>All the tests for α and β can be performed by calculating a likelihood ratio statistic which asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution with the corresponding degrees of freedom. In actual data analyses, an empirical approach based on simulation studies can be used to determine the threshold for these tests.</p>

<h4>A Worked Example</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>We used a real example from the soybean genome project to validate the model proposed for mapping ontogenetic allometry. Two original inbred lines of soybean, Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2, as parents were crossed to generate an F<sub>1</sub> population which was selfed for 7 generations to produce an RIL population composed of two groups of homozygous genotypes each containing two identical alleles from a different parental line. Let 1 and 2 denote the homozygotes derived from the Kefeng No. 1 alleles and Nannong 1138-2 alleles, respectively. A total of 184 RILs were genotyped for 488 molecular markers (restricted fragment length polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats and amplified fragment length polymorphisms) that construct a linkage map with 25 linkage groups covering 4,151.2 cM of the soybean genome <a href="#pone.0001245-Zhang1">[56]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>The RILs were planted in a simple lattice design with multiple replicates in a plot at Jiangpu Station, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China. The plants were harvested to measure their above- and under-ground biomass for eight times with the first time at the 28th day after emergence and successive seven times every 10 days thereafter. For the same RIL, the phenotypic values measured for different times correspond to successive measurements on a time scale. In this study, we will analyze the genetic control of the ontogenetic allometric scaling relationship between stem and whole-plant biomass.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3"></a><p>As shown by a subset of RILs from the mapping population in <a href="#pone-0001245-g001">Figure 1</a>, stem biomass scales as a power function of whole-plant biomass. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the two log-transformed traits from the samples for all subjects are all close to 1, ranging from 0.9381 to 0.9992. The sample mean of the coefficients for all individuals is 0.9885 with a sample standard error 0.0092. Thus, a high linear trend between the log-transformed stem biomass and whole plant biomass is appropriate for our allometric mapping model.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p4"></a><p>This relationship was incorporated into functional mapping to characterize specific QTL that control the allometric change of stem biomass relative to whole-plant biomass. Different from the backcross population, the conditional probabilities of a QTL genotype given marker genotypes are expressed in terms of the proportion of recombinant homozygotes <a href="#pone.0001245-Wu6">[57]</a>. We detected five significant allometry QTLs, two located between markers GMKF082c and GMKF168b and at marker A520T on chromosome 3, one located between markers GMKF059a and satt319 on chromosome 6, one located between markers Satt372 and Satt154 on chromosome 10, and one between markers GMKF082b and satt331 on chromosome 24, as indicated by peaks of the LR profile beyond the 5% critical threshold obtained from 1000 permutation tests (<a href="#pone-0001245-g002">Fig. 2</a>). We tend to claim two QTL on chromosome 3 in this particular example (although they were not tested simultaneously) because their detected positions are about 120 cM apart, suggesting an unlinked relationship. The permutation tests <a href="#pone.0001245-Churchill1">[54]</a> were performed by repeatedly reshuffling stem biomass and whole-plant biomass among different RIL progeny but leaving marker genotypes unchanged. It is interesting to point out that the QTL on chromosome 6 is located between two closely spaced markers (5 cM apart), with 4 cM to the left marker and 1 cM to the right one. In conjunction with a narrow LR peak, this suggests that the detection of this QTL has a high resolution. Two QTLs were counted on chromosome 3 because they are distant enough from each other to infer the existence of two unlinked QTLs. On chromosome 24, there are two well-separated peaks, but they are two close to claim the existence of two different QTL. Thus, we only counted one QTL with a higher peak. In the Discussion, we will provide a possible solution into the test of two linked QTLs under the framework of allometry QTL mapping by implementing the idea of composite interval mapping <a href="#pone.0001245-Zeng1">[29]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001245-Zeng2">[30]</a>.</p>
