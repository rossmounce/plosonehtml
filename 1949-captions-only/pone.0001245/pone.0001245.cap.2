                Figure 2.  The LR profile of the likelihoods under the null (there is no QTL) and alternative hypothesis (there is a QTL) across the lengths of 25 chromosomes for the allometric scaling relationship between stem and whole-plant biomass growth trajectories in a soybean RIL population.The 5% significance critical threshold (10.98) determined from 1000 permutation tests is indicated by the broken horizontal line. The arrowed broken vertical line indicates the MLE of the QTL location.
