Interactions between U1 snRNP associated with exon 9 at the 5′ splice site and complexes associated with In100, including U2 snRNP and PTB, block rather than promote the selection of this 5′ splice site. The In100 element is diagramed as the hatched box. Exons 8, 9 and 10 are depicted as E8, E9 and E10 in gray boxes. U1 snRNP and U2 snRNPs are illustrated as U1 and U2.</p>
