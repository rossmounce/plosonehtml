                Figure 2.  The evolutionary conservation of casp-2 In100 element and nucleotide composition of In100-like elements.(A) Alignment between human and mouse casp-2 In100 elements shows 74% sequence identity. Putative branch site A is in bold and underlined (BS). The polypyrimidine tract in the decoy 3â€²splice site (Py)n and CAG are indicated. (B) The nucleotide composition is displayed based on the identified 4342 In100 elements.
