                Figure 5.  The alternative splicing of In100-containing genes. (A) A diagram depicting the alternative splicing of In100-containing genes.In100-containing genes were identified with three flanking exons (E1 to E3) from EST database, illustrated as E1-E2-In100-E3. 482 genes from EST database and an additional 44 genes from AltSplice [14] Database, with a total of 526 different genes show exon 2 skipping. (B) A higher frequency of skipping of exon2 in In100-containing exon triplets revealed by EST analyses. Frequency of skipping of exon2 in In100-containing and In100-lacking exon triplets by EST evidence is: 36% and 26%, respectively. The sample sizes for analyzed In100-containing and control exon triplets are: 1470 and 15943, respectively.
