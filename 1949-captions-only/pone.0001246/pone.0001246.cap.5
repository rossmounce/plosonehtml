(B) A higher frequency of skipping of exon2 in In100-containing exon triplets revealed by EST analyses. Frequency of skipping of exon2 in In100-containing and In100-lacking exon triplets by EST evidence is: 36% and 26%, respectively. The sample sizes for analyzed In100-containing and control exon triplets are: 1470 and 15943, respectively.</p>
