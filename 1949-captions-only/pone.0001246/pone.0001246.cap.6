Exons are depicted in rectangles, and In100 elements are illustrated as small gray boxes. The positions of regions encoding “QACRG” pentapeptide sequence are marked with “*”. (B) Alternative splicing of Caspase 2, 3, 8, 9 genes as detected by RT-PCR. Specific primers corresponding to the upstream and downstream exons were used in RT-PCR as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. The sizes of each exons are not drawn to scale. The positions of PCR primers are marked by arrows.</p>
