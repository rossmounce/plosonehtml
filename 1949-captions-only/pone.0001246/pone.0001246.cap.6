                Figure 6.  Alternative splicing of caspase genes.(A) A schematic illustration of In100-like elements in caspase genes and their alternative splicing patterns. Exons are depicted in rectangles, and In100 elements are illustrated as small gray boxes. The positions of regions encoding “QACRG” pentapeptide sequence are marked with “*”. (B) Alternative splicing of Caspase 2, 3, 8, 9 genes as detected by RT-PCR. Specific primers corresponding to the upstream and downstream exons were used in RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. The sizes of each exons are not drawn to scale. The positions of PCR primers are marked by arrows.
