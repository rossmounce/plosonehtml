Bottom panel, relation between the percentage of articles dealing with soil ecology and the Impact Factor, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43, F = 12.0, P = 0.0032. Each point corresponds to one of the eighteen journals investigated. Axes have a logarithmic scale. The log-log linear regression is highly significant for each of these relations with a negative slope in each case. For each relation both the raw data and the regression line are displayed. See <a href="#pone-0001248-t001">Table 1</a> for raw data.</p>
