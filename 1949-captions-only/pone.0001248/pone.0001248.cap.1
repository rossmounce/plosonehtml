                Figure 1.  Use of models and evolutionary thinking in ecology journals and link with Impact Factors.Top panel, relation between the percentage of articles dealing with soil ecology and (1) the percentage of articles using a model, R2 = 0.62, F = 25.8, P&lt;0.0001; (2) the percentage of articles dealing with evolution, R2 = 0.87, F = 110.5, P&lt;0.0001. Bottom panel, relation between the percentage of articles dealing with soil ecology and the Impact Factor, R2 = 0.43, F = 12.0, P = 0.0032. Each point corresponds to one of the eighteen journals investigated. Axes have a logarithmic scale. The log-log linear regression is highly significant for each of these relations with a negative slope in each case. For each relation both the raw data and the regression line are displayed. See Table 1 for raw data.
