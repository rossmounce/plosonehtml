Each of the 414 individuals in the analysis is represented by a thin vertical line, and is partitioned into <em>K</em> colored segments that represent the individual's probability of belonging to one of the <em>K</em> populations. Mosquitoes were positioned in the figure according to the collection site (Burkina Faso (BF), Mali, Kenya and Senegal) and to their species/forms (M molecular form (M1 and M2), S-form (S1, S2 and S3), <em>A. arabiensis</em> (A1 and A2), <em>A. merus</em> (R) and <em>A. melas</em> (L). In plot B, the M1 is further separated from M2 for <em>K</em> = 2 with simulation length 5×10<sup>5</sup>.</p>
