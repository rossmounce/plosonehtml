                Figure 2.  The STRUCTURE results.Consistent STRUCTURE results for 4≤K≤7 across the simulation lengths (5×105, 106 and 2×106) for plot A. Each of the 414 individuals in the analysis is represented by a thin vertical line, and is partitioned into K colored segments that represent the individual's probability of belonging to one of the K populations. Mosquitoes were positioned in the figure according to the collection site (Burkina Faso (BF), Mali, Kenya and Senegal) and to their species/forms (M molecular form (M1 and M2), S-form (S1, S2 and S3), A. arabiensis (A1 and A2), A. merus (R) and A. melas (L). In plot B, the M1 is further separated from M2 for K = 2 with simulation length 5×105.
