                Figure 3.  PCA and CA results of the 414 individuals at 36 loci.PCA analysis of the 414 individuals in a genome-wide study for 36 microsatellites (A) and for seven loci on the X chromosome (B). CA analysis of the nine populations in the Xag inversion region (C), near the X centromere region (D), on chromosomes 2 (E) and 3 (F). Individuals and populations are color-coded as described (see legend where numbers in brackets next to the populations name indicate the number of mosquitoes in each group). The contribution of each PC or CA is indicated as a percentage in brackets on the axis. In plots A and B, each point represents a single mosquito, while in plots C to F, each point represents a population. In plots C to F, microsatellite markers are localized by black bars. The first three letters of their name (AGN, where N is chromosome X, 2 or 3) were removed.
