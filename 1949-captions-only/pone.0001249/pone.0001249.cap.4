PCA and CA results of the 262 A. gambiae s.s. at 42 loci.PCA results of the 262 A. gambiae s.s. at 42 microsatellites (A), and CA results of the five populations of A. gambiae s.s. in the Xag inversion region and near the X centromere (B), and on autosomes (C). Each individual (in plot A) or each population (in plots B and C) is represented by a single point. See Figure 3 for legend. Only the most significant microsatellites markers are indicated.
