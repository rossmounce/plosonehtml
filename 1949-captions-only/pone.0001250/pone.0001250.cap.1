                Figure 1.  CA3 pyramidal cells show slow oscillations with UP states under in vivo-like ionic circumstances.A–D, Representative intracellular traces recorded in control ACSF (A) and pACSF in the absence (B) or presence of a combination of CNQX, AP5, and picrotoxin (PTX) (C) or BAPTA (D). CNQX/AP5/PTX were bath-applied, and BAPTA was intracellularly loaded through patch pipettes. After exposure to pACSF, CA3 pyramidal neurons, which remained at resting membrane potentials in control ACSF (A), displayed slow UP-DOWN oscillations (B). Dotted lines indicate the membrane potentials at the 0.1% significance level estimated from the Gaussian curve fit to the DOWN membrane potentials (A: −57.8, B: −55.8, C: −53.2, and D: 54.0 mV), above which level membrane potential was regarded as UP states. The oscillations maintained even in the presence of CNQX/AP5/picrotoxin (PTX), but the oscillation frequencies were modulated. In the right-hand plot of the panel C, the UP-DOWN frequencies were compared in identical cells (connected line) before (None) and after application of CNQX/AP5/PTX. E, Regular and irregular oscillations induced by pACSF. Autocorrelograms (bottom) were constructed from intracellular traces (top) to calculate the Fourier transformational integral in the 0.4 to 1.0-Hz range (bottom inset). If this value was higher than 50, the oscillation was regarded as a regular oscillation (left), otherwise as an irregular oscillation (right), because this regularity criteria seems suitable to eye inspection. F, Distribution of the mean frequency of regular UP-DOWN oscillations (n = 61).
