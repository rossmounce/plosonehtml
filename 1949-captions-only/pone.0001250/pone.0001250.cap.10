Both neurons showed oscillation-locked spiking activity. <em>B</em>, Time course of SLM-evoked (top) or SR-evoked PSCs (bottom) in cell1 (closed circles, 0.5 Hz) and cell2 (open circles, 0.8 Hz) in a single slice following the current injection. Top: 13.0% potentiation in cell1 and 38.3% depression in cell2. Bottom: 25.9% potentiation in cell1 and 29.4% depression in cell2. Data for other experiments are shown as triangle symbols in <a href="#pone-0001250-g004">figure 4</a> (SLM, n = 12; SR, n = 13). <em>C</em>, A neuron displayed LTP and then LTD in response to 0.5-Hz and 0.8-Hz current injection, respectively.</p>
