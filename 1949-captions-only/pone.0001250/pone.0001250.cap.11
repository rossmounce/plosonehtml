                Figure 11.  Subthreshold slow oscillations induce bidirectional synaptic modifications.A, Responses were recorded with a patch pipette loaded with 5 µM QX314. pACSF elicited slow oscillations without action potentials and still induced synaptic plasticity. Data are summarized in panel C (closed triangles: SLM, n = 4, open triangles: SR, n = 3). B, A neuron was held in voltage-clamp configuration, and its membrane potential was forced to oscillate via voltage commands (from −70 to −45 mV at 0.7 Hz). No action potential occurred, but LTP took place. Data are summarized in the panel C (closed circles: SLM, n = 7; open circles: SR, n = 6). The same experiments were repeated with a pipette loaded with 10 mM BAPTA (closed squares: SLM, n = 4; open squares: SR, n = 3).
