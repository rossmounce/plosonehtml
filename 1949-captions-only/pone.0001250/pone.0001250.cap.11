Data are summarized in panel <em>C</em> (closed triangles: SLM, n = 4, open triangles: SR, n = 3). <em>B</em>, A neuron was held in voltage-clamp configuration, and its membrane potential was forced to oscillate via voltage commands (from −70 to −45 mV at 0.7 Hz). No action potential occurred, but LTP took place. Data are summarized in the panel <em>C</em> (closed circles: SLM, n = 7; open circles: SR, n = 6). The same experiments were repeated with a pipette loaded with 10 mM BAPTA (closed squares: SLM, n = 4; open squares: SR, n = 3).</p>
