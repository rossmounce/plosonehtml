                Figure 12.  Slow oscillation-induced plasticity (SOIP) enhances the stability of network state: a numerical simulation study.A, A hundred neurons are connected in an all-to-all fashion except themselves. B, Membrane potentials of these neurons are oscillated at different slow oscillation rhythms, in every cycle of which they fire 3 spikes at 40 Hz. C, The rule of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). D, The rule of slow oscillation-induced plasticity (SOIP). Eâ€“G, Example of simulation. Synaptic weights are set to 0.5 (E) and updated along slow oscillations for 60 min with STDP only (F) or with a combination of STDP and SOIP (G). The distribution of synaptic weights is evaluated by the mean weight  and Shannon index (Hs). H,I, Time course of the change in the space of  versus Hs during a updating period of 60 min with STDP only (H) and with a combination of STDP and SOIP (I). The weights are initially uniform, being set to a value ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. The insets show the distribution for the last 10 min. The state of a network with STDP alone is more unstable. The instability (i.e., data point dispersion) is captured by .the sum of the Euclidian distance from the gravity (D). J, Time course of the dispersion D of network states with STDP only (blue) and with both STDP and SOIP (red). Statistical significance was determined with Welch's test.
