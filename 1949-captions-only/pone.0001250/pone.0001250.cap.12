Synaptic weights are set to 0.5 (<em>E</em>) and updated along slow oscillations for 60 min with STDP only (<em>F</em>) or with a combination of STDP and SOIP (<em>G</em>). The distribution of synaptic weights is evaluated by the mean weight <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001250.e004&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> and Shannon index (<em>H<sub>s</sub></em>). <em>H,I,</em> Time course of the change in the space of <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001250.e005&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> versus <em>H<sub>s</sub></em> during a updating period of 60 min with STDP only (<em>H</em>) and with a combination of STDP and SOIP (<em>I</em>). The weights are initially uniform, being set to a value ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. The insets show the distribution for the last 10 min. The state of a network with STDP alone is more unstable. The instability (<em>i.e.</em>, data point dispersion) is captured by .the sum of the Euclidian distance from the gravity (<em>D</em>). <em>J,</em> Time course of the dispersion <em>D</em> of network states with STDP only (blue) and with both STDP and SOIP (red). Statistical significance was determined with Welch's test.</p>
