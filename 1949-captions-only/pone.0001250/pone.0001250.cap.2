                Figure 2.  Spontaneous slow oscillations induce bidirectional long-term plasticity at three types of hippocampal CA3 synapses.A, Schematic illustration of experimental procedures for recording synaptic responses of CA3 pyramidal cells. Three stimulating electrodes were placed on stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), radiatum (SR), and granulosum (SG) to activate temporoammonic, associational/commissural, and mossy fiber pathways, respectively. B, Examples of the time courses in PSCs evoked by SLM stimuli (SLM-PSC) before and after a 20-min exposure to pACSF. pACSF induced a 16.9% increase (left) or a 32.7% decrease in PSC amplitudes (right). Câ€“E, Cumulative probabilities of pACSF-induced persistent changes in PSCs evoked by stimulation of SLM (C), SR (D), and SG (E). The zero intercepts were 64.1% (n = 63), 74.4% (n = 59), and 94.4% (n = 18) for SLM-evoked, SR-evoked, and SG-evoked PSCs, respectively.
