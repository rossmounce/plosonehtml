                Figure 3.  pACSF-induced bidirectional synaptic modification does not require NMDA receptor activity.Even when slices were continuously perfused with 50 ÂµM d,l-AP5 to block NMDA receptors, synaptic modification occurred after pACSF application. The same results were observed in all 7 cases tested.
