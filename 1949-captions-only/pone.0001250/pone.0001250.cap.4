                Figure 4.  Frequencies of slow oscillations correlate with the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity.Relationships between oscillation frequencies during pACSF application and pACSF-induced changes in PSCs evoked by SLM (A, n = 49) and SR stimulation (B, n = 45). Each dot represents a single cell. MeansÂ±SDs are indicated by thick lines and shaded areas (0.1-Hz step). One-way ANOVA indicated significant correlations with slow-oscillation frequency: F4,28 = 4.04, P = 0.010 (SLM); F4,28 = 9.75, P = 0.00007 (SR). Irregular oscillations (irr) tended to induce LTD at both types of synapses (n = each 14). For other parameters, see Figure S1. Triangle symbols are experiments with current injection (see Figure 9).
