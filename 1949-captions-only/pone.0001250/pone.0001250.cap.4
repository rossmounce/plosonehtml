Each dot represents a single cell. MeansÂ±SDs are indicated by thick lines and shaded areas (0.1-Hz step). One-way ANOVA indicated significant correlations with slow-oscillation frequency: <em>F<sub>4,28</sub></em> = 4.04, <em>P</em> = 0.010 (SLM); <em>F<sub>4,28</sub></em> = 9.75, <em>P</em> = 0.00007 (SR). Irregular oscillations (<em>irr</em>) tended to induce LTD at both types of synapses (n = each 14). For other parameters, see <a href="#pone.0001250.s001">Figure S1</a>. Triangle symbols are experiments with current injection (see <a href="#pone-0001250-g009">Figure 9</a>).</p>
