                Figure 5.  Non-stationary fluctuation analysis on pACSF-induced persistent changes in SLM-evoked PSCs.Aâ€“B. Representative distributions of current variance as a function of the level of scaled ensemble average current for the PSCs before (closed circles) and after (open circles) LTP (A) and LTD induction (B). C, Summarized data of changes in the estimated number of synaptic receptor channels following pACSF application. Changes in PSCs were positively correlated with changes in numbers. D, Summarized data of changes in estimated single channel conductance following pACSF application. Changes in PSCs were negatively correlated with changes in channel conductance. **P&lt;0.01, Pearson's test.
