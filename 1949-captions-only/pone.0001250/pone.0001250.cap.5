Representative distributions of current variance as a function of the level of scaled ensemble average current for the PSCs before (closed circles) and after (open circles) LTP (A) and LTD induction (B). <em>C</em>, Summarized data of changes in the estimated number of synaptic receptor channels following pACSF application. Changes in PSCs were positively correlated with changes in numbers. <em>D</em>, Summarized data of changes in estimated single channel conductance following pACSF application. Changes in PSCs were negatively correlated with changes in channel conductance. **<em>P</em>&lt;0.01, Pearson's test.</p>
