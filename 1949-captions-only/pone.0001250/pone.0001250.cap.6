                Figure 6.  CA3 networks display diverse, mostly uncorrelated, slow oscillations.A, Schematic drawing of dual patch-clamp recordings (top) and confocal image of two CA3 pyramidal cells labeled with biotin-streptavidin Alexa-488 (bottom). B, Representative intracellular traces simultaneously recorded from two pyramidal cells (cell1 and cell2) in pACSF. In some pairs, slow oscillations were synchronized in-phase (top) or out-of-phase (middle), but many pairs (78.8%) did not show apparent synchronization (bottom). C, Distance between two recorded cells versus their slow-wave frequencies. There was no relationship between cell location and synchronization (n = 25 pairs). D, Simultaneous loose-patch-clamp recordings and confocal monitoring of neurons bulk-loaded with Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1 revealed that somatic Ca2+ transients reflect action potentials. Numbers above the trace indicate the numbers of spikes involved in the corresponding burst trains. Eâ€“F, Fast confocal scanning of Ca2+ transients of 11 neurons, the locations of which are shown in panel E, revealed that different cells generated Ca2+ transients at different frequencies. Fluorescent intensities were normalized in each cell, indicated in gray scale.
