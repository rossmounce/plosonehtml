In some pairs, slow oscillations were synchronized in-phase (top) or out-of-phase (middle), but many pairs (78.8%) did not show apparent synchronization (bottom). <em>C</em>, Distance between two recorded cells versus their slow-wave frequencies. There was no relationship between cell location and synchronization (n = 25 pairs). <em>D,</em> Simultaneous loose-patch-clamp recordings and confocal monitoring of neurons bulk-loaded with Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1 revealed that somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients reflect action potentials. Numbers above the trace indicate the numbers of spikes involved in the corresponding burst trains. <em>Eâ€“F</em>, Fast confocal scanning of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of 11 neurons, the locations of which are shown in panel E, revealed that different cells generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at different frequencies. Fluorescent intensities were normalized in each cell, indicated in gray scale.</p>
