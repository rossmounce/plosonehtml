                Figure 7.  Diversity in pACSF-induced synaptic modification in a network.A–B, Time course of SLM-evoked (A) and SR-evoked PSCs (B) in simultaneously recorded cell pairs. Different cells showed different levels of synaptic plasticity in the same slices. A, Cell1 showed 0.96-Hz oscillations and a 23.4% potentiation of PSCs, whereas cell2 showed 0.86-Hz oscillations and no plasticity (−0.6%). B, Cell1 showed 0.94-Hz oscillations and a 48.6% potentiation, whereas cell2 showed irregular oscillations and a 28.4% depression. C, pACSF-induced changes in SLM-evoked and SR-evoked PSCs recorded simultaneously from single cells (n = 31). D–E, No plastic change was observed when synaptic transmission was monitored by field recording. D, Representative time course of SR-evoked field postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). No stimuli were delivered from 0 to 30 min. E, Summary of changes in SR-evoked field PSPs before and after pACSF application (n = 4 slices). Field recordings failed to find pACSF-induced synaptic plasticity.
