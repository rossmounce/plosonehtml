Different cells showed different levels of synaptic plasticity in the same slices. <em>A</em>, Cell1 showed 0.96-Hz oscillations and a 23.4% potentiation of PSCs, whereas cell2 showed 0.86-Hz oscillations and no plasticity (−0.6%). <em>B</em>, Cell1 showed 0.94-Hz oscillations and a 48.6% potentiation, whereas cell2 showed irregular oscillations and a 28.4% depression. <em>C</em>, pACSF-induced changes in SLM-evoked and SR-evoked PSCs recorded simultaneously from single cells (n = 31). <em>D–E</em>, No plastic change was observed when synaptic transmission was monitored by field recording. <em>D</em>, Representative time course of SR-evoked field postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). No stimuli were delivered from 0 to 30 min. <em>E</em>, Summary of changes in SR-evoked field PSPs before and after pACSF application (n = 4 slices). Field recordings failed to find pACSF-induced synaptic plasticity.</p>
