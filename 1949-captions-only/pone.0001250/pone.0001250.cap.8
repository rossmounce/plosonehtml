                Figure 8.  Network structures of slow oscillations change over time during prolonged pACSF application.Crosscorrelogram of somatic Ca2+ fluorescence signals of 15 CA3 neurons in a hippocampal slice. pACSF were continuously bath-applied, and each 5-min segment of the fluorescence traces was used to calculate crosscorrelogram (A: 0–5 min; B: 30–35 min; C: 60–65 min). Neuron pairs that showed correlations with the peak amplitude of more than 0.5 were drawn with thick lines in the correlogram panels and topologically linked in the physical cell maps (insets). Note the combination of correlated cell pairs changed over time.
