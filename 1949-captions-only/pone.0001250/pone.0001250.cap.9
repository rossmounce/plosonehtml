                Figure 9.  Different levels of synaptic plasticity are induced by repeated exposure to pACSF.A, Representative data of SLM-evoked PSCs. The first pACSF application induced 0.87-Hz oscillations and a 16.4% potentiation, and 60 min later, the second pACSF induced 0.81-Hz oscillations and a 23.9% depression. Data are summarized in panel B (n = 12).
