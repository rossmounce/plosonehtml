Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining implant viral load (A) and protection from thymocyte depletion (B) for bevirimat-treated mice and mice treated with 10% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin vehicle alone. Mock-infected mice were not treated. Data are expressed as means±SEM; *<em>p</em>≤0.05 for bevirimat- or vehicle-treated mice versus untreated mice by the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>
