                Figure 1.  Bevirimat Potently Inhibits HIV-1 Replication and Protects Thymocytes from Virus-Mediated Depletion in Vivo.SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice were treated with bevirimat by twice-daily oral gavage beginning 1 day before inoculation of implants with HIV-1 NL4-3, and dosing was continued until implant collection 21 days after inoculation. Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining implant viral load (A) and protection from thymocyte depletion (B) for bevirimat-treated mice and mice treated with 10% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin vehicle alone. Mock-infected mice were not treated. Data are expressed as means±SEM; *p≤0.05 for bevirimat- or vehicle-treated mice versus untreated mice by the Mann-Whitney U test.
