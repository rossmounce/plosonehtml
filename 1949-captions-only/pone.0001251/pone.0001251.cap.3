Dosing was continued until implant collection 14 days (JD) and 21 days (NL4-3) after inoculation. Antiviral efficacy was assessed by determining cell-associated HIV-1 RNA and p24. There was no reduction in viral load in bevirimat-treated mice inoculated with bevirimat-resistant SP1/A1V, whereas 3TC treatment (30 mg/kg per day by twice-daily oral gavage) was highly effective. Data are expressed as means±SEM; *<em>p</em>≤0.05 for treated mice versus untreated mice by the Mann-Whitney U test for 6–8 mice per group.</p>
