                Figure 4.  Bevirimat Inhibits p24 Release from the Capsid p25 Precursor in Human Thymocytes.Thymocytes dispersed from NL4-3- and SP1/A1V-infected SCID-hu Thy/Liv implants were cultured in the presence of the indicated range of concentrations of bevirimat for 2 days. Purified virions was lysed and individual viral proteins were detected with HIV-1 Ig. Note the target-specific and dose-dependent reduction of CAp25 cleavage in the presence of bevirimat. The presence of the drug does not affect the stoichiometry of the precursor Pr55Gag polyprotein nor does it inhibit cleavage of the matrix protein, MAp17 (lower panel, longer exposure).
