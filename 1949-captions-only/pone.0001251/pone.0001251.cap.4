Purified virions was lysed and individual viral proteins were detected with HIV-1 Ig. Note the target-specific and dose-dependent reduction of CAp25 cleavage in the presence of bevirimat. The presence of the drug does not affect the stoichiometry of the precursor Pr55Gag polyprotein nor does it inhibit cleavage of the matrix protein, MAp17 (lower panel, longer exposure).</p>
