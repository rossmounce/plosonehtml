                Figure 5.  The A1V Mutation in SP1 Does Not Affect Kinetics of Viral Replication or Thymocyte Depletion.Bevirimat-resistant SP1/A1V replicates and depletes thymocytes with kinetics comparable to wild-type NL4-3 in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice. Viral replication was assessed by determining implant viral load (A), and thymocyte depletion was assessed by total implant cellularity, thymocyte viability, and CD4/CD8 ratio (B) for NL4-3-infected versus SP1/AIV-infected mice for 6 mice per group. Data are expressed as meansÂ±SEM; there were no statistically significant differences in viral load or thymocyte depletion at any of the three time points. The number in each graph is the proportion of SP1/A1V to NL4-3 in area under the curve.
