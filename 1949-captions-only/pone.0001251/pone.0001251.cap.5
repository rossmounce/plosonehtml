Viral replication was assessed by determining implant viral load (A), and thymocyte depletion was assessed by total implant cellularity, thymocyte viability, and CD4/CD8 ratio (B) for NL4-3-infected versus SP1/AIV-infected mice for 6 mice per group. Data are expressed as meansÂ±SEM; there were no statistically significant differences in viral load or thymocyte depletion at any of the three time points. The number in each graph is the proportion of SP1/A1V to NL4-3 in area under the curve.</p>
