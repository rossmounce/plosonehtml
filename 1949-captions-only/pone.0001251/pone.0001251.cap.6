                Figure 6.  In Vivo Competitions Reveal No Impairment of SP1/A1V Replication.Sequencing of CA-SP1 RNA from three SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice coinfected with equivalent infectious units of NL4-3 and SP1/A1V reveal no impairment of SP1/A1V replication 28 days after implant inoculation. The A-to-V substitution in SP1 is conferred by a C-to-T mutation at nucleotide 1880.
