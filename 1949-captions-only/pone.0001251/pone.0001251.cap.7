                Figure 7.  Protease Inhibitor-Resistant HIV-1 has Impaired CA-SP1 Cleavage.Wild-type NL4-3 and protease mutant NL4-3 PRI54V+V82A virions were collected from transfected 293T cells grown in the presence (20 ÂµM) or absence of bevirimat and analyzed for particle maturation by Western blot using a p24 monoclonal antibody. The protease mutant is deficient in CA-SP1 cleavage and is comparable to bevirimat-treated wild-type virus, however, the drug has a more dramatic effect on CA-SP1 cleavage in HIV-1 PRI54V+V82A.
