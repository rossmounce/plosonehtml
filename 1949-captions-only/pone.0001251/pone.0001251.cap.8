                Figure 8.  Protease Inhibitor-Resistant HIV-1 with Impaired CA-SP1 Cleavage Is Hypersensitive to Bevirimat In Vitro.NL4-3 PRI54V+V82A is hypersensitive to bevirimat in PHA-activated PBMCs with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) &gt;100 times lower than for wild-type NL4-3. CC50 is the 50% cytotoxic concentration as assessed by MTT assay.
