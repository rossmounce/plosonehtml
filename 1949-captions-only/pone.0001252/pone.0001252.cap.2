                Figure 2.  Five BER modulated strains were compared for measurements of AP site accumulation.Five experimental conditions (#1–5) each with different ratios of Mag:Apn1 were assessed for AP site accumulation measured in genomic DNA. Statistical difference (t-test, p&lt;0.05) from wild type (WT, *) or from Δapn1/MAG group (**) is indicated. The expression of Mag of Apn1 are shown as: (0) = low expression, (+) = wild type expression, (++++++++++) = high expression.
