                Figure 3.  Induction of base excision repair leads to an accumulation of frameshift mutations.Frameshift mutation frequency in Δapn1 strains that expressed Apn1 and/or Mag was determined as detailed in Materials and Methods. Asterisk (*) denotes statistical difference (t-test, p&lt;0.05) relative to the background strain (Δapn1).
