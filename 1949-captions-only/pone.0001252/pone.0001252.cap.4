                Figure 4.  Gene expression changes in S. cerevisiae caused by an induction of base excision repair or methyl methane sulfonate (MMS).MMS transcriptional data were obtained from two doses (0.05% and 0.1%) from [1]. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 633 ORFs whose transcription was significantly changed in at least one of the BER strains used in this study (as compared to the wild type). The number of ORFs identified for each experiment as statistically significant is shown in brackets below the column. Fold changes were Z-score transformed; red indicates increased relative expression, and blue indicates decreased relative expression.
