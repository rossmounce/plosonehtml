P-values for gene ontology enrichment are indicated in legend. Pie charts in the upper right hand corner of each figure represent the percentage of network nodes that are ESR (yellow) or non ESR (blue) (P-value of ESR enrichment is shown). Proteins encoded by transcripts that are transcriptionally activated are indicated with a (+), all other proteins are encoded by transcripts that are transcriptionally repressed by BER intermediate accumulation.</p>
