DNA damage signals for the transcriptional modulation of (i) the induction or repression of the ~900 genes belonging to the environmental stress response (ESR), and (ii) ~50 cell cycle regulated genes, and (iii) DNA damage-triggered networks that include the MMS and IR DNA damage signature. Novel branch points in the DNA damage-triggered ESR independent transcriptional response are shown in red.</p>
