                Figure 6.  Diagram of a DNA damage-triggered transcriptional response in S. cerevisiae.DNA base damage (e.g. alkylated bases induced by endogenous or exogenous agents) is processed by repair machinery resulting in repair intermediates (e.g. abasic sites, gaps and nicks). DNA damage signals for the transcriptional modulation of (i) the induction or repression of the ~900 genes belonging to the environmental stress response (ESR), and (ii) ~50 cell cycle regulated genes, and (iii) DNA damage-triggered networks that include the MMS and IR DNA damage signature. Novel branch points in the DNA damage-triggered ESR independent transcriptional response are shown in red.
