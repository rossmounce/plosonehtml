                Figure 1.  Multistability in AV temporal matching.A. Multiple visual flashes are presented in close temporal proximity to produce ambiguity in AV temporal matching. Many cycles were repeated continuously. B. A typical trial was illustrated. The visual flashes were presented at one of eight locations equidistant from fixation, producing the percept of a moving disk. One cycle lasted 534 ms. On a single trial, 60 identical cycles were repeated. C. The report of a representative trial is plotted as a function of stimulus cycles.
