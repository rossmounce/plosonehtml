The mean AV synchrony relative to the veridical position (n = 10). Positive values indicate forward shifts of perceived audiovisual synchrony. The gray zone represents one standard error of the mean. The data are plotted from the third cycle onwards as there was no response in earlier cycles due to response latency. B. Probability that a transition occurs in the forward (step size: +1, +2, or +3), backward (step size: −1, −2, or −3) or to the 180° opposite position (±4), which is directionally uncategorizable either as forward or backward, as a function of cycle number is shown. The black line is the probability sum of all transitions. The smooth curves are obtained by convolving the point (event) data with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 2 cycles). C. The mean dwell time is plotted as a function of disk position. The error bars indicate one s.e.m. (n = 10).</p>
