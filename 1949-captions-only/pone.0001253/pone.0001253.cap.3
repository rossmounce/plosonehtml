Transition probabilities are shown for all possible transition combinations. The diagonal elements signifying no perceptual shifts (red crosses) are not shown. B. The same data are represented relative to current position emphasize the directionality of the shifts. C. Transition probability marginalized across all current positions is plotted as a function of the absolute disk position. D. Transition probability marginalized across all current positions is plotted as a function of the relative disk position.</p>
