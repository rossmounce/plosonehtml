Hypothetical effects of adaptation are illustrated. Without adaptation, the auditory click is temporally aligned with the visual disk just prior to the veridically synchronous disk (top row). If audiotry adaptation would increase the processing latency for the auditory click, the position of the perceptually synchronous disk would shift forward (second row). Likewise, if adaptation to visual stimuli would increase the latency for vision, the position of the perceptually synchronous disk would shift backward (third row). If continuous presentation of visual disks would result in a shortening of processing latency, the position of the perceptually synchronous disk would shift forward. B. Three experimental conditions are schematically illustrated. In the flash off condition (top), the visual stimulus was turned off during the middle cycles and returned to the screen during the last five cycles. In the sound off condition (middle), the click sound was turned off during the middle cycles. In the control condition (botttom), there was no disruption during the middle cycles. C. The mean synchronous positions for the initial and the final cycles are plotted for each condition. The error bars indicate one s.e.m. (n = 6).</p>
