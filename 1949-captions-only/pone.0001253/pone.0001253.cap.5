A trial consisted of 20 cycles, and the letter stream was presented during the middle ten trials. The observers were asked to report the position of the position of perceptually synchronous disk for the initial five and the final five cycles. B. The perceptually synchronous positions for the initial and final cycles are plotted separately for the dual-task condition (open red circles) and for the single-task condition (solid blue circles). The error bars indicate one SEM (n = 6).</p>
