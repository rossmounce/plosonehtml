The left most data points are the results of the control conditions in which no attentional manipulations were made. In all attentional manipulations, the position of a perceptually sycnhronous disk was most shifted in the forward direction and reached close to the veridical position when observers attended to the disk that occurred one disk later than the veridically synchronous disk. Error bars indicate one s.e.m. (n = 6).</p>
