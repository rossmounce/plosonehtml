                Figure 1.  MCF-7 cells expressing PyLT are sensitive to p21 but refractory to p16 arrest.(A) MCF-7 cells were transfected with wild type PyLT or a Rb binding mutant (Rb-LT) of PyLT, treated with ICI in media supplemented with charcoal stripped serum (CSS), and proliferation was assayed by double indirect immunofluorescence for PyLT and BrdU at 48 h post transfection (Materials and Methods). The percentage of BrdU positive cells in PyLT expressing (T+) and non-expressing (T-) cells is shown. The expression of wild type and mutant PyLT in transfected cells was also assessed by immunoblotting (lower panel, UT = untransfected control). (B) MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with PyLT and either vector (V) alone, or p16/p21 encoding plasmids. Proliferation in the presence of ICI was assayed by double indirect immunofluorescence for PyLT and BrdU. Filled bars (T+) represent proliferation in cells expressing PyLT alone or along with vector, p16 or p21. Empty bars (T-) represent proliferation in cells that did not express PyLT or PyLT and cotransfected plasmid constructs. (C) The Rb binding mutant (Rb-LT) of PyLT was cotransfected with the above constructs in cycling MCF-7 cells that were treated with E, and proliferation was assayed as described above. All data shown in panels A–C is shown as mean±S.E. of at least three independent experiments, with a minimum of 100 PyLT positive and negative cells counted in each condition.
