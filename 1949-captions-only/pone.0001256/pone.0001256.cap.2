                Figure 2.  Selection of stable cell lines that express PyLT in an inducible manner.(A) Clonal cell lines stably transfected with the inducible PyLT construct were selected as described in Materials and Methods, and screened for PyLT expression by immunoblotting after 24 h of AP treatment. Asterisk denotes PyLT clones 5 and 6 that were chosen for further analysis based on robust induction. (B) One clonal cell line (LT-6) was analyzed for PyLT expression by indirect immunofluorescence. Micrographs show PyLT immunofluorescence in the absence and presence of AP for 24 h, and a phase contrast picture of the same field.
