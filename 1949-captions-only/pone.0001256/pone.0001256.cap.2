Asterisk denotes PyLT clones 5 and 6 that were chosen for further analysis based on robust induction. (B) One clonal cell line (LT-6) was analyzed for PyLT expression by indirect immunofluorescence. Micrographs show PyLT immunofluorescence in the absence and presence of AP for 24 h, and a phase contrast picture of the same field.</p>
