The cell cycle profile of each sample was analyzed by flow cytometry, and the percentage of cells in S phase is shown (top panel). The results represent the average±S.D. of one experiment done in triplicate. The percentage of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle is shown in a tabular format (lower panel). The standard deviation was typically less than 2 percent. Similar results were observed for the LT-6 clone (see <a href="#pone.0001256.s002">Figure S2</a>). (B) LT-6 cells were pre-arrested with ICI, treated with ICI+AP or E+AP for 24 h, and BrdU was added to cultures during the final 5 h. Cells were then fixed and stained for both PyLT and BrdU by double indirect immunofluorescence. The percentage of PyLT positive (T<sup>+</sup>) and negative (T<sup>−</sup>) cells that were also BrdU positive is shown. The results represent the average±S.D. of one experiment done in triplicate with a 100 cells counted per condition. (C) LT-5 cells were cultured, treated, and harvested in parallel to those in (A) above. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by western blotting for PyLT, cyclins A, E and D1 and the cdk inhibitors p21 and p27. Actin was used as a loading control. Protein levels were quantified by using the Image J software and these values were normalized to actin and are shown below the respective blots. All values are expressed relative to the zero time point that was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.</p>
