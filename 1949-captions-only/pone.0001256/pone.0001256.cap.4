Cells were then harvested at 24 h intervals and the cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentages of cells in S phase at various time points are shown. The results are from one experiment, with at least 10,000 cells analyzed per sample. (B) LT-6 cells were arrested with ICI and treated with ICI+AP as described in (A). Cell extracts were prepared at the indicated time points, and analyzed for PyLT and cyclin A expression by immunoblotting. A time-matched control of cells treated with ICI alone (ICI 24 h) was included. Actin was used as a loading control. (C) LT-6 cells were growth arrested with ICI as described in (A), then PyLT was induced by ICI+AP treatment. Time matched controls (24 h) of cells incubated in ICI or E were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Cell extracts were prepared at 24 h intervals and analyzed for cdk2 <em>in vitro</em> kinase activity using histone H1 (HH1) as a substrate. Control IgG (E 24, IgG) was used as a control for antibody specificity. The level of cdk2 activity was quantified by phosphorimager scanning and is shown below the autoradiograph. The values are relative to the E 24 h time point that was set as 100%. (D) The cdk2 activity was determined after 24 h treatment of LT-6 cells with ICI, ICI+AP or E and is expressed relative to the activity in E treated samples that was set as a 100%. The results are the averageÂ±S.D. of two independent experiments.</p>
