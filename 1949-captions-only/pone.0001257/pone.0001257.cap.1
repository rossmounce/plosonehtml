                Figure 1.  MRE11 associates with the DS region of OriP.A) DNA affinity purification assays were performed with Raji nuclear extracts and DNA templates derived from DS wt, DS nm-, or Î”DS. Input and template bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to TRF2, MRE11, EBNA1, PCNA, and PARP1, as indicated. B) Schematic of template DNA used for DNA affinity purification in A, and their respective protein binding sites. C) ChIP assays to monitor EBNA1, TRF2, and MRE11 binding at OriP wt or OriP nm- in transfected 293 cells. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real time PCR relative to total input DNA recovered for each transfected cell.
