                Figure 3.  Evidence that MRE11 and NBS1 are required for EBV episome maintenance.A) OriP plasmid maintenance assays were performed in MRE11 mutant (ATLD3) and reconstituted (ATLD3/wtMRE11) cell lines (left panel) or NBS1 mutant (GM7166) and reconstituted (GM7166/wtNBS1) cell lines (right panel). Plasmids containing OriP and EBNA1 were monitored by Southern blotting of Hirt lysates at 1 (lower panel) and 7 (upper panel) days post-transfection. Phosphorimager quantification of four independent experiments as shown in panal A where maintenance is measured as the ratio of day 7 to day 1 for OriP plasmid detection is shown below. B) EBV transformed B-lymphocytes were analyzed by PFG and Southern blotting for the presence of episomal forms of the EBV genome. Raji, Namalwa, NBS1 (GM15808), NBS1 (GM07078), LCL3472, and LCLAW7 DNA was loaded at equal concentrations and analyzed by ethidium staining of PFG (lower panel) or by Southern blot (upper panel) with EBV specific probe. C) Western blot of the same cell lines used for PFG analysis shown in panel B was probed with antibodies specific for NBS1 (antibody 143 and antibody 277), MRE11, or loading control Actin.
