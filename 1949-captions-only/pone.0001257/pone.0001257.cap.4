Cell cycle fraction numbers correspond to rates of counter flow used for centrifugal elutriation. B) MutuI cells were fractionated by centrifugal elutriation as shown in panel B, and then analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies to MRE11, NBS1, and control IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real-time PCR with primers specific for OriP or control OriR regions of the EBV genome. ChIP values were presented as percentage of input DNA. Cell cycle fractions correspond to the FACS analysis in panel A.</p>
