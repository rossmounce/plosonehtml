Recombination structures are formed at OriP and provide sister chromatid cohesion through topological linkages. Resolution of these linkages in anaphase promotes genome segregation and stable plasmid maintenance. B) Speculative model showing MRN and recombination structures that may form at DS. These include strand invasion, double Holliday junctions, and hemicatenane of nascent strand DNA.</p>
