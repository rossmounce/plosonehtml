                Figure 1.  Clinical and genetic profile of the proband.A. Baseline ECG recording reporting a QTc of approximately 825 ms. Note 2:1 AV block. B. Recording after infusion with IV lidocaine (see text). QTc is approximately 450 and 2:1 block is absent. C. Chromatograms of DNA sequences: the proband but neither the mother nor father has a 4418 T = &gt;G in SCN5A resulting in a substitution of cytsteine for phenylalanine at amino acid 1473 in Nav1.5.
