Shown are averaged raw TTX sensitive traces (WT, n = 11; F1743C, n = 31). C. Averaged WT and F1473C currents normalized to peak current and superimposed at high (left) and low (inset) gain (WT n = 11, F1473C n = 31). D. Bar graph representing mean +/− S.E.M. percentage of current remaining at 200 ms with respect to peak current for both WT and F1473C (WT n = 11, F1473C n = 31); * p&lt;&lt;0.001.</p>
