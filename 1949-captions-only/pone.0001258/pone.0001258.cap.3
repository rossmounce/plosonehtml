                Figure 3.  The F1473C mutation does not affect the voltage dependence of Na+ channel activation.A. Mean current voltage relationships recorded in low external sodium solution (Methods S1) in response to 25 ms voltage pulses from âˆ’80 mV to +75 mV (5 mV increments) for WT (n = 13, open triangles) and F1473C (n = 7, closed squares). B. Mean activation curves obtained from data in A, for WT (open) and F1473C channels (filled) show no affect of the F1473C mutation on the voltage dependence of activation (see text for details).
