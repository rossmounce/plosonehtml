                Figure 6.  Mexiletine and Ranolaziine, but not Flecainde, correct mutation-induced voltage shift in steady state inactivation.Steady state inactivation was measured with a 5s conditioning pulse (see Methods S1) followed by a brief −10 mV test pulse. A. Flecainide (n = 4) did not significantly alter V1/2 or slope factor of the channel availability curve. B–C. Mexiletine (n = 5) and Ranolazine (n = 9) each caused significant hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation (Table 1).
