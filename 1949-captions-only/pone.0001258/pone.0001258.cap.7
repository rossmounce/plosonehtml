                Figure 7.  Mexiletine and ranolazine inhibit F1473C channel activity during repolarization.Inward currents were measured in response to a pulse to +20 mV for 100 ms followed by repolarization to −100 mV at −1.6 V/sec (negative ramp) (see Methods S1). A. F1473C channels, relative to WT channels, show a very large increase in non-inactivating current for the duration of the voltage pulse to +20 mV and also cause a large surge of inward current during the negative voltage ramp. B–C. Mexiletine (B) and ranolazine (C) inhibit the mutation-induced repolarizing inward current (Mexiletine block of repolarization phase peak current = 82.1+/−0.2%, n = 7; Ranolazine block of repolarization phase peak current = 83.1+/−0.2%, n = 4).
