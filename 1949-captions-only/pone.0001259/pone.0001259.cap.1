                Figure 1.  Separation of adult C. elegans from their offspring and corresponding adult feeding.Extinction (optical density; log10 scale) versus time of flight (length; log10 scale) for (panel A) wild-type and (panel B) eat-2(ad465) nematodes, showing the results of the clustering algorithm to separate either wild-type (blue) or eat-2 (red) adults from larvae (green). In panel C the relationship between fluorescence (accumulated microspheres) versus time of flight for the adult wild-type (blue) and eat-2 (red) nematodes is shown. Each point corresponds to a single nematode.
