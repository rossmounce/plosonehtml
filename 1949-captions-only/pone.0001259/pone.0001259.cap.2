                Figure 2.  Comparison of wild-type and eat mutant C. elegans feeding.Boxplots of normalized fluorescence for 19 strains of adult nematodes aggregated over all experiments. Normalization of fluorescence measurements consisted of size-adjustment, square-root transformation, and centering and scaling to the respective day's wild-type measurements. The upper and lower limits of each box give the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data respectively, and the line inside the box gives the median. Whiskers of the boxplot extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range, with extreme measurements indicated by horizontal lines. Sample sizes are given in parentheses above each boxplot.
