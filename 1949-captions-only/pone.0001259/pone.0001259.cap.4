                Figure 4.  Effect of chlorpyrifos and cadmium on C. elegans feeding.Fitted concentration-response curves of single representative experiments based on observed mean size-adjusted fluorescence measurements as a percent of the control for two toxicants, cadmium (triangles, top axis) and chlorpyrifos (circles, bottom axis). Each point represents approximately 120 nematodes on average, with counts ranging from 104 to 141.
