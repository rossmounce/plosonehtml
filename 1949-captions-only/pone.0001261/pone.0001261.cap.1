                Figure 1.  Integrity of RNA isolated from fresh and aged FFPE samples.Rat tissue samples were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. 10 µm sections were cut within 3 days after embedding (T0), or after 1 year storage at the indicated temperatures (RT–room temperature, 20–25°C). Integrity of RNA isolated from individual sections was analysed by capillary electrophoresis. 18S and 28S rRNA bands correspond to 41–43 and 47–50 [s], respectively. The lower marker (marked ‘*’) corresponds to fluorescence intensity of 7–10 [FU].
