                Figure 2.  RT-PCR efficiency with RNA from fresh and aged FFPE samples.Rat tissue samples were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. 10 µm sections were cut within 3 days after embedding (T0), or after 1 year storage at the indicated temperatures (RT–room temperature, 20–25°C). The isolated RNA was used for one-step RT-PCR with different primer pairs directed against the rat HPRT gene. Amplicon sizes were 128, 208, 404, and 668 nt. All amplicons were amplified with equal efficiency from RNAlater-stabilized rat tissue (pos. Control), and no products were obtained in no template controls (neg. control).
