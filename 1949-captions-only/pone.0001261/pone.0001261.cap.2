The isolated RNA was used for one-step RT-PCR with different primer pairs directed against the rat HPRT gene. Amplicon sizes were 128, 208, 404, and 668 nt. All amplicons were amplified with equal efficiency from RNAlater-stabilized rat tissue (pos. Control), and no products were obtained in no template controls (neg. control).</p>
