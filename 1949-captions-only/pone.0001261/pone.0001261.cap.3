Fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, and 10 µm sections were cut within 3 days after embedding for preparation of RNA. RNA quality from each sample type was analysed by capillary electrophoresis. 18S and 28S rRNA bands correspond to 42–44 and 49–51 [s], respectively. The lower marker (marked ‘*’) corresponds to fluorescence intensity of 6–8 [FU]. The color bars indicate RNA performance in one-step RT-PCR using different primer pairs directed against the rat RPL4 gene. Amplicon sizes from top to bottom were 1010, 785, 613, 400, 206, and 96 nt. Red indicates no amplification, yellow–weak amplification, green–good amplification.</p>
