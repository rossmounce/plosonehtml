Samples were embedded in paraffin, and 10 µm sections were cut within 3 days after embedding. RNA quality was analysed by capillary electrophoresis. The lower marker (marked ‘*’) corresponds to fluorescence intensity of 8–9 [FU]. RNA performance was tested in one-step RT-PCR using different primer pairs directed against the rat RPL4 gene. Amplicon sizes as seen on the gel images were 96, 206, 400, 613, and 785 nt.</p>
