                Figure 5.  Fragmentation state and RT-PCR performance of RNA from tumor samples.RNA was isolated from individual 10 µm sections of FFPE tumor samples of different age (1–10 years). Fragmentation state was analysed by capillary electrophoresis (A). RNA performance was tested in 2-step real-time RT-PCR using assays directed against the human TBP gene, using either a mix of random and oligo-dT primers for cDNA synthesis (B), or oligo-dT alone (C).
