                Figure 2.  Disease variants in HapMap captured by three high-throughput chips.A. Shows the percentage of disease variants captured by three chips either directly (chip) or through linkage disequilibrium (r2≥0.8 and r2≥0.5). B. Displays the overlapped results captured by three chips (r2≥0.5).
