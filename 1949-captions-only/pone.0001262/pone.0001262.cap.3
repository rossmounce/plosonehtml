                Figure 3.  Distribution patterns of SNPs in genic regions.SNPs in genic regions are annotated with five functional classifications: flank (within 2 kb 5′ or 500 bp 3′ of a gene, originally named locus in dbSNP), utr (5′ and 3′ untranslated region), synonymous (synonymous coding SNP), nonsynonymous (nonsynonymous coding SNP) and intron (including splice-site SNPs).
