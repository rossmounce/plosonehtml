                Figure 4.  Distribution patterns of SNPs in ontologies and pathways.Outer rings: SNPs on Hap550. Middle rings: SNPs on GeneChip 500K. Inner rings: SNPs on Human-1. Each section represents the number of SNPs on the chips assigned to a given GO category or KEGG pathways. A. Distribution patterns in GO cellular component, molecular function and biological process categories. B. Distribution patterns in KEGG pathways.
