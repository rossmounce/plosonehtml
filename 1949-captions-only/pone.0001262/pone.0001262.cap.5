                Figure 5.  Distribution patterns of SNPs in evolutionary conserved introns and nongenic regions.The percentage of SNPs on three chips is plotted against conservation score. Human-1 contains more fractions of SNPs lying in evolutionarily conserved bases, according to its original design.
