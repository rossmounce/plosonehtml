                Figure 2.  Are accompanying temporal judgments distorted with duration?(a) Experimental details are the same as Figure 1, except that the visual sequence is accompanied by an auditory beep (top), or the photographs are flickered. (b) Mean DDF values for the visual oddball task (averaged from Figure 1c), auditory pitch (n = 6) and flicker rate (n = 6) discrimination tasks.
