                Figure 3.  Increasing the emotional salience of the oddball does not increase the effect.DDF values across the two categories of trialsâ€“neutral standards with neutral oddball (e.g., coffee cup) and neutral standards with salient oddball (e.g. tarantula). DDF neutral oddball = 1.112, DDF salient oddball = 1.098, p = 0.65. Error bars S.E.M. n = 15.
