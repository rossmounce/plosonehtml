                Figure 4.  The debut effect disappears with random stimuli.(a) Participants reported whether the first stimulus in a series of repeated or random images appeared longer than the following ones. Representative data from one participant shown. (b) Mean DDF values for the repeated and random series (n = 6). The debut effect only occurs when stimuli are repeated (p&lt;6×10−4), implicating the role of predictability. Error bars SEM. n = 8.
