                Figure 5.  Prediction at higher versus lower levels.Participants made duration discriminations about the first stimulus in a series of repeated, sequential or scrambled number sequences. Both repeated and sequential images had significant duration distortions (p&lt;0.005 and p&lt;0.03, respectively). This distortion was absent in scrambled sequences. Error bars SEM. n = 7.
