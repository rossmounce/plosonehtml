                Figure 1.  Example of a pre-miRNA predicted by RNAz.A) Locus1 shows the bimodal conservation pattern typical of a conserved miRNA hairpin structure in the phastcons track of the UCSC genome browser. Sequences from Drosophilids as distant as D. mojavensis contribute to the multiz alignment at this genomic position. B) Sequences from six species were chosen as input for RNAz and lend different levels of support to stabilizing selection of the predicted secondary structure prediction (first row). The color code indicates the number of different base-pairs (green = 3 pairs to red = 1 pair) and the number of pair incompatible with the predicted structure (dark color = 0 to faint color = 2) at each position. C, D) Locus1 is predicted to fold into symmetrical hairpins in both possible directions of transcription (color code as in B).
