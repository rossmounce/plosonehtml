Small RNAs detected by sequencing map to each of the novel miRNA loci (matches 50â€“52, blue). In addition, sequences map to two loci in the vicinity, giving rise to identical mature miRNAs (matches 48,49). Finally, a sixth locus is detected immediately downstream of <em>Grip84</em> (match 53). B) <em>mir-318</em>, located downstream of the <em>Irp1B</em> locus, clusters together with novel locus41 (green and small RNA sequence match 28, blue) C) Five novel miRNAs were predicted (green) and validated (blue) on either side of an exon of the CG31646 locus. D) Novel locus4 and manual5 (green) give rise to mature miRNAs (blue) and form cluster4.</p>
