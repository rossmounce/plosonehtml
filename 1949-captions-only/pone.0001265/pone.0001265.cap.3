                Figure 3.  Examples of small RNA sequences mapping to predicted miRNA loci.Small RNA sequences recovered by sequencing [12] were mapped to the predicted loci using Megablast. A) locus12 is transcribed from the ‘–’ strand and multiple overlapping sequences map to its coordinates. Numbers on the left indicate how often each sequence was identified in the small RNA libraries. The most abundant species (red box) most likely represents the mature miRNA. B) locus3 maps to the ‘+’ strand. Details for all predicted loci is available as supplemental data.
