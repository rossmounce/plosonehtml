A–C) Endogenous small RNAs were detected with probes directed against locus7, locus25 and manual3 in total RNA extracted from untransfected S2 cells. D–F) All three transcripts were also detected in RNA from different embryonic stages (time after egg-laying). F) A probe against valine tRNA was used as a loading control.</p>
