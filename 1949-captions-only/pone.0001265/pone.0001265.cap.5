                Figure 5.  miRNAs sharing seed sequences.A) The novel miRNA manual7 contains the same seed sequence as the D. melanogaster mir-12 miRNA and its orthologs. B) Sequence similarity between the novel locus11 and vertebrate miR-22 extends beyond the seed region, hinting at a possible common ancestry of these miRNAs. C) The mature sequence of Drosophila mir-12 was detected more than 1400 times in the small RNA libraries in samples from all developmental stages/tissues with the exception of the early embryo. D) The most abundant sequence mapping to the novel manual7 locus is distributed differently over the 10 sequenced samples, with RNA from discs contributing &gt;80% of hits.
