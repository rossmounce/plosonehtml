B) Sequence similarity between the novel locus11 and vertebrate <em>miR-22</em> extends beyond the seed region, hinting at a possible common ancestry of these miRNAs. C) The mature sequence of <em>Drosophila mir-12</em> was detected more than 1400 times in the small RNA libraries in samples from all developmental stages/tissues with the exception of the early embryo. D) The most abundant sequence mapping to the novel manual7 locus is distributed differently over the 10 sequenced samples, with RNA from discs contributing &gt;80% of hits.</p>
