A) Similar fractions of the four members of the Drosophila <em>miR-310-313</em> cluster are recovered in embryonic, imaginal disc and adult body samples, but virtually absent from the other samples. Bâ€“E) Members of the four novel miRNA clusters are distributed equally tightly over the small RNA libraries, demonstrating tight co-regulation. F) The mature sequences of locus4 and manual5 are highly similar and map to neighboring genomic coordinates (E), suggesting a duplication event that gave rise to two independent loci.</p>
