                Figure 6.  Four novel clusters encoding tightly co-expressed miRNAs.Though the individual number of sequence hits recovered in the small RNA libraries differs greatly between different miRNAs, the relative abundance in the different sequenced samples is highly correlated for miRNAs originating from the same cluster. A) Similar fractions of the four members of the Drosophila miR-310-313 cluster are recovered in embryonic, imaginal disc and adult body samples, but virtually absent from the other samples. Bâ€“E) Members of the four novel miRNA clusters are distributed equally tightly over the small RNA libraries, demonstrating tight co-regulation. F) The mature sequences of locus4 and manual5 are highly similar and map to neighboring genomic coordinates (E), suggesting a duplication event that gave rise to two independent loci.
