                Figure 1.  Entry into, and recovery from, a single bout of anoxia.Typical effects of 60 minutes of anoxia on the CO2 emission rate (VCO2; black), water loss rate (WLR; red) and activity (green; no units shown) of a male Drosophila melanogaster, mass 0.916 mg, at 25Â°C. B = baselines. A = initiation of anoxia. N = return to normoxia, S = secondary CO2 peak after reperfusion to normoxia. Note the increase in VCO2 after recovery from anoxia (recovery is evident in the activity trace).
