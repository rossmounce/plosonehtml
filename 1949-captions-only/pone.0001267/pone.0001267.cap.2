                Figure 2.  Effects of anoxia duration.The relation between anoxia duration and A) the volume of the secondary peak of CO2 emission after reperfusion to normoxia (measured by integration of the secondary peak against the background level of the primary peak, using sloping baselines). The secondary peak attains a maximum value after 30 minutes of anoxia exposure. Anoxia duration significantly affected the secondary peak areas (F4, 32 = 12.73, P&lt;10−6); B) the minimum level of water loss rate (WLR) attained after reperfusion to normoxia, which is inversely related to the integrity of spiracular function. The longer the exposure to anoxia, the less adequately the spiracular control system recovered (F5, 42 = 9.94, P&lt;10−5); C) the time required to resume voluntary activity (recovery). The longer the exposure to anoxia, the longer the time required for recovery. The dimensionless slope of the line is 0.399 (F1,36 = 169.0, P&lt;10−6). Each point shown is the mean value for the number of flies (out of 8) that recovered; these are 8 for all anoxia durations except 90 minutes (5 recovered) and 120 minutes (only one recovered). Error bars are standard errors. The curves enclose the 95% confidence limits of the line fitted to data pooled by anoxia duration.
