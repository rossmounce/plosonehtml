Successive reperfusions rapidly elevated water loss rates, and thus diminished spiracular control integrity (F<sub>5, 30</sub> = 19.91, P&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). B) the volume of CO<sub>2</sub> released by mitochondrial activity. Successive reperfusions rapidly reduced mitochondrial activity (F<sub>5, 30</sub> = 19.91, P&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). Considered as a linear regression using the points shown, reperfusion number explained &gt;95% of mitochondrial activity variance (F<sub>1, 3</sub> = 62.0, P = 0.004). The curves enclose the 95% confidence limits of the fitted line. The five reperfusions lasted for 60 seconds each and were spaced 20 minutes apart. Each point shown is the mean value for 6 flies. Error bars are standard errors.</p>
