                Figure 4.  Effects of multiple oxygen reperfusions.The effect of successive reperfusions on A) water loss rate (WLR which is inversely related to spiracular control integrity). Successive reperfusions rapidly elevated water loss rates, and thus diminished spiracular control integrity (F5, 30 = 19.91, P&lt;10−6). B) the volume of CO2 released by mitochondrial activity. Successive reperfusions rapidly reduced mitochondrial activity (F5, 30 = 19.91, P&lt;10−6). Considered as a linear regression using the points shown, reperfusion number explained &gt;95% of mitochondrial activity variance (F1, 3 = 62.0, P = 0.004). The curves enclose the 95% confidence limits of the fitted line. The five reperfusions lasted for 60 seconds each and were spaced 20 minutes apart. Each point shown is the mean value for 6 flies. Error bars are standard errors.
