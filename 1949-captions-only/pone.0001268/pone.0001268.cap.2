                Figure 2.  Exposure to violent stimuli diminishes activation of a frontolimbic regulatory circuit.Presented are the significant voxels in right ltOFC for the response attenuation regression analysis, in which the violent condition is compared against the controls. Average hemodynamic responses (HDRs) were extracted on a per-trial basis from this cluster during all three film conditions; these responses were averaged across subjects based on condition type and exposure number, then averaged together into consecutive bins of three. Presented are the maximum signal changes of each binned HDR, expressed as a fraction of the first bin magnitude. The violent clips induced a continuous response attenuation trend that was not present during exposure to the fearful or neutral clips (r2violence = 0.79, p = 0.003; r2fearful = 0.41, p = 0.09; r2neutral = 0.30, p = 0.16). It is important to note that certain areas such as the amygdala were active during the individual conditions alone, or even combined, but that these areas did not show a differential activation between the violent and control conditions. In attention-related areas, all three conditions produced nearly identical attenuation trends; see Fig S2. (B) Psychophysiological interaction analysis identified left amygdala voxels in which functional connectivity with right ltOFC decreased with each exposure to the violent stimuli (p&lt;0.05, mixed-effects t-test).
