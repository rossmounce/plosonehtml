Scores spanned a standard, non-clinical range from 22 to 42, out of a possible 85. (Robust-fitted least squares line added.) (B) HDRs (nine-second window) from right ltOFC during the violent condition were extracted from the three subjects with the lowest (top) and highest (bottom) reactive aggression scores and then averaged together based on exposure number. They are presented in sequence, with responses averaged together in bins of four. (The first trace is the average of responses 1–4, the second trace of responses 5–8, and so on.)</p>
