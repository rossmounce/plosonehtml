                Figure 4.  Increased throughput to motor planning regions coincident with diminished regulatory control.The data are analyzed and presented as in figure 2. Exposure to the violent clips induced an increase in supplementary motor response, whereas exposure to the fearful or neutral clips did not (r2violence = 0.55, p = 0.03; r2fearful = 0.03, p = 0.67; r2neutral = 0.12, p = 0.39).
