                Figure 2.  Progerin expression in primary dermal fibroblast cultures.A, Immunofluorescence microscopy on primary dermal fibroblasts from an HGPS subject and unaffected individuals of indicated ages with rabbit monoclonal anti-progerin antibody. B, Immunofluoresence detection of progerin in HGADFN 127 (HGPS individual) and DR118 (86-year-old individual) at late PPDs. C, Western blot analysis of nuclear protein extracts derived from fibroblast cultures HGADFN 127 (HGPS) at PPD 20 and DR118 (86-year-old female) at PPD 15 and 30, respectively, were immunoprecipitated with anti-progerin mAb 972S9 and the corresponding Western blot was probed with the same antibody.
