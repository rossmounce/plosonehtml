                Figure 3.  In situ localization of progerin on human skin sections derived from a subject with HGPS and from unaffected individuals.A, HGPS skin sections immunostained with anti-progerin (prog), anti-lamin A (LMNA) antibody, or anti-α smooth muscle actin antibody (αSMA) and counterstained with a DNA stain (dapi). Morphologic entities are indicated: epidermis (ep), dermis (de), sweat glands (SG), capillary (c), arrector pili muscle (a), and hair follicle (h). B, Newborn foreskin sections immunolabelled with anti-progerin or anti-αSMA antibody. C, Breast skin sections from 22- and 46-year-old female subjects probed with anti-progerin and lamin A. The respective double or triple merged signals are indicated.
