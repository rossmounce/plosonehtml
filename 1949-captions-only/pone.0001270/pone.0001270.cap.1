Clone BCDE containing elements unique to bovine PC 5′UTRs B, C, D, and E was truncated by removing the 96 bp segment near the PC coding sequence to form clone BCDE<sub>t</sub> (Panel B). The size of the UTR fragments of the parent and truncated clones is indicated within the shaded and patterned area. In both cases the segment removed included a portion of the 3′ end of the UTR and a portion of the 5′ end of the coding sequence. The coding region is indicated as CR. The adaptor for ligation of Bcl<em>I</em> and BSU<em>36I</em> digestions is shown in Panel C. The highlighted sequence represents the adaptor and plain text represents the sequence of the 5′ overhang end obtained from Bcl<em>I</em> and BSU<em>36I</em> digestion of plasmids ABCEF<sub>t</sub> and BCDE<sub>t</sub>.</p>
