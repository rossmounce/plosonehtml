                Figure 1.  Construction of truncated RPA probes for bovine PC 5′ UTR variant analysis.Plasmid ABCEF containing all of the elements for bovine PC 5′ UTR was truncated by removing the 96 bp segment near the start of the PC coding sequence to form clone ABCEFt (Panel A). Clone BCDE containing elements unique to bovine PC 5′UTRs B, C, D, and E was truncated by removing the 96 bp segment near the PC coding sequence to form clone BCDEt (Panel B). The size of the UTR fragments of the parent and truncated clones is indicated within the shaded and patterned area. In both cases the segment removed included a portion of the 3′ end of the UTR and a portion of the 5′ end of the coding sequence. The coding region is indicated as CR. The adaptor for ligation of BclI and BSU36I digestions is shown in Panel C. The highlighted sequence represents the adaptor and plain text represents the sequence of the 5′ overhang end obtained from BclI and BSU36I digestion of plasmids ABCEFt and BCDEt.
