The full sequence of each bovine 5′ UTR variant is represented by the connected series of filled and shaded boxes (that are described in <a href="#pone-0001270-g001">Figure 1</a>) to the left of the variant name. The full length riboprobes are indicated in the top left corner of each panel. Pairing of riboprobe segments with each 5′ UTR variant is indicated below the boxes representing each variant. Upon digestion with RNase H and T1 the sense and antisense paired strands of RNA remaining in solution are indicated for each UTR variant and coding sequence. The sizes of the protected fragments that originate from hybridization with each riboprobe are given on the right. Both probes protect an identical 59 nucleotide fragment of the coding sequence of bovine PC.</p>
