The protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 5.5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. The protected fragments were visualized by exposing the dried polyacrylamide gel to Kodak X-Omat film and quantified using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Version 2.0.1). Fragments for transcripts bPC5′A, bPC5′B, bPC5′C, bPC5′D, bPC5′E, and bPC5′F are indicated by the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively. The abbreviations CR, M, UE, and UC represent the coding region, molecular weight markers, undigested probe BCDE<sub>t</sub>, and undigested probe ABCEF<sub>t</sub>, respectively. Size of molecular weight markers are shown on the left of the gel.</p>
