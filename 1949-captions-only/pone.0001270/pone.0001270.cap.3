                Figure 3.  Autoradiogram of ribonuclease protection assay for bovine 5′ UTR variants.Total RNA samples were hybridized in solution with either riboprobe ABCEFt or BCDEt and digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1. The protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 5.5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. The protected fragments were visualized by exposing the dried polyacrylamide gel to Kodak X-Omat film and quantified using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Version 2.0.1). Fragments for transcripts bPC5′A, bPC5′B, bPC5′C, bPC5′D, bPC5′E, and bPC5′F are indicated by the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively. The abbreviations CR, M, UE, and UC represent the coding region, molecular weight markers, undigested probe BCDEt, and undigested probe ABCEFt, respectively. Size of molecular weight markers are shown on the left of the gel.
