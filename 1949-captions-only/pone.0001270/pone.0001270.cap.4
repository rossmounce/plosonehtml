Abundance of each variant was determined by dividing the uracil-adjusted values for each variant by the uracil-adjusted value of coding region generated from riboprobe ABCEF<sub>t</sub> and riboprobe BCDE<sub>t</sub>. Means separation was by Duncan's Multiple Range Test and means that are statistically different (P&lt;0.05) are indicated by superscripts (a, b, c, and d) above the bars that differ.</p>
