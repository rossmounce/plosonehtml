                Figure 4.  Contribution of PC 5â€²UTR variants to total PC mRNA on +1 d relative to calving.RNA samples were subjected to RPA analysis and the abundance of protected fragments was adjusted for the number of uracil residues within each fragment. Abundance of each variant was determined by dividing the uracil-adjusted values for each variant by the uracil-adjusted value of coding region generated from riboprobe ABCEFt and riboprobe BCDEt. Means separation was by Duncan's Multiple Range Test and means that are statistically different (P&lt;0.05) are indicated by superscripts (a, b, c, and d) above the bars that differ.
