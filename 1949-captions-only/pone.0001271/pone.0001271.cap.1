This arrangement is different from the three strains that represent the BoNT/A2, BoNT/A3 and BoNT/A4 subtypes which contains the orfX3, orfX2, orfX1, BotR, p47, NTNH and BoNT genes. The BoNT/A4 complex is connected by dashed lines to the BoNT/bvB complex to indicate its presence within the same plasmid yet separated by about 97 kb. Partial IS elements (designated IS') are indicated in green and identified by IS family designations. Genes flanking the toxin complex include the <em>lyc</em>A, <em>ars</em>C or flagellin genes. The presence of a partial flagellin gene is designated as flagellin'. Hypothetical proteins are indicated in black. Numbers indicate the distances in nucleotides within intergenic regions.</p>
