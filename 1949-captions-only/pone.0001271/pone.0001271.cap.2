                Figure 2.  Simplot comparing the NTNH subtype sequences to the Loch Maree strain.The NTNH genes within BoNT/A1, BoNT/A2, BoNT/A4, BoNT/B1 and BoNT/bvB subtypes were compared to the NTNH gene within the BoNT/A3, Loch Maree strain. The plot shows the similarity of the NTNH genes within each of these subtypes along the length of the gene and shows a recombination event in the middle of the A1 NTNH gene (at approximately 1800 bp) where the sequence becomes more similar to the A3 NTNH in the second half of the gene.
