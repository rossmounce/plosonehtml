                Figure 3.  Circular plasmid maps of pCLK (Loch Maree), pCLJ (657), and pCLD (okra).These plasmid maps show the location of the neurotoxin gene complexes within each of the plasmids and the predicted sites of gene transcription. The 266,805 bp pCLK contains the BoNT/A3 gene, the 270,346 bp pCLJ contains both the BoNT/A4 and BoNT/bvB genes separated by about 97 kb and the 148,780 bp pCLD contains the BoNT/B1 gene. The data are described from the outermost circle to the innermost circle. Circles 1 and 2 show black bars to indicate predicted coding sequences on the plus strand (circle 1) and minus strand (circle 2). Circle 3 and 4 indicate the BoNT cluster genes transcribed on the plus strand and minus strand respectively. The colors used in circle 3 and 4 are the same as shown in Figure 1: NTNH and BoNT genes are red, orfX1, orfX2, orfX3 are dark blue, p47 is light blue, HA70, HA17 and HA33 are light purple and botR is orange. Circle 5 depicts the G+C content and the innermost purple circle shows the GC skew (Gâˆ’C/G+C) with tan values &gt;1 and purple&lt;1.
