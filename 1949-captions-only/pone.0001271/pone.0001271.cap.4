Regions that are not shared include the BoNT/B1 or BoNT/bvB gene clusters within the BoNT/A3 Loch Maree strain or the BoNT/A3 and BoNT/A4 gene clusters within the BoNT/B1 okra strain. These regions appear to have been deleted from pCLK and pCLD. Within pCLK and pCLJ an inversion, approximately 16.7 kb in size, has occurred where the toxin gene cluster for BoNT/A4 appears in the opposite direction from BoNT/A3. The lower panel expands the two regions designated as insert 1 and 2 in the upper panel. These regions detail the conserved plasmid sequences that flank the BoNT/A3 and BoNT/A4 extended cluster (15.4 kb upstream to 23.6 kb downstream) and the BoNT/B1 and BoNT/bvB extended cluster (3.5 kb upstream to 9.3 kb downstream).</p>
