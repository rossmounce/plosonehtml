The vector has an internal SV40 promoter (SV40) from which the neomycin-resistant gene (NeoR) is transcribed and translated. The myc oncogene (v-myc) is transcribed from the LTR (long terminal repeat). (B): Karyotyping analysis of B10 cells revealed the normal human karyotype of 46, XX. (C): Phase contrast microscopy of primary human MSCs derived from fetal human bone marrow (16 weeks gestation). Bar indicates 20 µm. (D): Immunofluorescence microscopy of primary human MSCs expressing nestin staining, a cell type specific-marker for neural stem cells. Cell nuclei are labeled by DAPI. (E): Phase contrast microscopy of B10 human MSC cell line at passage 11. (F): Immunofluorescence microscopy of B10 cells expressing nestin staining. Bars in (C–F) indicate 20 µm.</p>
