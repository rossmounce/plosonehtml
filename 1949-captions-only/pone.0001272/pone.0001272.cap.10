                Figure 10.  Expression of neurotrophic factors in B10 cells by RT-PCR Gene expression of neurotrophic factors and cytokine receptors (involved in cellular migration of B10 cells) was analyzed by RT-PCR in primary human MSCs and B10 cells.B10 cells express genes for neurotrophic factors including NGF, BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, bFGF, IGF, HGF and VEGF. In addition, receptors for cytokines known for induction of cell migration, VEGFR1, CXCR4 and c-kit are expressed by B10 cells.
