Surface phenotype was analysed by FACS. Open histograms are for control immunoglobulins and colored histograms are for specific antibodies. MSC markers, CD29, CD44 and CD166 are expressed in B10 cells while hematopoietic stem cell markers, CD14, CD34 and CD45 are not. (B)–(D): B10 cells were cultured for 2 weeks in the selection media specifically designed for adipogenic, osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation. (B), adipogenic differentiation is shown with oil red O staining and RT-PCR analysis for lipoprotein lipase; (C): Osteogenic differentiation is shown with alkaline phosphatase staining and RT-PCR analysis for osteopontin, osteocalcin and PTH receptor; (D): Chondrogenic differentiation is detected with alcian blue staining and RT-PCR analysis for syndecan, perlecan and type II collagen. Bars indicate 50 µm.</p>
