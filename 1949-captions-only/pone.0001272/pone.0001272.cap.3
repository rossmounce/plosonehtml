                Figure 3.  Neuronal phenotype and neuronal differentiation of B10 cells.Gene expression of stem cell markers and neuronal markers was examined by RT-PCR. B10 cells reproduce genetic features of primary human bone marrow MSCs by expressing ABCG2 and Oct-4 as general stem cell markers, Mash 1 and Otx 2 as neurogenic bHLH genes, nestin as a cell type specific marker for neural stem cells, and low-molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-L), intermediate molecular weight NF (NF-M) and high molecular weight NF (NF-H) as specific markers for neurons. B10 cells were grown in medium containing basic FGF for 2 weeks, In these conditions, B10 cells were demonstrated to differentiate into neurons.
