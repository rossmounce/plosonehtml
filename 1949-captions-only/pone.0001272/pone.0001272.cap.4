Bar inciates 20 µm. (B) Two color Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstarating pluripotential differentiation of B10 cells into neurons (as shown by NF-L/green staining) and astrocytes (GFAP/red). B10 cells were grown in serum-containing medium supplemented with basic FGF for 2 weeks. (C) Percentage of neural cells immunoreaction-positive for β-tubulin III, NF-L, NF-M and NF-H is determined in the B10 cells treated with 100 ng/ml bFGF and the controls (in the absence of bFGF). Cell number was determined in 5 fields of low magnification. Error bars = SEM.</p>
