                Figure 5.  Electrophysiology of B10 cells demonstrating neuronal characteristics.(A): Voltage-gated channel activation in B10 cells following treatment with 100 ng/ml bFGF for 11–14 days. The holding potential was −80 mV and depolarizing steps were applied from −80 mV to +40 mV in 10 mV increments. (B): Na+ currents were activated from a depolarizing step of −40 mV and blocked reversibly by 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX). B10 cells grown with bFGF showed sustained outward currents as well. These currents showed a voltage-dependence and kinetics characteristics for delayed rectifier K+ channels. (C): Neurotransmitter-elicited currents. Application of 1 mM GABA, 100 µM glycine, or 100 µM glutamate resulted in inward currents in the presence or absence of specific antagonists, bicuculline (10 µM), strychnine (1 µM) or APV (200 µM), respectively.
