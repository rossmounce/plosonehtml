Two weeks after transplantation, an extensive migration of B10 cells was identified. (B): Two weeks post-operation, LacZ-positive B10 cells were noted migrating away from the injection track and located along the hemorrhage borders and also into contralateral hemisphere via corpus callosum. (C)–(E): Higher magnification of areas identified in (B) indicating a good survival and long-distance migration of LacZ-positive B10 cells from the injection site. Bar in (B) indicates 0.5 mm, and bars in (C)–(E) are 100 µm.</p>
