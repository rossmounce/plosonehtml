                Figure 7.  B10 cells labeled by β-galactosidase (β-gal) transplanted into the cortex overlying the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) lesion are found to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes.Two weeks post-transplantation at the lesion sites. In vivo differentiation of β-gal-positive B10 cells into neurons was shown by β-tubulin III (A and B), and neurofilament (C) and into astrocytes as shown by GFAP (D) staining. Bar indicates 50 µm.
