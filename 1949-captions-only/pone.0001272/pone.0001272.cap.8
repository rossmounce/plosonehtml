(A): LacZ (β-gal)-positive B10 cells are found migrating into the pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus. Bar indicates 100 µm. (B)–(D): β-galactosidase-positive B10 cells differentiate into neurofilament (NF)-positive neurons in hippocampus in the lesion side (B), in the boundary of striatal lesion (C) and corpus callosum (D) at 6 weeks post-transplantation. Bar indicates 100 µm.</p>
