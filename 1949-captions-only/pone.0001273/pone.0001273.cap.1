                Figure 1.  Mutation of Cys residues within the syntaxin 1A TMD disrupts depolarization-evoked capacitance transient.(A) Upper protocol, depolarizing voltage command consisting of depolarization from a holding potential of −80 mV to 0 mV for 2×500 ms, separated by 100 ms at −80 mV. Continuous monitoring of membrane capacitance of exemplary recordings, showing the effect of depolarization on membrane capacitance (Cm) in an oocyte expressing, Lc-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2) subunits α11.2, β2A, α2δ without (left) and with SNARE's: Sx1A 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin (right). The SNAREs and synaptotagmin were injected 24 hr after the injection of the channel subunits. (B). Monitoring Cm in oocytes expressing different Sx 1A mutants- Oocytes expressing heterologously Cav1.2 subunits (α11.2, β2A, α2δ), SNAP-25, synaptotagmin I with either one of the Sx mutants: C271V/C272V, C272V, C271V, or V271C/V272C (Trus et al., 2001; Arien et al., 2003) or a truncated Sx 1A (1–167) (C) Summary: effect of depolarization on Cm. Groups as in (B). ΔCm, depolarization-induced change of membrane capacitance; bars show mean±SEM (n = 13). Inset, The effect of depolarization on membrane current (InA mean±SEM, n = 13–18). (D) Monitoring differences in Cm induced by different pulse duration via excitosome composed of Sx 1A and Sx CC/VV- Capacitance induced by varying depolarizing pulses as indicated; bars show mean±SEM (n = 13–15).
