Currents were elicited from a holding potential of –80 mV to +10 mV in response to 500 ms pulse (<em>upper panels</em>). Leak-subtracted peak current–voltage relations collected data from oocytes expressing GFP-α<sub>1</sub>1.2/β2A/α2/δ (5/5/5 ng/oocyte) without (-○-) and with RFP-Sx1A (0.8 ng/oocyte -•- and 1.6 ng/oocyte -▪-) (A) and RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV). Currents were elicited in response to 500 ms pulse from a holding potential of –80 mV to various test potentials at 5-sec intervals (B) (<em>middle</em>). Activation rate constants (τ, mean±SEM, n = 12) of currents generated in oocytes by GFP-α<sub>1</sub>1.2/β2A/α2/δ without (-○-) and with RFP-Sx1A (0.8 ng/oocyte -•- and 1.6 ng/oocyte -▪-) (A) and RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV) (B) (<em>lower</em>). The data points correspond to the mean±SEM of currents (n = 8-14) at each experimental point. Two-sample Student's t tests assuming unequal variance were applied, and P values &lt;0.01 were obtained (C) Dose dependent of GFP-α<sub>1</sub>1.2/β2A/α2/δ current inhibition, plotted against increasing RFP-Sx1A and RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV) RNA concentration injected into oocytes. (D) Sx1A expression was tested in a western blot analysis of oocyte plasma membrane fraction co expressing GFP-α<sub>1</sub>1.2/β2A/α2/δ and 1.6 ng/oocyte RFP-Sx1A, 1.6 ng/oocyte RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV), 1.6 ng/oocyte Sx1A. Proteins were detected with anti-Sx1A antibodies.</p>
