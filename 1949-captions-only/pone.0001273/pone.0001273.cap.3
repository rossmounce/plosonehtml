(B) Oocytes were injected with cRNA mixture encoding the excitosome complex (GFP-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2/RFP-Sx1A/SNAP-25/SytI) or (C) (GFP-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2/RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV)/SNAP-25/SytI) and fluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy. GFP-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 fluorescence (<em>upper panel</em>) and RFP-Sx1A fluorescence (<em>middle panel</em>) were localized at the cell membrane and a merge of the showed co-localization of both proteins. The enlarged area is depicted at the right hand side. The experiment was repeated two times with 4 oocytes in each group.</p>
