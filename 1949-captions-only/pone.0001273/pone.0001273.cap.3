                Figure 3.  Expression and localization of Sx1A and Sx1A(CC/VV) on the cell membrane.(A) Western blot analysis of membrane fraction of oocyte expressing GFP-α11.2/β2A/α2/δ (5/5/5 ng/oocyte) with either RFP-Sx1A (1.6 ng/oocyte) or RFP-Sx1A (CC/VV) (1.6 ng/oocyte) or Sx1A (1.6 ng/oocyte), with or without SNAP-25 (1.6 ng/oocyte) and Syt I (3.2 ng/oocyte) (Excitosome, Ex), using anti-Sx1Aa antibodies. (B) Oocytes were injected with cRNA mixture encoding the excitosome complex (GFP-Cav1.2/RFP-Sx1A/SNAP-25/SytI) or (C) (GFP-Cav1.2/RFP-Sx1A(CC/VV)/SNAP-25/SytI) and fluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy. GFP-Cav1.2 fluorescence (upper panel) and RFP-Sx1A fluorescence (middle panel) were localized at the cell membrane and a merge of the showed co-localization of both proteins. The enlarged area is depicted at the right hand side. The experiment was repeated two times with 4 oocytes in each group.
