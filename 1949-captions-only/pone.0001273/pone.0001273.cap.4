                Figure 4.  Phenyl arsene oxide abolished depolarization evoked ΔCm.(A) Continuous monitoring of membrane capacitance induced by a depolarizing voltage command from a holding potential of −80 mV to 0 mV of 2×500 ms, separated by 100 ms at −80 mV in an oocyte expressing, Cav1.2 subunits, α11.2, β2A, α2δ without (upper left) and with SNARE's: Sx1A, SNAP-25 and SytI (upper right), and with either PAO (10 µM) (lower left) or PAO (10 µm) followed by 2 mM BAL (lower right). (B) Summary of effect of depolarization on Cm. Groups as in the exemplary recordings shown in (A). ΔCm, depolarization-induced change of membrane capacitance; (left) bars show mean±SEM (n = 13) and the Effect of depolarization on mean peak Ba2+ currents: InA (mean±SEM, n = 11; right).
