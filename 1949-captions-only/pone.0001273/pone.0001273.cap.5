                Figure 5.  Modulation of Cav1.2 kinetics by syntaxin isoforms.Oocytes were injected with α11.2 (2 ng/oocyte), β2A (5 ng/oocyte), α2δ (5 ng/oocyte) and 24 hr later, with either one of the syntaxin isoforms (2 ng/oocyte). (A) At day 6 after cRNA injection Ba2+ currents were elicited from a holding potential of –80 mV by voltage steps applied at 5-sec intervals to test potentials between –35 to +45 mV in response to 160 ms pulse duration. Representative traces of inward currents are shown. (B) Leak subtracted peak-current relationship: collected data form oocytes expressing Cav1.2 (o) and Cav1.2 with each one of the Sx isoforms (•). The data points correspond to the mean±SEM of currents (n = 8) at each experimental point. (C) The effect of syntaxin isoforms on I/Imax ratio. Peak current amplitudes normalized to maximum current (I/Imax) (data from B) are plotted against test potentials and displayed with a Boltzmann fit (mean±S.E.M; n = 8–10; more details in Experimental Procedures). (D) The averaged time constant of activation (τact mean±S.E, n = 11–13) are plotted against test pulses between −25 and +20 mV in the absence of (o) and in the presence (•) of Sx isoform as indicated.
