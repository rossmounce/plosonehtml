(<em>A</em>) Superposition of representative online leak-subtracted current traces measured with Sx isoforms as indicated with voltage protocols diagramed at the top. (<em>B</em>) The first 30 ms of the response is shown. The normalized traces show a shift of Cav1.2 activation by Sx isoforms. (<em>C</em>) Normalized conductance–voltage (G/Gmax) relationship obtained from (<a href="#pone-0001273-g003">Fig. 3.B</a>) displayed with a Boltzmann fit. The mid-point of activation (V1/2) and the Boltzmann slope (k) of Cav1.2 were: V1/2 = −7.6±0.2 mV, k = 6.3±0.3; with Sx 1A, V1/2 = −3.5±1.9 mV; k = 5.9±1; with Sx 2, V1/2 = −1.8±1.9 mV; k = 5±0.6±1; with Sx3, V1/2 = −3.7±0.9 mV, k = 5.9±0.5; and with Sx 4, V1/2 = −3.5±1.4 mV; k = 6.3±0.7. (<em>D</em>) Peak current amplitudes normalized to maximum current (I/Imax) (data from <a href="#pone-0001273-g003">Fig. 3B</a>) are plotted against test potentials and displayed with a Boltzmann fit. The data points correspond to the mean±S.E.M. (n = 10–12). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test.</p>
