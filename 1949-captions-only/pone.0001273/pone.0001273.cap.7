Capacitance steps were elicited by two consecutive pulses of 500 ms, 100 ms apart as depicted in the protocol in <a href="#pone-0001273-g001">Fig. 1D</a>. Monitoring Cm in representative oocytes expressing heterologously Cav1.2 without and with SNAP-25, synaptotagmin and different syntaxin 1A isoforms. The amino acid sequence of Sx isoforms TMD are shown (<em>left)</em>. (<em>B</em>) Summary of the exemplary recordings shown in (A) of the Sx isoforms effect on Cm induced by membrane depolarization of Cav1.2 0.71±0.07 nF; n = 11; and with: Sx 1A, 2.65±0.17 nF (n = 20), Sx 2, 1.04±0.13 nF (n = 16), Sx 3, 0.86±0.12 nF (n = 12) and Sx 4, 0.48±0.11 (n = 12) (Groups as in A). <em>insert,</em> Average the corresponding peak currents amplitudes of VGCC expressed with SNAP-25, synaptotagmin and syntaxin isoforms, as indicated.</p>
