                Figure 7.  Assembly of the excitosome with syntaxin isoforms does not support depolarization-induced secretion.(A) Oocytes were injected with Cav1.2 subunits (as detailed in legend to Fig. 1) and 24 hr later with cRNA encoding SNAP-25, Syt 1 and either one of the syntaxin isoforms. Capacitance steps were elicited by two consecutive pulses of 500 ms, 100 ms apart as depicted in the protocol in Fig. 1D. Monitoring Cm in representative oocytes expressing heterologously Cav1.2 without and with SNAP-25, synaptotagmin and different syntaxin 1A isoforms. The amino acid sequence of Sx isoforms TMD are shown (left). (B) Summary of the exemplary recordings shown in (A) of the Sx isoforms effect on Cm induced by membrane depolarization of Cav1.2 0.71±0.07 nF; n = 11; and with: Sx 1A, 2.65±0.17 nF (n = 20), Sx 2, 1.04±0.13 nF (n = 16), Sx 3, 0.86±0.12 nF (n = 12) and Sx 4, 0.48±0.11 (n = 12) (Groups as in A). insert, Average the corresponding peak currents amplitudes of VGCC expressed with SNAP-25, synaptotagmin and syntaxin isoforms, as indicated.
