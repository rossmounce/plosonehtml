                Figure 8.  Assembly of VGCC Sx 1A, SNAP-25, and SytI, to generate a releasing complex; A Schematic model.The voltage -gated Ca2+ channel is schematically illustrated as a transmembrane barrel (yellow), and Sx 1A as a single transmembrane domain (red). (A) The Ca2+ channel, interact with Sx 1A transmembrane domain either via Cys 271 or Cys 272 residues, where one channel molecule interacts with one Sx1A (left). A simultaneous interaction of one Sx 1A molecule with two adjacent VGCC molecules via two vicinal Cys resides, lead to the Sx1A lashing two VGCC molecules, consequently, three Sx1A together with three VGCC molecules generate a secreting competent cluster (right). For simplicity, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin were not inserted. (B) Top view of the cluster formed by three Sx1A and three Ca2+ channel molecules, clearly illustrates the fusion pore that traverses the plasma membrane to form a circle (shaded area).
