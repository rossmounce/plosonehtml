The y-axis of each panel shows power while the x-axis shows the proportion of variance explained by the QTL under study. The red (for MG), green (for GRAMMAR), blue (for PedGR-GC), and pink (for GC) circles show the empirical power estimates. The power estimates are based on Î± = 0.01. The empirical power estimates are based on 1000 simulations for NP, and IPP, and 100 simulations for ERF.</p>
