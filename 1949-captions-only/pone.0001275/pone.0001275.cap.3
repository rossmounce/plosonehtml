                Figure 3.  Hierarchical tree showing the structure of the citation network calculated using the ‘edge betweenness’ algorithm [13].Due to space constraints, only the tree leaves corresponding to articles are depicted. Tree branches correspond to the splits of the network. The very first split produced two clusters called C1 and C2. Subsequent splits revealed divisions between seven subgroups within the C1 group. Tree leaf colours indicate the type of pesticide or drug considered by the articles.
