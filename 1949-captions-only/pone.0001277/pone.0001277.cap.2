Grey boxes represent genes that are not identifiably orthologous or are not conserved in context. Regions of both genomes transposed above or below the aligned regions represent blocks of genes in different contexts. The chromosomal location of the <em>E. cuniculi</em> orthologue of such genes from <em>E. bieneusi</em> is indicated by Arabic numerals above the boxes. The chromosomal location of syntenic ORFs in the genome of <em>E. cuniculi</em> is shown in the lower part of the figure and annotated with Roman numbers. Straight lines join the homologous ORFs. Red triangles represent boundaries between the contigs used to generate the scaffolds presented in these figures.</p>
