                Figure 2.  Analysis of contigs included in the scaffold SC_2384 and gene order comparisons between the E. bieneusi (A) and E. cuniculi (B) orthologues.Coloured boxes represent orthologues in the same context in both genomes, and the chromosome on which each E. cuniculi segment is located is indicated by Roman numerals. Grey boxes represent genes that are not identifiably orthologous or are not conserved in context. Regions of both genomes transposed above or below the aligned regions represent blocks of genes in different contexts. The chromosomal location of the E. cuniculi orthologue of such genes from E. bieneusi is indicated by Arabic numerals above the boxes. The chromosomal location of syntenic ORFs in the genome of E. cuniculi is shown in the lower part of the figure and annotated with Roman numbers. Straight lines join the homologous ORFs. Red triangles represent boundaries between the contigs used to generate the scaffolds presented in these figures.
