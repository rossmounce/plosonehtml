                Figure 5.  Schematic representation of phylogenetic relationships among microsporidian genera based on SSU rDNA sequences using Maximum Likelihood and genetic distances (Neighbor-Joining) [20], [30.]Colored boxes linking pairs of taxa indicate the percentage of conservation of adjacent pairs of genes. Blue boxes indicate the percentage of adjacent loci that are also adjacent in the third microsporidian species analysed in this study.
