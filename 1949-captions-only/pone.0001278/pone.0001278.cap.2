The avidity index is the NH<sub>4</sub>SCN concentration (M) where 50% of the bound antibodies are eluted. Shown are results obtained with individual sera and the median (line) for each time point. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to calculate the statistical significance of a difference in avidity between the third and the first vaccination.</p>
