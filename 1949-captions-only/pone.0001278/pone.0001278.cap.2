                Figure 2.  Affinity maturation of vaccine-induced IgG.Median of avidity indices for the anti-UK-39 IgG responses in all vaccination groups receiving UK-39 three weeks after the first, second and third immunization. The avidity index is the NH4SCN concentration (M) where 50% of the bound antibodies are eluted. Shown are results obtained with individual sera and the median (line) for each time point. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to calculate the statistical significance of a difference in avidity between the third and the first vaccination.
