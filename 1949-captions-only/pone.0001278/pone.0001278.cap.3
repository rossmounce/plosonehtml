                Figure 3.  Cross-reactivity of vaccine-induced IgG with P. falciparum sporozoites.IFA (left panel) and Western blotting (right panel) were performed with P. falciparum salivary gland sporozoites. Shown are endpoint titers and number of volunteers showing an increase in titer compared to pre-immune (pI) serum. Note that the volunteers in the 50 µg group who gave positive results before the first immunization showed no increase in titer upon vaccination. Blood samples were taken pre-immune, three weeks after the first, second and third immunization and one year after the third immunization. Lines represent the geometric mean of all volunteers in the respective group. Arrows indicate volunteer 35/D that had a pre-existing anti-UK39 IgG ELISA titer of 103. Only the groups immunized with 10 µg UK-39 or 50 µg UK-39+50 µg AMA49-C1 were followed up for one year.
