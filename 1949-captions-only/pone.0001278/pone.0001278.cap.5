                Figure 5.  Functional activity of anti-UK39 IgG responses.Sporozoite migration and invasion inhibition by IgG preparations (final concentration 1 mg/ml) purified from sera taken before the first (pI) and three weeks after the third immunization (3.imm). Three volunteers (xy/B) immunized with 10 µg UK-39, one volunteer (35/D) immunized with 50 µg UK-39, and three volunteers (xy/E) immunized with 50 µg UK-39+50 µg AMA49-C1 were chosen. Shown are the means and standard deviation from at least two independent experiments. A: In vitro inhibition of sporozoite migration through human HepG2 cells. B: In vitro Inhibition of sporozoite invasion of primary human hepatocytes.
