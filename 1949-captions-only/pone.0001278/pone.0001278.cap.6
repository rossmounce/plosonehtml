                Figure 6.  Correlation (r) of functional activity with antibody titers.Sera taken before the first and three weeks after the third immunization from eight PEV302 immunized volunteers plus one IRIV control and one control from group C immunized with PEV301 alone (only post immunization) analyzed in inhibition assays were included in the analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for correlation of invasion and migration inhibition; nonparametric (Spearman) correlation was used for analysis of immunogenicity assays.
