                Figure 1.  Electropherograms of BRAF and MEK1 mutations compared to normal controls.Four BRAF mutations were identified in four individual cell lines. A) OVCAR 10 contained a nt 603 G→T transversion causing a heterozygous missense substitution p.Q201H in exon 4. B) OV90 contained a novel heterozygous deletion starting at nt 1457 (arrow) resulting in a 5 amino acid deletion, p.N486-P490del, in exon 12. C) Hey contained a nt 1391 G→A transition resulting in loss of heterozygosity. D) ES-2 contained an exon 15, T→A transversion at nt 1799, substituting glutamic acid for valine at position 600 (p.V600E). E) A nt 199 G→A transition in MEK1, exon 2 resulted in a heterozygous missense substitution, p.D67N.
