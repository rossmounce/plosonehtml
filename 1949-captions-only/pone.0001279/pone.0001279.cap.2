                Figure 2.  Functional characterization of the MEK1 p.D67N mutant identified in ES-2.Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with empty vector, wild-type MEK1, MEK1 p.Y130C (positive control mutant which has known high activity level[18]) and the MEK1 p.D67N mutant. ERK (p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2) phosphorylation was assayed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. The p.D67N MEK1 mutant had increased ERK phosphorylation compared to the level induced by empty vector and wildtype MEK1. The level of ERK phosphorylation induced by p.D67N MEK1 is slightly less than the CFC MEK1 p.Y130C mutant which is known to have increased activity [18]. Myc-tagged MEK1 is shown for transfection efficiency and total ERK is shown as a loading control.
