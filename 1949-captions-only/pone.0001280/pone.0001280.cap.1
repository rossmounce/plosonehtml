                Figure 1.  Susceptibility of naturally uninfected and cured Daphnia to infection with the parasite O. bayeri.We experimentally compared the susceptibility to infection of naturally uninfected D. magna and cured but formerly infected D. magna (infection status). Each line is the mean of a genotype pair from a different population. Within a population, cured but formerly infected genotypes had a significantly higher likelihood to become infected than naturally uninfected genotypes.
