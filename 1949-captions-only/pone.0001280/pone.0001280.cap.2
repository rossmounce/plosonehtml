Within each pair, one genotype was naturally uninfected and the other cured but formerly infected. There was no significant effect of the infection status on a genotypes' competitive ability. The genotype pairs of each population are connected with a line. Fitness was measured for each of the 44 genotypes individually in a competition experiment against a common tester genotype.</p>
