                Figure 2.  Relative fitness of naturally uninfected and cured Daphnia genotypes.Relative fitness within genotype pairs from 22 populations in the absence (left panel) or in the presence of a sympatric parasite (right panel). Within each pair, one genotype was naturally uninfected and the other cured but formerly infected. There was no significant effect of the infection status on a genotypes' competitive ability. The genotype pairs of each population are connected with a line. Fitness was measured for each of the 44 genotypes individually in a competition experiment against a common tester genotype.
