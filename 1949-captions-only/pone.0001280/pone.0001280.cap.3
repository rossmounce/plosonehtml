These are the same data as in <a href="#pone-0001280-g002">Fig. 2</a>, but now mean values (Â±SE) of relative fitness are given. We furthermore distinguished between the planned treatments where all replicates were analysed (A) and the effective treatments (B). In the effective treatments we excluded replicates in which a successful establishment of the parasite could not be verified.</p>
