                Figure 3.  Relative fitness of naturally uninfected and cured Daphnia genotypes.Relative fitness within genotype pairs from 22 populations in the absence or in the presence of a sympatric parasite. These are the same data as in Fig. 2, but now mean values (Â±SE) of relative fitness are given. We furthermore distinguished between the planned treatments where all replicates were analysed (A) and the effective treatments (B). In the effective treatments we excluded replicates in which a successful establishment of the parasite could not be verified.
