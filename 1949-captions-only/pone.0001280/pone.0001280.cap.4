                Figure 4.  Fitness of naturally uninfected relative to cured Daphnia genotypes.Relative fitness difference (meanÂ±SE) per day within genotype pairs from eight populations. In each pair, one genotype was naturally uninfected while the other was cured but formerly infected. Relative fitness was measured in direct competition. There was no effect of the infection status on competitive abilities, as the overall mean was not significantly different from zero. All genotypes were uninfected at the onset of the experiment and in half of the replicates we added sympatric parasites (black bars).
