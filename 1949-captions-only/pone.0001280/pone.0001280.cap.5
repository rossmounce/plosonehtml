In total, 42 genotypes from 21 populations have been tested. Open dots represent naturally uninfected genotypes, while filled dots represent cured but formerly infected genotypes. We connected the dots of the two genotypes from each population with a line. 16 out of these 21 lines have a positive slope. Thus, within a pair of genotypes, the one that has a high fitness in the absence of parasites has also a high fitness in the presence of parasites, and vice versa (p = 0.02). Within each pair, one genotype was naturally uninfected and the other cured but formerly infected (open and filled dots). However, there was no correlation of the natural infection status with the genotype's relative fitness.</p>
