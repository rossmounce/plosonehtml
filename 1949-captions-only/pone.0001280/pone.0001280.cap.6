The first approach used relative fitness of each genotype against a common tester and the difference between naturally uninfected and cured genotypes is calculated (x-axis). The second approach used direct competition within each genotype pair, and fitness of naturally uninfected relative to cured genotypes is given (y-axis). There is a significant positive correlation between these two estimates. Each genotype pair was from a different population. For comparison, we show the slope of one (dashed line), which would be a perfect fit of the two approaches.</p>
