                Figure 2.  ROC curves comparing marker concentrations in cases to healthy controls.Case specimens were obtained either at surgery (surgical comparison; dashed line) or 1 to 39 days prior to surgery (pre-surgical comparison; solid line). The pre-surgical comparison suggests that prolactin levels do not discriminate between women with and without cancer in the clinic setting. * indicates AUC different from 0.5 at alpha = 0.05 significance level (Mann Whitney U test)
