                Figure 10.  Morphodynamics sequential images of electro-optical dynamic system.Final Momentum. Panel A–B–C. Triangular light clusters experiences displacement inside the interaction region. Higher magnification. Panel D–E. Interleaving of sub patterns of indefinite light clusters and defined left handed and right handed spirals are structured in interaction area. Panel F. Finally triangular geometric expression twisted 360° at the boundaries of the system generatting mirror images (Chirality).
