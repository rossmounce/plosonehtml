Microscopic GTCHC complex in prostate adenocarcinoma. Panel B. Macroscopic GTCHC complex in liposarcoma. Panel C. Microscopic GTCHC complex in lipoma .Helicoid border. Panel D. Macroscopic GTCHC complex in breast cancer. Observe how the straight lines are assembled from helicoid border pattern. Panel E. Full view of GTCHC complex, this is the same as panel D after demarcating and cleaning the area. It is possible equally to identify “hole” microcavities in their surface. Panel F. Macroscopic GTCHC complex in filloid breast tumor with helicoid border pattern. We appreciate the initial formation of hole microcavities concluding in changes of cystic degeneration at the interior of the geometric complex.</p>
