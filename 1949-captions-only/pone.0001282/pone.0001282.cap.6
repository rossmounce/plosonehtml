                Figure 6.  Final evolution step of GTCHC complexes.Panel A–B–C–D. Final step of massive malignant cell disintegration by hexagonal crystal complexes that remember carbon fullerene structure. Panel E. Histopathology findings inside macroscopic GTCHC: Low cellular population. Apoptosis, helicoidal hypertrophy of individual collagen type I bundles, and mirror images. Panel F. High cellular population, elevated mitosis typical characteristics of malignant behavior outside and near GTCHC complexes.
