                Figure 9.  Morphodynamics sequential images of electro-optical dynamic system.Initial Momentum. Panel A. It illustrates a radian brigth that result from the collision interaction between the flash light and electromagnetic field. Panel B. In the interaction region result ejected particles of wave light that splitting into two components that take opposite directions in helicoid flow pattern with polarization and mirror image. Panel C–D. Each opossite light particles clusters begin to express hexagonal geometric configuration and “hole” microcavities in their surface.Higher magnification. Panel E–F. Triangular–hexagonal light pattern assembly in mirror images.
