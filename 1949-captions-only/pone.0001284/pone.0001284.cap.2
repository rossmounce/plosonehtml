                Figure 2.  An illustration of partitioning the map of San Francisco using the overlapping square grid approach.Three overlapping squares, representing three spatial scanning windows in the detection method, are overlaid upon the northwest quadrant of San Francisco. The map is partitioned by census tracts. A single square size and only a few census tract centroids (blue ‘x’ symbols) are represented in this example for illustrative purposes.
