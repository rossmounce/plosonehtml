The percentage of outbreaks detected are reported using individual addresses (blue bars) and census tract centroids (red bars) for spatial window sizes of (A) 0.02 km, (B) 0.1 km, (C) 0.2 km, (D) 0.5 km, and (E) 1 km, where in each case, simulated outbreaks were added to increasing number of census tracts (1 to 4) . This simulation was conducted on 12 separate geographic regions of 0.2 km in range and the average detection percentage was calculated. For each plot, the horizontal axis is scaled to the maximum detection sensitivity percentage to better visualize the primary comparison between individual addresses and census tract.</p>
