                Figure 5.  Average detection timeliness of the method applied to simulated outbreaks using a fixed spatial window of 0.2 km with increasing time window.The average -log2 transformed p-value was calculated across the same 12 geographic regions as those used in Figure 4 for individual addresses (blue bars) versus census tract centroids (red bars) with increasing counts of simulated cases, one for each month.
