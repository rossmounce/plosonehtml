                Figure 6.  Sensitivity of detection of simulated outbreaks with varied amounts of historical data using (A) census tract centroids and (B) individual addresses.To determine the significance of detected simulated outbreaks with varying amount of historical data a fixed time window of one month was used. The orange dashed lines represent what the authors designate as significant “weak” and “strong” signals corresponding to p-values of 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively.
