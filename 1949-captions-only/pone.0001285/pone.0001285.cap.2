The estimated harmonic mean of <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> is represented by a single, bold, horizontal line within the broader 95% confidence interval (CI) of the respective estimate. MtDNA haplotype (Hd) and nucleotide (π) diversity values for each population are shown for both the 1991/1993 and 2004 samplings. Note: for all populations except Marchena, the estimated 95% CI of <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> overlaps with the maximum estimate of <em>N<sub>c</sub></em>. (B) Graphical display of the mean estimated <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> indicative of the genetic bottleneck detected for marine iguanas on Marchena between 1993 and 2004. <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> (x-axis) between 1993 and 2004 was estimated at 40 individuals (95% CI = 21–86 individuals) and is indicated by the peak of the log likelihood value (y-axis) at <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> = 40. Please see <a href="#pone.0001285.s005">Figure S1</a> for graphical displays of <em>N<sub>e</sub></em> estimates for other populations and <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a> for the approach to estimate <em>N<sub>e</sub></em>.</p>
