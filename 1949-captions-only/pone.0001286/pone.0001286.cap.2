Our estimate of predator selectivity was the average of the predation rates on the first three days in the stream (i.e., the average of the first three points in each panel, see Electronic Supporting Information, <a href="#pone.0001286.s001">Text S1</a>). Note that the probability of being killed decreased within increasing in-stream age in Hansen and A creeks (i.e., bears killed salmon showing little senescence), but increased to varying degrees in Bear, Hansen, Pick, and Yako creeks (i.e., bears killed salmon showing more advanced senescence).</p>
