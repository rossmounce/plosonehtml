These functions are based on a mean day of entry and on population-specific day of entry parameters. The higher the hazard for a given in-stream age, the greater the senescence rate at that age. The slopes of these lines represent variation in the shape of the hazard function (<em>α</em>) and the elevation of the lines represent variation in their magnitude given the shape (<em>λ</em>).</p>
