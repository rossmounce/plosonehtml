                Figure 4.  Rate of aging.Senescence rates (ω±95% confidence intervals generated from likelihood profiles, [42]) plotted against (A) predator selectivity for salmon that show little senescence (± SE across the first three days in the stream) and (B) predation rate (± SE across years). For both plots, the line represents the predicted senescence rates from an ordinary-least squares regression.
