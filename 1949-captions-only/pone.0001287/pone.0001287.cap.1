Oval-shaped columns selective to horizontal stimuli, schematically redrawn from a separate optical imaging experiment (unpublished) are superposed on the axons. Notice that callosal axons terminate in discrete clusters of synaptic boutons which roughly fit the distribution of the columns. Notice also that action potentials transported by each of the two axons with extensive arbors (filled arrows: for the blue axon two branches are shown whose origin lies outside the figure) reaches the terminal boutons roughly synchronously. However, due to their different thickness, the two axons conduct at different speed, therefore action potentials originating at the same time at their cell bodies arrive at the targets with the considerable delays of roughly 4 ms. The territories of the two axons are partially segregated although they overlap in one of the columns (interrupted red-blue contour). The third axon (open arrow) has a very narrow arbor, and is irrelevant to the present context.</p>
