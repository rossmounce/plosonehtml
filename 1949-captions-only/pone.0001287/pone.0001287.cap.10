                Figure 10.  Examples of the effects of cooling on phase synchronization.Same experiments and conventions as in Figs. 3, 6, and 8. Notice that the effects are globally comparable to those obtained with S although they reach less frequently statistical significance. For easier extraction of the phase the gamma band was split into two sub-bands: i.e. gamma 1 (30–50 Hz) and gamma 2 (50–70 Hz).
