                Figure 2.  Experimental set up.Anesthetized ferrets viewed either a uniform gray screen (BKG) or gratings moving in the direction shown by the arrows. IS stimuli activated identically and DS differently the hemifields (hence the hemispheres). Local field potentials were recorded with a 3Ã—5 microelectrode array aimed at the visual areas 17, 18 of the right hemisphere. The contra-lateral areas 17 to 19 were reversibly inactivated by cooling.
