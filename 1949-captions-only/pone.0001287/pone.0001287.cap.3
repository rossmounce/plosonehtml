                Figure 3.  Summary of cooling effects on stimulus-evoked synchronization.Top: Effect of cooling the contra-lateral hemisphere on the value of S during exposure to the background stimulus (BKG) and on that of ΔS (ΔS = SBKG-Sstimulus) during the presentation of the IS and DS gratings. The data are normalized with the number of observations marked on each column segment. Notice that cooling less frequently modified the ΔS elicited by DS than by IS stimuli. The synchronization measured during exposure to BKG appears to be even more frequently affected by cooling. Bottom: Effects of cooling on the ΔS responses to cardinal and diagonal gratings. The responses to the cardinal gratings are more often affected by cooling than those to the diagonal ones. Sct is S during control; Scl is S during cooling; similarly ΔSct is ΔS during control and ΔScl is ΔS during cooling.
