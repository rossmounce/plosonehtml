The data are normalized with the number of observations marked on each column segment. Notice that cooling less frequently modified the ΔS elicited by DS than by IS stimuli. The synchronization measured during exposure to BKG appears to be even more frequently affected by cooling. Bottom: Effects of cooling on the ΔS responses to cardinal and diagonal gratings. The responses to the cardinal gratings are more often affected by cooling than those to the diagonal ones. S<sub>ct</sub> is S during control; S<sub>cl</sub> is S during cooling; similarly ΔS<sub>ct</sub> is ΔS during control and ΔS<sub>cl</sub> is ΔS during cooling.</p>
