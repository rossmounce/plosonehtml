S<sub>ct</sub> is S in control before cooling; S<sub>cl</sub> is S in cooling; S<sub>rc</sub> is S in recovery after cooling. Red stars denote comparisons with statistically significant differences; green stars comparisons with statistically insignificant differences. In both experiments, synchronization during the presentation of BKG interleaved with the IS shows that cooling increases S and that, after cooling S returns to control levels. During the presentation of BKG interleaved with the DS, synchronization is not affected by cooling in experiment 041105 whilst it is increased in experiment 022405-2. Furthermore, after cooling S undershoots control levels in both experiments.</p>
