Notice that cooling affects the responses to IS stimuli, not to DS stimuli. In the experiment 041105 cooling decreases ΔS, i.e. stimulus desynchronizes less (i.e. other hemisphere has a desynchronizing role) and in 022405-2 cooling increases ΔS, i.e. stimulus desynchronizes more (i.e. other hemisphere has a synchronizing role). Other conventions are as in <a href="#pone-0001287-g002">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0001287-g003">3</a>.</p>
