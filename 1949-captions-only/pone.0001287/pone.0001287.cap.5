                Figure 5.  Two examples of stimulus-evoked changes in synchronization (ΔS) in control condition (ΔSct) and during cooling (ΔScl).Statistically significantly different pairs are marked by stars. Notice that cooling affects the responses to IS stimuli, not to DS stimuli. In the experiment 041105 cooling decreases ΔS, i.e. stimulus desynchronizes less (i.e. other hemisphere has a desynchronizing role) and in 022405-2 cooling increases ΔS, i.e. stimulus desynchronizes more (i.e. other hemisphere has a synchronizing role). Other conventions are as in Figs. 2 and 3.
