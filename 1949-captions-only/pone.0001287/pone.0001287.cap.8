                Figure 8.  Summary of effects on the different frequency bands for S and for phase synchronization.Conventions as in Fig. 3. Notice that S and phase synchrony return comparable results. In particular, in all bands the most robust effects are obtained during exposure to BKG, followed by the IS stimuli, while there is almost no effect of cooling on the responses to DS stimuli.
