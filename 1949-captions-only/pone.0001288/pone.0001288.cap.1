                Figure 1.  Generation of GLUT2-loop transgenic mice.A: Quantification of the transgene copy number in genomic DNA from independent lines of mice (Tg G, P, B and W) to the reference gene Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). B: RT-PCR analysis of transgene and L19 control mRNA levels in various tissues. C: Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis showing the presence of GLUT2 loop in liver homogenate from transgenic mice.
