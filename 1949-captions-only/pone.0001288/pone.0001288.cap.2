Transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice were fasted for 48 h and refed for 15 h before liver and epididymal fat pad biopsies. Levels of mRNA were analyzed by real time PCR. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 5 mice/group). Statistical differences between refed and fasted mice are indicated by *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, and ns non significant. B: GLUT2 protein levels in total membrane preparations from the liver of mice fed a glucose-rich diet for five days. D: Blood glucose concentrations during an insulin tolerance test in wild-type and transgenic mice. Values are presented as means±S.E.M (n = 8 to 10 mice/group).</p>
