The test meal was given just before the lights were turned off and the response measured until metabolism rate and respiratory quotient returned to pre-meal levels. The changes in resting metabolism rate and respiratory quotient were included in the calculation of the changes in glucose (Gox) and lipid (Lox) oxidation.</p>
