                Figure 4.  Detection of low and high glucose levels.A: Left panel: glycogen content in liver, kidney and intestine from fasting wild-type (WT) and transgenic (Tg) mice. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (for the liver n = 6 to 7 mice per group, for the kidney and intestine n = 3 mice/group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as *P&lt;0.05. Right panel: Representative pancreas sections from fed wild-type and transgenic mice stained with PAS reagent. The black bar corresponds to 50 µm. B: Fasting metabolic parameters. Blood glucose concentration, plasma insulin concentration and total fat are indicated for wild-type and transgenic mice after fasting for 48 h. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 4 mice/group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as *P&lt;0.05 and ns non significant. Right panel: Example of a DEXA scan. C: Lipid metabolism. Plasma free-fatty acids (FFA) and triglyceride concentrations in wild-type and transgenic mice in the fasting state or 6h after refeeding. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 5 mice/group). Statistical differences between refed and fasted mice are indicated as ***P&lt;0.001, *P&lt;0.05 and ns non significant. Right panel: Liver triglyceride content in liver extract from wild-type and transgenic mice 6h after refeeding. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 4 to 5 mice/group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as **P&lt;0.01. D: Blood glucose and urine glucose levels measured after steptozotocin injection. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 4 mice/group). Statistical differences between wild-type (open squares) and transgenic (closed triangles) mice are indicated as *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.
