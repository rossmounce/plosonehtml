Levels of mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 4 mice/group). Statistical differences between refed and fasted mice are indicated as **P&lt;0.01 and ns non significant. B: GLUT2 protein levels in total membrane preparations of pancreas from mice fed a glucose-rich diet for five days. C: Left panel: Blood glucose concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test in wild-type and transgenic mice fasted for 24 h (n = 17 for wild-type mice, n = 2 to 5 for transgenic mice). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as ***P&lt;0.001, *P&lt;0.05 and ns non significant (two-way ANOVA) for the areas under the curves. Right panel: Blood glucose concentrations in wild-type and transgenic mice in the fasted state or 6 h after being refed with a glucose-rich diet. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 4 to 8 mice/group). D: Upper panel: Plasma insulin concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test in fasted wild-type and transgenic mice (n = 10 to 13 mice/group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as ***P&lt;0.001 (two-way ANOVA) for the areas under the curves. Lower panel: Pancreatic insulin content in mice 6h after being refed a standard diet. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 5 mice/group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as *P&lt;0.05. E: Upper panel : Representative immunostaining with antibody against insulin of pancreatic sections from wild-type and transgenic mice. Arrows indicate small islets. The bar corresponds to 100 µm. Lower panel: Histomorphometric comparisons of islet number, size and ß-cell mass. Proportion of small islets (&lt;25 µm) to total number of islets is statistically different indicated as *P&lt;0.03 between transgenic and wild-type mice.</p>
