                Figure 6.  Kidney function in mice after impairment of extracellular sugar detection.A: Effect of a glucose-rich diet on gene expression in the kidney of transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice fasted for 48 h and refed for 15 h. Levels of mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 4 mice/group). Statistical differences between refed and fasted mice are indicated as *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ns non significant. B: GLUT2 protein levels in total membrane preparations of kidney from mice fed with a glucose-rich diet for five days. C: Structure, size and weight of kidneys from wild-type and transgenic mice shown by ultrasonic image (transverse cross section). D: Urine and blood glucose concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test in fasted wild-type and transgenic mice (n = 3 mice per group). Statistical differences between transgenic and wild-type mice are indicated as **P&lt;0.01 (two-way ANOVA) for the areas under the curves. E: Levels of SGLT mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR. Values are presented as means±S.E.M. (n = 3 to 4 mice/group). Statistical differences between refed and fasted mice are indicated as **P&lt;0.01 and ns non significant.
