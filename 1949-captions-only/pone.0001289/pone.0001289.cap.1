                Figure 1.  Box plots illustrating associations between semen parameters and level of methylation (PMR, on the natural-log scale) in DNA isolated from 65 study sperm samples.DNA methylation was measured by MethyLight. Methylation targets were sequences specific to the genes HRAS, NTF3, MT1A, PAX8, PLAGL1, DIRAS3, MEST and SFN and the repetitive element Satellite 2 (SAT2CHRM1). P-value for trend over category of semen parameter is given for each plot. Rows: DNA methylation targets; columns: semen parameters.
