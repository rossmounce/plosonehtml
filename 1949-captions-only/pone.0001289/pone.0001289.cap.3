Level of DNA methylation scored as β-value. Color: β-value for column sample at row sequence (green: β&lt;0.1; yellow: 0.1≤β≤0.25; orange 0.25&lt;β≤0.5; red: β&gt;0.5). MI and PI: maternally and paternally imprinted genes (black bar). Sequences assigned to tertile of median β-value among buffy coat DNA samples (I, II, III) and sorted within tertile on median β-value among sperm DNA samples. Box 1: sequences with sperm-specific DNA methylation; Box 2: sequences with buffy coat-specific DNA methylation.</p>
