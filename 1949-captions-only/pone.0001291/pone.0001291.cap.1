                Figure 1.  Mutation of the genes encoding the SpuDEFGH transporter decreased the expression of T3SS genes.(A) The exsCEBA expression patterns of five transposon mutants under normal and low calcium condition. (B) Time course analysis of the exsCEBA expression in strain PAO1 and in the spermidine transporter mutants. (C) Deletion of the transporter abolished the low calcium-induced expression of exsCEBA. (D) Deletion of the transporter abolished the low calcium-induced expression of exoT. Bacteria were grown in LB medium with or without 7.5 mM NTA, indicated by solid and open bar/symbol, respectively. The experiment was repeated twice and the data were the means of three replicates.
