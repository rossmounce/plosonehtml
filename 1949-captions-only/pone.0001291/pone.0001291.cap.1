(B) Time course analysis of the <em>exsCEBA</em> expression in strain PAO1 and in the spermidine transporter mutants. (C) Deletion of the transporter abolished the low calcium-induced expression of <em>exsCEBA</em>. (D) Deletion of the transporter abolished the low calcium-induced expression of <em>exoT</em>. Bacteria were grown in LB medium with or without 7.5 mM NTA, indicated by solid and open bar/symbol, respectively. The experiment was repeated twice and the data were the means of three replicates.</p>
