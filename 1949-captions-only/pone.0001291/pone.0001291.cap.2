                Figure 2.  Inactivation of the spermidine transporter led to decreased transcription of T3SS genes.Top panel shows the relative location and size of the genes required for secretion, translocation and T3SS-related regulatory activities, which are located contiguously on the chromosome within five operons (based on the genome sequence data of strain PAO1, http://prodoric.tu-bs.de/gsearch.php). The ExsA-dependent promoter and transcriptional direction are indicated by diamond and arrow, respectively. Bottom panel indicates the transcriptional fold changes of these T3SS genes in the deletion mutant Î”spuE in comparison with the wild type strain PAO1. The transcriptional changes of three effector genes, i.e., exoT, exoY, and exoS, which are located elsewhere on the chromosome, were described in the text.
