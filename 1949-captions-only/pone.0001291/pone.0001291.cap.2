The ExsA-dependent promoter and transcriptional direction are indicated by diamond and arrow, respectively. Bottom panel indicates the transcriptional fold changes of these T3SS genes in the deletion mutant Î”spuE in comparison with the wild type strain PAO1. The transcriptional changes of three effector genes, i.e., <em>exoT</em>, <em>exoY</em>, and <em>exoS</em>, which are located elsewhere on the chromosome, were described in the text.</p>
