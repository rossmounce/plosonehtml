                Figure 3.  In trans expression of exsA restored the T3SS gene expression and effector production in the spermidine transporter mutants.(A) Inactivation of the spermidine transporter inhibited the production of the type III effector protein ExoS but the phenotype was rescued by expression of exsA. Bacterial cultures were grown overnight in LB medium with or without 7.5 mM NTA and the extra-cellular proteins in supernatants were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-ExoS antibody (upper panel). (B) Overexpression of exsA in the transporter mutants resulted in a high level expression of the T3SS genes exsCEBA. Symbol: “+” and “−” indicate whether the plasmid or expression construct was carried by the bacterial strains. The data were the means of three replicates.
