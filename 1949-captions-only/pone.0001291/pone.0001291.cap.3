Bacterial cultures were grown overnight in LB medium with or without 7.5 mM NTA and the extra-cellular proteins in supernatants were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-ExoS antibody (upper panel). (B) Overexpression of <em>exsA</em> in the transporter mutants resulted in a high level expression of the T3SS genes <em>exsCEBA</em>. Symbol: “+” and “−” indicate whether the plasmid or expression construct was carried by the bacterial strains. The data were the means of three replicates.</p>
