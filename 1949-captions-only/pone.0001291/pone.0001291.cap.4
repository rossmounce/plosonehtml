                Figure 4.  Exogenous spermidine induction of the T3SS system required a functional SpuDEFGH transporter.(A) The exsCEBA promoter directed β-galactosidase activity. Results were the means of three replicates. (B) Immunoblotting detection of the effector ExoS. Bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with NTA and spermidine as indicated. The extra-cellular proteins (ECP) and intra-cellular proteins (ICP) from strains PAO1 (P) and ΔspuE (ΔE) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-ExoS antibody. The experiment was repeated for at least three times with similar results.
