Results were the means of three replicates. (B) Immunoblotting detection of the effector ExoS. Bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with NTA and spermidine as indicated. The extra-cellular proteins (ECP) and intra-cellular proteins (ICP) from strains PAO1 (P) and ΔspuE (ΔE) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-ExoS antibody. The experiment was repeated for at least three times with similar results.</p>
