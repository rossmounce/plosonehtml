                Figure 5.  Inactivation of the spermidine transporter reduced the host cell extract-dependent expression of exsCEBA and attenuated the T3SS-mediated cytotoxicity.(A) The exsCEBA promoter directed β-galactosidase activity after culture of the bacterial cells for 4 h in minimum medium with various amounts of mouse liver extract (indicated as equivalent to liver tissue fresh weight per ml culture). The bacteria grown in the same minimum medium was used as a blank control. (B) Cytotoxicity was assayed by monitoring LDH release by the HeLa cells infected with a MOI of 40–50. Experiments were performed with DMEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 2 mM glutamine. The data were the means of at least three replicates.
