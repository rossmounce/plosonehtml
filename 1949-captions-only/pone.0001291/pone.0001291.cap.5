The bacteria grown in the same minimum medium was used as a blank control. (B) Cytotoxicity was assayed by monitoring LDH release by the HeLa cells infected with a MOI of 40–50. Experiments were performed with DMEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 2 mM glutamine. The data were the means of at least three replicates.</p>
