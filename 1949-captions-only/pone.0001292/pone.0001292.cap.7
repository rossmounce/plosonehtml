                Figure 7.  Time-courses in the ROIs (anterior insulae, rostral aMCC and contralateral somatosensory cortex/Area 2) analyzed in fMRI experiment II.Note that all areas show a significant hemodynamic response during both the injection and the numbed hand stimuli. Significant differences as determined by linear contrasts are indicated by asterisks (** = P&lt;0.05, * P&lt;0.10, see text for details).
