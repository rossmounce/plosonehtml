                Figure 2.  Region of mouse Chr 7 assayed and summary of results.Upper line. The location in Mb of the PWS/AS locus is shown by the turquoise bar, and that of the OlfR clusters by the green bars. Lower line. The location of genes assayed for allele-specific expression is shown. Monoallelically expressed genes are indicated by red triangles; bi-allelically expressed genes by vertical lines (see text).
