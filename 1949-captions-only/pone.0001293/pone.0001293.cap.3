                Figure 3.  MAUD assay controls and reproducibility.Hybridization profiles are shown for A. Snrpn and B. H47. For each gene, the x-axis shows our data aligned with the nucleotide position of genes and restriction sites along mouse Chr 7 (UCSC genome browser). The y-axis represents the log2 ratio for RE treated-DNA vs. control (upper track, blue bars) and McrBC- treated DNA vs. control (lower track, purple bars). Each bar represents the value for an individual probe. The numbers above the peaks indicate the peak height for mouse 1; similar log2 ratios were found for all three mice. Below each set of tracks, the vertical lines above show the location of Csp6I sites, and the lines below show the location of DNA methylation-sensitive HpaII AciI and HpyCH4IV sites. Horizontal arrows indicate the start site and orientation of transcription for each gene. The small turquoise boxes highlight the sequences analyzed for differential DNA methylation in Figure S4. C. Evidence for reproducibility. The Venn diagram shows positive hits (genes with clear peaks in both upper and lower tracks) in the three mice assayed. Criteria for peak selection are described in Text S1.
