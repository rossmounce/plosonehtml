                Figure 4.  Monoallelic expression of Agc1, p, P4ha3 and Thrsp in NSC clones.The panels show sequencing results following RT-PCR of RNA from representative F1 hybrid NSC clonal lines. Results for all six lines as well as standard curves showing the resolution of the sequencing assay are shown in Figure S3.
