                Figure 5.  Monoallelic expression of Trim12.A restriction fragment length polymorphism permitted the use of agarose gel electrophoresis rather than sequencing to analyze allele-specific expression. A. RT-PCR products from parental strains B6 and JF1 and the six NSC clonal lines are shown. B. PCR of genomic DNA from two NSC clonal lines 2A1 and 3A1, the NSC parental strains NSC2 and NSC3, and brain DNA from strains F1 (B6♀×JF1♂) (F1a), and the reciprocal cross (F1b) are shown.
