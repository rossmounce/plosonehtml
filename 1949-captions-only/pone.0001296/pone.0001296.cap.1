For H3 and H1 subtypes, totals were adjusted to account for type A isolates that were not further subtyped. For all types and subtypes, the adjusted number of weekly isolates was increased by one to remove any zero values. The natural log of the results were plotted by country for (i) H3, (ii) H1, and (iii) B on a color scale, with white representing either zero isolates or no data and brown representing the highest observed number of isolates for H3 (n = 4,057).</p>
