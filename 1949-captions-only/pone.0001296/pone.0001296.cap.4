To emphasize the difference between positive and negative growth, the natural log of the growth rates were plotted for (i) H3, (ii) H1, and (iii) B. The scatter plot shows the values of <em>G</em> for individual countries in the given season, to give an idea of the observed variation. Note that the values for 1998 and 1999 in the Southern Hemisphere are based on only three countries, as Argentina had no data available during the 1998 influenza season.</p>
