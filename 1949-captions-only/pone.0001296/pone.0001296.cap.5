                Figure 5.  Mean type and subtype epidemic week versus distance from the equator.Mean week of each epidemic was determined for all countries, and the arithmetic mean (Â± SE) of these values for each country was plotted versus distance from the equator for (i) H3, (ii) H1, and (iii) B. The red lines indicate best fit lines for each type or subtype.
