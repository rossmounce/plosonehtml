                Figure 10.  RECQ1 interacts with Rad51.Panel A, Co-immunoprecipitation of RECQ1 and Rad51 from HeLa nuclear extracts. Rad51 was detected in RECQ1 immunoprecipitates (lane 3). RECQ1 was immmunoprecipitated with Rad51 from nuclear extracts as detected by Western blot (lane 5). Lanes 2 and 4 represent immunoprecipitate from control rabbit and mouse IgG, respectively. Input (lane 1) represent 10% of the total protein used for immunoprecipitation. Panels B and C, ELISA for RECQ1-Rad51 interaction. Either BSA or purified recombinant human RECQ1 (14 nM) was coated onto microtiter plates. Following blocking with 3% BSA, appropriate wells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of purified recombinant human Rad51 (0–76 nM, Panel B or 76 nM, Panel C) for 1 h at 30°C. In Panel C as indicated, DNaseI (100 U/ml) or ethidium bromide (EtBr) (50 µg/ml) was included in the incubation with Rad51 in the binding step in the corresponding wells to test for DNA-mediated protein interaction. Following washing, RECQ1 bound Rad51 was detected by ELISA using rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rad51. The values represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicate with SD indicated by error bars.
