The RECQ1 immunoprecipitate from each cell extract was divided in half and was either incubated or not with λ-phosphatase (500 U) for 1 h at 30°C before elution with SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed for RECQ1. <em>Panel B,</em> IR-induced RECQ1 phosphorylation is dependent on radiation dose. RECQ1 was immunoprecipitated from either untreated cells or 6 h after treatment of cells with the indicated dose of γ-radiation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were divided in two aliquots which were either treated with λ-phosphatase or left untreated. RECQ1 was detected as described above. <em>Panel C,</em> Time course of RECQ1 phosphorylation in response to IR. U2OS cells were subjected to γ-radiation (10 Gy), and RECQ1 was immunoprecipiated from whole cell extracts prepared at the indicated time points following IR exposure. <em>Panel D,</em> Phosphorylated RECQ1 is preferentially associated with chromatin in IR-treated cells. RECQ1 was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-soluble (S2) and insoluble (S4) fractions of untreated or IR treated cells, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot analysis.</p>
