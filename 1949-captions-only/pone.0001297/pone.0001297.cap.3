Whole cell extracts from HeLa cells that had been transfected with control or RECQ1 siRNA (oligonucleotide L1 or L2) were subjected to Western blotting with RECQ1 or Actin antibodies (as a loading control). <em>Panel B</em>, Proliferation of control or RECQ1 siRNA treated cells as determined by CyQuant assay at indicated time points after transfection. <em>Panel C</em>, MTT assay of <em>in vitro</em> proliferation of control or RECQ1-siRNA transfected cells. <em>Panel D</em>, Colorimetric BrdU cell proliferation ELISA of control or RECQ1 siRNA treated HeLa cells. Results are taken from three independent experiments and proliferation is represented as the meanÂ±standard deviation (SD).</p>
