                Figure 3.  RECQ1-depleted cells show reduced cellular proliferation.Panel A, Small interfering RNA inhibition of RECQ1. Whole cell extracts from HeLa cells that had been transfected with control or RECQ1 siRNA (oligonucleotide L1 or L2) were subjected to Western blotting with RECQ1 or Actin antibodies (as a loading control). Panel B, Proliferation of control or RECQ1 siRNA treated cells as determined by CyQuant assay at indicated time points after transfection. Panel C, MTT assay of in vitro proliferation of control or RECQ1-siRNA transfected cells. Panel D, Colorimetric BrdU cell proliferation ELISA of control or RECQ1 siRNA treated HeLa cells. Results are taken from three independent experiments and proliferation is represented as the meanÂ±standard deviation (SD).
