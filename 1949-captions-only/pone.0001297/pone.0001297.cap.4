Western blot showing RECQ1 expression in puromycin resistant HeLa cells transfected with either control or RECQ1 shRNA (#1 or #2). Actin is used as loading control. Proliferation of control or cells transfected with RECQ1-specific shRNA plasmids was determined by Coulter counting the total number of cells at indicated time points (<em>Panel B</em>) and by colony forming assay (<em>Panel C</em>). <em>Panels D</em> and <em>E</em>, RECQ1 depletion induces G2/M accumulation. Flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle distribution of control or RECQ1 shRNA transfected cells (<em>Panel D</em>) or RECQ1 siRNA transfected cells (<em>Panel E</em>).</p>
