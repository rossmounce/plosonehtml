                Figure 4.  Reduced cell growth and aberrant cell cycle progression of RECQ1-depleted cells.Panel A, Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RECQ1 depletion in HeLa cells. Western blot showing RECQ1 expression in puromycin resistant HeLa cells transfected with either control or RECQ1 shRNA (#1 or #2). Actin is used as loading control. Proliferation of control or cells transfected with RECQ1-specific shRNA plasmids was determined by Coulter counting the total number of cells at indicated time points (Panel B) and by colony forming assay (Panel C). Panels D and E, RECQ1 depletion induces G2/M accumulation. Flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle distribution of control or RECQ1 shRNA transfected cells (Panel D) or RECQ1 siRNA transfected cells (Panel E).
