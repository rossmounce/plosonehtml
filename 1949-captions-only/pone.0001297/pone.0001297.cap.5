Cells were either untreated or incubated with 400 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 3 h in serum free medium, washed, and allowed to recover in complete medium for 21 h. <em>Panel A,</em> Enrichment of the cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA fragments that are indicative of an ongoing apoptosis in cells with the indicated siRNA oligonucleotides. Samples were analyzed in duplicates, and data points represent the mean of three independent experiments; <em>bars</em> denote SD. <em>Panel B,</em> immunoblotting analysis of the PARP cleavage in control or RECQ1 siRNA treated HeLa cells either untreated or exposed to 400 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
