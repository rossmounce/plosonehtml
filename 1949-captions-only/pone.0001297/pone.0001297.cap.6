                Figure 6.  RECQ1 depletion sensitizes cells to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or camptothecin.siRNA knockdown of RECQ1 in HeLa cells leads to increased sensitivity to treatment with IR (Panel A) or CPT (Panel B). HeLa cells treated with either RECQ1 siRNA or control siRNA (#C) were plated in quadruplicate and treated with increasing doses of IR or concentrations of CPT. Total DNA content was measured as an indication of cell growth. Two independent siRNAs (#L1 and #L2) used to downregulate RECQ1 expression resulted in similar growth phenotype in HeLa cells. Three independent determinations of cell survival were performed and the meanÂ±SD is presented.
