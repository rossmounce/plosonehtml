HeLa cells treated with either RECQ1 siRNA or control siRNA (#C) were plated in quadruplicate and treated with increasing doses of IR or concentrations of CPT. Total DNA content was measured as an indication of cell growth. Two independent siRNAs (#L1 and #L2) used to downregulate RECQ1 expression resulted in similar growth phenotype in HeLa cells. Three independent determinations of cell survival were performed and the meanÂ±SD is presented.</p>
