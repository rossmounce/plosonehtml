                Figure 8.  Depletion of RECQ1 leads to spontaneous formation of γ-H2AX foci in the absence of exogenous damage.Panel A, Control or RECQ1 siRNA-treated HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with formaldehyde and co-immunostained with anti- γ-H2AX and anti-RECQ1 antibodies. The merged picture shows cells stained with anti- γ-H2AX (green) and anti-RECQ1 (red) as well as DAPI (blue). Normal induction of γ-H2AX foci is shown upon IR (5 Gy) exposure in RECQ1 depleted cells. Panel B, Quantitative assessment of γ-H2AX foci in control or RECQ1-depleted cells that have been either untreated or exposed to IR, as described in Panel A. Images of at least 100 cells were captured and used for quantitative analyses of γ-H2AX foci. To avoid bias in the selection of cells, DAPI stained nuclei were randomly selected for γ-H2AX staining. Panel C, HeLa cells were treated with control or RECQ1 siRNA. Following IR exposure or not, cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-RECQ1, anti- γ-H2AX, or anti-actin antibodies.
