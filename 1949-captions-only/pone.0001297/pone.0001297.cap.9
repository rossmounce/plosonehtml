                Figure 9.  Elevated sister chromatid exchanges in RECQ1-depleted human cells.Panel A, SCEs were assayed in BrdU labeled, giemsa-stained chromosome spreads from control or RECQ1 siRNA treated HeLa cells. A representative spread is shown for spontaneous SCEs in control and RECQ1-depleted cells. Panel B, Quantitative representation of the number of SCEs per metaphase, either spontaneous or induced by CPT or MMC in cells treated with either control or RECQ1 siRNA. A minimum of 25 metaphases were counted for each cell type and treatment.
