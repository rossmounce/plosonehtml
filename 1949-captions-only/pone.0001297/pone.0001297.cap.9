A representative spread is shown for spontaneous SCEs in control and RECQ1-depleted cells. <em>Panel B</em>, Quantitative representation of the number of SCEs per metaphase, either spontaneous or induced by CPT or MMC in cells treated with either control or RECQ1 siRNA. A minimum of 25 metaphases were counted for each cell type and treatment.</p>
