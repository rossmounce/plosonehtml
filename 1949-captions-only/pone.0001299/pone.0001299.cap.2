                Figure 2.  Differences in soil respiration between litter manipulation treatments and controls in tropical rainforest.The differences are calculated as a percentage of the average respiration measured in the control plots for each month; grey bars are litter addition plots and white bars are litter removal plots; a star above a bar denotes a significant treatment effect (P&lt;0.05) compared to the controls, a circle above a bar denotes a marginally significant treatment effect (P&lt;0.065) compared to the controls.
