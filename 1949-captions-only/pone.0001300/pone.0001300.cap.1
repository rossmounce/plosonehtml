                Figure 1.  Western blot analysis of melanoma cells stimulated with IL-10-type cytokines IL-19, -20, and -24 shows no induction of STAT phosphorylation.(A) 12 Mycoplasma-free melanoma cell lines, NHEM, and HaCaT cells were grown in 6-well plates and then stimulated for 45 min with the indicated cytokines (75 ng/ml). Cells were lysed directly on ice by addition of 1Ã— Laemmli buffer. Transferred proteins were incubated over night with anti P-Tyr STAT3 antibody, stripped and counter-stained with anti-actin antibody. (B) Stimulation of a selection of melanoma cells was performed as described in (A) only that cytokines were added for different periods of time (5 min, 30 min, 3 h) before cells were harvested. Stripping of western blot membranes prior to incubation with another phospho-specific antibody was performed as described in materials and methods.
