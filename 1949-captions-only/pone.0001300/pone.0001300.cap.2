                Figure 2.  Kinetics and dose-dependence of IL-24 stimulation.HaCaT keratinocytes (positive control cells reacting to IL-24) and 2 selected melanoma cell lines (MeWo and Wm35) were incubated with increasing amounts of IL-24 for 30 min (A) or with 25 ng/ml OSM or 200 ng/ml IL-24 for different periods of time (B). Cell lysates were analysed by western blot with subsequent staining of P-STAT3, P-STAT1, and P-STAT5 followed by STAT3 and actin counter stains.
