                Figure 3.  RT-PCR of IL-24 and its receptor subunits.Eight different melanoma cell lines, primary NHEM and HaCaT cells were grown on Petri dishes to a confluence of 80â€“90% before cells were harvested. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and cDNA amounts equivalent to 100 ng RNA were used as input material for amplifications of IL-24, and the receptor subunits IL-20R1, -20R2, and -22R. To control for equal starting amounts and loading, actin was amplified. Size markers (bp) are indicated on the left.
