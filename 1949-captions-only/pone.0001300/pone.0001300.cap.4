                Figure 4.  Quantitative PCR for IL-24 and its 3 possible receptor subunits: absence of a functional IL-24 receptor on melanoma cells.RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as for standard RT-PCR. 12.5 ng RNA was used as input material followed by specific amplification of target genes as indicated. Results are means +/− STD of triplicate amplifications from three independent experiments using 3 independently extracted RNAs. Ct values were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene TBP for each tested cell line. Calculations of relative expression values were performed using the 2−ΔΔCt formula and expression levels were correlated to NHEM results for IL-24, (A) and to HaCaT for receptor subunits, (B), which were set to 1. (C) The Ct value of the housekeeping gene TBP (in HaCaT cells) was arbitrarily set to represent 100 mRNA copies. The Ct values of IL-24 and the three receptor subunits were converted accordingly in order to facilitate a clearer view of the relative amounts of the 4 target genes compared to the housekeeping gene TBP.
