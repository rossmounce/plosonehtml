                Figure 5.  Western blot analysis of IL-24 and its receptors in total melanoma cell lysates.Total cell lysates of the depicted melanoma cell lines, NHEM and HaCaT cells as well as control samples were analysed by Western blot to detect endogenous levels of IL-24 and its receptors. Positive control samples: 100 ng of commercial recombinant IL-24 or Hek cells transiently transfected with the respective receptor subunit plasmids pcDEF3-IL-20R1, pCEP4-IL20R2, or pEF-BosPuro-IL-22R as described before[7]. Lysates were loaded in parallel on either an 8% gel (IL-20R1 and IL22R) or a 10% gel for detection of IL-20R2 and IL-24. After the first round of detection, blots were stripped and re-probed over night at 4Â°C with subsequent antibodies. As transfected cells were strongly over-expressing the individual receptor chains, less lysates were loaded for the controls (see loading controls stained with actin or FIN13). Commercially available antibodies recognize all positive controls but fail to detect specific bands correlating to endogenous levels of receptors or IL-24.
