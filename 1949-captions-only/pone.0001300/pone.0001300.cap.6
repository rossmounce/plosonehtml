                Figure 6.  Influence of IL-10-type cytokines on the proliferation of melanoma cells.Four different melanoma cell lines and HaCaT cells were seeded in their appropriate growth media supplemented with 1% FCS (96-well plates) and were incubated with 100 ng/ml of IL-19, -20, -22, -24 or IFN-γ. At day 0, 2, and 5, 5 µl of WST-1 reagent was added for 40 min to each well before absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Shown are results of triplicate wells from three different experiments +/− STD.
