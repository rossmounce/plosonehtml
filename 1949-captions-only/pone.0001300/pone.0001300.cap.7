                Figure 7.  Recombinant GST-IL-24 and its effect on the growth of selected melanoma cells.(A) GST-IL-24 was cloned and purified as described in materials and methods. Samples from the flow through, wash and eluted fractions were analysed on a SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Western blots of recombinant GST-IL-24 showing specific staining with anti-GST and anti-IL-24 antibodies. (B) AnnexinV-apoptosis assay on cells that were incubated with 40 Âµg/ml recombinant fusion proteins for 48 h. GST-IL-24 does not substantially increase the number of apoptotic melanoma cells relative to control treatments.
