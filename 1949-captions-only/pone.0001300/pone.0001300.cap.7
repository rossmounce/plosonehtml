Samples from the flow through, wash and eluted fractions were analysed on a SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Western blots of recombinant GST-IL-24 showing specific staining with anti-GST and anti-IL-24 antibodies. (B) AnnexinV-apoptosis assay on cells that were incubated with 40 Âµg/ml recombinant fusion proteins for 48 h. GST-IL-24 does not substantially increase the number of apoptotic melanoma cells relative to control treatments.</p>
