                Figure 8.  Mammalian IL-24 secreted and purified from transfected Hek cells does not induce apoptosis in melanoma cells.(A) Western blot analysis of supernatants from Hek cells transfected with mock vector pCEP, pCEP-IL-20, or pCEP-IL-24. (B) Proliferation assay of 3 selected cell lines that were incubated for 72 h with at approximately 40 ng/ml of IL-20 or IL-24 from transfected Hek cell supernatants. (C) Density blots of FACS apoptosis assay of selected cell lines incubated for 72 h with the indicated Hek supernatants, IFN-Î³, or Etoposide, which served as positive control inducing profound apoptosis in most cell lines. The percentage of dead cells is depicted as bar diagrams on the right panel. Neither Hek-produced IL-20 nor IL-24 increase apoptosis in melanoma cells.
