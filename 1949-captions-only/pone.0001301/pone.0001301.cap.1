                Figure 1.  The CTL killing assay.Peptide-pulsed target cells and control (unpulsed) cells are injected intravenously (A). The control cells allow us to measure the flux of both populations into the spleen, and the differences between numbers of pulsed and unpulsed cells in the spleen at later timepoints (panel B) is assumed to be due to killing by spleen-resident CTL.
