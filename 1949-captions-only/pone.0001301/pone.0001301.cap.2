                Figure 2.  The fits (square panels) of the basic killing model to the data using the proportion of GP and NP-pulsed target cells that are killed over time, by effector CTL (upper panels) and memory CTL (lower panels) in the spleen.In the square panels the black open circles show the measured proportion of targets killed, and the fitted values for each animal are shown offset to the right in red open circles. The residuals after arcsin square-root transformation are shown below each fit in the rectangular panels. Best fit estimates of k in units of minâˆ’1 are shown in each panel, with 95% confidence intervals.
