                Figure 1.  Clustering of changed genes around SAP102/dlgh3 and PSD-95/dlgh4 loci. A, significant genes (x-axis) from SAP102−/Y hippocampus along chromosome X (y-axis), indicating the location of SAP102 gene (dlgh3) and hprt.White histogram, results from 129S5 strain animals; black histogram, results from C57BL/6j after selection of hprt deletion (see text). B, probe sets from PSD-95−/− along chromosome 11, where the position of the mutated gene (dlgh4) is indicated. White histogram, hippocampus mRNA; black histogram; cortex mRNA.
