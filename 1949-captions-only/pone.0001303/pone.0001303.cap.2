                Figure 2.  PCR genotyping results for Atp7a and Dlgh3 genomic regions.Two bands were observed for Atp7a reactions, one of 694 bp corresponding to 129-derived sequences and another of 637 bp corresponding to C57Bl6-derived sequences (upper panel). The appearance of the 694 bp-band coincided with the presence of the SAP102 mutation (-/y) (lower panel). Wild-type 129S5 (129) and C57BL/6j (BL6) were used as positive controls.
