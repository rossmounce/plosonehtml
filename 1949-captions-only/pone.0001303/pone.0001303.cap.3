                Figure 3.  Validation of microarray analyses by qRT-PCR assays in PSD-95 and SAP102 mutants.Hippocampus mRNA was extracted and level of mRNA detected using microarrays or qRT-PCR. A, SAP102 mutant mice; results for SAP102, Hprt, Fundc2, BB315069 (3′ to Fundc2) are shown. B. PSD-95 mutant mice; results for PSD-95, Fbxo39 and BG092359 (3′ to Fbxo39). y-axis: fold change of mutant mRNA levels compared to control; mean±s.e.m. P, qRT-PCR data; M, microarray data. M1, M2… refers to different probe sets for the same gene. Note different scale of y-axes.
