                Figure 1.  Immunolabelling of scrapie-affected tonsil using antibodies directed to the C' or N' terminus of PrP.Paraffin-embedded tonsil from clinically-affected sheep. Serial sections. PrPd immunolabelling. a. The follicle shows both widespread follicular dendritic cell (FDC) labelling interspersed between lymphocytes and multiple granules of intracytoplasmic tingible body macrophage (TBM) labelling (arrows) using R145 antibody. Bar, 130 µm. b. Using BG4 antibody, light FDC labelling and single intracytoplasmic granules of TBM labelling are present (arrows). Bar, 130 µm.
