                Figure 10.  Diagram showing the process of internalisation of PrPd.More detailed schematic diagram showing a possible internalisation mechanism of PrPd in tingible body macrophages (TBMs). PrPd is only internalised into TBMs by the process of caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Once PrPd reaches the fused random ER networks, it is then transported to lysosomes.
