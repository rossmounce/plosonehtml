PrP<sup>d</sup> immunolabelling. Diffuse follicular dendritic cell (FDC) and granular tingible body macrophage (TBM) labelling are present within the follicle, additionally, granular labelling is associated with the peri-follicular area and the epithelium of the tonsil. Follicular dendritic cell labelling is present throughout the light zone of the follicle (bottom) while TBM labelling is conspicuous in the dark zone (top) Bar, 290 Âµm.</p>
