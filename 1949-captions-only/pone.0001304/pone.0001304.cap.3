                Figure 3.  Immunoglobulin in normal and scrapie-affected follicles-light microscopy.a. Resin embedded Submandibular lymph node from an uninfected sheep. Immunoglobulin labelling. Immunolabelling is interspersed between lymphocytes of the germinal centre as branching networks, consistent with follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-associated labelling. Bar, 55 µm. b. Resin embedded Submandibular lymph node from clinically-affected sheep. Immunoglobulin labelling. A similar yet considerably more intense pattern of immunoglobulin labelling is present between lymphocytes of the germinal centre. Accumulations appear more expanded within the extracellular space when compared with the uninfected control shown in figure 3a. Bar, 55 µm.
