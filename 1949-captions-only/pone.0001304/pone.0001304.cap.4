Immature FDC dendritic processes from an unaffected sheep submandibular lymph node (SMLN). Simple FDC processes run between lymphocytes, a number of which are labelled (d). The extracellular space surrounding FDC dendrites is uniform in width and contains no electron dense deposit. Bar, 1 µm. b. Disease-associated mature type 1 FDC dendritic processes from a scrapie-affected sheep SMLN. FDC processes are more numerous and convoluted with abundant uniformly-electron dense deposit within the expanded extracellular space. Again, a selection of dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 1 µm. c. Disease-associated mature type 2 FDC dendritic processes from a scrapie-affected sheep SMLN. Dendrites are convoluted and the associated extracellular space grossly expanded. The space contains many indistinct spherical or ovoid structures. Electron dense deposit as seen in <a href="#pone-0001304-g004">figure 4b</a> is absent from this space. Selected dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 2 µm. d. Regressing FDC from an unaffected sheep. Dendrites form distinct rod-like projections. Electron dense deposit and vesicular structures are limited or absent while the extracellular space is clearly expanded. Selected dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 2 µm.</p>
