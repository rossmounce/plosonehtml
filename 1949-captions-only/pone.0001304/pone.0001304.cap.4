                Figure 4.  Ultrastructural follicular dendritic cell (FDC) morphology.Uranyl acetate (UA)/lead citrate (LC) counterstain. a. Immature FDC dendritic processes from an unaffected sheep submandibular lymph node (SMLN). Simple FDC processes run between lymphocytes, a number of which are labelled (d). The extracellular space surrounding FDC dendrites is uniform in width and contains no electron dense deposit. Bar, 1 µm. b. Disease-associated mature type 1 FDC dendritic processes from a scrapie-affected sheep SMLN. FDC processes are more numerous and convoluted with abundant uniformly-electron dense deposit within the expanded extracellular space. Again, a selection of dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 1 µm. c. Disease-associated mature type 2 FDC dendritic processes from a scrapie-affected sheep SMLN. Dendrites are convoluted and the associated extracellular space grossly expanded. The space contains many indistinct spherical or ovoid structures. Electron dense deposit as seen in figure 4b is absent from this space. Selected dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 2 µm. d. Regressing FDC from an unaffected sheep. Dendrites form distinct rod-like projections. Electron dense deposit and vesicular structures are limited or absent while the extracellular space is clearly expanded. Selected dendrites are labelled (d). Bar, 2 µm.
