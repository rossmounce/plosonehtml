FDC processes from an unaffected sheep tonsil. IgG immunogold labelling. Limited immunogold labelling is associated with the electron dense deposit between dendritic processes of a mature FDC. Occasionally, immunogold is located on the plasmalemma of these processes. Bar, 1 µm. b. FDC processes from a scrapie-affected sheep tonsil. IgG immunogold labelling. Immunogold labelling is primarily associated with the extensive electron dense deposit (Note difference in scale from control tissue in 5a) between processes of the disease-associated mature type 1 FDC. Where electron dense deposit is less abundant, immunogold can be identified on the plasmalemma of FDC dendrites (arrowheads). Bar, 2 µm.</p>
