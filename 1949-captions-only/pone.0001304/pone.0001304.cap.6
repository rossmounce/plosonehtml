                Figure 6.  PrPd on the plasmalemma of follicular dendritic cell (FDC) dendrites and a B cell.Scrapie-affected tonsil. PrP immunogold labelling. a. PrPd is clearly limited to the plasmalemma of follicular dendritic cell (FDC) dendritic processes (d). Immunogold is not associated with the extracellular electron dense deposit held between FDC dendritic processes. Bar, 500 nm. b. PrPd is also associated with the plasmalemma of B cells. Immunogold labelling is not present within the cytoplasm of the cell. Bar, 1 Âµm.
