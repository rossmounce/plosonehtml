                Figure 7.  Intracytoplasmic tingible body macrophage (TBM)-associated immunolabelling.a. Scrapie-affected tonsil. PrPd immunogold labelling. Immunogold labelling is present at the membrane of the random endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network within the cytoplasm of a tingible body macrophage (TBM). Immunogold labelling is also present within an adjacent lysosome (asterisk). Bar, 1 µm. b. Scrapie-affected tonsil. PrPd immunogold labelling. Immunogold labelling is associated with the membrane of random ER networks within the cytoplasm of a TBM. Adjacent to these PrPd labelled structures are areas of ER (arrows). Lysosomes are sparsely labelled (asterisk). Bar, 400 nm. c. (and insert). Scrapie-affected tonsil. PrPd immunogold labelling. PrPd immunolabelling is present on the plasma-membrane of a TBM. In addition, discreet vesicular structures contiguous with the plasma-membrane or within the cytoplasm of the TBM show immunogold labelling (arrowheads). Adjacent to these structures, a clathrin-coated pit is not labelled for PrPd (arrow). A random network of ER is also immunolabelled. A lysosome shows PrPd accumulation (asterisk). Bar, 1 µm. d. Scrapie-affected tonsil. Ubiquitin immunogold labelling. A random network of convoluted ER shows immunogold labelling of the membrane. Labelling is not present within the adjacent lysosomes (asterisks). Bar, 2 µm.
