                Figure 8.  Diagram showing the maturation of normal and scrapie-affected follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).Following antigenic stimulation, immature FDCs, present in both normal and scrapie-affected animals, develop into a mature form of FDC. In scrapieâ€“affected animals (grey), mature FDCs develop to form type disease-associated mature type 1 and subsequently disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs. We suggest the regression of normal mature and disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs results in the appearance of regressing FDCs within the germinal centre.
