In scrapieâ€“affected animals (grey), mature FDCs develop to form type disease-associated mature type 1 and subsequently disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs. We suggest the regression of normal mature and disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs results in the appearance of regressing FDCs within the germinal centre.</p>
