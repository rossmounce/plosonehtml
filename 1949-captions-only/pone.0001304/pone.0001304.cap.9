                Figure 9.  Diagram of the proposed mechanisms of PrPd transfer and internalisation.a. Follicular dendritic cell (FDC)/B cell interactions. PrPc is converted to PrPd at the plasmalemma of the FDC. The molecule is passively transferred to the B cell during immune complex stimulation (possibly due to complex linkage), where it remains on the plasmalemma. FDCs do not re-internalise PrPd. b. FDC/tingible body macrophage (TBM) interactions. PrPd may also be transferred from FDCs to TBMs where it is internalised after interaction with a trans-membrane ligand via a ubiquitin-mediated endocytic pathway and resulting in the accumulation of PrPd at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.
