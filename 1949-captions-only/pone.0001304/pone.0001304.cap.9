Follicular dendritic cell (FDC)/B cell interactions. PrP<sup>c</sup> is converted to PrP<sup>d</sup> at the plasmalemma of the FDC. The molecule is passively transferred to the B cell during immune complex stimulation (possibly due to complex linkage), where it remains on the plasmalemma. FDCs do not re-internalise PrP<sup>d</sup>. b. FDC/tingible body macrophage (TBM) interactions. PrP<sup>d</sup> may also be transferred from FDCs to TBMs where it is internalised after interaction with a trans-membrane ligand via a ubiquitin-mediated endocytic pathway and resulting in the accumulation of PrP<sup>d</sup> at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
