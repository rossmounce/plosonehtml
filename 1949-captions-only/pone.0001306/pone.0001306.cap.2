The relative fluorescence intensities of alleles A and B in each sample with regard to rs1895694 are shown. Fluorescence intensities of the S-WGA products obtained by protocol 2 (N = 24) are shown. The results from another 5 heterozygous SNPs can be found in <a href="#pone.0001306.s002">Figure S1</a>. (<em>B</em>) Manual genotyping of rs1895694 in the S-WGA products. AB, heterozygous (allele AB); PA, preferential amplification; AD, allele dropout; Failed, failure in WGA. (<em>C</em>) Summary of the manual genotyping of the heterozygous SNPs. The percentage was calculated from a total of 240 data points obtained from genotyping of 6 heterozygous SNPs in 40 S-WGA products. (<em>D</em>) Concordance rate of the heterozygous SNPs by Taqman genotyping assay correlated with call rate on the SNP array. The data from 12 S-WGA products derived from a LCL and 3 S-WGA products derived from the CMK11-5 are shown. Genotyping results of 6 heterozygous SNPs (rs1895694, rs4706387, rs2074711, rs1007971, rs4140571, and rs2280964 for a LCL; rs1895694, rs7110302, rs11657541, rs1217617, rs9991, and rs2268248 for the CMK11-5) by Taqman assay were used for calculation of concordance rate. In genotyping S-WGA products, the heterozygous SNP as well as PA-classified SNPs were considered to be concordant with non-amplified gDNA. The blue squares and diamonds indicate the S-WGA products obtained by protocol 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
