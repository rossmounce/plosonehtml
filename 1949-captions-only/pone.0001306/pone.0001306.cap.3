                Figure 3.  Concordance rate of genotypes correlated with call rate on the SNP array.Concordance rate of genotypes was determined by the global genotype data between non-amplified gDNA and S-WGA products. The results of all genotypes (left) and homozygous/heterozygous genotypes (right) are shown. Two data sets of S-WGA products from a LCL, with call rate&lt;50%, were not used for further analysis.
