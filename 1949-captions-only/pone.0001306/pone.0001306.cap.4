                Figure 4.  Genotype and CCN analyses in each chromosome.Y axes of the top and bottom panels indicate averaged relative genotype concordance (N = 10 array) and averaged signal log2 ratio (N = 10 array), respectively. Signal log2 ratio above and below 0 indicate gain and loss of CCN, respectively. Two apparently failed array data sets (call rate&lt;50%) were excluded from the analysis.
