Standard deviations of the signal log2 ratio are shown at the right. A genomic smoothing size of 2 Mb was used for analysis. Blue bars indicate the deletion in chromosome 6q. (<em>B</em>) CCN profiles of chromosome 19. Blue, pink and red lines indicate CCN data of non-amplified gDNA, WGA and S-WGA products, respectively. Profiles of 10 S-WGA products are shown. (<em>C</em>) Example of normalization of the CCN data of chromosome 19. The CCN data of chromosome 19 in an S-WGA product was normalized using the CCN data of the other nine S-WGA products as reference. Blue, red, and black lines indicate the CCN data of non-amplified gDNA, S-WGA product, and S-WGA product (normalized), respectively. (<em>D</em>) Example of the deletion of chromosome 6q in the S-WGA product. Weak signal log2 ratio of the 6q was still detected after normalization was applied (black line). Red bars indicate the location of the heterozygous SNPs in the non-amplified gDNA. Heterozygous and allele dropout indicate heterozygous and homozygous calls, respectively, on the array. (<em>E</em>) The result of karyotyping. Deletion of chromosome 6q was detected in 4 of 14 cells analyzed.</p>
