                Figure 6.  CCN analysis of the S-WGA products from the CMK11-5 cell line.(A) Results of the CCN analysis. A 3-Mb genomic smoothing size was used for analysis. Blue and red lines indicate CCN data of the non-amplified gDNA and S-WGA product, respectively. (B) Effect of the genomic smoothing size (Ïƒ) on the CCN analysis. Green and red lines indicate CCN data of the non-amplified gDNA and S-WGA product, respectively.
