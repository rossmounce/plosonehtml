Application of PBS was used as control. (A) Whole intestinal cell populations were isolated from gnotobiotic mice treated either with PBS, K12 or EcN. For sorting of a pure intestinal epithelial cell population, cells were labeled with anti-CD45 antibody to exclude hematopoietic cells and further distinguished by cell granularity and size (SSC) (Pre sorting). IECs were FACS-sorted by negative selection. Re-analysis was performed to determine the purity of sorted IECs (Post sorting). (B) Quantitative ZO-1 mRNA expression in IECs. Relative mRNA amounts were normalized with respect to expression levels of IECs from control mice (fold change = 1). Data are presented as mean of three independent experiments (n = 3/group). (C) Quantitative ZO-2 mRNA expression in IECs. Relative mRNA amounts were normalized with respect to expression levels of IECs from control mice (fold change = 1). Data are presented as mean of three independent experiments (n = 3/group). *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 EcN vs. Ctrl (relative expression values).</p>
