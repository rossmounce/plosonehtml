Original magnification×20. (B) Protein expression of ZO-1 in IECs. Western blot analysis of FACS sorted IECs from colonized mice was performed using anti-ZO-1 antibody. Anti-β actin antibody was used as internal control, binding to the corresponding protein with a molecular weight of 42 kDa. The ZO-1 antibody detects endogenous ZO-1 protein, displayed as a band at ~210 kDa.</p>
