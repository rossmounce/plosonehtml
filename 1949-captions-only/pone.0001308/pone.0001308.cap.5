                Figure 5.  Increased ZO-1 mRNA expression in mice treated with DSS and EcN.IECs were isolated from indicated mice and relative levels of ZO-1 mRNA were normalized with respect to the expression level of IECs from DSS treated mice (fold change = 1). Data are presented as mean of four independent experiments (n = 3/group). *p&lt;0.05 group III vs. group II (relative expression values).
