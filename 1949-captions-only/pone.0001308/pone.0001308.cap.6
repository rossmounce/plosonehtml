                Figure 6.  Secretory and absorptive function of isolated colonic mucosa from DSS-treated mice, with and without EcN administration, and healthy controls.(A) Basal and forskolin-stimulated Isc in DSS treated (group II n = 7), DSS+EcN (group III n = 12) and control animals (group I n = 10). The different numbers resulted from the fact that considerably more colonic segments from the DSS treated mice were so friable that they ruptured before measurements could be taken. (B) Basal and post-forskolin net Na+ flux rates in the three different groups. Whereas Na+ absorption was completely abolished in group II, active Na+ absorption was only partially inhibited in group III. Only in the control group I could an inhibition of Na+ absorption by forskolin be observed, indicating normal regulation (n = 6/group). *p&lt;0.05
