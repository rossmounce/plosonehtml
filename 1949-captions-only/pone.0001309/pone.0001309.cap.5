Data are presented as means of three consecutive image acquisitionsÂ±SEM. Significant differences were observed in the VMH, and PVN brain areas (P&lt;0.05) but not in the ARC. <em>Key:</em> ARC, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus; VMH, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus; PVN, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus; LRS, low resistant starch diet; HRS, high resistant starch diet.</p>
