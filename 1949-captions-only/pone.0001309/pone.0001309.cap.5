                Figure 5.  Representative baseline (pre-contrast) MRI images of the mouse brain showing assignment of regions of interest (ROIs) in various brain areas from which signal intensities (SI) were obtained.Time course of changes in SI (as a percentage of baseline) before and at various times after IV manganese chloride infusion in the (A) ARC, (B) VMH and the (C) PVN. Data are presented as means of three consecutive image acquisitionsÂ±SEM. Significant differences were observed in the VMH, and PVN brain areas (P&lt;0.05) but not in the ARC. Key: ARC, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus; VMH, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus; PVN, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus; LRS, low resistant starch diet; HRS, high resistant starch diet.
