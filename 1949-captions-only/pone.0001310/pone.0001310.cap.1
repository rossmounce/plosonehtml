                Figure 1.  Analysis of the association and dissociation rates constants by SPR.Van't Hoff plots of the rate constants A, k+1, B, k−1, C, k+2 and D, k−2 for mAb 18B7, 18B7dg, and chAb 18B7 binding to peptide P1. All data points were obtained from the BIAevaluation 4.1 software using a two-state model. Lines represent the best fit to a linear regression using a 95% confidence interval. Errors bars were calculated using propagation of error for SE of each assay.
