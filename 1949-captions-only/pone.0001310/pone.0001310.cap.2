                Figure 2.  Equilibrium affinity constants for the binding of mAb 18B7, 18B7dg, and chAb 18B7 to peptide P1.Van't Hoff plots of the A, equilibrium association constant (KA), B, encounter equilibrium association constant (Ka1) and C, docking equilibrium association constant (Ka2) for mAbs 18B7 binding to peptide P1. All equilibrium constants were calculated from the rate constant obtained from the fittings to a two-state model. Lines represent the best fit to a linear regression using a 95% confidence interval. Errors bars were calculated using propagation of error for SE of each assay.
