                Figure 3.  Thermodynamics of binding of mAbs 18B7, 18B7dg and chAb 18B7 to a peptide mimetic of GXM.Behavior of A, free energy of binding (ΔG), B, encounter free energy of binding (ΔG1), C, docking free energy of binding (ΔG2) and D, entropy of binding (ΔS) as a function of temperature for the mAb 18B7, 18B7dg and chAb 18B7 binding to peptide P1. Free energies were calculated from the formula ΔG = −RT ln KA, ΔG = −RT ln Ka1, ΔG = −RT ln Ka2 and ΔS from the formula ΔG = ΔH−TΔS.
