                Figure 4.  Effect of temperature on the differences in free energy of binding (ΔΔG) of chAb 18B7 and 18B7dg complexes.Each panel corresponds to the ΔG of chAb 18B7-P1 and 18B7dg-P1 complex formation, relative to the ΔG of parental mAb 18B7, at different temperatures. A, overall difference of the free energy of binding (ΔΔG) and overall difference of the free energy of binding of B, encounter and C, docking steps (ΔΔG1 and ΔΔG2) for the mAbs 18B7dg and chAb 18B7 at 35°C, 30°C, 25°C, 20°C, 15°C, 10°C. Values of ΔΔG were calculated as ΔGch/dgAb−ΔGmAb18B7.
