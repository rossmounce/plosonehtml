                Figure 5.  Differences in free activation energy of binding (ΔΔG‡) of the transition states of chAb 18B7 and 18B7dg for the binding to peptide P1.Each panel corresponds to the ΔG of chAb 18B7-P1 and 18B7dg-P1 complex formation, relative to the ΔG of parental mAb 18B7. A, free activation energy of binding (ΔΔG‡), B, encounter activation free energies (ΔΔG1‡) and C, docking activation free energies (ΔΔG2‡), as a function of temperature. Values of ΔΔG were calculated as ΔGch/dgAb−ΔGmAb18B7. In all cases, the activation energies for the encounter and docking steps (ΔG1‡ and ΔG2‡) were calculated from k+1 and k+2, respectively, according to the transition state theory: ΔG‡ = −RT ln K‡, ΔΔG‡ = −RT ln K‡ch/dg Ab/K‡mAb18B7, and K‡ = kB T ka/ћ, where ka is the forward rate constant, kB is Boltzmanns constant and ћ is Plank's constant.
