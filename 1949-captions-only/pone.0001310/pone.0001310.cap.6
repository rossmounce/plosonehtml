                Figure 6.  Structural models for chAb18B7 (red) and murine mAb18B7 (blue).A, Global structural superposition of the models; light chain depicted in gray. B, Structural superposition of light chain keeping fixed VL and C, CL domain. Structural superposition of D, heavy chain keeping fixed VH and E, CH1 domain.
