Areas of high connectivity are indicted by red and orange (red Zscore&gt;2.0; orange: 1.5≤Zscore&lt;2.0); medium connectivity residues are indicated in yellow (1.0≤Zscores&lt;1.5), whereas low connectivity is indicated in blue (Zscore&lt;1.0). Light chain is shown in gray. Side chains of amino acids with high connectivity values (Zscore≥1.5) are indicated by arrow. <em>C</em>, Residues masked in blue in the sequence alignment of H chain are equal in both Abs (domain V<sub>H</sub>: 1–120; domain C<sub>H1</sub>: 121–200). Connectivity values for each residues are shown in the alignment (in form of histogram and color coding, being b, y, o, and r: blue, yellow, orange, and red respectively); secondary structure elements are also shown.</p>
