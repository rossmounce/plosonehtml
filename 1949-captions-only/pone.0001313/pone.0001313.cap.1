Data points represent the combination index comparing low, medium, and high combinations of NO-Cbl and each chemotherapeutic agent (mean of eight replicates) to assess synergy. Synergy between NO-Cbl and various chemotherapeutic agents was determined by median effect analysis(38), (combination index &gt;1 indicates antagonism,  = 1 indicates additivity, and &lt;1 indicates synergy). The sequential treatment of NO-Cbl and chemotherapeutic drugs induced synergistic antiproliferative activity in 77.7% of the combinations examined.</p>
