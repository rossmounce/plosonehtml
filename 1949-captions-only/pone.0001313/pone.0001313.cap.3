                Figure 3.  IκB kinase (IKK) activity. IKK activity was assessed using recombinant GST-IκBα(1-54) and γ32P-ATP as substrates.The phosphorylated GST fusion protein was detected by autoradiography. IKK activity was determined in cells that were pre-treated with NO-Cbl (300 µM, 16 h) followed by doxorubicin (20 µM, 4 h) or cisplatin (20 µM, 1 h) or 5 flurouracil (5-FU, 100 µM, 5 h) or etoposide (20 µM, 4 h) or paclitaxel (20 µΜ, 5 h). Anti-β-actin antibody was used as an irrelevant antibody control for immunoprecipitation and yielded no signal. After exposure to film, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue to visualize total protein and demonstrated equal loading of the GST-IκBα(1-54) substrate. The same cell extracts were probed for total IKK by immunoblot analysis and demonstrated equal loading of IKK.
