                Figure 4.  Western blot analysis of phospho-AKT.Cells were pre-treated with NO-Cbl (300 µM, 16 h) followed by doxorubicin (20 µM, 4 h) or cisplatin (20 µM, 1 h) or 5 flurouracil (5-FU, 100 µM, 5 h) or etoposide (20 µM, 4 h) or paclitaxel (20 µΜ, 5 h). Whole cell lysates were probed with anti-phospho-AKT and then re-probed with anti-AKT (unphosphorylated) which served as a loading control.
