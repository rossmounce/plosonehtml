                Figure 5.  Western blot analysis of XIAP.Cells were pre-treated with NO-Cbl (300 µM, 16 h) followed by doxorubicin (20 µM, 4 h) or cisplatin (20 µM, 1 h) or 5 flurouracil (5-FU, 100 µM, 5 h) or etoposide (20 µM, 4 h) or paclitaxel (20 µΜ, 5 h). XIAP protein levels were determined in whole cell lysates. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
