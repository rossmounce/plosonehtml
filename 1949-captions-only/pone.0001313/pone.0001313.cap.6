                Figure 6.  Western blot analysis of mediators of apoptosis.A, Time course analysis of A375 cells pre-treated with NO-Cbl (300 µM, 16 h) followed by doxorubicin (20 µM, 4 h). Phospho-AKT, XIAP, caspase-8 and PARP immunoblots were performed on whole cell lysates. Note that caspase-8 and PARP cleavage were maximal with combination treatment at all time points. Degradation of XIAP was increased following combination treatment at all time points. B, OVCAR-3 cells were pre-treated with NO-Cbl (300 µM, 16 h) followed by etoposide (20 µM, 4 h). XIAP protein levels were determined. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
