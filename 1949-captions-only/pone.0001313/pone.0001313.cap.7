Daily drug treatments of control (PBS), NO-Cbl (150 mg/kg, s.c.), etoposide (2 mg/kg, s.c.), and the combination began on day 2 following inoculation. Tumor volume was measured every other day. Points represent the mean tumor volume±95% CI. B, Kaplan-Meir survival curve. DBA/2 male mice (n = 5) were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10<sup>5</sup> P388 murine leukemia cells. NO-Cbl was given twice daily (165 mg/kg, i.p.) and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once weekly, starting on day 2. Treatment in the combination group ceased on day 40 and the animals continued to be monitored for ninety days. Significance comparing the survival of groups was calculated using the logrank test.</p>
