                Figure 1.  Comparison of previously identified and novel epigenetic targets in breast cancer.(A) Hierarchical clustering of differentially methylated loci identified by microarray analysis. DNA methylation measurements of 220 loci identified to be significantly differentially methylated by statistical analysis of global DNA methylation profiles are shown. The color scale of the heatmap represents densely methylated loci (red) to sparsely methylated loci (green). Unsupervised clustering (top dendrogram) distinguishes adjacent histology normal breast tissues (green branches) from breast cancer tissues (red branches). Individual matched tumor/adjacent histology normal tissues pairs are indicated by a number assigned to each individual (Matched pair). (B) Differential DNA methylation in individual tumor and adjacent histology normal tissue pairs. Differences between log2 ratios for individual tumor and adjacent histology normal pairs are shown for known and novel epigenetic targets. Because the experimental procedure compares total genome representations to those depleted for fragments containing DNA methylation, methylated sequences have a untreated:depleted ratio near or above 1.0 while unmethylated sequences have a ratio approaching zero due to mass normalization of target DNA [27]. Log2 differences ≥0.7 (red), 0.5 to 0.6 (yellow) and ≤0.5 (green) are shown. The annotated genes associated with the differential DNA methylation events are indicated at the left.
