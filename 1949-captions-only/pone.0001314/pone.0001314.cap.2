Primer pairs designed to amplify 116 of the 220 regions predicted to be significantly differentially methylated. Delta-delta Ct values (delta Ct <sub>tumor</sub>â€“delta Ct <sub>adjacent normal</sub>) and differential log<sub>2</sub> microarray values (Log<sub>2 tumor</sub>-Log<sub>2 adjacent normal</sub>) were compared for breast tumor/adjacent normal tissue pairs. Data for one representative tumor/adjacent normal pair are shown. Data points in the upper right and lower left quadrants represent hypermethylation and hypomethylation measurements that are concordant between the two independent methods, respectively. qPCR measurements within the 0.5 cycle range of variance of the qPCR platform (hatched lines) were considered discordant.</p>
