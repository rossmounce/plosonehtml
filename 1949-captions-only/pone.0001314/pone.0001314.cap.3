                Figure 3.  Differential DNA methylation of identified loci within an initial validation panel of clinical samples.qPCR measurements of DNA methylation density were obtained for 53 loci across 16 IDC tumor samples and 25 normal or benign breast samples. An average delta Ct (Ct McrBC–Ct Mock) less than 1.0 was scored as sparsely methylated (green cells). A delta Ct of 1.0 indicates that approximately half of the DNA in the reaction was cleaved by McrBC within the amplified region and therefore contained a measurable density of DNA methylation. An average delta Ct greater than or equal to 1.0, but less than 2.0 was scored as intermediately methylated (yellow cells). Finally, an average delta Ct≥2.0 (≥75% of DNA molecules were cleaved by McrBC) was scored as densely methylated (red cells).
