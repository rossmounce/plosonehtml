                Figure 4.  Differential DNA methylation relative to tumor stage.(A) Comparison of the frequency of differential DNA methylation of 16 loci in stage I breast tumors relative to stage II–III breast tumors. (B) DNA methylation density of 3 selected loci relative to tumor stage. The percent depletion by McrBC for each sample in which a given locus scored as methylated was calculated [1-(1/2̂delta Ct (McrBC digested – Mock treated)) * 100] to provide a measure of the load of methylated molecules within the sample. The % depletion is plotted (from left to right) for normal and benign samples, stage I tumors, stage IIA tumors, stage IIB tumors and stage III tumors.
