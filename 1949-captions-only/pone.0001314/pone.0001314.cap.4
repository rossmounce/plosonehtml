(B) DNA methylation density of 3 selected loci relative to tumor stage. The percent depletion by McrBC for each sample in which a given locus scored as methylated was calculated [1-(1/2̂delta Ct (McrBC digested – Mock treated)) * 100] to provide a measure of the load of methylated molecules within the sample. The % depletion is plotted (from left to right) for normal and benign samples, stage I tumors, stage IIA tumors, stage IIB tumors and stage III tumors.</p>
