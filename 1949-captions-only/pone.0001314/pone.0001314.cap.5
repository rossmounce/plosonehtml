                Figure 5.  Differential DNA methylation of selected loci.(A) DNA methylation measurements for selected loci in normal blood, normal or benign breast tissue and breast tumors. Each data point represents the averaged delta Ct value for an independent clinical sample. (B) ROC curve analyses of the four loci shown in (A). Sensitivity (percentage of tumor samples scoring above a methylation threshold) and specificity (percentage of non-tumor samples scoring below that same threshold) were calculated for all observed delta Ct values. The minimum allowed threshold was set at 0.5 so that calculations could not be based on thresholds within the variability range of the qPCR platform.
