Bisulphite sequencing was performed by 454 Life Sciences technology as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. The average number of molecules sequenced for each locus within each sample was 587. The calculated DNA methylation density (number of methylated CpGs divided by the total number of CpGs sequenced) for each sample is plotted versus the qPCR DNA methylation measurement for the same sample (A, C, E, G). Analyzed samples included normal breast tissues (open circles), tumor-adjacent histology normal breast tissues (filled circles) and breast tumors (filled squares). The number of samples analyzed and the qPCR-based methylation score are as follows: <em>GHSR,</em> 6 tumor (5 densely and 1 intermediately methylated), 3 adjacent normal (sparsely methylated) and 5 normal (sparsely methylated); chr7-8256880, 6 tumor (3 densely and 3 intermediately methylated), 3 adjacent normal (sparsely methylated) and 7 normal (sparsely methylated); <em>MGA,</em> 6 tumor (2 densely and 4 intermediately methylated), 3 adjacent normal (2 sparsely and 1 intermediately methylated) and 5 normal (sparsely methylated); <em>NFIX</em>, 5 tumor (densely methylated), 3 adjacent normal (sparsely methylated) and 5 normal (sparsely methylated). In addition, the percent methylation occupancy at each analyzed CpG dinucleotide is shown (B, D, F, H).</p>
