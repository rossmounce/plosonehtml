RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primer pairs designed to flank intronic sequence so that the contribution of contaminating genomic DNA could be excluded. Analysis of <em>GAPDH</em> expression was performed as an internal control. Serial dilutions of first-strand cDNA preparations from tumor samples and a normal breast tissue sample were used as templates for PCR. The DNA methylation measurement (qPCR) for each locus in each tumor sample is indicated (- sparse, + intermediate and ++ dense methylation).</p>
