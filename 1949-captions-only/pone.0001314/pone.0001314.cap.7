                Figure 7.  Correlation between DNA hypermethylation and gene expression.Transcription of GHSR1a was analyzed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primer pairs designed to flank intronic sequence so that the contribution of contaminating genomic DNA could be excluded. Analysis of GAPDH expression was performed as an internal control. Serial dilutions of first-strand cDNA preparations from tumor samples and a normal breast tissue sample were used as templates for PCR. The DNA methylation measurement (qPCR) for each locus in each tumor sample is indicated (- sparse, + intermediate and ++ dense methylation).
