                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of recombinant plasmid pC23 part structure encoding the class 1 integron in P. aeruginosa Pa695 (adapted from Dubois et al., 2002, accession number AF355189).The horizontal arrows indicate the translation orientation of the genes. The conserved core and inverse core sites are underlined and the cassette boundaries are represented by vertical arrows. The black arrowheads indicate the different primers described in materials and methods used for cloning the IntI1 gene and the different recombination and excision substrates: A: IntI1-3′-stop, B: IntI1-5′-Topo, C: attI1-LBamH1, D: attI1-RHindIII, E: C12T3bis and F: 3′CS.
