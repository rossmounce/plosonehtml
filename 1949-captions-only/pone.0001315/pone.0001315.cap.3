                Figure 3.  In vitro DNA binding of IntI1 with free double-stranded attI1 (A) and attC (B) recombination sites.Free 5′ 32P radiolabeled dsDNA fragments containing recombination sites (0.1 pmoles) were incubated with purified IntI1 (1–10 pmoles) at 4°C for 20 min before electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel run at 50 V, for 2 hours at 4°C. Arrows indicate the protein-DNA complexes and F corresponds to free recombination sites.
