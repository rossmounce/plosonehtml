                Figure 5.  Comparison of IntI1 1 affinity for double-stranded (A) and single-stranded (B) recombination sites.Filter binding assays were performed as described in materials and methods section using either double-stranded attI (attI ds) and attC (attC ds) either top (top) or bottom (bot) strand of attI and attC. Percentages of substrate retained on filters are shown. Values are the meanÂ±standard deviation (error bars) of three independent experiments.
