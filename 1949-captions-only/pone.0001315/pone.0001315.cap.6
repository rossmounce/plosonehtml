                Figure 6.  In vitro recombination catalyzed by IntI1 at attI1 and attC sites.Reactions were performed for 90 min in the presence of purified IntI1 (5 or 10 pmoles), 0.1 to 0.2 pmoles of either pGEM-T-attI1 or pGEM-T-attC (pattI1 and pattC in the figure) and 0.1 pmoles free 5â€² 32P radiolabeled recombination sites under standard conditions described in materials and methods. Products were loaded on 1% agarose gel and autoradiographied (A). F: free recombination sites, RP: recombination products. The recombination products were quantified and the percentage of recombination versus the amount of IntI in pmoles was plotted (B).
