                Figure 7.  In vitro recombination catalyzed by wild type, R146E and R286K mutated IntI1.Reactions were performed for 90 min in the presence of purified enzyme (5 pmoles), 0.1 pmoles of linear radiolabeled recombination sites attI1 or attC and 0.1 pmoles of pGEM-T-attI1 under standard conditions described in materials and methods section. Products were loaded on 1% agarose gel and autoradiographied. F: free recombination sites, RP: recombination products.
