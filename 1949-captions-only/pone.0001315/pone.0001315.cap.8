                Figure 8.  In vitro recombination catalyzed by wild type IntI1 in presence of double- or single-stranded substrates.Reactions were performed for 90 min in the presence of purified enzyme (5 pmoles), 0.1 pmoles of linear radiolabeled double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (bottom strand: ss bot, or top strand: ss top) recombination sites attI1 or attC and 0.1 pmoles of pGEM-T-attI1 or pGEM-T-attC under standard conditions described in materials and methods section. Products were loaded on 1% agarose gel and autoradiographied. F: free recombination sites, RP: recombination products.
