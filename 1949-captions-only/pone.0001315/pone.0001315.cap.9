                Figure 9.  Effect of cations (A), salt (B) and detergent (C) on in vitro recombination catalyzed by IntI1.Recombination reactions were performed in the presence of 2 pmoles purified IntI1, 0.1 pmoles free attI1* and 0.1 pmoles pGEM-T-attI1 and different concentrations of MgCl2, MnCl2 NaCl and detergent as indicated. Recombination products were quantified with DNAJ software and are shown on the graphs as the percentage of recombinant product versus the total substrate.
