                Figure 1.   C. albicans produces a tri-hydroxy derivative of EPA that is structurally identical to the human anti-inflammatory lipid mediator RvE1.The MS/MS spectra of biogenic RvE1 (1A) and 18-HEPE (1B) produced by C. albicans cultured in liquid media supplemented with EPA. (1C) C. albicans, cultured in the presence of EPA the LO inhibitors esculetin or zileuton (100 ÂµM) as well as the CYP450 inhibitor, 17-ODA, reduced RvE1 biosynthesis (squares). LO inhibitors, but not the CYP450 inhibitor, reduced biosynthesis of 5-HEPE (circles), 12-HEPE (diamonds), and 18-HEPE (triangles).
