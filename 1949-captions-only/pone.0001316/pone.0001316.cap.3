Neutrophils treated with the non-hydrolyzable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP were less likely to phagocytose the yeast (black bar). (3A) Representative images of isolated neutrophils phagocytosing FITC-stained HKO <em>C. albicans</em> in the presence of 10 nM RvE1, 1 nM RvE1 or vehicle and trypan blue. Green fluorescence (right panels) correspond to FITC-stained HKO <em>C. albicans</em> phagocytosed by neutrophils (3C) Neutrophils exposed to RvE1 exhibited a positive dose-dependent increase in their ability to kill opsonized <em>C. albicans</em> (yellow bars). Twice as many <em>C. albicans</em> were killed by neutrophils treated with 1nM RvE1 and over three times as many yeast were killed by neutrophils treated with 10 nM RvE1 relative to vehicle-treated neutrophils. Asterisks indicate significant differences from vehicle-treated controls (ANOVA: p&lt;0.001). (3D) RvE1 had no effect on hydroxy-radical produced by neutrophils exposed to HKO <em>C. albicans</em> (red, orange, and yellow circles vs blue diamonds). (3E) 100 nM RvE1 increased neutrophil super-oxide production in neutrophils exposed to HKO <em>C. albicans</em> relative to neutrophils exposed to vehicle and HKO <em>C. albicans</em> (red circles vs blue diamonds) while lower concentrations of RvE1 (orange and yellow circles) did not increase neutrophil super-oxide relative to cells exposed to vehicle and HKO <em>C. albicans</em> (blue diamonds). 100nM RvE1 alone did not increase the amount of ROS produced by neutrophils relative to vehicle controls (3DE: black circles).</p>
