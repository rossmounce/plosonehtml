                Figure 4.  RvE1 reduces C. albicans concentrations in the blood.To evaluate the actions of RvE1 on the virulence of C albicans, 8–10 week old female BALB/c mice were injected via the tail vein with RvE1 (8 ng g−1 mouse) or vehicle and C. albicans (5×104 yeast cells g−1 mouse). After 24 h, and blood and organs were collected, homogenized, serially diluted and plated. There was a 10-fold reduction in C. albicans circulating in the blood of mice injected with RvE1 compared to those injected with vehicle (circles vs triangles). In contrast, RvE1 and vehicle-treated mice showed similar levels of organ colonization.
