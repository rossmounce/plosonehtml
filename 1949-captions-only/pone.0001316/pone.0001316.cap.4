After 24 h, and blood and organs were collected, homogenized, serially diluted and plated. There was a 10-fold reduction in <em>C. albicans</em> circulating in the blood of mice injected with RvE1 compared to those injected with vehicle (circles vs triangles). In contrast, RvE1 and vehicle-treated mice showed similar levels of organ colonization.</p>
