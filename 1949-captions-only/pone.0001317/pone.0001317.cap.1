A D<sup>100</sup>A mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to create the G<sub>s</sub>-coupled RASSL (Rs1). An additional point mutation (D<sup>66</sup>A, D<sup>66</sup>N, or W<sup>272</sup>A) was added to Rs1 to modulate constitutive signaling. Rs1.1 is the Rs1-C-5-HT<sub>2C</sub> chimera with enhanced G<sub>q</sub> signaling. Rs1.2 is Rs1 with an extra D<sup>66</sup>A mutation that decreased constitutive G<sub>s</sub> signaling. Rs1.3 is the Rs1-i3-5-HT<sub>1A</sub> chimera with G<sub>i</sub> signaling. The junctions in Rs1.1 and Rs1.3 indicate ends of domain swapping where the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> has been replaced by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, respectively.</p>
