                Figure 1.  Human 5-HT4-based RASSLs.A signal peptide and the FLAG epitope were added to the N-terminus of the human 5-HT4 receptor. A D100A mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to create the Gs-coupled RASSL (Rs1). An additional point mutation (D66A, D66N, or W272A) was added to Rs1 to modulate constitutive signaling. Rs1.1 is the Rs1-C-5-HT2C chimera with enhanced Gq signaling. Rs1.2 is Rs1 with an extra D66A mutation that decreased constitutive Gs signaling. Rs1.3 is the Rs1-i3-5-HT1A chimera with Gi signaling. The junctions in Rs1.1 and Rs1.3 indicate ends of domain swapping where the 5-HT4 has been replaced by 5-HT2C or 5-HT1A, respectively.
