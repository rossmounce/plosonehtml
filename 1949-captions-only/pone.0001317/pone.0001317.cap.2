                Figure 2.  Rs1 is a Gs-coupled RASSL.Rs1 was efficiently activated by small compounds known to be full agonists (cisapride, zacopride), partial agonists (RS39604, RS67333, and RS23597), antagonists (GR113808, RO110-0235), or inverse agonists (GR125487) for the wildtype 5-HT4 receptor. It was not activated by its endogenous agonist (serotonin). Values are mean±SD of three independent experiments in which 25 ng of 5-HT4 or Rs1 receptor cDNA was electroporated into 5×106 cells. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
