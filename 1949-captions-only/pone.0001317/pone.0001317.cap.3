                Figure 3.  Rs1 activation occurs in the nanomolar range.(A–E) Rs1 transfectants were stimulated with increasing amounts of drugs. The D100A mutation in Rs1 makes the receptor insensitive to serotonin. It was efficiently activated by GR113808, GR125487, and RO110-0235, which do not activate the wildtype 5-HT4 receptor. Values are mean±standard deviation of three independent experiments in which 25 ng of 5-HT4 or Rs1 receptor cDNA was electroporated into 5×106 HEK293 cells. (F) Best-fit estimate of the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50). Values are mean±SEM of three independent experiments.
