The D<sup>100</sup>A mutation in Rs1 makes the receptor insensitive to serotonin. It was efficiently activated by GR113808, GR125487, and RO110-0235, which do not activate the wildtype 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Values are mean±standard deviation of three independent experiments in which 25 ng of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> or Rs1 receptor cDNA was electroporated into 5×10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells. (F) Best-fit estimate of the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50). Values are mean±SEM of three independent experiments.</p>
