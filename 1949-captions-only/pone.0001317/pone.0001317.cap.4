                Figure 4.  Rs1 has significant constitutive activity.(A) Rs1 and the wildtype 5-HT4 receptor both had much higher constitutive activity than the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-ADR) and parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH). ***p&lt;0.005, and * p&lt;0.05 vs. mock-transfected cells (t test). (B) Rs1 was still activated when 1.5 µg of receptor cDNA was electroporated into 5×106 HEK293 cells. Rs1 only showed a 197% increase over constitutive signaling. 5-HT4 and Rs1 were stimulated with 1 µM of zacopride. β2-ADR and PTH were stimulated with 1 µM of isoproterenol and human PTH (1-34) peptide, respectively. Activation of any of the four receptors resulted in significantly higher cAMP over the PBS mock treated samples. ***p&lt;0.005 (t test). All experiments were repeated three times. Values are mean±SD.
