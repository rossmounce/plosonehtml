(B) Rs1 was still activated when 1.5 µg of receptor cDNA was electroporated into 5×10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells. Rs1 only showed a 197% increase over constitutive signaling. 5-HT<sub>4</sub> and Rs1 were stimulated with 1 µM of zacopride. β<sub>2</sub>-ADR and PTH were stimulated with 1 µM of isoproterenol and human PTH (1-34) peptide, respectively. Activation of any of the four receptors resulted in significantly higher cAMP over the PBS mock treated samples. ***p&lt;0.005 (<em>t</em> test). All experiments were repeated three times.
