The 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor showed increased G<sub>q</sub> signaling when activated by serotonin, cisapride, and zacopride but not by RS39604 or RS67333, relative to mock treatment with HBSS. Rs1 showed significantly higher G<sub>q</sub> signaling than the wildtype 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor when activated by cisapride, zacopride, RS39604, and RS67333 but not by serotonin. G<sub>q</sub> signaling of Rs1-C-5HT<sub>2C</sub> chimera was activated by cisapride, zacopride, RS23597, RS39604, and RS67333 and was minimally activated by RO110-0235. GR113808 and GR125487 did not activate G<sub>q</sub> signaling by any of the three receptors. ***p&lt;0.005, * p&lt;0.05 vs. mock-transfected cells (<em>t</em> test). Values are Â±SD of three experiments.</p>
