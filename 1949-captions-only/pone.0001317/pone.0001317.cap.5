                Figure 5.  The wildtype 5-HT4 receptor, Rs1, and the Rs1-C-5-HT2C chimera exhibit different Gq signaling properties.Gq signaling was analyzed by measuring the accumulation of inositol 1 phosphate (IP1). The 5-HT4 receptor showed increased Gq signaling when activated by serotonin, cisapride, and zacopride but not by RS39604 or RS67333, relative to mock treatment with HBSS. Rs1 showed significantly higher Gq signaling than the wildtype 5-HT4 receptor when activated by cisapride, zacopride, RS39604, and RS67333 but not by serotonin. Gq signaling of Rs1-C-5HT2C chimera was activated by cisapride, zacopride, RS23597, RS39604, and RS67333 and was minimally activated by RO110-0235. GR113808 and GR125487 did not activate Gq signaling by any of the three receptors. ***p&lt;0.005, * p&lt;0.05 vs. mock-transfected cells (t test). Values are Â±SD of three experiments.
