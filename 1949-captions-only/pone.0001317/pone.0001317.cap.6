                Figure 6.  Abolishing the constitutive activity of Rs1 eliminates ligand-induced Gs and Gq signaling.(A) The D66A, D66N, and W272A mutations each decreased the constitutive signaling of Rs1, as shown by cAMP HTRF HiRange assay. (B) Cell-surface expression levels of Rs1-D66A, Rs1-D66N, and Rs1 were similar and higher than that of Rs1-W272A. *** p&lt;0.05 vs. Rs1 (t test). (C) The D66A or D66N mutations also abolished Gq signaling of Rs1, as shown by HTRF IP1 assay.
