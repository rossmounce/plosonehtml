                Figure 7.  Replacing i3 of Rs1 with that of 5-HT1A results in a receptor, Rs1-i3-5-HT1A, with weak Gi signaling.(A) Rs1-i3-5-HT1A chimera decreased cAMP accumulation. It also showed little constitutive Gs signaling, in contrast to Rs1. All HEK293 transfectants were electroporated with 0.6 µg of human dopamine 1 receptor and 1.5 µg of Rs1, Rs1-i3-5-HT1A chimera, or human mu-opioid receptor. The transfectants were stimulated with 10 µM apomorphine (agonist for the dopamine 1 receptor) to increase basal cAMP level in order to observe Gi signaling. Rs1 and Rs1-i3-5-HT1A were then stimulated with 10 µM zacopride. The mu-opioid receptor was stimulated with 10 µM DADLE. ***p&lt;0.005, * p&lt;0.05 vs. apomorphine (t test). (B) Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) abolished the decreased cAMP accumulation of Rs1-i3-5HT1A and mu-opioid receptor, indicating that the decreased cAMP accumulation seen in panel (A) was due to Gi signaling. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Values are mean±SD. (C) Rs1-i3-5HT1A required a large amount of zacopride for maximal Gi response. The data are representative of two independent experiments. ***p&lt;0.005, *p&lt;0.05 (t test), zacopride vs. no treatement.
