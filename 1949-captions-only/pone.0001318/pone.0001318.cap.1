(<em>B</em>) Summary of variants identified in five TLR proteins. Shown are all variant sites that would be made by the <em>TLR</em> alleles identified in either the TB patients or control subjects. Black, rare variant; red, variants that are common in all three ethnic groups analyzed. SG, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain; TIR, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain; NSP, nonsynonymous polymorphisms (includes nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, nonsense mutations, and insertion and deletions). Numbers in parentheses denote amino acid residue positions.</p>
