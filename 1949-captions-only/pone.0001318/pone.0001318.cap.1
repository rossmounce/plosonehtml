                Figure 1.  Schematic of the TLR proteins and sequence variants.(A) Schematic of human chromosome 4 showing location of TLR genes. (B) Summary of variants identified in five TLR proteins. Shown are all variant sites that would be made by the TLR alleles identified in either the TB patients or control subjects. Black, rare variant; red, variants that are common in all three ethnic groups analyzed. SG, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain; TIR, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain; NSP, nonsynonymous polymorphisms (includes nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, nonsense mutations, and insertion and deletions). Numbers in parentheses denote amino acid residue positions.
