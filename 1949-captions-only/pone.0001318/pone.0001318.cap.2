                Figure 2.  Altered NF-κB signal transduction by rare variants of TLR6.HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with TLR2 and the indicated TLR6 variant expression plasmids, NF-κB reporter (firefly luciferase), and β-actin Renilla luciferase plasmids. NF-κB activation in transfected cells was measured 24 hrs post transfection. The data shown are the mean ± SD from 4 independent experiments expressed as the percent relative firefly luciferase activity (RLU) (normalized to Renilla luciferase activity) induced in cells co-expressing TLR2 and WT TLR6. * P&lt;0.01; ** P&lt;0.001 compared to TLR6 WT NF-κB activity.
