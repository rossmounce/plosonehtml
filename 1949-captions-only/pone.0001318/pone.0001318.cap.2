NF-κB activation in transfected cells was measured 24 hrs post transfection. The data shown are the mean ± SD from 4 independent experiments expressed as the percent relative firefly luciferase activity (RLU) (normalized to <em>Renilla</em> luciferase activity) induced in cells co-expressing <em>TLR2</em> and WT <em>TLR6</em>. * <em>P</em>&lt;0.01; ** <em>P</em>&lt;0.001 compared to TLR6 WT NF-κB activity.</p>
