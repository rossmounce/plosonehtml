                Figure 1.  Neighbor joining tree of T. castaneum chemoreceptor genes family.The T. castaneum putative chemoreceptor genes (TcasGr and TcasOr) are indicated to the right. The corrected distance tree was rooted by declaring the TcasOr16 and its homologs (DmelOr83b, AmelOr2, AgamOr7, and HvirOr2) as outgroup, based on their position at the base of the insect Or family in the phylogenetic analysis of [11]. Receptors that represent lineages are indicated in bold and italics, and the supported bootstrap value (&gt;50%) is indicated with #. * represents lineages of either TcasGr or TcasOr receptors supported with a bootstrap value of &gt;50%. TcasGr are written in blue letters, TcasOr are written in red, and the members of TcasOr16 outgroup are written in black. The amino acid sequences alignment was carried out using CLUSTAL X [47]. The neighbour joining tree was produced using the PHYLIP package [48] and based on the consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates. Tree drawing was performed as corrected-distance cladogram with the help of TreeView 1.6.6. program.
