The corrected distance tree was rooted by declaring the <em>Tcas</em>Or16 and its homologs (<em>Dmel</em>Or83b, <em>Amel</em>Or2, <em>Agam</em>Or7, and <em>Hvir</em>Or2) as outgroup, based on their position at the base of the insect Or family in the phylogenetic analysis of <a href="#pone.0001319-Robertson2">[11]</a>. Receptors that represent lineages are indicated in bold and italics, and the supported bootstrap value (&gt;50%) is indicated with #. * represents lineages of either <em>Tcas</em>Gr or <em>Tcas</em>Or receptors supported with a bootstrap value of &gt;50%. <em>Tcas</em>Gr are written in blue letters, <em>Tcas</em>Or are written in red, and the members of <em>Tcas</em>Or16 outgroup are written in black. The amino acid sequences alignment was carried out using CLUSTAL X <a href="#pone.0001319-Jeanmougin1">[47]</a>. The neighbour joining tree was produced using the PHYLIP package <a href="#pone.0001319-Felsenstein1">[48]</a> and based on the consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates. Tree drawing was performed as corrected-distance cladogram with the help of TreeView 1.6.6. program.</p>
