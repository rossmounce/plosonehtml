The genes are encoded on X axon with numbers as described in <a href="#pone-0001319-t001">Table 1</a>. The data on Y axon represented meanÂ±SD normalized relative to the actin related protein transcript levels. All samples were run in triplicate and the entire assay was performed twice for each biological pool.</p>
