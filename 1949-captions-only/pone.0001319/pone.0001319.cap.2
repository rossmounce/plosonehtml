                Figure 2.  Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of T. castaneum chemoreceptor genes family.It shows the relative transcription levels of (A) TcasGr receptor genes, and (B) TcasOr receptor genes in the labium, maxillae, antennae, heads (without gustatory and olfactory organs), and prolegs of adult T. castaneum. The genes are encoded on X axon with numbers as described in Table 1. The data on Y axon represented meanÂ±SD normalized relative to the actin related protein transcript levels. All samples were run in triplicate and the entire assay was performed twice for each biological pool.
