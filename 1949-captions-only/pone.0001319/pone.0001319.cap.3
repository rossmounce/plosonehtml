(a) shows the expression of the TcasGr receptors in the labium and maxillae of adult mouth parts. (c) shows the expression of the TcasGr receptors in the femur, tibia, and tarsus of adult prolegs. (b) and (d) show the sense negative controls. The TcasGr mRNAs were labeled using Dig 11-dUTP (Roche) and visualized by fluorescence in situ RT-PCR analysis using HNPP/Fast Red TR (Roche).</p>
