                Figure 5.  Tissue specific localization of the T. castaneum Or receptor genes in the antennae of adult beetles using whole-mount in situ RT-PCR.(a) shows the antisense mRNA expression. (b) shows the sense negative controls. The last line shows the expression of the TcasOr16 receptor (homolog to DmelOr83b) in the antennae, mouth parts (labium and maxillae), and in the prolegs (femur, tibia, and tarsus) of adult beetles. For other details see Figure 3.
