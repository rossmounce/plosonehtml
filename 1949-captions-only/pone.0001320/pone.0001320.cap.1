                Figure 1.  Increases of osteoclasts and inflammatory cells associated with alveolar bone loss in diabetic groups.Diabetic rats presented significant alveolar bone loss (a) starting at 3 months after alloxan injection when compared to the controls. After histotechnical procedures, sections were investigated by morphometric analyses for: b) volumetric density of osteoclasts, c) volumetric density of inflammatory cells.
