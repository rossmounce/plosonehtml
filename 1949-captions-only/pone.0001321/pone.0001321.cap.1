(B) rCMECs were pretreated with Sal B (0~100 µM) for 30 min, and then coincubated with or without 200 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h, followed by apoptosis measurement using TUNEL assay. (C) rCMECs were analyzed by DAPI staining and TUNEL assay after a 12-h exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with or without Sal B pretreatment. (D) Time course of caspase-9 activation in rCMECs incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) alone or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM). (E) Time course of caspase-3 activation in rCMECs incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) alone or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM). Immunoblotting were carried out on cell lysate proteins from control cells or rCMECs pretreated with Sal B for 1 h and then exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for the indicated times. (G) rCMECs were pretreated with zVAD-fmk (0~100 µM) for 60 min, and then coincubated with or without 200 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h, followed by apoptosis measurement using TUNEL assay. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05; **<em>P</em>&lt;0.01 versus control, <sup>#</sup>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 versus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone.
