                Figure 1.  Inhibition of H2O2-induced rCMECs apoptosis by Sal B.(A) Apoptosis was induced in rCMECs with 0~500 µM H2O2 for 12 h and determined by TUNEL assay. (B) rCMECs were pretreated with Sal B (0~100 µM) for 30 min, and then coincubated with or without 200 µM H2O2 for 12 h, followed by apoptosis measurement using TUNEL assay. (C) rCMECs were analyzed by DAPI staining and TUNEL assay after a 12-h exposure to H2O2 with or without Sal B pretreatment. (D) Time course of caspase-9 activation in rCMECs incubated with H2O2 (200 µM) alone or with H2O2 (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM). (E) Time course of caspase-3 activation in rCMECs incubated with H2O2 (200 µM) alone or with H2O2 (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM). Immunoblotting were carried out on cell lysate proteins from control cells or rCMECs pretreated with Sal B for 1 h and then exposed to H2O2 for the indicated times. (G) rCMECs were pretreated with zVAD-fmk (0~100 µM) for 60 min, and then coincubated with or without 200 µM H2O2 for 12 h, followed by apoptosis measurement using TUNEL assay. *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01 versus control, #, P&lt;0.05 versus H2O2 alone. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
