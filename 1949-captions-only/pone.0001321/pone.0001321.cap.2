                Figure 2.  Effects of Sal B on MEK/ERK signaling.(A) Effects of Sal B, MEK inhibition, or their combination on H2O2-induced apoptosis. rCMECs were incubated with U0126 (10 µM) or U0124 (10 µM) for 1 h and then exposed to H2O2 in the presence or absence of Sal B pretreatment for 12 h. *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01 versus H2O2 alone. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Time course of phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression in rCMECs incubated with H2O2 (200 µM) alone, or with H2O2 (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM), or with Sal B (20 µM) alone. Immunoblotting were carried out on cell lysate proteins from control cells or rCMECs pretreated with Sal B for 1 h and then exposed to H2O2 for the indicated times. The representative Western blots and the quantitative analysis of protein expression (in relative protein density units). *P&lt;0.05 versus control, #, P&lt;0.05 versus H2O2 alone. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
