Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Time course of phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression in rCMECs incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) alone, or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) and Sal B (20 µM), or with Sal B (20 µM) alone. Immunoblotting were carried out on cell lysate proteins from control cells or rCMECs pretreated with Sal B for 1 h and then exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for the indicated times. The representative Western blots and the quantitative analysis of protein expression (in relative protein density units). *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 versus control, <sup>#</sup>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 versus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone.
