Blot shown is representative of at least three independent experiments. (B) Phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473) and phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser-259) expressions in rCMECs incubated with Sal B (20 µM) for the indicated times. (C) Effect of PI3K inhibition on phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473) and phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser-259) expressions induced by Sal B. rCMECs were incubated with LY294002 (50 µM) and/or Sal B (20 µM) for 1 h. (D) Effect of c-Raf inhibition on phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 activation induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. rCMECs were incubated with GW5074 (5 µM) and/or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) for 1 h. (E) Effect of PI3K inhibition on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in the presence or absence of Sal B (20 µM). rCMECs were incubated with LY294002 (50 µM) and/or Sal B (20 µM) for 1 h and then exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h. LY, indicates LY294002. S, indicates Sal B. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05; **<em>P</em>&lt;0.01 versus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone; n.s., not significant. Data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
