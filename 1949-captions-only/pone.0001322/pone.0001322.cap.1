                Figure 1.  Biosynthetic pathway of aliphatic glucosinolates in Arabidopsis Col-0.A. The chain-elongation machinery. Methionine enters the chain-elongation cycle via deamination by BCAT4 and is subsequently condensed with acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by MAM1 and MAM3. MAM1 can catalyze one to four condensation cycles, whereas MAM3 catalyzes one to six cycles. Subsequently, an isomerization and oxidation-decarboxylation step occurs and the molecule can re-enter the cycle or enter the core pathway following a transamination step. B. Synthesis of the core methylthio glucosinolate structure. The first enzymatic step has side chain specificity with CYP79F1 that converts both short- and long- chained methionine derivatives (n = 1–6) to the corresponding aldoxime whereas CYP79F2 only takes the long-chained methionine derivatives (n = 5–6). C. Secondary modifications. Short- and long-chained methylthio glucosinolates can be secondarily modified to methylsulfinyl glucosinolates in Col-0 leaves. In the seeds, the short-chained methylsulfinyl glucosinolates can be further modified to hydroxy and benzoyloxy forms. Characterized enzymes in the pathway are noted next to the reaction arrows.
