The LOD plot from QTL Cartographer CIM module for QTL on chromosome V is shown. The significance threshold was obtained by 1,000 random permutations within QTL Cartographer. A 4-LOD confidence interval around the QTL is depicted (vertical dotted lines) and the arrows show the position of the genes marking the 4 LOD interval.</p>
