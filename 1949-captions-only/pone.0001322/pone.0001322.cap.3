                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic tree of plant MYBs related to MYB28.The entire MYB complement from the genomic sequence for rice, Arabidopsis and poplar with a BLAST P value of 10eâˆ’60 or lower when tested against the MYB28, MYB29, MYB76 or ATR1/MYB34 R2R3 domain, were obtained and translated into their corresponding amino acid sequence. A complete neighbor joining tree with 1000 bootstraps was conducted in ClustalX and the unrooted cladogram is shown. All branches were supported by, at minimum, 630 bootstraps. A distance scale is shown to the bottom left. Table S3 contains the identification numbers for the sequences and Figure S1 the alignments.
