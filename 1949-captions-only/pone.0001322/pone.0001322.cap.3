A complete neighbor joining tree with 1000 bootstraps was conducted in ClustalX and the unrooted cladogram is shown. All branches were supported by, at minimum, 630 bootstraps. A distance scale is shown to the bottom left. <a href="#pone.0001322.s004">Table S3</a> contains the identification numbers for the sequences and <a href="#pone.0001322.s001">Figure S1</a> the alignments.</p>
