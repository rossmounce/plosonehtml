The pathways linking one major metabolite to another with statistically significant altered expression are shown as colored arrows. Red shows that the <em>35S:MYB</em> lines led to increased transcript levels for the biosynthetic pathway in comparison to wild-type, while blue shows decreased transcript levels. Dark color represents a change of 50 percent or more while the lighter color shows a change of less than 50 percent. The genes used for each pathway are as listed in <a href="#pone.0001322.s009">Table S8</a>. MYB28 illustrates the comparison of transcript levels in <em>35S:MYB28</em> lines versus Col-0. MYB29 illustrates the comparison of transcript levels in <em>35S:MYB29</em> lines versus Col-0. MYB76 illustrates the comparison transcript levels in <em>35S:MYB76</em> lines versus Col-0.</p>
