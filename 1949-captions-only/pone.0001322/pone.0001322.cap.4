                Figure 4.  Expression of Sulfur Utilization Biosynthetic Pathways in 35S:MYB lines.Nested ANOVAs were utilized on microarray data to test for altered expression of the major sulfur utilization biosynthetic pathways as described. The pathways linking one major metabolite to another with statistically significant altered expression are shown as colored arrows. Red shows that the 35S:MYB lines led to increased transcript levels for the biosynthetic pathway in comparison to wild-type, while blue shows decreased transcript levels. Dark color represents a change of 50 percent or more while the lighter color shows a change of less than 50 percent. The genes used for each pathway are as listed in Table S8. MYB28 illustrates the comparison of transcript levels in 35S:MYB28 lines versus Col-0. MYB29 illustrates the comparison of transcript levels in 35S:MYB29 lines versus Col-0. MYB76 illustrates the comparison transcript levels in 35S:MYB76 lines versus Col-0.
