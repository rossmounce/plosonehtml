                Figure 6.  Overlap in Altered Gene Regulation Between the 35S:MYB over-expressor lines.Each ring of the Venn diagram shows the number of genes whose transcript level was statistically significantly altered by the given 35S:MYB transgene. Statistical significance was determined by individual gene ANOVAs using a FDR of 0.05. The bottom diagram shows the predicted number of genes in each intersection under the assumption that the MYB genes have independent regulatory functions.
