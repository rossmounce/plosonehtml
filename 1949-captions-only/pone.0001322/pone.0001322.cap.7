Diagram of the <em>MYB28</em>, <em>MYB29</em> and <em>MYB76</em> genes with exons given as black boxes and 5′UTR, 3′UTR and introns given as black lines. The T-DNA insertion site in <em>myb28-1</em> is located in the 5′UTR, the T-DNA insertion sites in <em>myb29-1</em> and <em>myb29-2</em> are located in the third exon and 5′UTR, respectively, and the T-DNA insertions of <em>myb76-1</em> and <em>myb76-2</em> are located in the first exon and first intron, respectively. Arrows marked F and R show the approximate positions of the primers used for RT-PCR. B. Steady state foliar mRNA transcript levels of <em>MYB28</em>, <em>MYB29</em> and <em>MYB76</em> and various aliphatic biosynthetic genes in wild-type Col-0, <em>myb28-1</em>, <em>myb29-1, myb29-2</em>, <em>myb76-1</em> and <em>myb76-2</em> and <em>myb28-1 myb29-1</em> mutants as measured by RT-PCR in 23-25 days old plants. Each mutant is displayed with its corresponding wild-type. A PCR for actin was used as a loading control. Amplification was shown to be in the logarithmic phase. C.
