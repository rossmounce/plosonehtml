                Figure 7.  Characterization by RT-PCR of transcript levels in myb28-1, myb29-1, myb29-2, myb76-1, myb76-2 and myb28-1 myb29-1 mutants.A. Diagram of the MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76 genes with exons given as black boxes and 5′UTR, 3′UTR and introns given as black lines. The T-DNA insertion site in myb28-1 is located in the 5′UTR, the T-DNA insertion sites in myb29-1 and myb29-2 are located in the third exon and 5′UTR, respectively, and the T-DNA insertions of myb76-1 and myb76-2 are located in the first exon and first intron, respectively. Arrows marked F and R show the approximate positions of the primers used for RT-PCR. B. Steady state foliar mRNA transcript levels of MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76 and various aliphatic biosynthetic genes in wild-type Col-0, myb28-1, myb29-1, myb29-2, myb76-1 and myb76-2 and myb28-1 myb29-1 mutants as measured by RT-PCR in 23-25 days old plants. Each mutant is displayed with its corresponding wild-type. A PCR for actin was used as a loading control. Amplification was shown to be in the logarithmic phase. C. Steady state foliar mRNA transcript levels of MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76 and various aliphatic biosynthetic genes in wild-type Col-0 and the myb28-1 myb29-1 mutant as measured by RT-PCR in 25 days old plants. A PCR for actin was used as a loading control. Amplification was shown to be in the logarithmic phase.
