                Figure 8.  The effects of myb28-1 myb29-1 Double Mutant on Glucosinolate Accumulation.Homozygous wild-type, homozygous single mutant or homozygous double mutant progeny were measured for foliar and seed glucosinolates by HPLC. 12 independent plants were separately measured per line for the four lines and the data analyzed via ANOVA (Table S14, S15, S16 and S17). Data for 4MSB, 8MSO, total aliphatic and total indolic glucosinolate content are shown. Genotypes with different letters show statistically different glucosinolate levels for the given glucosinolate.
