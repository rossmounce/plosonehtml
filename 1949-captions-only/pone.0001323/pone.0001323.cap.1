                Figure 1.  Decoupling the task and stimulus specificity of positional learning.Schematic illustrations of each of the task and stimulus configurations used in the experiment are shown in the green boxes. In each case, the black arrow indicates the spatial axis of the required positional judgement. To characterise the specificity of perceptual learning, subjects' performance was measured on all four task-configuration combinations before and after they received training on one of them. In principle, trained improvements in performance on particular task-configuration combinations could be tightly coupled to the task (dashed blue lines), the stimulus configuration (dashed red line) or the spatial axis of the judgement (dashed black lines).
