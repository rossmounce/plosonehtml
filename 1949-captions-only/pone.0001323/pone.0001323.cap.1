In each case, the black arrow indicates the spatial axis of the required positional judgement. To characterise the specificity of perceptual learning, subjects' performance was measured on all four task-configuration combinations before and after they received training on one of them. In principle, trained improvements in performance on particular task-configuration combinations could be tightly coupled to the task (dashed blue lines), the stimulus configuration (dashed red line) or the spatial axis of the judgement (dashed black lines).</p>
