                Figure 2.  Quantifying positional learning.Example individual results are shown for a typical subject trained on the horizontal bisection task. a) A comparison of psychometric functions obtained on the first and last day reveals negligible learning at the smallest stimulus separation (4 deg). b) In contrast, a noticeable steepening of the psychometric function is evident at the largest stimulus separation (29 deg), indicating a learned improvement in task performance. c) Positional thresholds derived from the individual's psychometric functions, plotted as a function of session for the two extreme stimulus separations.
