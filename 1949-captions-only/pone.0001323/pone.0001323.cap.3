                Figure 3.  Positional learning for each task and stimulus configuration.Mean positional thresholds obtained on the first and last days for groups trained on a) vertical alignment, b) vertical bisection, c) horizontal alignment and d) horizontal bisection. Learned improvements in task performance are consistently seen for large, but not small, stimulus separations. Error bars are SEM.
