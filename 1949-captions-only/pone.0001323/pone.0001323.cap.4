Trained improvements in performance did not transfer to different configurations (dashed blue line) or tasks (dashed red line), but did transfer between task-configuration combinations when there was common spatial axis to the judgement (dashed black line). For comparison, the solid green line shows averaged learned improvements obtained within each task-configuration combination. Error bars are SEM.</p>
