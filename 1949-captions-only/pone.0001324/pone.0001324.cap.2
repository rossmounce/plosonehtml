For each breed, a dendogram is drawn in which each vertical line represents a single dog. The two clusters are represented in blue and red, and grey dashed lines indicate outlier dogs. Below the dendogram, dogs are named by geographical origin (US or EU), and names are colored upon their cluster assignment. The scale on the right axis represents the genetics distances calculated by PLINK software.</p>
