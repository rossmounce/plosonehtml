                Figure 3.  Effect of EAK16-II concentration on the surface coverage of peptide assemblies on mica.AFM images of EAK16-II-modified mica surfaces at 10 min incubation in solutions with various peptide concentrations: (a) 1 µM; (b) 2 µM; (c) 4 µM; (d) 8 µM; (e) 12 µM. Surface coverage of EAK16-II nanofibers on mica as a function of peptide concentration is plotted in panel (f). Proposed molecular arrangement of EAK16-II assembly on mica is plotted in panel (g). Each image corresponds to a scan area of 2000 nm×2000 nm.
