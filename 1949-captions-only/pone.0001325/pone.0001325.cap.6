                Figure 6.  Proposed model of EAK16-II assembly on HOPG.(a) Schematic representation showing the orientation of assembled EAK16-II strands; (b) AFM image of EAK16-II on HOPG surface over a scan area of 1000 nm√ó1000 nm; the inset shows the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the AFM image and characteristic 6-fold symmetry.
