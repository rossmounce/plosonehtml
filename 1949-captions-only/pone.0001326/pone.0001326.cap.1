The map was assembled according to Cartwright et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Cartwright1">[113]</a>. On the left are marker names and positions, in centimorgans, from Troggio et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Troggio1">[15]</a> (<a href="http://genomics.research.iasma.it">http://genomics.research.iasma.it</a>). Most metacontigs were anchored to the map using markers with unique sequence locations: SSRs, BAC-end sequences and SNP-based markers derived from either ESTs or assembled sequences of the two haplotypes of the Pinot Noir genome. Metacontigs without bridge markers were anchored based on their association to other metacontigs (details in <a href="#s3">Materials and Methods</a>). Approximate size in Kb of each metacontig is indicated on the right. Gaps separating metacontigs are of undefined size.</p>
