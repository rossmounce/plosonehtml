                Figure 2.  Comparison of four plant genomes based on gene homology.All genes were compared each other as all-vs-all similarity searches using BLAST. Genes predicted for poplar, Arabidopsis and rice are respectively from www.genome.jgi-psf.org; www.arabidopsis.org; www.tigr.org. Grape gene estimates have been carried out on 58,611 assembled contigs. Genes of similar length with over 60% of similarity alignments at protein level were considered homologous using BLOSUM62 matrix [123]. The frequencies of sequences shared among species are reported on the right.
