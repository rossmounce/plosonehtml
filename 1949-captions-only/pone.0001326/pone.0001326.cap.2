Genes predicted for poplar, Arabidopsis and rice are respectively from <a href="http://www.genome.jgi-psf.org">www.genome.jgi-psf.org</a>; <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">www.arabidopsis.org</a>; <a href="http://www.tigr.org">www.tigr.org</a>. Grape gene estimates have been carried out on 58,611 assembled contigs. Genes of similar length with over 60% of similarity alignments at protein level were considered homologous using BLOSUM62 matrix <a href="#pone.0001326-Henikoff1">[123]</a>. The frequencies of sequences shared among species are reported on the right.</p>
