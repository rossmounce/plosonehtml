                Figure 3.  Chromosomal organization of disease resistance genes of V. vinifera.A) Phylogenetic analysis of NBS-LRR protein sequences of V. vinifera present in Pinot Noir. The phylogeny of these genes is based on a distance-matrix neighbour-joining analysis (Clustal X, [124]; bootstrap of 1000) after alignment of sequences by TCoffee (version 5.05, [125]). The phylogenetic clades, in general, correspond to the classification based on protein domains (however, see text and Table S3). B) Genes assigned to LGs are represented by dots. Their gene number is specified in LG-specific insets and in Table S3. NBS clades (see A above) contain mainly genes of the following classes: (1) TIR-NBS-LRR in blue; (2) CC-NBS-LRRa in green; (3) CC-NBS-LRRb in yellow; (4) NBS-LRR in cyan; (5) CC-NBS-LRR in red. Other resistance genes, belonging to NBS and TIR-NBS groups, are represented by the open and filled dots, respectively. Resistance-related genes different from NBS genes are shown in black. The size of each LG is given in Mb (on the right), whereas markers of the genetic map ([15] and http://genomics.research.iasma.it) are shown on the left, together with the interval in cM between the two closest markers in each gene cluster.
