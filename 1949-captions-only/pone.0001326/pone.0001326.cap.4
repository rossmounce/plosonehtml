                Figure 4.  V. vinifera pathways for phenolic and terpenoid biosynthesis.A) V. vinifera general pathway for phenolics biosynthesis leading to stilbenes (C6-C2-C6) and flavonoids (C6-C3-C6). For each enzyme, the gene copy number is reported in brackets. Genes were identified by similarity search using BLAST where the references were the sequences of phenolic biosynthetic genes previously characterized in grape and in other plant species. Putative homologues and gene copy numbers were determined by comparing aligned amino acid sequences based on a threshold of 80% similarity between the grape sequences, and 60% similarity between grape and other species. For the large StSy, PAL and F3'5'H families, phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA4 package [126] after aligning with ClustalW [127]. The following enzymes involved in the pathway are shown: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; StSy, stilbene synthase; RSGT, resveratrol glucosyltransferase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3'H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3'5'H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; FLS, flavonol synthase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; ACCase, acetyl CoA carboxylase. PA refers to proanthocyanidins. Enzymatic steps that have not been experimentally confirmed are marked with an asterisk (*). B) Steps of plastidic isoprenoid pathway and monoterpenoids biosynthesis. For each enzyme, the gene copy number is reported in brackets. Gene annotation was performed as described in Material and methods.
