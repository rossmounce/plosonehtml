Different colours of the histograms corresponds to the different TF classes. B) Distribution of transcription factor clusters over the grape genome. TF organization in LGs 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17 is presented. For each LG, markers of the genetic map, developed by Troggio et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Troggio1">[15]</a> (see also <a href="http://genomics.research.iasma.it">http://genomics.research.iasma.it</a>) are reported on the left together with the interval in cM between the two closest markers for each TF cluster. TF types are reported on the right.</p>
