                Figure 5.  Distribution of transcription factors along the 19 V. vinifera LGs.A) Distribution of 1,617 transcription factors along the 19 V. vinifera LGs inferred from the positions of anchored metacontigs. Different colours of the histograms corresponds to the different TF classes. B) Distribution of transcription factor clusters over the grape genome. TF organization in LGs 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17 is presented. For each LG, markers of the genetic map, developed by Troggio et al. [15] (see also http://genomics.research.iasma.it) are reported on the left together with the interval in cM between the two closest markers for each TF cluster. TF types are reported on the right.
