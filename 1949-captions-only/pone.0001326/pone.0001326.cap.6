                Figure 6.  Scatter plot of the distribution of V. vinifera transcription factors.For each of the 60 families (1983 genes) of V. vinifera TFs (X-axis) (log base 2 transformed), family members have been plotted against the corresponding number reported for three other genomes: A) A. thaliana (http://arabtfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v1.1), B) P. trichocarpa (http://poplartfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v2.​0) and C) O. sativa (http://ricetfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v2.i). The degree of the correlation among TF gene numbers is indicated by the Pearson correlation value (r). Each scatter plot shows the TF families which were statistically over- or under- represented in pair-wise comparisons (χ2 tests were applied to untransformed data; p = 0.05).
