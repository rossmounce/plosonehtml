Above: the 188 kb region; below: the 215 kb region. I from contig groups 1030-H15, 1079-G03, 2068-K04, 1034-C17 and II 2010-J07, 2044-L11, 1030-N10. In the genetic map the two regions are positioned at 60.1 cM: see preliminary experiment in Text S1. TE elements are labeled as follows: c: Copia; g: Gypsy/gypsy; a: Gypsy/athila; d: hAT/Dart; k: Karma; h: hAT; m: Mutator. B) SNP profiles of the 19 LGs of <em>V. vinifera</em>. Left and right of the figure correspond respectively to top and bottom of LGs of Troggio et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Troggio1">[15]</a>. The SNP values reported do not consider gaps in and among metacontigs. C) SNPs in exons and non-coding DNA and percentage of anchored genes tagged with SNPs. In parts B to E of this figure, gene prediction and annotation and the exon-intron boundaries were based on the methods described in Solovyev et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Solovyev1">[114]</a>; Korf et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Korf1">[101]</a>; Majoros et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Majoros1">[115]</a>; Altschul et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Altschul1">[116]</a>; Huang and Madan <a href="#pone.0001326-Huang1">[117]</a>. D) Relative age of grape duplicated genes estimated from the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites (K<sub>S</sub> values). The peak between 0.6 and 1.2 KS supports a relatively large scale duplication event. Paralog genes were identified as in Li et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Li1">[120]</a> and K<sub>S</sub> distributions were calculated as in Maere et al. <a href="#pone.0001326-Maere1">[105]</a>. E) The same as in D for genes present in duplicated chromosome segments.</p>
