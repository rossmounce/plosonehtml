                Figure 7.  Features of the Pinot Noir heterozygous genome.A) Comparison of constrasting haplotypes (a and b) co-mapping at two almost contigous regions in metacontig 32,921 of chromosome 1. Above: the 188 kb region; below: the 215 kb region. I from contig groups 1030-H15, 1079-G03, 2068-K04, 1034-C17 and II 2010-J07, 2044-L11, 1030-N10. In the genetic map the two regions are positioned at 60.1 cM: see preliminary experiment in Text S1. TE elements are labeled as follows: c: Copia; g: Gypsy/gypsy; a: Gypsy/athila; d: hAT/Dart; k: Karma; h: hAT; m: Mutator. B) SNP profiles of the 19 LGs of V. vinifera. Left and right of the figure correspond respectively to top and bottom of LGs of Troggio et al. [15]. The SNP values reported do not consider gaps in and among metacontigs. C) SNPs in exons and non-coding DNA and percentage of anchored genes tagged with SNPs. In parts B to E of this figure, gene prediction and annotation and the exon-intron boundaries were based on the methods described in Solovyev et al. [114]; Korf et al. [101]; Majoros et al. [115]; Altschul et al. [116]; Huang and Madan [117]. D) Relative age of grape duplicated genes estimated from the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites (KS values). The peak between 0.6 and 1.2 KS supports a relatively large scale duplication event. Paralog genes were identified as in Li et al. [120] and KS distributions were calculated as in Maere et al. [105]. E) The same as in D for genes present in duplicated chromosome segments.
