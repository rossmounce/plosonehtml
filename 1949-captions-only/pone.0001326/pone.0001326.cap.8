                Figure 8.  Scenario of angiosperm genome evolution.Alternative scenario to the one proposed by Jaillon et al. [7] to explain angiosperm genome evolution. Our analyses seem to suggest that there has been a large-scale duplication event, likely a hybridization event, in the Vitis lineage, rather than before the split of Vitis and other dicots.
