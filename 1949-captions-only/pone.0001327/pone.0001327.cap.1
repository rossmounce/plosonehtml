                Figure 1.  Individually recorded RBCs display an Ih–like current.A, Perforated–patch clamp recording in the retina slice of an RBC. Dim flashes of green light delivered at the cell's response threshold evoke highly variable depolarizing potentials in current–clamp (constant flash intensity, 6 ms flash duration, 4 s inter–flash interval, 20 consecutive episodes). Evidence for a quantal nature of these responses can be seen in the distribution of their peak amplitudes (histogram shows binned data from 79 flash episodes). B, The same RBC stained with LY at the end of the experiment. C, Voltage–clamp protocol applied to this RBC shows the progressive activation of a slow inward Ih–like current in response to increasingly hyperpolarizing voltage steps, from a holding potential of −63 mV (black traces). The model of eqs. 1–2 (red traces) provides a very good fit of the experimental records with parameters Gh = 0.144 nS, V0.5 = −89.5 mV, km = 5.0 mV, taumax = 510 ms; Gleak = 0.340 nS. D, In the same neuron, a voltage–clamp protocol of increasingly depolarizing steps from a holding potential of −74 mV, reveals an outward current with slow activation time course (traces with stars). At potentials above about −40 mV a larger current appears, with fast activation and slow inactivation kinetics. Experimental traces in C and D are averages of 11 and 10 trials, respectively. Stimulation artifacts are trimmed.
