                Figure 2.  The Ih blocker ZD7288 has high affinity and specificity for the hyperpolarization–activated current.Perfusion of the organic drug abolished almost entirely the putative Ih current already at a concentration of 1 µM (inset traces, averages of 4, were obtained with the voltage–clamp protocol of hyperpolarizing steps shown at the top). The specificity of its action can be appreciated on the I–V plot, which shows current amplitudes measured at the end of the voltage steps of two different protocols (see also Results and Figure 1), one targeted for inward currents (hyperpolarizing steps) and the other for outward currents (depolarizing steps). After about 25 min (empty circles) ZD7288 strongly reduced the currents activated below −80 mV, compared to control conditions (full circles). The residual current includes an ohmic leakage. Plot displays means and standard errors.
