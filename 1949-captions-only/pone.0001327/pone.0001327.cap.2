The specificity of its action can be appreciated on the I–V plot, which shows current amplitudes measured at the end of the voltage steps of two different protocols (see also Results and <a href="#pone-0001327-g001">Figure 1</a>), one targeted for inward currents (hyperpolarizing steps) and the other for outward currents (depolarizing steps). After about 25 min (empty circles) ZD7288 strongly reduced the currents activated below −80 mV, compared to control conditions (full circles). The residual current includes an ohmic leakage. Plot displays means and standard errors.</p>
