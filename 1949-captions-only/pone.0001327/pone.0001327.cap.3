A, RBC subjected to negative current steps from rest displayed voltage overshoots at step onset—a classical hallmark of I<sub>h</sub>. B, The frequency response of another RBC was explored with sinusoidal current stimuli of constant amplitude but modulated in frequency (0.1 to 30 Hz; top trace). When the stimulus was delivered at −75 mV the amplitude of the cell's voltage response decreased progressively with increasing frequency. At two more hyperpolarized potentials, on the other hand, the peak response occurred in the middle of the stimulus, at an intermediate frequency. Traces are averages of 6–9 sweeps. C, Graphs show, as a function of frequency, the modulus of input impedance computed from sinusoidal stimulus–response pairs (noisy black traces; see <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>). A selection from several RBCs, and covering a range of potentials, is presented in a–e. Band–pass behavior is clear–cut in a–c and in e. The membrane potential and a band–pass index i<sub>BP</sub> (see <a href="#s3">Results</a>) are given for each graph. Band–pass impedance profiles at −82 mV and more negative (a–c) are predicted by a simplified theoretical model of each RBC, which includes passive properties and I<sub>h</sub> as the only active current (see <a href="#s3">Results</a>). Theoretical impedance profiles (red traces) were derived by linearizing the model (see <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>) and thus apply to small input signals. D, Summary of data from all RBCs in the form of i<sub>BP</sub> versus tested potential (circles). Band–pass behavior is expressed &lt;−75 mV and &gt;−70 mV. The average i<sub>BP</sub> predicted by all RBC theoretical models (red curve) shows that, negative to −75 mV, the observed frequency tuning is fully explained by I<sub>h</sub>, while above −70 mV some other current must come into play. E, Summary of resonant (peak response) frequency data from all RBCs (circles). The models correctly predict, in a wide potential range centered around I<sub>h</sub> half–activation, an average value of about 1 Hz (red curve).</p>
