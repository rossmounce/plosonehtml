                Figure 4.  Blocking Ih converts the impedance profile of RBCs from band–pass to low–pass.Left column, Impedance profile of an RBC measured at Vdark, Vdark−10 mV and Vdark−20 mV in control and during a nearly complete blockade of Ih with 1 µM ZD7288. At −85 mV and −95 mV ZD7288 greatly enhanced the cell's response to low–frequency input, converting its behavior from band–pass to low–pass one. This effect was less prominent but also present at the −75 mV (Vdark). Impedance profiles obtained from average of 4–9 sinusoidal response sweeps. Right column, Impedance profiles predicted by a simplified model of the same RBC (see Figure 3C, legend) match rather well the experimental ones, except at −75 mV in ZD7288. The mismatch at this potential may be due to some activation of the current behind the upper range of band–pass behavior (cf. Figure 3D). ZD7288 was simulated by setting Gh to zero. Detailed parameters used in modeling this cell were Gh = 0.395 nS, V0.5 = −90.5 mV, km = 5.5 mV, taumax = 330 ms, Gleak = 0.150 nS, C = 25 pF.
