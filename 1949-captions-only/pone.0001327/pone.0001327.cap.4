At −85 mV and −95 mV ZD7288 greatly enhanced the cell's response to low–frequency input, converting its behavior from band–pass to low–pass one. This effect was less prominent but also present at the −75 mV (V<sub>dark</sub>). Impedance profiles obtained from average of 4–9 sinusoidal response sweeps. <em>Right column</em>, Impedance profiles predicted by a simplified model of the same RBC (see <a href="#pone-0001327-g003">Figure 3C, legend</a>) match rather well the experimental ones, except at −75 mV in ZD7288. The mismatch at this potential may be due to some activation of the current behind the upper range of band–pass behavior (cf. <a href="#pone-0001327-g003">Figure 3D</a>). ZD7288 was simulated by setting <em>G<sub>h</sub></em> to zero. Detailed parameters used in modeling this cell were <em>G<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.395 nS, <em>V<sub>0.5</sub></em> = −90.5 mV, <em>k<sub>m</sub></em> = 5.5 mV, <em>tau<sub>max</sub></em> = 330 ms, <em>G<sub>leak</sub></em> = 0.150 nS, <em>C</em> = 25 pF.</p>
