                Figure 5.  Ih quickens the dim flash response of RBCs and sharpens the detection of event coincidence.A, The band–pass filtering of RBCs operates not only on pipette–injected current, but also on light–evoked input. On the left, post–synaptic current (PSC) evoked by dim flash (3× threshold) recorded in voltage–clamp (−86 mV holding, average of 79). The same PSC was fed to the simplified model (see Figure 3C, legend) of the RBC under study (linearized at −84 mV, iBP = 1.47). On the right (red trace), the predicted trajectory of post–synaptic potential (PSP) matches the one recorded in current–clamp with the same flash (black trace; membrane potential set at −86 mV by current injection, average of 61). B1, Flash–evoked PSPs predicted by the model at two different membrane potentials in control, and after removing Ih (by setting Gh to 0). In the presence of Ih, peak amplitude is reduced and the return to baseline is anticipated. B2, The latter remains true even after normalizing PSP amplitudes. Thus, the ‘price’ paid in terms of response amplitude reduction by expressing Ih, is more than offset by a faster response of the RBC. C, Graph shows the amplitude of a second dim flash response following a first one with a brief delay (same flash strengths), as predicted by the model at −86 mV in control and after removing Ih. Response amplitude is normalized to that of the same flash given in isolation. Inset shows the normalized voltage trajectories evoked by two flashes 0.45 s apart. For a duration of several hundred ms (indicated by a gray bar) Ih converts temporal summation of near–coincident flash responses (graph values&gt;1) to attenuation (graph values&lt;1).
