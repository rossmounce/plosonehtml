I<sub>h</sub> kinetics is markedly and significantly faster (* is p&lt;0.05). Plot displays means and standard errors. B, The impedance profile of an RBC at 35°C (orange trace, −89 mV) displays a resonance peak shifted above 3 Hz. A representative profile from a cell at 23°C (similar potential) is superimposed for comparison (blue trace). Amplitudes are normalized. C, Average dim flash–evoked PSC recorded in two voltage–clamped RBCs, one at 35°C (orange trace, average of 25) and the other at 23°C (blue trace, average of 60). Amplitudes are normalized. The inset shows that the two PSC trajectories overlap once a time–wise scaling factor of 0.3 is applied to the blue trace.</p>
