                Figure 7.  Correcting for the shunting effect of patch recording reveals the functional impact of Ih in unperturbed RBCs.The average dark membrane potential (Vdark) observed in RBCs was −74.7 mV. If one assumes that during these recordings the pipette seal resistance was in a realistic range of a few tens of GΩ, the true (unperturbed) average value of Vdark may be predicted (see Results). For any given finite seal resistance, the true Vdark will be more negative than the recorded one, due to the depolarization introduced by the seal during the experiment (thin line, right axis). Only in the hypothetical case of an infinite seal resistance would the two values coincide (small circle at top right of thin line). The true Vdark and the simplified cellular model may be used to predict the band–pass index (iBP) of the average unperturbed RBC in darkness. Assuming for our experiments plausible seal resistances of less than 30–40 GΩ leads us to conclude that, at the true Vdark of RBCs, Ih is active and endows them with marked band–pass behavior (thick line, left axis).
