If one assumes that during these recordings the pipette seal resistance was in a realistic range of a few tens of GΩ, the true (unperturbed) average value of V<sub>dark</sub> may be predicted (see <a href="#s3">Results</a>). For any given finite seal resistance, the true V<sub>dark</sub> will be more negative than the recorded one, due to the depolarization introduced by the seal during the experiment (thin line, right axis). Only in the hypothetical case of an infinite seal resistance would the two values coincide (small circle at top right of thin line). The true V<sub>dark</sub> and the simplified cellular model may be used to predict the band–pass index (i<sub>BP</sub>) of the average unperturbed RBC in darkness. Assuming for our experiments plausible seal resistances of less than 30–40 GΩ leads us to conclude that, at the true V<sub>dark</sub> of RBCs, I<sub>h</sub> is active and endows them with marked band–pass behavior (thick line, left axis).</p>
