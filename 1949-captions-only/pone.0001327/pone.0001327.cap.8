Labeling is present in rod inner segments (IS), outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer (OPL) and inner plexiform layers (IPL). B, HCN2 are particularly evident in the OPL, but also weakly present in the external aspect of the IPL (left panel). Note that both the HCN1 and HCN2 stains were abolished by pre–incubation of the primary antibodies with their respective immunizing peptides (right panels). C, Double staining shows HCN1 subunits (green) together with RBCs labeled with mouse anti–PKC antibody (red). HCN1 do not seem to colocalize in any significant way with RBCs. D, The striking expression of HCN2 in small spots within the OPL (green), is strongly suggestive of a close association with the stubby dendrites of RBCs (red). Scale bars 10 µm.</p>
