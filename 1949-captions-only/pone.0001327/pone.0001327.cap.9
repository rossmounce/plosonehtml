                Figure 9.  HCN2 concentrate at the tips of RBC dendrites, at sites of synaptic input from rods.A, Close–up view of the HCN1/PKC double staining. Further magnification of the field within the box is shown below. HCN1 express diffusely within the OPL, but do not colocalize with RBCs. B, Analogous close–up of an HCN2/PKC section shows that the channels' spotlike expression lines the tips of RBC dendrites. C, Double labeling with the postsynaptic receptor mGluR6 and PKC shows the same pattern observed with HCN2. D, Again, a similar arrangement is seen with the postsynaptically located shaker channel Kv1.3. E, Double labeling of HCN1 (green) and ribbon–contained Bassoon protein (red). HCN1 is clearly presynaptic. F, HCN2 (green) juxtapose with the arc–shaped ribbon complexes (red), in the same way as the postsynaptic mGluR6 (green in G) and Kv1.3 (green in H). Scale bars 10 µm.
