The contrast, c, is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of the light intensity modulation and the mean light intensity (3.04*10<sup>4</sup> effective photons per second and receptor). The light intensity values were drawn from a normal distribution and the sequences were lowpass filtered with a 2nd order Butterworth filter with 256 Hz cut-off. B Probability density of the 0.31 contrast stimulus with a Gaussian fit. C Typical responses of a photoreceptor to the contrast modulation illustrated in A [averages over 25 trials (dark colors)Â±the standard deviation (light colors)]. D Probability density functions of photoreceptor response (black dots and black labels on x-axis) and the response noise (red dots and red labels on x-axis) fitted with Gaussian functions.</p>
