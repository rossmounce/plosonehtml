                Figure 1.  Stimulus and response properties.A Stimulus traces of different contrasts. The contrast, c, is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of the light intensity modulation and the mean light intensity (3.04*104 effective photons per second and receptor). The light intensity values were drawn from a normal distribution and the sequences were lowpass filtered with a 2nd order Butterworth filter with 256 Hz cut-off. B Probability density of the 0.31 contrast stimulus with a Gaussian fit. C Typical responses of a photoreceptor to the contrast modulation illustrated in A [averages over 25 trials (dark colors)Â±the standard deviation (light colors)]. D Probability density functions of photoreceptor response (black dots and black labels on x-axis) and the response noise (red dots and red labels on x-axis) fitted with Gaussian functions.
