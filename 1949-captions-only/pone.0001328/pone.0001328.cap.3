For each recorded cell the Kullback-Leibler divergence was estimated at each instance of time and was subsequently averaged across time giving a single divergence value for each cell at each contrast level (see <a href="#s4">methods</a>). The plotted values are averages of these divergences across the 12 cells.</p>
