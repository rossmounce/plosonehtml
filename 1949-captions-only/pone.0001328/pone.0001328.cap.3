                Figure 3.  Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the contrast.Average Kullback-Leibler divergence Â±95% confidence interval at the different contrast (N = 12). For each recorded cell the Kullback-Leibler divergence was estimated at each instance of time and was subsequently averaged across time giving a single divergence value for each cell at each contrast level (see methods). The plotted values are averages of these divergences across the 12 cells.
