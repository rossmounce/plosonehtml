The history of each file is represented horizontally from left to right. At the time of ET (•), the total number of future reuses varies from one instrument to the other (here between 8 and 10). For example, instrument 4 was used for the first time on the infectious sCJD patient, and will be reused 9 times in subsequent patients. In contrast, instrument 6 is never reused after being contaminated. b–Flow chart of sCJD transmission and natural history in our model. The sCJD incubation period is divided into three phases: I, the infected individual is neither infectious nor symptomatic, II, the patient becomes infectious, but remains asymptomatic: this is the only period when iatrogenic transmission is possible. III, the patient is symptomatic and CJD has been diagnosed so that the patient MUST be treated with single-use instruments and will not infect others.</p>
