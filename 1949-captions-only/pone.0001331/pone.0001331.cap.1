                Figure 1.  Amount of viral RNA in the retina, 2 days post-inoculation.Total RNA was extracted from the eye. The number of TMEV negative-strand RNA copies was measured in each sample by real time RT-PCR. Negative-strand RNA is diagnostic of replication whereas positive-strand RNA can be residual inoculum. Each circle corresponds to a different mouse. There is no statistically significant difference of viral load between control and Wlds mice (p = 0.40, Mann-Whitney test).
