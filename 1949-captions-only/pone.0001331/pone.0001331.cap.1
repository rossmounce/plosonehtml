The number of TMEV negative-strand RNA copies was measured in each sample by real time RT-PCR. Negative-strand RNA is diagnostic of replication whereas positive-strand RNA can be residual inoculum. Each circle corresponds to a different mouse. There is no statistically significant difference of viral load between control and <em>Wld<sup>s</sup></em> mice (<em>p</em> = 0.40, Mann-Whitney test).</p>
