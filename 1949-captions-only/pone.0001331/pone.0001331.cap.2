                Figure 2.  Number of infected cells in the LGN, 4 days post-inoculation.Mice were inoculated intraocularly in one eye. Serial sections of the entire corresponding geniculate nucleus were stained with a fluorescent anti-viral capsid antibody. The total number of fluorescent neuron cell body was counted. Each circle corresponds to a different mouse. There is no statistically significant difference of viral load between control and Wlds mice (p = 0.61, Mann-Whitney test).
