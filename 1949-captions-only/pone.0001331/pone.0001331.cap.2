Serial sections of the entire corresponding geniculate nucleus were stained with a fluorescent anti-viral capsid antibody. The total number of fluorescent neuron cell body was counted. Each circle corresponds to a different mouse. There is no statistically significant difference of viral load between control and <em>Wld<sup>s</sup></em> mice (<em>p = </em>0.61, Mann-Whitney test).</p>
