Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). SMI32 staining was detected in wild type samples only. B: Electron microscopy. Swollen axons with disorganized cytoskeleton are present in wild type mice only (star); bar = 5 Âµm. Mice shown in A and B were sacrificed 3 days post inoculation. C: Frozen sections were stained for CNPase (oligodendrocytes) or GFAP (astrocytes) and for TMEV to determine the percentage of TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells which were CNPase<sup>+</sup>. No difference between wild type and <em>Wld<sup>s</sup></em> mice was found (<em>p</em> = 0.31, Mann-Whitney test). D: The same sections were used to measure the density of CNPase<sup>+</sup>, TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells (infected oligodendrocytes/mm<sup>2</sup>). No difference between wild type and <em>Wld<sup>s</sup></em> mice was found (<em>p</em> = 0.40, Mann-Whitney test). In C and D, each circle corresponds to a different mouse.</p>
