                Figure 3.  Phenotype of TMEV-infected optic nerves of wild type and Wlds mice.A: Longitudinal sections of optic nerves reacted with the SMI32 antibody (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). SMI32 staining was detected in wild type samples only. B: Electron microscopy. Swollen axons with disorganized cytoskeleton are present in wild type mice only (star); bar = 5 Âµm. Mice shown in A and B were sacrificed 3 days post inoculation. C: Frozen sections were stained for CNPase (oligodendrocytes) or GFAP (astrocytes) and for TMEV to determine the percentage of TMEV+ cells which were CNPase+. No difference between wild type and Wlds mice was found (p = 0.31, Mann-Whitney test). D: The same sections were used to measure the density of CNPase+, TMEV+ cells (infected oligodendrocytes/mm2). No difference between wild type and Wlds mice was found (p = 0.40, Mann-Whitney test). In C and D, each circle corresponds to a different mouse.
