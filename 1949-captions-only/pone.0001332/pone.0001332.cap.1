                Figure 1.  Inhibition of COX activity by compounds 7 and 15.The inhibition of COX enzyme activity was measured by the production of PGE2 in cultured mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells (CT26). While the COX activity is inhibited by the ester compound 15 (IC50 = 69 nM), it is completely unaffected by the amide compound 7. This typical experiment gave similar results in two additional trials. Shown are the chemical structures of compounds 7 and 15.
