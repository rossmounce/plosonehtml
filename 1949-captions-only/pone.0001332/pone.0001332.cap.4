                Figure 4.  Compound 13 inhibits Kv7.2/3 currents and enhances firing of peripheral DRG neurons.(A) Representative traces recorded from the same CHO cell before (left panel) and after (right panel) external application of compound 13 (25 µM). The membrane potential was stepped from −90 mV (holding potential) to +50 mV for 1.5 s pulse duration in 10 mV increments, followed by a repolarizing step to −60 mV. (B) Current density-voltage relations in the absence (empty squares) and presence of compound 13 (25 µM) (solid squares) (n = 6). (C) Representative rat DRG spiking discharge, evoked by a squared depolarizing current pulse (10 pA for 400 msec) before (control), during exposure to 1 µM compound 13 for 1, 2 and 3 min. (D) Representative trace of spontaneously spiking DRG neuron previously exposed (5 min) to 1 µM compound 13.
