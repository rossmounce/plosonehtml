The membrane potential was stepped from −90 mV (holding potential) to +10 mV for 1.5 s pulse duration in 10 mV increments, followed by a repolarizing step to −60 mV. (B) and (C) Cells were stepped from −90 mV to −50 mV every 30 sec for 1.5 sec pulse duration. Current traces were recorded from the same cell in the absence (control) and presence of 10 µM (B) and 50 µM (c) compound 15. (D) The percentage of the current recorded at −50 mV is shown in the presence of 10 µM and 50 µM compound 15 or in its absence, the latter being the control of 100% (n = 10; * p&lt;0.01). (E) The normalized conductance (G/Gmax) was plotted as a function of the test voltages, for control (open squares), 10 µM (solid squares) and 50 µM (diamonds) compound 15-treated cells. The activation curves were fitted using one Boltzmann function (n = 5). (F) The potency of compound 15 was determined by the extent of left-shift (ΔV<sub>50</sub>), plotted as a function of compound 15 concentration and fitted by a sigmoidal function yielding an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 22±1 µM (n = 5).</p>
