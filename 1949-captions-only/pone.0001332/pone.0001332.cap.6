                Figure 6.  Effect of compound 15 on activation and deactivation kinetics of Kv7.2/3 channels.(A) Activation kinetics were evaluated at −20 mV by determining t1/2 , the time value at which half of the current amplitude developed, in the absence or presence of 25 µM compound 15 (n = 4; * p&lt;0.02). (B) Representative normalized trace of current activation in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 15. (C) Representative normalized trace of current deactivation at −60 mV in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 15. (D) At −60 mV, deactivation kinetics were fitted by one exponential function and the time constant was measured in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 15 (n = 4; * p&lt;0.02).
