                Figure 7.  Compound 15 inhibits firing of hippocampal and peripheral DRG neurons.(A) Representative rat hippocampal spiking discharge, evoked by a squared depolarizing current pulse (100 pA for 400 msec) before (control), during exposure to 25 µM compound 15 and after washout (wash). (B) Resting membrane potential of DRG neurons before (control) and following exposure to 25 µM compound 15 (n = 13; * p&lt;0.01). (C) Representative solitary spike evoked in DRG neurons by 2 ms squared depolarizing current pulses (100–1100 pA in 100 pA increments) in the absence (control) or presence of 25 µM compound 15. (D) Number of spikes evoked by injecting squared depolarizing current pulses (75–200 pA for 400 ms) in hippocampal and DRG neurons in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 15 (n = 8; * p&lt;0.01). (E) Rheobase current necessary to inject (2 ms) into DRG neurons to evoke a solitary spike in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 15 (n = 12; * p&lt;0.01).
