(B) Representative experiment showing sIPSCs frequency as a function of time, before, during exposure to 25 µM compound 15 and after washout. (C) Effect of 25 µM compound 15 on normalized charge transfer, amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs (n = 7; * p&lt;0.01). (D) Representative traces of spontaneous EPSCs recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV, before (control), during exposure to 25 µM compound 15 and after washout (wash). (E) effect of 25 µM compound 15 on normalized burst duration, on frequency and charge transfer within bursts and on total (F) charge transfer of sEPSCs (n = 6; * p&lt;0.01). (G) Compound 15 protects from epileptic seizures induced by the MES generalized epilepsy model in mice (0.2 sec, 50 mA) with ED<sub>50</sub> of 12 mg/kg.</p>
