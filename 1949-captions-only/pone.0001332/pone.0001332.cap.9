The membrane potential was stepped from −90 mV (holding potential) to +40 mV for 1.5 s pulse duration in 10mV increments, followed by a repolarizing step to −60 mV. (B) The normalized conductance (G/Gmax) was plotted as a function of the test voltages, for control (open squares), 25 µM (solid squares) and 100 µM (empty circles) compound 6-treated cells. The activation curves were fitted using one Boltzmann function (n = 5). (C) The potency of compound 6 was determined by the extent of left-shift (ΔV<sub>50</sub>), plotted as a function of compound 6 concentration and fitted by a sigmoidal function yielding an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 14±2 µM (n = 5). (D) Representative rat DRG spiking discharge, evoked by a squared depolarizing current pulse (100 pA for 400 msec) before (control), during exposure to 25 µM compound 6 and after washout (wash). (E) Rheobase current necessary to inject (2 ms) into DRG neurons to evoke a solitary spike in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 6 (n = 8; * p&lt;0.01). (F) Number of spikes evoked by injecting squared depolarizing current pulses (75–200 pA for 400 ms) in DRG neurons in the absence and presence of 25 µM compound 6 (n = 12; * p&lt;0.01). (G) Resting membrane potential of DRG neurons before (control) and following exposure to 25 µM compound 6 (n = 7; * p&lt;0.01).</p>
