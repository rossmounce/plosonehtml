                Figure 1.  Experimental task.A subject was asked to select either a white or yellow square by pressing a button on the corresponding side. In the example shown here, if the subject chooses a white square at each step, a small amount of juice (0.8 ml) is delivered in two steps (2.5×2 = 5 sec). If the subject chooses a yellow square, four yellow choices (2.5×4 = 10 sec) must be repeated to obtain a larger amount of juice (3.2 ml). The position of the squares (left or right) was changed randomly at each step.
