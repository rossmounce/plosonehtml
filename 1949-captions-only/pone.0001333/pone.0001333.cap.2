Red to yellow coded voxels, correlated with reward prediction at shorter time scales, are predominantly located in the ventral part of the striatum (ventral putamen and nucleus accumbens), while the green to blue coded voxels, correlated with reward prediction at longer time scales, are located in the dorsal part of the striatum (dorsal putamen and caudate body).</p>
