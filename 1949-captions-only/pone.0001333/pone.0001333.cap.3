                Figure 3.  Effects of tryptophan levels on short- and long-term reward prediction in ventral and dorsal parts of the striatum.Bar plots show the regression coefficients (betas) of V(t) with γ = 0.6 (white bars) and 0.99 (gray bars) for the BOLD signals in the regions of interest (ROI) in the ventral (A) ((x, y, z) = (26, 0, −4) and (−26, 0, −8); see Table S2) and dorsal (B) ((x, y, z) = (24, 2, 22) and (−16, 2, 28)) parts of the striatum. Data shown are group averages (n = 12 subjects), and error bars represent standard errors. * significantly different from zero at P&lt;0.05 in a two-tailed one sample t-test.
