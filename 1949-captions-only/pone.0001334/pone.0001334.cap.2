                Figure 2.  Down-regulation of Cebpd mRNA requires Cebpb.Phosphorimage quantitation of Northern blot analyses of whole ovary total RNA from 5 week-old Cebpb null mice (KO) or litter mate controls (WT) treated for 2 days with PMSG followed by hCG for the indicated times. Expression levels of Cebpd were normalized to cyclophilin (Ppi) expression and are shown in arbitrary units (a.u.; mean±SEM; n = 3–4 mice per data point). **P = 0.01 by two-way ANOVA with follow-up comparisons among groups in the form of t-tests at each time point.
