Expression levels of <em>Cebpd</em> were normalized to cyclophilin (<em>Ppi</em>) expression and are shown in arbitrary units (a.u.; mean±SEM; n = 3–4 mice per data point). **<em>P</em> = 0.01 by two-way ANOVA with follow-up comparisons among groups in the form of <em>t</em>-tests at each time point.</p>
