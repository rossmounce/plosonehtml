                Figure 4.  CEBPD protein expression in mouse ovaries.(A) Immunohistochemistry for CEBPD in ovaries from wild-type (WT) or Cebpd null mutant (KO) mice at the indicated time points following hCG treatment. (B, C) Immunohistochemistry for CEBPD and alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) in wild-type ovaries harvested 3 h after hCG treatment. Solid arrows indicate theca layers (B), open arrows indicate stromal areas (C) expressing both CEBPD and ACTA2.
