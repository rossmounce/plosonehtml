(B) <em>Cebpd</em>-deficient females display regular estrous cycles. Two month-old <em>Cebpd</em> null females (KO, n = 5) and wild-type littermate controls (WT, n = 4) were mated to vasectomized, sterile males and monitored daily for the occurrence of vaginal plugs over a period of 40–50 days. The number of days between 19 plugs per group was averaged. (C) <em>Cebpd</em>-deficient females display normal progesterone levels. Progesterone levels were measured in serum from mice on day 5 of gestation (from experiment in <a href="#pone-0001334-g005">Fig. 5A</a>, n = 5 KO, 3 WT) or on day 5 of pseudopregnancy (from experiment in <a href="#pone-0001334-g005">Fig. 5B</a>, n = 5 KO, 4 WT).
