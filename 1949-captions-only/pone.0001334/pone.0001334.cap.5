                Figure 5.  Cebpd-deficient females exhibit normal reproductive functions (A) Cebpd-deficient females generate normal-sized litters.Two to three-month old females with wild-type Cebpd (WT, n = 10) or Cebpd null mutation (KO, n = 16) were mated, the male removed subsequent to recording of a vaginal plug, and the number of pups of the following litter were counted within 24 hours after birth. (B) Cebpd-deficient females display regular estrous cycles. Two month-old Cebpd null females (KO, n = 5) and wild-type littermate controls (WT, n = 4) were mated to vasectomized, sterile males and monitored daily for the occurrence of vaginal plugs over a period of 40–50 days. The number of days between 19 plugs per group was averaged. (C) Cebpd-deficient females display normal progesterone levels. Progesterone levels were measured in serum from mice on day 5 of gestation (from experiment in Fig. 5A, n = 5 KO, 3 WT) or on day 5 of pseudopregnancy (from experiment in Fig. 5B, n = 5 KO, 4 WT). Means±S.E.M. are shown.
