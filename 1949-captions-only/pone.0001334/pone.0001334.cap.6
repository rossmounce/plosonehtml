                Figure 6.  Normal gene expression pattern in Cebpd-deficient ovaries.Phosphorimage quantification of Northern blot analyses for the indicated genes of whole ovary total RNA from 5 week-old Cebpd null mice (KO) and litter mate controls (WT) treated for 2 days with PMSG followed by hCG for 4 hours. Expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin (Ppi) expression (a.u. = arbitrary units; meansÂ±SEM). Panel A: n = 6 WT, 8 KO; Panel B: n = 4 WT, 4 KO.
