                Figure 7.  Cebpd is overexpressed in theca cells from PCOS patients.Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results examining Cebpd mRNA expression in theca cells derived from four healthy women and four PCOS patients are shown. Expression levels were normalized by Gapdh values and the relative values are shown (a.u. = arbitrary units). The two-sample independent t-test, for which the values were transformed to their common logs, and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, both yielded a statistically significant difference at P&lt;0.03.
