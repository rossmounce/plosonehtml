Expression levels were normalized by <em>Gapdh</em> values and the relative values are shown (a.u. = arbitrary units). The two-sample independent <em>t</em>-test, for which the values were transformed to their common logs, and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, both yielded a statistically significant difference at <em>P</em>&lt;0.03.</p>
