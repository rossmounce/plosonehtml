                Figure 2.  Cytometric dot plots and ELISpot wells from a subject with active tuberculosis, demonstrating interferon (IFN)-γ synthesis in response to overnight incubation of induced-sputum with purified-protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD).Panel A: Proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-γ after incubation with no antigen (Ag) added. Panel B: Proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-γ after incubation with PPD. Panel C: ELISpot wells showing the IFN-γ T-cell response after incubation with no antigen added. Panel D: ELISpot wells showing the IFN-γ T-cell response after incubation with PPD.
