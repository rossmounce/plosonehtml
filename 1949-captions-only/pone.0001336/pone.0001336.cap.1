                Figure 1.  The experimental setup.(A) A side view. The subject is attached to the robotic manipulandum with a custom fitted thermoplastic cuff. An opaque plastic tabletop covers the manipulandum, arm and hand of the subject preventing any visual information of their location. Visual feedback of the targets and hand position are presented using a top mounted projector onto the plastic sheet. (B) A top view of the setup showing the targets displayed on top of the plastic cover. On this diagram the PFM and arm are shown visible through the material simply for illustration purposes. (C) The unstable divergent force field (DF). On the left, the force field is shown as a function of the hand position. On the right side, the forces applied to hand are shown for two slightly different paths to either side of the straight line joining the start and end targets. Small differences in the trajectory produce large differences in the forces applied to the hand. (D) The stable curl force field (CF). On the left, the force field is shown as a function of the hand velocity. On the right side, the forces applied to hand are shown for two slightly different paths to either side of the straight line joining the start and end targets. Small differences in the trajectory produce almost no difference in the forces applied to the hand.
