                Figure 2.  Initial and final movement trajectories.(A) Initial and final trajectories in the NF, DF and CF with visual feedback. (B) Initial and final trajectories in the NF, DF and CF without visual feedback. The first 5 movements and the last 5 movements during learning for subject 1 are shown. The black lines represent the 5 cm safety boundary implemented in the DF at which point the force field was turned off.
