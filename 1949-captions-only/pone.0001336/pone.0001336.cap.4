The mean value (dotted line) plus mean standard error (shaded areas) are shown for both vision and no-vision conditions. While the variability is higher in the no-vision condition throughout the movement this becomes most prominent towards the end of the movement. Times with a significant difference between the visual and non-visual conditions are indicated by the black (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) and red (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001) lines at the top of the figure (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). (B) Movements in the CF. The largest difference in the variability between the no-vision and vision conditions occurs at the end of the movement. (C) Movements in the DF. No significant differences were found. (D) Uncorrected <em>p</em>-values for the paired t-tests performed for each of the three force fields. The uncorrected <em>p</em> = 0.05 level is indicated with the thin dotted line.</p>
