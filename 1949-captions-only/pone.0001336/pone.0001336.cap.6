                Figure 6.  Endpoint Stiffness for all eight subjects (S1-S8) under all conditions represented as an ellipse.Visual conditions are shown in red while non-visual conditions are shown in blue. The NF stiffness ellipse is shown with the light filled ellipse, the DF stiffness ellipse is shown with the solid line, and the CF stiffness ellipse is shown with the dashed line. The stiffness of the limb is measured in the middle of the movement.
