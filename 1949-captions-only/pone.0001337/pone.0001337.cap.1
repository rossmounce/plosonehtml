Abnormal mitoses. Tetraploid cells were stained to visualize chromosomes (Hoechst 33342, blue) and γ-tubulin (green). The arrow marks a misaligned chromosome. B. Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in tetraploid mitoses. Cells are stained to visualize chromosomes (blue), centromeres (CENP-B, red) and the SAC protein BubR1 (green). The white color results from the overlap of the three fluorescence signals, indicating recruitment of BubR1 to centromeres. C. Quantitation of the data obtained in A and B, comparing diploid and tetraploid cells in three independent experiments (X±SEM). D, E. p53 phosphorylation linked to abnormal mitoses. Representative examples of tetraploid cells that show incomplete cytokinesis, binucleation and micronucleation coupled to p53 phosphorylation on serine 15 (detected by immunofluoresence staining) are shown in D and quantified in E. F, G. Evidence for transcriptional activation of p53 in tetraploid cells. Diploid or tetraploid cells were transfected with dsRed (red fluorescence), a p53-inducible GFP construct (green fluorescence), and either empty vector only, a plasmid encoding for wild type p53 or dominant-negative p53 (H175) and then cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of the p53 inhibitor cyclic pifithrin-α. Cells were labeled with the vital stain DAPI and the frequency of transfected (dsRed-expressing) cells that express GFP was determined by cytofluorometry as shown in D for vector-only controls cultured in the absence of pifithrin. Representative results (X±SEM, n = 3) from three independent experiments are shown in E. Asterisks indicate significant (p&lt;0.01) differences between diploid and tetraploid cells.</p>
