                Figure 2.  Effect of Chk1 depletion on mitosis and p53 activation in tetraploid cells.A. Efficient Chk1 depletion after transfection with a specific siRNA. Tetraploid RKO cells were transfected with a Chk1-specific siRNA (Chk1a) or scrambled (SCR) control siRNA and the abundance of Chk1 was determined by immunobloting. GAPDH was detected to control equal loading. B–D. Videomicroscopic analyses of tetraploid cell division. Tetraploid RKO cells stably transfected with a histone H2B-GFP fusion construct (green fluorescence marking chromosomes) were transfected with a Chk1-specific siRNA (Chk1a) and monitored 48 h later for abnormal mitosis. Representative sequences of pictures in B illustrate normal mitosis (0), delayed mitotic exit resulting in apparently normal division (I), apoptotic disintegration of daughter cells after cytokinesis (II), abnormal metaphase plates leading to formation of binucleated cells (III), multipolar mitoses (IV) and apoptosis during or shortly after the metaphase (V). The frequency of mitotic aberrations observed in cells that were transfected with a control siRNA (SCR) or the Chk1-depleting siRNA was calculated after having monitored 150 to 200 mitoses (C) and the length of mitosis was computed (D). E, F. Premature mitosis in Chk1-depleted tetraploid cells. Thirty-six hours after transfection with control siRNA (SCR) or Chk1-depleting siRNA, diploid or tetraploid cells were stained to measure DNA content (with DAPI) and histone H3 phosphorylation, followed by cytofluorometric analysis. The rectangle in E marks the population of cells showing the phosphorylation of mitotic histone H3. Numbers refer to percentage of diploid or tetraploid cells with less than 4N or 8N, respectively, that manifest premature mitosis. The quantification is represented in F. (X±SEM, n = 3).
