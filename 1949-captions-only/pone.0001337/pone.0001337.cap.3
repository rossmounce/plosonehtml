                Figure 3.  Phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 in response to SAC inhibition.A, B. Abolition of SAC by Chk1 depletion. Tetraploid cells were either transfected with a scrambled control siRNA (SCR) or with a Chk1-specific siRNA and then subjected 48 h later to immunofluorescence to determine the centromeric location of BubR1 or Bub1 (as in Fig. 1B) as a sign of SAC activation. Note that depletion of Chk1 fully abolished SAC. C. p53 activation by Chk1 inhibition in diploid versus tetraploid cells. Cells treated with 15 µM cisplatin, a Chk1-depleting siRNA (or its control SCR) or the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 were stained 48 h later to detect p53 phosphorylation on serine 15. Cisplatin treatment was used as an internal positive control. D. Efficacy of siRNAs directed against SAC proteins, as determined by immunoblot, 48 hours after transfection. E. p53 phosphorylation on serine 15 after depletion of SAC proteins. (X±SEM, n = 3).
