                Figure 4.  Apoptosis induction by depletion of Chk1 in tetraploid HCT116 cells.A, B. Loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and viability induced by Chk1 depletion. Diploid (D) or tetraploid (T) cells were transfected with either of two siRNAs specific for Chk1 (Chk1a, Chk1b) or Chk2 (Chk2a, Chk2b) and stained 48 h later to measure ΔΨm (with DiOC6(3)) and viability (with PI). Representative FACS pictograms are shown in A and data are quantified in B. C, D. Apoptotic DNA loss induced by Chk1 depletion. Cells were stained with DAPI to measure DNA content, 24, 48 or 72 h after transfection with Chk1-depleting siRNA. Data shown in C have been obtained 48 h after transfection. The numbers in C refer to the percentage of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content. Inserts in D demonstrate siRNA-mediated Chk1 and Chk2 depletion, as detected by immunoblots. * p&lt;0.01 and ** p&lt;0.001 as compared to untreated or control siRNA-transfected (SCR) controls. Data represent the mean of three independent experiments in triplicate. (X± SEM).
