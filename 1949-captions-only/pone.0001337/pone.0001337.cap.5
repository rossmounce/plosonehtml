Chk1 inhibition by a dominant-negative (DN) Chk1 mutant. Diploid or tetraploid HCT116 cells were transfected with vector only (Co) or vectors encoding wild type (WT) or DN Chk1 or Chk2, together with a DsRed-encoding construct. 48 h later, cells were stained with DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) and the frequency of DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3)<sup>low</sup> cells was determined among the transfected (dsRed<sup>+</sup>) population. B–F. Chk1 inhibition by pharmacological agents. HCT116 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of UCN-01 (B,D) or SD1825 (C,D) and the frequency of dead and dying cells was measured by co-staining with DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) and PI (as in <a href="#pone-0001337-g003">Fig. 3A</a>). Alternatively, cells cultured on polylysin slides were stained for the simultaneous immunofluorescence detection of mitochondrial cytochrome <em>c</em> (Cyt <em>c</em>) release and caspase-3 activation (Casp-3a). Representative microfluorographs are shown in D and the frequency of cells showing diffuse Cyt <em>c</em> staining and caspase-3 activation are scored in E. Finally, phosphatidylserine exposure was measured in diploid and tetraploid RKO cells by annexin V-FITC staining (F). Asterisks denote significant (p&lt;0.01) effects of Chk1 inhibition. G, H. Preferential mortality of tetraploid cells subjected to SAC inhibition. Diploid or tetraploid cells were depleted from the indicated SAC proteins. Forty-eight hours later, apoptotic events were scored by measuring the frequency of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (with DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3)) and viability (with PI) (G) or sub-G1 cells (H). Columns represent the average of three independent experiments ±SEM.</p>
