Cytotoxic effects of Chk1 depletion in combination with cisplatin. Diploid (D) and tetraploid (T) HCT116 cells were knocked down for Chk1 (or transfected with control siRNA SCR) for 24 h and then cultured in absence or presence of cisplatin (20 µM) for further 48 h. Finally, the frequency of dying (DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3)<sup>low</sup> PI<sup>−</sup>) or dead (DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3)<sup>low</sup> PI<sup>+</sup>) cells was monitored by DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3)/PI staining. B. Cell killing by pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 plus cisplatin. Cells were cultured with cisplatin (20 µM), UCN-01 (500 nM) and/or SD1825 (500 nM) for 48 h, and dead and dying cells were determined as in A. C–E. Combined effects of Chk1 inhibition and cisplatin on tetraploid tumors established <em>in vivo</em>. Diploid or tetraploid HCT116 tumors were established <em>in vivo</em> and their growth was monitored continuously from day 18 (when tumors measured 125 to 250 mm<sup>3</sup>), when animals were injected with PBS alone (controls in C), cisplatin (D), UCN-01 (E), or with a combination of both (F). Asterisks indicate significant differences between diploid and tetraploid cells (p&lt;0.05, unpaired Student t test). The results shown in <a href="#pone-0001337-g006">Fig. 6C–E</a> are representative for three different experiments.</p>
