Hierarchical cluster analysis of 1411 gene expression profiles in the 6 experimental samples is shown. Each row represents the combination of two dye-swap experiments compared to untreated control cells and each column represents a single gene. Red and green colors indicate an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the expression of genes as compared to unstimulated control cells. B. Overview of the modification of gene expression by cisplatin and Chk1 inhibition in diploid and tetraploid cells (p value&lt;10<sup>âˆ’5</sup>).</p>
