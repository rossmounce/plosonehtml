                Figure 7.  Microarray analyses of the transcriptome of diploid (D) and tetraploid (T) HCT116 cells treated with cisplatin, Chk1 inhibitor or the combination of both.A. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 1411 gene expression profiles in the 6 experimental samples is shown. Each row represents the combination of two dye-swap experiments compared to untreated control cells and each column represents a single gene. Red and green colors indicate an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the expression of genes as compared to unstimulated control cells. B. Overview of the modification of gene expression by cisplatin and Chk1 inhibition in diploid and tetraploid cells (p value&lt;10âˆ’5).
