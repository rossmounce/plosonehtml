                Figure 2.  Loss of Id1 impairs generation of EPCs in the BM.A) Flow cytometric analysis of the EPC fraction of BM cells from wild type (WT) or Id1-/- mice. The profiles shown are representative of Lin- cells. The gates identified the Lin- c-kit+ Flk-1+ EPC population. The numbers indicate the average percentage±SEM of c-kit+ Flk-1+ in the Lin- fraction (n = 24, ***p&lt;0.001). B–C) Flow cytometric analysis of the endothelial specific markers VE-cadherin, CD13, AC133 (B) and the stem cell specific marker Sca-1(C) in the Lin- c-kit+ Flk-1+ population. The histograms represent the distribution of Lin- c-kit+ Flk-1+ stained with the specific marker indicated (red) or the isotype control (blue). The numbers indicate the average percentage±SEM of marker positive cells in the Lin- c-kit+ Flk-1+ fraction (n = 5). D) Quantitative real time PCR analysis of Id1 mRNA levels in sorted HSCs and Lin-cKit+Flk-1+ cells. The bars represent the fold change of Id1 mRNA levels in Lin-cKit+Flk-1+ cells relative to HSC levels. The results were normalized to HPRT expression and expressed as average fold change±SD (Lin-cKit+Flk-1+ 2.7±0.69 n = 4).
