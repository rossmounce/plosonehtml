                Figure 3.  Lin- cKit+Flk-1+ BM cells have endothelial properties.A) Schematic representation of the experimental procedure. B) Immunofluorescence on matrigel sections showing the incorporation of GFP+ Lin- c-kit+ Flk-1+ cells into vessels (arrowheads). Yellow and orange insets show magnification of GFP+ cells. Green: GFP; Red: VE-Cadherin; Blue: DAPI. Scale bar 50 Âµm.
