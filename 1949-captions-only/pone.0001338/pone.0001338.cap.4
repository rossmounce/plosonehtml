                Figure 4.  Id1 is necessary for the endothelial differentiation of BM stem cells.Flow cytometric analysis of EPCs in the peripheral blood of the indicated mice 4 weeks after transplantation of Lin- cKit+ Sca-1+ Flk-1- HSCs. The bars represent the average number or circulating EPCs (±SEM). per ml of blood. WT+WT HSCs: 0.105±0.002 (n = 3); WT+Id1-/- HSCs: 0.009±0.009 (n = 3); Id1-/-+WT HSCs: 0.077±0.034 (n = 4); Id1-/-+Id1-/- HSCs: 0.002±0.008 (n = 4).
