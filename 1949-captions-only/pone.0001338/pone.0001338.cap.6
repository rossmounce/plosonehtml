A–B) In vitro differentiation of sorted HSCs in response to cytokine stimulation. We monitored the acquisition of hematopoietic lineage markers and the simultaneous loss of expression of Sca-1 (A). The numbers represent the percentage of Lin<sup>low</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells remaining after 3 days in culture. The coupling of lineage differentiation with proliferation was analyzed by the progressive decrease in CFSE staining intensity with each cell division (B). The arrows correspond to each subsequent division, and the numbers represent the fraction of differentiated (Lin<sup>+</sup>) cells within each generation. The shown data is representative of three independent experiments. (C) Spleen colony forming assay using sorted Id1-/- HSCs cells. 500 sorted HSCs from the indicated groups of mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients, and spleen colonies were scored on day 8 post-transplant. Numbers indicate average colony numbers±SEM (WT 1.5±0.64 n = 4; Id1-/- 3.8±0.58 n = 5; Id1-/-p21-/- 0.5±0.28 n = 4; p21-/- 1±0.40 n = 4) D) Quantitative real time PCR analysis of c/EBPα mRNA levels in sorted HSCs. The bars represent the fold change of c/EBPα mRNA levels in Id1-/-, Id1-/-p21-/- and p21-/- mice relative to WT levels. The results were normalized to HPRT expression and expressed as average fold change±SD (Id1-/- 2.6±0.7; Id1-/- p21-/- 0.71±0.22; p21-/- 0.85±0.53 n = 2).</p>
