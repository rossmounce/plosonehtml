                Figure 1.  Immunoperoxidase stainings of acetone-fixed tumor cells on cytospins.Intracellular compartments of HT-29, 1106mel, Jurkat (A–C) and HeLa cells (D) were stained with NKp46-Ig, NKp44-Ig and NKp30-Ig fusion proteins as indicated. In (D), intracellular stainings of HeLa cells with the ER marker calnexin, the Golgi marker GM130, the early endosome marker EEA-1, and the late endosome marker LAMP-1 were performed in parallel for comparison with NCR-Ig staining pattern. A–C, ×150, D, ×250.
