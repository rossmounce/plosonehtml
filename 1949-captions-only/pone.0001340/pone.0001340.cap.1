                Figure 1.  Effects of intensified knockdown of LEDGF/p75 in SupT1 cells on the efficiency of lentiviral infection.A) and B) HIV luc activity was compared for wild-type SupT1 cells, SupT1 containing a control scrambled shRNA (SCRAM), and LEDGF/p75 knockdown (KD) cells. A) High multiplicity of infection (80 ng p24); B) Lower multiplicity of infection (20 ng p24). The designation “p24” indicates the amount of viral stock, measured by the weight of the p24 capsid antigen applied to cells. C) and D) EIAV infectivity was compared in the SupT1 cell set as assayed by quantitative PCR for viral cDNA: C) high multiplicity (100 µl stock), D) lower multiplicity (25 µl stock).
