                Figure 4.  EIAV integration site distributions in control and LEDGF/p75-knockdown SupT1 cells.Integration site distributions are shown relative to A) RefSeq genes, B) CpG islands (plus or minus 1 kb), C) relative G/C content (Integration sites from unmodified and knockdown cells were pooled and divided into 10 equal bins of increasing GC content, and sites in each cell type plotted for each bin), D) gene density, and E) relative gene expression intensity. For each value in A–B) and D), the measured value for the integration site population was divided by that of the matched random control to emphasize the departure of the experimental data from random. P values shown are based on regression analysis (A–C) or Chi Square test for trend (D–E).
