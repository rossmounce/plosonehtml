                Figure 9.  Correlation between LEDGF/p75 expression and the frequency of HIV integration in genes.Data is shown for 15 HIV integration site data sets in 10 cell types. The y-axis shows the percentage of integration events within transcription units of the “known gene” set of human genes for each integration site data set. The x-axis shows relative expression values for LEDGF/p75 derived from Affymetrix array data (see methods for details). The R-squared value for the fit is 0.6148 (P&lt;0.0001). The references for the data sets used are as follows: Macrophage 1 is the VSV-G set in [25]; Macrophage 2 is the CCR5 set in [25]; SupT1 [21]; IMR90 1 is the dividing set in [66]; IMR90 2 is the growth-arrested set in [66]; CD4 T [67]; PBMC [22]; Jurkat 1 is the Mse set in [46]; Jurkat 2 is the Avr set in [46]; Jurkat 3 is the initially bright set in [5]; Jurkat 4 is the initially dark set in [5]; Jurkat p75 knockdown [40],[46]; 293T [40]; 293T Scram [40]; 293T p75 knockdown [40].
