                Figure 1.  Five marine cyanobacteria from a range of ecological niches show distinct responses of photosystem II quantum yield (FV/FM), reflecting photosystem II activity, to a 10 fold irradiance increase episode followed by recovery under growth light.The high light episode is delineated by the dotted lines. Cultures were treated (closed) or not (open) with the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin to block photosystem II repair (n = 4, Â±1 s.e.). Note the strong recovery of photosystem II function in Synechococcus sp. RSS9917, and the lack of recovery in Prochlorococcus sp. SS120.
