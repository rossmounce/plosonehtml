Cultures were treated (closed) or not (open) with the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin to block photosystem II repair (n = 4, Â±1 s.e.). Note the strong recovery of photosystem II function in <em>Synechococcus</em> sp. RSS9917, and the lack of recovery in <em>Prochlorococcus</em> sp. SS120.</p>
