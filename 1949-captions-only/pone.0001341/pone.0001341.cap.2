                Figure 2.  Five marine cyanobacteria show comparable inhibition of Photosystem II plotted versus cumulative photon dose (µmol photons nm−2 s−1×s), when photosystem II repair is blocked (lincomycin treated cultures; n = 4, ±1 s.e.).Open triangle: Synechococcus RS9917; open circle: Synechococcus RCC307; open square: Synechococcus WH8102; open diamond: Prochlorococcus PCC 9511; closed triangle: Prochlorococcus SS120.
