                Figure 3.  The ability of five marine cyanobacteria strains to tolerate short-term increases in irradiance (ETOL) relates to the vertical light attenuation coefficient (k490) at their location of origin.Color bar indicates the 2006 annual average vertical attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, k490. Symbols indicate the origin of the strains sampled near the surface (open symbols) except for SS120 strain sampled at 120 meters (closed triangle).
