                Figure 4.  A trade-off between protein specific light capture capacity (protein specific σPSII) and tolerance of irradiance variations (ETOL) across five marine cyanobacteria.Prochlorococcus strains show a high protein specific σPSII, which varied 40-fold across the strains and shows a strong negative correlation with ETOL (µmol photons m−2 s−1), the capacity to tolerate upward irradiance fluctuations, which was highest in the coastal Synechococcus RSS9917 (n = 4, ±1 s.e.; r2 = 0.98).
