                Figure 1.  Bub1p is a relatively stable component of fission yeast kinetochores, whereas the bulk of Mad3p rapidly exchanges.(A) Bub1-GFP fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP): nda3 cells expressing Bub1-GFP were arrested in mitosis at 18°C and treated with anti-microtubule drugs (25 µg/ml carbendazim) to ensure the arrest was maintained. Specific GFP kinetochore signals were then photobleached with a laser, and images captured at intervals throughout the recovery period. The % fluorescence recovery and half-times indicated are the average of nine experiments. The recovery curve shown is representative, and the dashed line indicates the 50% post-bleach recovery level. (B) Mad3-GFP fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP): nda3 cells expressing Mad3-GFP were arrested in mitosis at 18°C and treated with anti-microtubule drugs (25 µg/ml carbendazim) to ensure the arrest was maintained. Specific GFP kinetochore signals were then photobleached with a laser, and images captured at intervals throughout the recovery period. The % fluorescence recovery and half-times indicated are the average of 5 experiments.
