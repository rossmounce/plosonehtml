Specific GFP kinetochore signals were then photobleached with a laser, and images captured at intervals throughout the recovery period. The % fluorescence recovery and half-times indicated are the average of nine experiments. The recovery curve shown is representative, and the dashed line indicates the 50% post-bleach recovery level.
