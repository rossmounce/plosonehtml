                Figure 2.  Bub1-(1-586)-GFP-Taz1Myb is targeted to telomeres.(A) A model of the Bub1-GFP-Taz scaffold protein (Bub1-Tel). (B) Field of bub1Î” cells expressing Bub1-Tel. (C) Anti-Bub1p immunoblot of extracts from strains expressing Bub1-GFP or Bub1-Tel. (D) Bub1-Tel co-localises with telomeres (Pot1-mRFP) and not kinetochores (Ndc80-CFP) in interphase cells. In mitotic cells the scaffold is recruited to both telomeres and kinetochores (data not shown). Scale bar is 5 microns.
