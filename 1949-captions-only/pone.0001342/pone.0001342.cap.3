(B) Bub1-Tel recruits and co-localises with Mad3-tdTomato at telomeres. Scale bars are 5 Âµm. (C) Quantitation of the co-localisation observed between checkpoint proteins and telomeres (Pot1), or kinetochores (Ndc80). Full co-localisation was scored when all of the telomere (or kinetochore) foci observed in a given cell co-localised with the Bub1-Tel <em>and</em> either Bub3p (grey columns) or Mad3p (red columns). See supplementary data (<a href="#pone.0001342.s001">Tables S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0001342.s002">S2</a>, <a href="#pone.0001342.s003">S3</a> and <a href="#pone.0001342.s004">S4</a>) for further details. (D) Speculative model of Bub1 scaffold action at a telomere (TEL). Note, due to low signal intensity, we have not yet demonstrated that Bub3p and Mad3p exchange rapidly at the telomeres.</p>
