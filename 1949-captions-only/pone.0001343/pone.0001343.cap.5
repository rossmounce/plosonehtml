Inhibition of synthesis of cell wall mycolic acids in different mycobacterial species by treatment with TAC or its analogue SRI-224.Autoradiogram of FAMEs and MAMEs extracted from exponentially growing cells that were radiolabeled in vivo with 14C-acetate. Drug concentrations are indicated in Âµg/ml. The different mycolates are indicated by arrows. Mycolic acid profiles from M. marinum (A) and from M. chelonae (B).
