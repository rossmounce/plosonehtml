                Figure 6.  In vivo identification and relative quantification of cis-cyclopropanes by 1H HR-MAS NMR.(A) Detail of 1H HR-MAS spectrum of control whole cells of M. bovis BCG. (B) Unidimensional selective COSY spectrum after irradiation of Ha signal showing 3J and 2J connectivities of cis-cyclopropyl ring Hb and Hc protons to Ha as depicted in (C). (D) Relative quantification by 1H HR-MAS NMR of cis-cyclopropanes based on differential integration of the Ha signals in control untreated cells (c) or cells treated with TAC-treated (1 µg/ml) (TAC) or SRI-224-treated (1 µg/ml) (224). Results are representative of two independent experiments.
