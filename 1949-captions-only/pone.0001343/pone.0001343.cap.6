(D) Relative quantification by <sup>1</sup>H HR-MAS NMR of <em>cis</em>-cyclopropanes based on differential integration of the Ha signals in control untreated cells (c) or cells treated with TAC-treated (1 µg/ml) (TAC) or SRI-224-treated (1 µg/ml) (224). Results are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
