                Figure 7.  Partial recovery of mycolic acid synthesis in the presence of TAC or SRI-224 in strains overexpressing the CMAS genes.Autoradiogram of FAMEs and MAMEs extracted from exponentially growing cells that were radiolabeled in vivo with 14C-acetate. (A) M. bovis BCG or (B) M. marinum containing the plasmid vector pMV261 or the same vector carrying cmaA2, mmaA2 or pcaA of M. tb H37Rv. Extracts were obtained from untreated control cells (c) or cells treated with 5 Âµg/ml of either TAC or SRI-224 as indicated. All other details are as in Figure 3.
