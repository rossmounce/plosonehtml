                Figure 1.  Weight loss curves during the 10 week hypocaloric diet.The two groups were defined as responders (i.e. subjects losing between 8â€“12 kgs) and non-responders (i.e. subjects losing less than 4 kgs). Weight was measured in at least 43 subjects at each weekly time point. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals (equal to 1.96 * standard deviation).
