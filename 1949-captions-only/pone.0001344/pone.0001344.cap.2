                Figure 2.  Distribution of the mean gene expression levels in responders and non-responders, computed from microarray measurements normalized with respect to the standard Gaussian distribution.Each spot represents the mean expression for a single gene. Dotted lines indicate the 95% confidence interval of the means (equal to 1.96 * standard deviation).
