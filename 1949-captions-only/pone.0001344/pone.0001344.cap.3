B. ALL patients (black squares) can be clearly separated from AML patients (red circles), apart from a single patient (identified by the green circle) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.795 and Q<sup>2</sup> = 0.622). R<sup>2</sup> explains the cumulative variation of the first two components and Q<sup>2</sup> indicates the variation explained by the model according to cross validation. Only a Q<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.5 indicates a good model.</p>
