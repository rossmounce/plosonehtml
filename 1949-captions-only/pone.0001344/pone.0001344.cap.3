                Figure 3.  A. Differentiating populations by PLS-DA.Global gene expression analysis in sub-cutaneous tissue reveals a separation trend between dietary responders (black squares) and non-responders (red circles); however, there is a significant overlap between the two populations (R2 = 0.547 and Q2 = âˆ’0.096). B. ALL patients (black squares) can be clearly separated from AML patients (red circles), apart from a single patient (identified by the green circle) (R2 = 0.795 and Q2 = 0.622). R2 explains the cumulative variation of the first two components and Q2 indicates the variation explained by the model according to cross validation. Only a Q2&gt;0.5 indicates a good model.
