The analysis was performed on RNA from summer monarchs (three 12-animals sets of head RNA collected during summer 2005) and on RNA from migratory monarchs (three 12-animal sets of head RNA collected during fall 2005, and three 12-animals sets of head RNA collected during fall 2006). Only the 2005 RNA from migratory butterflies was used for analysis of <em>single-minded</em> and <em>turtle</em> gene expression. The results were normalized with <em>rp49</em> and then averaged. The average level of each gene in the migrants was normalized to 1.0 for graphing. *** p&lt;0.001, ** p&lt;0.01, * p&lt;0.05</p>
