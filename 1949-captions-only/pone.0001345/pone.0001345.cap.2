                Figure 2.  Expression profiles of selected genes between summer and migratory butterflies.Relative expression of the mRNA levels of allatotropin, juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT), takeout, juvenile hormone (JH) epoxide hydrolase, foraging, single-minded, and turtle were examined by qPCR. The analysis was performed on RNA from summer monarchs (three 12-animals sets of head RNA collected during summer 2005) and on RNA from migratory monarchs (three 12-animal sets of head RNA collected during fall 2005, and three 12-animals sets of head RNA collected during fall 2006). Only the 2005 RNA from migratory butterflies was used for analysis of single-minded and turtle gene expression. The results were normalized with rp49 and then averaged. The average level of each gene in the migrants was normalized to 1.0 for graphing. *** p&lt;0.001, ** p&lt;0.01, * p&lt;0.05
