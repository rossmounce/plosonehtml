                Figure 3.  Na+/K+ ATPase in monarch butterflies.A. Electropherogram of valine codon in the BF01056B1B12.fl EST. B. Partial sequence of the Na+/K+ ATPase from the monarch, queen butterfly (Danaus gilippus), and sheep. H1 and H2 are transmembrane domains. The residues in bold in the sheep sequence have been shown by mutagenesis to confer ouabain resistance when mutated, and positions 111 and 122 are indicated [35]. The Monarch-EST sequence is from two EST clones (BF01056B1B12.fl &amp; BF01017B2C11.fl) from the monarch EST database. The Monarch-Previous sequence is the previously reported monarch sequence which has an amino acid change at one critical site (shown in red) [32], [34]. Both of the EST sequences have a second amino acid change at a second critical site (shown in green). The queen butterfly sequence has neither change [34].
