                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic relationship between different B. henselae STs as determined by eBURST.A clonal complex contains STs that have 7 out of 8 alleles in common. ST7 is assigned as a singleton since it differed in 3â€“7 alleles from all other STs. The size of the circles relates to the frequency of the corresponding ST, and illustrates that the assigned primary founder of the major clonal complex (ST5) is a common clone.
