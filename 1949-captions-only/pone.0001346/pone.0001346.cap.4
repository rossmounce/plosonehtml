                Figure 4.  Neighbour-joining tree of the concatenated sequences of B. henselae STs as reconstructed by MEGA4.1,000 bootstrap replicates were used to examine the confidence in the tree. The only node to score above 60 is the one leading to Group 1 (75%, as indicated), indicating that the delineation of Group 1 represents a real division in the B. henselae population.
