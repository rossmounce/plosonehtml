PPIs networks corresponding to (A) global human HF network, (B) BCAR1's PPI network, (C) AKT1's PPI network. All PPIs were retrieved from the HPRD. Up-regulated genes are represented by red nodes. Down-regulated genes are represented by green nodes. Known HF genes (KHFG) are represented by nodes in yellow. Other genes encoding interacting partner proteins are represented by nodes in purple, if they have a corresponding transcript, or in grey if they have no corresponding transcripts in the gene expression data set.</p>
