RA expedited the neural differentiation process that was often associated with extensive interconnections and lattice formation. (B, C). The differentiation was comparable in KO medium at 13 dpp with (E) or without (D) RA exposure. The EBs generated by hanging drop and exposed to RA also exhibited extensive neural differentiation (d7+7) upon plating when cultured in KO medium (F). The ES cells displayed a cellular mat (G) when cultured in DM in a monolayer without RA exposure (13 dpp), while in presence of RA (H) had cells with neural morphology. Scale: 30 ÂµM.</p>
