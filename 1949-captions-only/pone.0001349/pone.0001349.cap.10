The A2B5<sup>+</sup> cells cultured in either DM (A: 6 dpp; B: 10 dpp) or KO medium (C: 6 dpp; D: 10 dpp) exhibited proliferation and differentiation with better differentiation in KO (D) that showed both Map2<sup>+</sup> neurons (E) and GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (F). Similarly the SSEA1<sup>−</sup> cells when cultured in KO medium (G) underwent differentiation into Map2<sup>+</sup> neurons (H) and GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (J). Scale: 30 µM.</p>
