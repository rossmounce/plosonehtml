                Figure 10.  The differentiation profile of neural progenitors purified by MACS.The nes-EGFP cells 8 dpp were subjected to MACS, the A2B5+ eluent (A–D) and SSEA1− flow through (G) were collected and grown in culture. The A2B5+ cells cultured in either DM (A: 6 dpp; B: 10 dpp) or KO medium (C: 6 dpp; D: 10 dpp) exhibited proliferation and differentiation with better differentiation in KO (D) that showed both Map2+ neurons (E) and GFAP+ astrocytes (F). Similarly the SSEA1− cells when cultured in KO medium (G) underwent differentiation into Map2+ neurons (H) and GFAP+ astrocytes (J). Scale: 30 µM.
