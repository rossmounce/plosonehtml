The neural differentiation was promoted in KO medium (A–D) compared to that in serum containing one (E–G). RA expedited the process with better differentiation in respective media (B, D and G). While the neural progenitors were EGFP<sup>+</sup>, the mature ones with extensive processes were EGFP<sup>−</sup> (H) corresponding with the endogenous nestin expression pattern. Scale: 30 µM.</p>
