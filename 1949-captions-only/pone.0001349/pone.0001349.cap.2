                Figure 2.  The influence of medium on neural differentiation profile in nestin transgenic ES cell clones.The differentiation pattern in nes-EGFP cells as seen in bright field and fluorescence at 8 dpp and 10 dpp in KO (A,B and C,D) and FBS containing (E,F and G) medium respectively. The neural differentiation was promoted in KO medium (A–D) compared to that in serum containing one (E–G). RA expedited the process with better differentiation in respective media (B, D and G). While the neural progenitors were EGFP+, the mature ones with extensive processes were EGFP− (H) corresponding with the endogenous nestin expression pattern. Scale: 30 µM.
