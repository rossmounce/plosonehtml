Extensive neuronal differentiation was demonstrated by Map2 stained cells (D) including 5-HT<sup>+</sup> serotonergic (E) and TH<sup>+</sup> dopaminergic (F) neuronal subtypes. This 2D culture strategy also yielded GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (G) and O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes (H). The Map2<sup>+</sup> cells were also synaptophysin+ (J; red: synaptophysin, blue: Dapi). Scale: 40 M except D and G (10 µM).</p>
