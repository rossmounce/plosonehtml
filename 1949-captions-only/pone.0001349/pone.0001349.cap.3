                Figure 3.  The neural differentiation and immuno-cytochemical characterization.The expression of early neural markers Sox2 and nestin was detected in an overlapping fashion at various time periods during differentiation (A–C) with Sox2 showing nuclear localization (Dapi+: A). Extensive neuronal differentiation was demonstrated by Map2 stained cells (D) including 5-HT+ serotonergic (E) and TH+ dopaminergic (F) neuronal subtypes. This 2D culture strategy also yielded GFAP+ astrocytes (G) and O4+ oligodendrocytes (H). The Map2+ cells were also synaptophysin+ (J; red: synaptophysin, blue: Dapi). Scale: 40 M except D and G (10 µM).
