                Figure 4.  The influence of plating density on neural progenitor generation and differentiation in nes-EGFP ES cells.The cells plated at 2 K density showed EGFP+ neural progenitors in KO (A) or KR (B) medium, however, without any apparent differentiating neural cells at 8 dpp. The cells plated at medium (60 K; C, D) and high (130 K; E, F) densities showed prominent neural differentiation at the said time period. RA exposure (D) and (F) at the respective densities facilitated pronounced neural sprouting. Figures are shown in bright field and fluorescence. Scale: 30 ÂµM.
