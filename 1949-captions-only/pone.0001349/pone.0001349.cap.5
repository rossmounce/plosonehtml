                Figure 5.  Immunophenotyping of nes-EGFP cells during differentiation.The nes-EGFP cells expressing EGFP during differentiation also expressed nestin and Sox1 as seen at 2 dpp (A). Contrary to nestin, the Sox1 expression window was transient with enhanced expression at 4 dpp (B) that became negligible by 7 dpp (C). The nes-EGFP cells exhibited rosette like structures during differentiation with co-localization of EGFP and endogenous nestin (D). The Map2+ differentiating neurons were EGFP−, however remained associated with EGFP+ neural progenitors (E). The histogram represents the Sox1 population during differentiation as quantified by flowcytometry (F). Scale: 40 µM.
