Contrary to nestin, the Sox1 expression window was transient with enhanced expression at 4 dpp (B) that became negligible by 7 dpp (C). The nes-EGFP cells exhibited rosette like structures during differentiation with co-localization of EGFP and endogenous nestin (D). The Map2<sup>+</sup> differentiating neurons were EGFP<sup>−</sup>, however remained associated with EGFP<sup>+</sup> neural progenitors (E). The histogram represents the Sox1 population during differentiation as quantified by flowcytometry (F). Scale: 40 µM.</p>
