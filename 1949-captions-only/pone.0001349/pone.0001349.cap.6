The Map2 expression was extensive at 9 dpp in cells cultured in either KO (C, E) or KR (D, F) medium and plated at medium (C, D) or high (E, F) densities respectively. The cells plated at low density, however, had attenuation in neuronal differentiation at the detected time point (G; 9 dpp). Scale: 40 ÂµM.</p>
