                Figure 7.  The differentiation of human ES cells into neurons.An undifferentiated human ES cell colony grown on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast monolayer (A). The human ES cells were differentiated into neurons (d25) in the KR medium showing Map2 positive staining (B). Some of the Map2+ neurons (C) were also TH+ (D) indicating their dopaminergic neuronal subtype status. Scale: 30 ÂµM.
