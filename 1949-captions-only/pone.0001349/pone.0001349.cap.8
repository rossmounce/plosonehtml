                Figure 8.  The RT-PCR analysis for secretory factors during neurogenesis in cells plated at varying densities.(A): BMP4, FGF4, Noggin expression status in undifferentiated ES cells and during various days of differentiation in cells plated at medium (50 K) density. β-actin gene served as a housekeeping positive control. (B): The expression status of BMP4, FGF4, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt8a, Wnt8b at d6 and d8 of differentiation in cells plated at varying densities. The bottom row shows the housekeeping β-actin control with (+) and without (−) reverse transcriptase in the reactions. (C): The semi-quantitative (densitometry: Wnt 3a) and quantitative (Wnt 5a, Wnt 8a) detection of Wnt transcripts relative to β-actin, keeping the relative expression count at 50 K density as 1. Data are represented as mean+/−SEM (n = 4–5) with P&lt;0.05 (Wnt5a) and &lt;0.01 (Wnt8a) using paired t- test for comparing the transcripts between 2 K and 50 K groups.
