                Figure 9.  The quantification of EGFP+ neural progenitors by flowcytometry.(A): The nes-EGFP cells cultured in monolayer generated bright EGFP+ neural progenitors (M2 population) with maximum number being detected at d7. The M1 population included also the weak EGFP+ cells representing the differentiating population. (B): The bar diagram shows the neural progenitor generation profile comparing the EGFP population at the M2 window at different time points during differentiation keeping the ES cells value as 1 (n = 4–6). The EGFP+ cells peaked during 6–9 dpp, the optimum time window for efficient neural progenitor generation during differentiation followed by a decrease in the second week. (C): The bar diagram shows the influence of plating density and RA exposure of cells on EGFP+ neural progenitor generation at 7 dpp. Data are represented as mean+/−SEM (n = 4–7).
