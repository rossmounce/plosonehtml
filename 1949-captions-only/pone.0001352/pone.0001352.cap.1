Scale bar, 20 µm. (B) A relation between cytoplasmic streaming and the number of endosymbionts. A bar graph shows the number of endosymbionts (±S.D.) at each phase of host cell cycle (stage 1–4). The endosymbionts were classified into a unicellular cell (purple), 2 (green) and 4 autospores (white). A table shows whether cytoplasmic streaming occurs or not, and the total number of endosymbionts. * and ** mean statistical differences with Student's <em>t</em>-test, *<em>P</em>&lt;0.005 and **<em>P</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
