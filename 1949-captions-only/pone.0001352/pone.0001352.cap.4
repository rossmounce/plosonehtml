                Figure 4.  (A) Movement of carmine particles near the division plane in algae-free P. bursaria at dividing phase.An algae-free P. bursaria having carmine particles (arrowheads) was monitored using video-microscopy (Left and Middle panel: 0 min and 5 min after initiating the observation, respectively). The right panel is a schematic diagram of movements of carmine particles. (B) P. bursaria at dividing phase. Microphotographs indicate a differential interference contrast image (a) and the corresponding conventional fluorescence image (b). Scale bar, 50 Âµm. (C) Serial fluorescence sections of dividing paramecia obtained by confocal microscope. Endosymbionts were eliminated from the division plane in P. bursaria at dividing phase.
