The right panel is a schematic diagram of movements of carmine particles. (B) <em>P. bursaria</em> at dividing phase. Microphotographs indicate a differential interference contrast image (a) and the corresponding conventional fluorescence image (b). Scale bar, 50 Âµm. (C) Serial fluorescence sections of dividing paramecia obtained by confocal microscope. Endosymbionts were eliminated from the division plane in <em>P. bursaria</em> at dividing phase.</p>
