                Figure 1.  Expression of CEA and CEACAM6 in the CEABAC mouse colon.A) Images of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FITC-labeled CEA cDNA probes and DAPI-stained nuclei) show one nuclear spot (red arrow) for CEABAC10 and two for CEABAC20. Magnification: 1000×. B) Significant reduction visually of body size of CEABAC20 mice at 3 weeks of age. C) Immunoblots of colon protein extracts show a correlation between expression levels of CEA (detected with A20 mAb) and CEACAM6 (detected with 9A6 mAb) and CEABAC transgene copy numbers in the CEABAC mice (CEABAC2, CEABAC10 and CEABAC20). D) Immunohistochemical staining (brown staining) for human CEACAM (detected with RbαCEA) in 3 week-old mouse colons shows increasing expression levels of CEA/CEACAM6 correlated with the transgene copy number. The high expression level of CEA/CEACAM6 in the CEABAC20 mice was no longer restricted to the apical surface (red arrow points to apical surface staining; black arrows point to basolateral staining) and significant intracellular localization of CEA/CEACAM6 was also evident. E) Immunohistochemical staining (brown staining) for human CEACAM (detected with RbαCEA) in 3 month-old CEABAC20 mouse colons shows levels and patterns of CEA/CEACAM6 expression which are similar to those of human colorectal carcinomas at a similar stage of progression. WT denotes wild-type littermate.
