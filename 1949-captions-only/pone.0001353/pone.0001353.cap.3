                Figure 3.  Subcellular localization of CEACAM and integrin signaling elements in purified colonocytes.A) Immunoblots of different membrane fractions of purified colonocytes derived from sucrose density gradients show a shift in subcellular localization from high density (H) towards low density (L) membrane complexes for integrin α5, ILK, total AKT and Ser473-phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in purified colonocytes from CEABAC2 and CEABAC10 mice relative to WT littermate mice. No such shift was observed for integrin α2, integrin β1 and FAK. GM1 is a marker for membrane raft-containing membrane fractions. Note that these immunoblots are representative of three independent experiments using at least 6 mice per mouse group. B) Antibody-mediated cross-linking of CEA and CEACAM6 with J22 mAb in the purified colonocytes accentuates the shift of ILK to the less dense membrane fractions shown in A. C) Densitometric analysis of immunoblots for AKT and pAKT shown in A. The mean densitometric ratios (the intensity of band in L divided by the one in H) from three independent experiments show a statistical significant shift of AKT and pAKT to the low density membrane complexes in the CEABAC colonocytes (P&lt;0.001 for AKT and P&lt;0.005 for pAKT). Error bars  =  SEM (N = 3).
