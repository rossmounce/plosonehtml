                Figure 4.  Hyperproliferation in CEABAC mouse colonic epithelium at 3 weeks of age.A) Extension of the proliferative zones in colonic crypts is shown for both CEABAC10 and CEABAC20 by PCNA staining. Lengthening of crypts, poor cryptal alignment, increase of peri-cryptal stroma, and elongation of nuclei are noted in CEABAC20 mice, indicating hyperplastic changes. Arrow shows an example of crypt fission used to calculate percent crypt fission for C. B) Proliferation indices estimated by PCNA staining in A show significant increases for both CEABAC10 and CEABAC20 from WT mice (P&lt;0.0001). C) Percent crypt fission plotted against transgene copy-number shows a linear curve with a correlation coefficient of 0.977; each data point is significantly different from the others (P&lt;0.0001). D) Cross sections of colons show increasing epithelial content with increasing CEABAC transgene copy number (i.e. CEA/CEACAM6 expression levels). Magnification: 400× (A), 100× (D). Staining: hematoxylin. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean (N = 9). WT denotes wild-type littermate.
