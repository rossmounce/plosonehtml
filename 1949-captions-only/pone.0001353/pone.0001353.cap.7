                Figure 7.  Histopathological findings in CEABAC20 tumors including serrated adenomatous and dysplastic morphology.A) Longitudinal section of normal colonic crypts. B) Longitudinal sections of serrated colonic crypts showing upper third of the elongated crypts (left panel), sawtooth like in-folding at the mid-crypt (middle panel) and marked branching at the crypt base (right panel). C) Cross-section of a hyperplastic crypt (red arrow) showing numerous small mucinous vacuoles. D) Longitudinal section (left panel) and cross-section (right panel) of dysplastic crypts showing elongated nuclei and nuclear stratification (red arrow). There is also evidence of myofibroblastic (spindle cell) proliferation in the lamina propria in C and D. Magnification: 400Ã—. Staining: hematoxylin and eosin.
