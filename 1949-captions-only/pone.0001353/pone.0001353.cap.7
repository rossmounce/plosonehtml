B) Longitudinal sections of serrated colonic crypts showing upper third of the elongated crypts (left panel), sawtooth like in-folding at the mid-crypt (middle panel) and marked branching at the crypt base (right panel). C) Cross-section of a hyperplastic crypt (red arrow) showing numerous small mucinous vacuoles. D) Longitudinal section (left panel) and cross-section (right panel) of dysplastic crypts showing elongated nuclei and nuclear stratification (red arrow). There is also evidence of myofibroblastic (spindle cell) proliferation in the lamina propria in C and D. Magnification: 400Ã—. Staining: hematoxylin and eosin.</p>
