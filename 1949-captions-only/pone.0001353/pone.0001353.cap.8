                Figure 8.  Inhibition of apoptosis/anoikis in CEABAC mice.A) TUNEL assays on formaldehyde-fixed frozen sections of WT and CEABAC20 colons. Cyan (red arrow): apoptotic nuclei; Blue (yellow arrow): non-apoptotic nuclei. Note the presence of non-apoptotic anchorless cells, which are CEA/CEACAM6-positive (data not shown), in the crypt lumens of CEABAC20 colons (yellow arrow). Magnification: 400×. Staining: DAPI. B) Immunoblots of colon protein extracts for PARP show reduced cleavage product of PARP (ΔPARP) indicating an overall reduction of apoptosis in CEABAC20 mouse colons. C) TUNEL assays on purified colonocytes show a marked inhibition of anoikis of CEABAC colonocytes compared to WT colonocytes after 3 hours in single cell suspension. Negative control (freshly purified WT colonocytes) is completely TUNEL negative. Positive control (freshly purified WT colonocytes treated with DNAseI) is TUNEL positive. D) Apoptotic indices estimated from 3 independent experiments shown in C. E) Immunoblots of colonocyte lysates from anoikis experiment for caspase-3 show a baseline cleavage of caspase-3 (ΔCaspase3) at time 0 (freshly purified colonocytes) and a marked reduction of caspase-3 cleavage at time 1 hr (after 1 hour in single cell suspensions) for CEABAC mice, indicating inhibition of anoikis in the CEABAC colonocytes.
