Panel A: Dot-plots of transfected cells analysed by flow cytometry showing the cell surface level of the MHC class I molecule L<sup>d</sup> or β2-microglobulin (x-axis) plotted against the level of intracellular MeCP2 (y-axis). Panel B: The induction factor was calculated as the ratio of MFI of treated cells (over-expressing MeCP2 or untransfected cells) on MFI of untreated N2A cells. Values used for the histogram are the mean (±SEM) of induction factors obtained in seven independent transfection experiments. Statistical significance of difference between groups was analysed by using an unpaired t-test (*, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; ***, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001).</p>
