                Figure 2.  Transient overexpression of MeCP2 inhibits MHC class I induction by IFN-γ.N2A cells transfected with pCMX vectors expressing murine or human MeCP2 were treated or not with IFN-γ for 48 hrs and then double immunostained for cell surface β2-microglobulin, transferrin receptor or MHC class I and intracellular MeCP2. Panel A: Dot-plots of transfected cells analysed by flow cytometry showing the cell surface level of the MHC class I molecule Ld or β2-microglobulin (x-axis) plotted against the level of intracellular MeCP2 (y-axis). Panel B: The induction factor was calculated as the ratio of MFI of treated cells (over-expressing MeCP2 or untransfected cells) on MFI of untreated N2A cells. Values used for the histogram are the mean (±SEM) of induction factors obtained in seven independent transfection experiments. Statistical significance of difference between groups was analysed by using an unpaired t-test (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001).
