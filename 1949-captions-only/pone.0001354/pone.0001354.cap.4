                Figure 4.  Evaluation of MHC class I expression in adult mouse brain slices.Serial frozen sections of adult male wild-type and MeCP2âˆ’/y littermates were analysed for expression of MHC class I by immunohistochemistry using the rat R1-21.2 monoclonal antibody and EnVision detection technology (Dako). For the negative control, the same staining process was used omitting the primary antibody. Similar results were obtained with the M1/42 monoclonal antibody. Similar results were obtained in independent experiments on brains from three different pairs of mice.
