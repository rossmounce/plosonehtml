Neurons were identified by their intracellular staining with an anti-β-III-tubulin antibody (inset). Large cells, containing mainly astrocytes, were analysed separately by an appropriate forward/side scatter gate. Primary spleen fibroblasts from the same mice were also subjected or not to IFN-γ treatment and stained for their MHC class I expression. Panel A: Representative histograms showing cell surface staining (x axis) against cell number (y axis), obtained with cells from wild-type and MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> male littermates. White-filled curves represent background staining, gray-filled curves represent MHC I-specific staining. Panel B: MHC class I fold-induction in response to IFN-γ was calculated as the ratio of MFI of treated cells (induced MHC I level) on MFI of untreated cells (basal MHC I level). Grey-filled squares show MHC class I fold-induction for individual mice and for each cell type. White-filled squares represent the group's mean of fold-inductions (±SD).</p>
