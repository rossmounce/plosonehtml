                Figure 1.  Targeting strategy for the creation of DiCre ES cells.A: Scheme of the targeting vector and of the Rosa26 locus following homologous recombination. “B” and “R” stand, respectively, for the BamHI and EcoRV sites that are used when screening ES cells clones for correct insertions using Southern blots and the probes indicated on the scheme. Fragments amplified when genotyping animals are also represented B: Representative examples of Southern blots obtained from wild type ES cells or clones with correct recombination, using the probes shown on the schemes above.
