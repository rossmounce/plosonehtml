                Figure 2.  DiCre are functional in targeted ES cells.A: Scheme of the CALNLZ indicator construct used to test the functionality of Cre. B: ß-galactosidase expression, as revealed by the blue X-Gal reaction product, in ES cells with correct insertion of the DiCre construct into the Rosa26 locus and stable transfection of the pcDNA-CALNLZ construct. Cells are tested without (“Control”) or following exposure, for three days, to 20 nM of the dimerizer AP23102.
