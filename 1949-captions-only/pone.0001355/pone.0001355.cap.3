                Figure 3.  Induction of Cre-mediated recombination in DiCre×Z/EG mice.A: The presence of recombination is shown by EGFP expression in the heart of DiCre×Z/EG adult animals ten days after the end of treatment with the inducer (5×10 mg/kg rapamycin i.p.). B: In the absence of rapamycin treatment no specific fluorescence can be seen.
