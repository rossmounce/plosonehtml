                Figure 5.  Dose-dependence of DiCre activation in vivo.A: Southern blots, using a LacZ probe, prepared from the liver of adult DiCreR26R animals ten days following 510mgkg, 310mgkg, 110mgkg, 520mgkg or 540mgkg i.p. rapamycin treatment, with two or three animals for each condition. The upper band R corresponds to the R26R allele after recombination, the lower band NR to the nonrecombined allele. B Quantification of the degree of recombination, as estimated by image analysis of the blot shown above.
