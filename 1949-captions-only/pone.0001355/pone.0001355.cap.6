                Figure 6.  Induction of Cre-mediated recombination in primary cultures of embryonic tissues of DiCre×R26R mice.The presence of recombination is shown by ß-galactosidase expression, as revealed by the blue X-Gal reaction product on the bright-field (upper row) and phase contrast (lower row) images of the same fields, in primary cultures prepared from various tissues of DiCre×R26R E15 embryos. Cultures were exposed between 3 and 7 day in vitro to 10 nM AP23102.
