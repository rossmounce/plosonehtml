B: Expression level, relative to that measured in the liver, of the same transgenes in tissues of adult animals, as measured by qPCR (means +/− SEM, n = 3–5). C: Northern blot, and D: qPCR analysis, as in panels 7A and 7B, from embryonic (E15) tissues and adult tissues used as comparison. Note that the adult tissues used here were not the same as those shown on panels 7A and 7B.</p>
