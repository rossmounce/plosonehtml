                Figure 1.  Highly virulent P. aeruginosa actively restricts skeletal muscle gene induction within 1 h post-inoculation.Relative expression ratio levels of 20 fly genes that encode proteins with essential functions of thorax skeletal muscle, under different conditions: 1, 6, and 12 h after thoracic injury only (A), thoracic injury and PA14 inoculation (B), or thoracic injury and CF5 inoculation (C); 1 h following thoracic injury and co-infection with 100:100 and 200:100 PA14:CF5 CFUs/fly (D); or following abdominal injury alone or together with inoculation with PA14 or CF5 (E). The relative expression ratio levels of selected SMGs for each condition were calculated versus na√Øve. The statistical evaluation of differences in expression values between PA14 and CF5 inoculated flies is presented in Table S1.
