Skeletal muscle structural gene function contributes to host hypersusceptibility to infection.Survival kinetics of mutants for the flight muscle genes act88F, hdp, or Tm2 following local PA14 infection of the thorax (A) or the abdomen (B) relative to wild-type flies. Detailed statistical evaluations of the survival kinetics are presented in Table S2.
