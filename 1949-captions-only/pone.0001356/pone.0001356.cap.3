                Figure 3.  Loss of muscle specific expression of TpnC41C and Gst2 increases fly susceptibility to infection.Survival kinetics of flies carrying the RNAi control gene yuri (blue diamonds), versus muscle specific TpnC41C RNAi transgenic flies (red triangles), following thoracic (A) or abdominal (B) PA14 infection. (C) Homozygous flies bearing two distinct loss-of-function Gst206253/04227alleles, presented as Gst2(−/−), versus the corresponding heterozygous Gst206253/+ flies, presented as Gst2(−/+). (D) Wild-type flies, versus Gst2GS2160 loss of function flies, presented as Gst2(GS), and overexpression of the fly muscle specific gene Gst2 in the Gst2GS2160 loss of function background flies presented as Gst2(GS);Gst2 muscle following local PA14 infection of the thorax. Detailed statistical evaluations of the survival kinetics are presented in Table S2.
