                Figure 4.  hep mediates increased resistance to thoracic, but not abdominal or systemic, infection.Survival kinetics of (A, C, E) and bacterial proliferation per fly in (B, D, F) wild-type and hep1 flies, following local PA14 infection of the thorax (A, B), or the abdomen (C, D), or systemic injector-pumping PA14 infection (E, F). Error bars indicate Standard Deviation of the mean (C, D, F) and * indicate t-test P-values of â‰¤0.05 (B). The difference in mortality kinetics between wild type and mutant flies is statistically significant. Detailed statistical evaluations of the survival kinetics are presented in Table S2.
