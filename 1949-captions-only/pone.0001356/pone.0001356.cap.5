                Figure 5.  JNK inhibition increases P. aeruginosa proliferation in mouse muscle.(A) “Infection” and “Infection + JNK inhibitor” mice were respectively injected with empty micelles and micelles filled with the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and then inoculated with bioluminescent P. aeruginosa cells. The inhibitor did not perturb bacterial growth in vitro. Luminescence was assessed 0, 1, and 3 d post-treatment. The luminescence signal is magnified 3X in the lower panels. (B) Average luminescence from eight control versus eight JNK inhibitor mice. *P≤0.05 for days 1, 2, and 3 based on t- and Wilcoxon tests. RLU, relative luminescence units. (C) Diagram depicting the proposed role of JNK pathway in host defense and the ability of P. aeruginosa to affect SMGs expression.
