The inhibitor did not perturb bacterial growth <em>in vitro</em>. Luminescence was assessed 0, 1, and 3 d post-treatment. The luminescence signal is magnified 3X in the lower panels. (B) Average luminescence from eight control versus eight JNK inhibitor mice. *<em>P</em>≤0.05 for days 1, 2, and 3 based on t- and Wilcoxon tests. RLU, relative luminescence units. (C) Diagram depicting the proposed role of JNK pathway in host defense and the ability of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> to affect SMGs expression.</p>
