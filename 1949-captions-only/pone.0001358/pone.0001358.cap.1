                Figure 1.  Genome BLAST atlas of the A. butzleri strain RM4018.Arcobacter butzleri strain RM4018 is the reference genome and is compared to a set of 15 other epsilonproteobacterial genomes, including different Campylobacter (rings 7–14 from center) and Helicobacter (rings 15–17 from center) strains, as well as the UniProt database (outermost ring in black). A web-based “zoomable atlas” can be found at [147].
