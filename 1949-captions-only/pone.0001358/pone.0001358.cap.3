                Figure 3.  Predicted TCA, methylcitrate and citramalate cycles of A. butzleri strain RM4018.Genes unique within the Campylobacteraceae are labeled in green. Genes in parentheses encode multi-subunit proteins or a protein and its cognate accessory protein. 1: pyruvate dehydrogenase; 2: L-lactate dehydrogenase; 3: phosphate transacetylase; 4: acetate kinase; 5: citrate synthase; 6: aconitase; 7: isocitrate dehydrogenase; 8: 2-oxoglutarate:acceptor oxidoreductase; 9: fumarate reductase; 10: fumarase; 11: malate dehydrogenase; 12: malate:quinone oxidoreductase; 13: 2-methylcitrate synthase; 14: 2-methylcitrate dehydratase; 15: aconitase; 16: 2-methylisocitrate lyase; 17: malic enzyme; 18: malyl-CoA hydrolase; 19: malyl-CoA lyase; 20: Î²-methylmalyl-CoA lyase; 21: mesaconyl-CoA hydratase; 22: mesaconyl-CoA synthetase; 23: citramalate hydrolase; 24: citramalate lyase.
