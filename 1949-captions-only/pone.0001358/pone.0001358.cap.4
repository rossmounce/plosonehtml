                Figure 4.  Respiratory pathways in A. butzleri strain RM4018.Transfer of electrons to the menaquinone (MQ) pool is represented by blue arrows; transfer of electrons from the menaquinone pool is represented by red arrows. b- and c-type cytochromes are shaded yellow. Genes unique within the Campylobacteraceae are labeled in green. NADH:Q OR: NADH:quinone oxidoreductase; M:Q OR: malate:quinone oxidoreductase; FormDH: formate dehydrogenase; LacDH: L-lactate dehydrogenase; SulfDH: sulfur dehydrogenase; Ubi cyt c OR: Ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase; TMAO RD: TMAO reductase; NO3RD: nitrate reductase; NO2RD: nitrite reductase; FumRD: fumarate reductase; QHAmDH: quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase; AldDH: aldehyde dehydrogenase; PX: peroxidase; CTQ: cysteine tryptophylquinone.
