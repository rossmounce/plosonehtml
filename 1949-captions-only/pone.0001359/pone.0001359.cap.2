In A, <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. Control (1), VEGF at 10 ng/ml (2), culture medium of non-infected T84 cells (3), culture medium of wild-type C1845-infected T84 cells (1×) (4), culture medium of wild-type C1845-infected T84 cells (0.5×) (5). In B, Western blot showing phospho-Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 visualized with respectively anti-phospho-Erk and anti-Erk antibodies. Control (1), VEGF at 10 ng/ml (23), culture medium of wild-type C1845-infected T84 cells (1×) (3), culture medium of wild-type C1845-infected T84 cells (0.5×) (4). The results are representative of at least three independent experiments. *, p&lt;0,01. In C, Endothelial cells were seeded on matrigel and incubated with growing medium (control) alone or supplemented with T84 conditionned medium (CM), C1845–condition medium (C1845) or VEGF. Images show that only C1845-conditionned medium (C1845) and VEGF allow the alignment of endothelial cells in tube like structure.</p>
