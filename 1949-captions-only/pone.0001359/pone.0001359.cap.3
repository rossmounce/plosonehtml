Confluent serum-starved T84 cells infected were with wild-type C1845 at 5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml, which represents a multiplicity of infection of 20 bacteria per epithelial cell, for two hours. When indicated, cells were treated for 30 minutes prior to infection with the anti-DAF blocking IH4 monoclonal antibody. VEGF mRNA expression was assayed by q-PCR. *, p = 0,03 (n = 7). In B, wild-type C1845-induced VEGF mRNA increase is blocked by transcription inhibitor. Confluent serum-starved T84 cells were pre-treated for 30 minutes with 25 µg/ml of the reversible transcription inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB). Cells were then infected with 5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml wild-type C1845 for four hours and total RNA prepared. The relative quantity of VEGF mRNA was measured by q-PCR. Quantification of the results from three independent experiments (means±SD) is shown. *, p&lt;0,01.</p>
