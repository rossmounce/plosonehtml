                Figure 4.  Wild-type C1845 bacteria induce Akt and Erk signaling pathways in T84 epithelial cells.Confluent serum-starved T84 cells were non-infected (NI) or infected with increasing concentrations of wild-type C1845 bacteria, for two hours. When indicated, cells were pre-treated with an anti-DAF blocking IH4 monoclonal antibody prior to or in the absence of infection. In A, phospho-Akt and total Akt were assayed by Western blotting using respectively anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt antibodies. In B, phospho-Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 were visualized with respectively anti-phospho-Erk and anti-Erk antibodies. These results are representative of at least three independent experiments.
