When indicated, cells were pre-treated with an anti-DAF blocking IH4 monoclonal antibody prior to or in the absence of infection. In A, phospho-Akt and total Akt were assayed by Western blotting using respectively anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt antibodies. In B, phospho-Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 were visualized with respectively anti-phospho-Erk and anti-Erk antibodies. These results are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>
