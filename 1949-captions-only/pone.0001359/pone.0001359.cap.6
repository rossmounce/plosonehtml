                Figure 6.  Wild-type C1845-induced VEGF expression is dependant on Src and Erk proteins.Confluent serum-starved T84 cells were pre-treated with 5 µM PP2, 10 µM U0126 or 15 µM LY294002 for 30 minutes. Cells were then infected with wild-type C1845 bacteria at 5×107 CFU/ml for four hours. Total RNA was prepared and the relative quantity of VEGF mRNA was measured by q-PCR. Quantification of the results from four independent experiments (means±SD.) is shown. *, p&lt;0.005 versus non infected cells.
