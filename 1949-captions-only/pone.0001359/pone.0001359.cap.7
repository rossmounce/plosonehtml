Phospho-Erk1/2 and total Erk1 were visualized by Western Blotting with respectively anti-phospho-Erk and anti-Erk1 antibodies. This experiment is representative of two independent experiments. In B, confluent serum-starved T84 cells were non-infected (NI), infected with increasing concentrations of AAEC185 or recombinant AAEC185-F1845 strains for 2 h. Phospho-Erk and total Erk-1 were assayed by Western blotting using respectively anti-phospho-Erk and anti-Erk1 antibodies. In C, coomassie-stained polyacrylamide-SDS gel of fimbriae purified from C1845 or AAEC185 bacteria. 1 µg of bovine serum albumine (BSA) are showed on the left of the gel. In D, confluent serum-starved T84 cells were non treated (NT) or incubated 2 h in the presence of extracts of C1845 bacteria (containing 2 µg of purified F1845 adhesin) or AAEC185 bacteria. These result are representative of three independent experiments. In E, confluent serum-starved T84 cells (5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected with AAEC185 bacteria or recombinant AAEC185-F1845 bacteria expressing the pSSS1 operon encoding the F1845 adhesin (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml). Total RNA were extracted and analysed by q-PCR. These results are representative of at least two independent experiments (means±SD).</p>
