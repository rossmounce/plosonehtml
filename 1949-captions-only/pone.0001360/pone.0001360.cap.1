During the 30 seconds, a tone was emitted. Within the second half (15 seconds) of this 30-second period, the shock was delivered. Thirty seconds following the trial served as a rest period. All trials took place in the morning and were repeated consecutively ten times per day, resulting in one session lasting 10 minutes in total. Control rats followed the same routine with tone emission, but without experiencing any shocks. On the third day, the same procedure was followed, but without administering shocks. This was done to avoid measuring behavioral outputs due to direct drug interference or pain stimuli. <em>Experiment 1: n = 48; experiment 2: n = 29</em></p>
