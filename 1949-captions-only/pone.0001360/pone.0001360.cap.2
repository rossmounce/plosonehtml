At the top of the hierarchy, we divided rats into two main groups: those receiving fear conditioning, and those not. Those animals receiving fear conditioning, were then further divided into rats receiving ketamine administration and rats receiving saline shams. The latter group would form the fear conditioning only group (FC). The rats not receiving fear conditioning were also divided into two groups depending on whether they would receive a ketamine or saline injection; the former group making up the ketamine only group (Ket), and the latter being the control group (NFC). The remaining fear conditioned rats also receiving ketamine were then further divided into those receiving either a saline injection (FC+Ket) or those receiving an additional antipsychotic injection consisting of clozapine (FC+Ket+CLOZ), haloperidol (FC+Ket+HALO), or LY 379268 (FC+Ket+LY). <em>CLOZ, clozapine; FC, Fear conditioning; HALO, haloperidol; KET, ketamine; LY, LY379268; NFC, no fear conditioning; SAL, saline.</em></p>
