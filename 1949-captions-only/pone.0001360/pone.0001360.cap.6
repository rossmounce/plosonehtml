The FC group showed increased glutamate levels (A) in the central and basolateral amygdala, as compared to the NFC group. Ketamine also significantly inhibited this effect in both amygdala nuclei, as revealed by the comparison between FC+Ket and FC groups. Clozapine, in turn, blocked the actions of ketamine on glutamate levels (FC+Ket versus FC+Ket+Cloz) in the central amygdala nucleus, with full restoration of normal fear conditioned-induced glutamate levels in the basolateral amygdala. Clozapine alone (FC+Cloz vs. FC) decreased glutamate levels in the central amygdala. In terms of dopamine content, there were no differences between the FC and NFC groups in either amygdala nuclei (B). A decrease in dopamine content was, however, noted in the nucleus accumbens (C). Ketamine abolished this fear conditioning response, and clozapine partially counteracted the effect of ketamine in the nucleus accumbens. Clozapine alone (no ketamine) also showed effects (FC+Cloz), and increased dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens as compared to the FC group. Ketamine in combination with clozapine (FC+Ket+Cloz; or alone (FC+Ket) increased dopamine levels in the central amygdala (B) as compared to the FC only group. <em>Bla, basolateral amygdala nucleus; cea, central amygdala nucleus; Cloz, clozapine; FC, fear conditioning; Ket, ketamine; nacc, nucleus accumbens; NFC, no fear conditioning.</em></p>
