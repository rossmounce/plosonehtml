                Figure 1.  Pedigree of family DU-11 with haplotypes on chromosome 14 and segregation of MYH7 mutation R281T (c.842G&gt;C).Family members are shown by filled black symbols (affected), by half filled symbols (partially affected), open symbols (unaffected) and gray symbols (unknown affection status). An arrow points to the index patient. The disease associated haplotype is shown by filled black bars. Markers within the minimum disease associated haplotype are boxed. Below the haplotypes of each individual the occurrence of wild-type (+) and mutant MYH7 alleles (âˆ’) is indicated.
