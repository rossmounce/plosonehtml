                Figure 2.  Imaging of NVM in patient III:8 of family DU-11.A, Magnetic resonance image: long-axis plane in diastole. Prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses are seen in the apical half of the right and left ventricle as indicated by arrows. B, Magnetic resonance image: short-axis plane in diastole. In the apex region the cavum and the myocardial wall can not clearly be distinguished. Extensive trabeculations in this region produce a sponge-like appearance of the myocardium. C, Two-dimensional echocardiograph: apical four-chamber view in diastole with (right) and without (left) color flow imaging. A massive apical thickening is seen without any evidence of trabeculations in the left image. In contrast, color flow imaging (right image) shows more clearly the recesses extending deeply into the myocardial wall. D, Two-dimensional echocardiograph: parasternal short-axis view in diastole with (right) and without (left) color flow imaging. The left image shows a mesh-like morphology in the mid-region of the left ventricle. The cavum is not clearly discernable. The right image demonstrates numerous small blood-flow eddies within the sponge-like myocardium (as shown by color flow imaging). LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle; LA, left atrium; RA, right atrium.
