Two-point LOD scores for all chromosomes under the assumption of a reduced penetrance of 90% are shown. In the line below the diagram each red slash indicates the position of an analyzed marker on the corresponding chromosome. B, Genetic map of the candidate region 14cen-14q12. A part of the deCODE map is shown in the upper part. The critical interval is delimited by 14ptel and <em>D14S264</em>. The genomic organization of <em>MYH7</em> is delineated in the lower part. Exons are indicated by filled boxes and introns by horizontal lines. The translational start codon is located in exon 3. The positions of the intragenic markers <em>MYO</em> I in intron 1and <em>MYOII</em> in intron 24 are shown. The mutation was identified in exon 10. C, Mutation analysis. Chromatograms of the index patient III:4 and her unaffected son IV:2 are shown. The mutation site is marked by an arrow. Parts of the nucleotide sequence (from c.835 to c.849) and protein sequence (from 279 to 283) are given below.</p>
