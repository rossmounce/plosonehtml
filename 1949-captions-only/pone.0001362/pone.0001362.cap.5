The mutations were plotted on a model of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 (PDB code 2MYS). Functional sites are indicated by arrows. 68 selected mutations causing HCM are indicated by yellow spheres and 4 mutations causing DCM by green spheres. The mutations were selected from the UniProt database (UniProtKB) and from two publications<a href="#pone.0001362-Woo1">[33]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001362-Villard1">[34]</a>. The described NVM causing mutation is highlighted as a blue sphere and labeled according to the position in MYH7_HUMAN. B, Close-up view of the salt bridge between residues R281 and D325 in chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 (PDB code 2MYS). The amino acids are numbered according to MYH7_HUMAN. The sulfate molecule (yellow and orange) marks the ATPase active site for better orientation. The residues R281 and D325 are shown according to the CPK color scheme (grey, carbon atoms; red, oxygen atoms, i.e. acidic side chain; light blue, nitrogen atoms, i.e. basic side chain). The salt bridge between R281 and D325 is symbolized by dashed black lines that indicate potential hydrogen bonds. The helix attached to D325 is highlighted in red.</p>
