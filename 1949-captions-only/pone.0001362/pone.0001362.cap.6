                Figure 6.  Multiple alignment of different myosin molecules.The interacting sites R281 and D325 (both in bold, position numbering according to MYH7_HUMAN) are highly conserved between myosin molecules of human, fruit fly, zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively (*, identical position; :, conservative exchange). Sequence names correspond to SwissProt entry names: MYH7_HUMAN-human myosin heavy chain, cardiac muscle beta isoform; MYH1_HUMAN-human myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle, adult 1; MYH4_HUMAN-human myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle, fetal; MYH1_MOUSE-murine myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle, adult 1; MYH4_RABIT-rabbit myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle, juvenile; MYSS_CHICK-chicken myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle, adult; Q802Z4_BRARE (Q802_BRARE)-zebrafish protein Q802Z4; MYSA_DROME-fruit fly myosin heavy chain, muscle; MYO3_CAEEL-Caenorhabditis elegans myosin heavy chain A.
