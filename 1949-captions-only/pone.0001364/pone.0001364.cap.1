                Figure 1.  Influence of hypoxia on TLR mRNA expression in murine dendritic cells.Isolated murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative mRNA levels of TLR1-9 and TLR11-13 were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to ß-actin and expressed as fold change relative to normoxia±SEM and transcript levels in normoxic BMDCs were normalized to 1. Results are derived from three different experiments (*p&lt;0.05, significant differences from normoxia).
