<h4>Hypoxia induction of TLR6 transcript, protein and function</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>After having shown induction of TLR2 with hypoxia, we next studied additional details of TLR6 induction during hypoxia. In fact, TLR6 can function as co-receptor and heterodimerizes with TLR2 to form preexisting cell surface receptors on different cell types <a href="#pone.0001364-Triantafilou1">[19]</a>. Such TLR2/TLR6 complexes play an important role in innate immune responses by recognizing microbial compounds including lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria <a href="#pone.0001364-Schwandner1">[20]</a> or fungal zymosan <a href="#pone.0001364-Ozinsky1">[21]</a>. In order to confirm TLR6 inducibility by hypoxia, we exposed human DCs, MM6, HMEC-1 or Caco-2 epithelia to hypoxia (2% oxygen) and measured changes in TLR6 transcript level by real-time RT-PCR. Similar to the above findings of TLR2 induction by hypoxia, real-time RT-PCR confirmed hypoxia induction of TLR6 in all cell lines studied (<a href="#pone-0001364-g003">Figure 3A and B</a>). For example, TLR6 transcript levels were dramatically elevated following 24 h of hypoxia exposure in Caco-2 cells (4.080±0.4446, p&lt;0.01). We next verified these findings on a protein level by measuring TLR6 expression by Western blot analysis. Here, we exposed confluent HMEC-1 monolayers to hypoxia over 0 to 72h to hypoxia. Consistent with our studies of TLR6 transcript, we found a robust induction of TLR6 protein with hypoxia (<a href="#pone-0001364-g003">Figure 3C</a>). As next step we studied TLR signaling effects during normoxia or hypoxia. Here, we used a specific ligand for the TLR2/TLR6 complex (FSL-1, range 1–100 ng/ml) and measured IL6 concentration in the HMEC-1 pre-exposed to normoxia or 24 h of hypoxia (2% oxygen). In fact, FSL-1 stimulated IL6 production was significantly enhanced in post-hypoxic HMEC-1 (<a href="#pone-0001364-g003">Fig. 3D</a>), showing that hypoxia enhances signaling through the TLR2/6 complexes. These findings confirms induction of TLR6 transcript, protein and function by ambient hypoxia.</p>
