Cells were exposed to normoxia and hypoxia for indicated time points. Total RNA was isolated and TLR6 mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to ß-actin and expressed as fold change relative to normoxia±SEM, where transcript levels in normoxic cells were normalized to 1. Results are derived from three different experiments. *, significant differences from normoxic cells (p&lt;0.01). <em>C</em>, Confluent HMEC-1 cells were grown to confluence and exposed to indicated periods of hypoxia. Result depicts a representative TLR6 Western blot from three separate experiments. The same blot was probed for ß-actin expression as a control for protein loading. <em>D</em>, Same amount of HMEC-1 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Cells were then stimulated with TLR2/6 agonist (FSL-1) at the indicated concentrations and exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h. After 24 h, generation of IL6 was measured by ELISA in the cell supernatant. Data are mean±SEM from 3 separate replicates. *, significant differences from untreated cells (p&lt;0.05); #, significant differences from normoxia and untreated cells (p&lt;0.05).</p>
