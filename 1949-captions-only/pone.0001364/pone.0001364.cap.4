Total RNA was isolated, and 1 µg of RNA was transcribed into first strand cDNA. Relative expressional levels of TLR2 transcript were compared to normoxic controls by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to internal control gene (ß-actin), and are expressed as fold change over normoxia±SEM, *, significant differences from normoxia and control cells (p&lt;0.05). Results are derived from three different experiments in each condition. <em>C</em>, Total RNA of normoxic monolayers of either wildtype (WT) or oxygen-stable HIF-1α expressing (HIF<sup>+/+</sup>) HMEC-1 cells was isolated and real-time RT-PCR was performed as described above. *, significant differences from wildtype cells (p&lt;0.001). <em>D</em>, Western blot analysis of TLR2 protein of normoxic HMEC-1 wild type (WT) and oxygen-stable HIF-1α expressing (HIF+/+) cells. The same blot was probed for ß-actin expression as a control for protein loading. <em>E</em>, HMEC-1 monolayers were treated with 1mM of dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), following measurement of TLR2 transcript levels by real-time RT-PCR as described above. *, significant differences from untreated cells (p&lt;0.001). <em>F</em>, ChIP assay was utilized to examine HIF-1α binding to the TLR2 promoter in normoxic and hypoxic HMEC-1 cells. Reaction controls included samples precipitated with protein G sepharose beads alone (beads), immunoprecipitations using a nonspecific igG monoclonal antibody (IgG) and PCR performed using HMEC-1 DNA (input). An example of three experiments is shown.</p>
