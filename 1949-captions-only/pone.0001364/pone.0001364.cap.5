                Figure 5.  Influence of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α on TLR6 expression during hypoxia.A, Map of TLR6 promoter region showing positions of the putative HIF binding sites and the binding site for NFκB relative to the transcription start site (TSS). B, Stable transfected HMEC-1 monolayers containing either HIF-1α siRNA or control-siRNA were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for indicated time points. Total RNA was isolated, and 1 µg of RNA was transcribed into first strand cDNA. Relative expressional levels of TLR6 transcripts were compared to normoxic controls by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to internal control gene (ß-actin), and are expressed as fold change over normoxia±SEM, *, significant differences from normoxia and control cells. Results are derived from three different experiments in each condition. C, Total RNA of normoxic monolayers of either wildtype (WT) or oxygen-stable HIF-1α expressing (HIF+/+) HMEC-1 cells was isolated and realt-time RT-PCR was performed as described above. *, significant differences from wildtype cells. D, Western blot analysis of TLR6 protein of normoxic HMEC-1 wildtype (WT) and oxygen-stable HIF-1α expressing (HIF+/+) cells. The same blot was probed for ß-actin expression as a control for protein loading. E, HMEC-1 monolayers were treated with 1mM of dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) for 24 hours. Afterwards transcript levels of TLR6 where quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described above. *, significant differences from untreated cells. F, ChIP assay was utilized to examine HIF-1α binding to the TLR6 promoter in normoxic and hypoxic HMEC-1 cells. Reaction controls included immunoprecipitations using a nonspecific igG monoclonal antibody (IgG) and PCR performed using HMEC-1 DNA (input). An example of three experiments is shown.
