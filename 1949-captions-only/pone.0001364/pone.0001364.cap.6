Tissue of Colon, Liver and Lung where harvested from mice after exposure to normoxia or normobaric hypoxia (8% O2, 92% N2 for 6h). Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative mRNA levels of TLR2 and TLR6 were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to ß-actin and expressed as fold change relative to normoxia±SEM and transcript levels in normoxic organs were normalized to 1. Results are derived from six animals in each condition (*p&lt;0.01, significant differences from normoxia).</p>
