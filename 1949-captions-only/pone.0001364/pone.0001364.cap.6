                Figure 6.  Expression of TLR2 and TLR6 during ambient hypoxia in vivo.A and B, Expression of TLR2 and TLR6 mRNA in normoxic or hypoxic organs. Tissue of Colon, Liver and Lung where harvested from mice after exposure to normoxia or normobaric hypoxia (8% O2, 92% N2 for 6h). Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative mRNA levels of TLR2 and TLR6 were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Data were calculated relative to ß-actin and expressed as fold change relative to normoxia±SEM and transcript levels in normoxic organs were normalized to 1. Results are derived from six animals in each condition (*p&lt;0.01, significant differences from normoxia).
