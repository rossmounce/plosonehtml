                Figure 7.  Pulmonary immunohistochemistry for TLR2 and TLR6 during hypoxia.A and B, Lungs from mice exposed to normoxia or normobaric hypoxia (8% O2, 92% N2 for 4h) were harvested, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with antibodies for TLR2 and TLR6 or isotype controls. This figure is representative of three experiments in each condition.
