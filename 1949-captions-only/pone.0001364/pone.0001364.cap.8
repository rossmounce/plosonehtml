                Figure 8.  Role of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 in TLR2 and TLR6 expression during hypoxia in vivo.Real-time RT-PCR analysis of murine epithelial TLR2 and TLR6 mRNA in conditional HIF-1α mutant (HIF-/-) and littermate control (WT) animals subjected to normoxia or hypoxia. Data were calculated relative to ß-actin and are expressed as fold change over normoxia±SEM, where transcript levels of control animals were normalized to 1. *, significant differences from normoxic control animals (p&lt;0.05). Results are derived from 8 animals in each condition.
