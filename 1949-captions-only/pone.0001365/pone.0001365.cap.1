<h4>50-kHz calls</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Throughout playback, 221 natural 50-kHz calls (total calling time: 15.3 s) were presented. The presentation was composed of a sequence of 3.5 s, which was repeated for 1 min, i.e. 17 times, to assure the presentation of a high number of frequency-modulated calls within a relatively short period of time. Each sequence contained 13 calls (total calling time: 0.90 s). Out of these, 10 were frequency-modulated and 3 were flat, and had the following features: call duration 0.07±0.01 s (mean±SEM); peak frequency: 61.24±1.75 kHz; bandwidth: 4.63±1.21 kHz; frequency modulation: 31.68±4.62 kHz. These calls had been recorded from a male Wistar rat during exploration of a cage containing scents from a cage mate (for setting and recording see: <a href="#pone.0001365-Whr2">[43]</a>).</p>


<h4>50-kHz tones</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>50-kHz sine wave tones were generated with the computer software SASLab Pro (version 4.2, Avisoft Bioacoustics) by replacing all calls through sine wave tones. In detail, each given call was replaced by a sine wave tone with identical duration, frequency, amplitude, etc. Thus, the signal had the same temporal patterning and was identical to the 50-kHz call signal with respect to all call features, apart from the fact that the tones were not amplitude and frequency modulated as the natural 50-kHz calls.</p>


<h4>22-kHz calls</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>Throughout playback, 29 natural 22-kHz calls (total calling time: 34.25 s) were presented. These calls had the following acoustic parameters: call duration 1.18±0.06 s; peak frequency: 23.61±0.07 kHz; bandwidth: 1.37±0.05 kHz; frequency modulation: 1.90±0.09 kHz. Their presentation was not composed of a repeated sequence, since in case of the long 22-kHz calls potential information, which is contained in temporal patterning is likely lost through sequencing. These calls had been recorded from a male Wistar rat after applications of foot-shocks (for setting and recording see: <a href="#pone.0001365-Whr1">[10]</a>).</p>


<h4>Noise</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1"></a><p>Since all three acoustic stimuli presented contained background noise, i.e. sounds, which occur when a rat is exploring an arena with bedding, background noise without calls or tones was presented to control for its possible effects.</p>


<h4>Experimental procedure</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p1"></a><p>A given animal was placed onto the central platform of the radial maze, facing the arm opposite to the loudspeaker. After an initial phase of 15 min where no acoustic stimuli were presented (termed habituation), the rat was exposed to three presentations of acoustic stimuli for 1 min, each followed by an inter-stimulus-interval of 10 min.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p2"></a><p>Between sub-groups of subjects, different orders of stimulation presentation were used to account for the possible impact of sequence effects. In Exp. 1, background noise, 22-kHz calls and 50-kHz calls were used as acoustic stimuli. They were presented in the following orders: a) background noise, b) 22-kHz calls, c) 50-kHz calls (n = 6 rats), or a) background noise, b) 50-kHz calls, c) 22-kHz calls (n = 6). In Exp. 2 and 3, where background noise, 50-kHz sine wave tones and 50-kHz calls were tested used, they were presented either in the order a) background noise, b) 50-kHz sine wave tones, c) 50-kHz calls (Exp. 2: n = 6; Exp. 3: n = 12), or a) background noise, b) 50-kHz calls, c) 50-kHz sine wave tones (Exp. 2: n = 6; Exp. 3: n = 12), or a) 50-kHz calls, b) 50-kHz sine wave tones, c) background noise (Exp. 3: n = 12), or a) 50-kHz calls, background noise, 50-kHz sine wave tones (Exp. 2: n = 7). One animal was excluded from analysis of Exp. 2 due to incorrect presentation of acoustic stimuli.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec8.p3"></a><p>We abstained from depicting the order of stimulus presentation in detail, since it had no major qualitative effects on the patterns of result, i.e. behavioral responses towards 22-kHz calls and 50-kHz calls were similar over all positions (Mann-Whitney-U-test for Exp. 1 or Kruskal-Wallis-test for Exp. 2 &amp; 3: all p-values &gt;.100).</p>


<h4>Recording and analysis of animal activity</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>Behavior was monitored by a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP 330/GE, Hamburg, Germany) from about 150 cm above the maze, which fed into DVD recorder (DVR-3100 S, Pioneer, Willich, Germany).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2"></a><p>Behavioral analysis was performed in two ways. A trained observer scored the videos for the time spent on the three arms proximal to or distal from the ultrasonic loudspeaker. Furthermore, the total distance travelled (cm), and the number of arm entries into the three proximal or distal arms, were analyzed using an automated video tracking system (Ethovision, Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). For the automated analysis, input filters were activated to avoid an over-estimation of locomotor activity due to head-movements. In more detail, a minimal distance moved of 8 cm was used for the total distance travelled, whereas a minimal distance moved of 3 cm was used for the arm entries.</p>


<h4>Recording and analysis of ultrasonic vocalization</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p1"></a><p>Playback of acoustic stimuli and potential ultrasonic calls uttered by the rat under testing were monitored by two UltraSoundGate Condenser Microphones (CM 16; Avisoft Bioacoustics) placed 20 cm away from the maze at a height of 55 cm above the floor. One out of these two was placed next to the loudspeaker, i.e. in front of the three proximal arms, whereas the other one was placed vis-à-vis in front of the three distal arms. These microphones were sensitive to frequencies of 15-180 kHz with a flat frequency response (± 6 dB) between 25–140 kHz, and were connected via an Avisoft UltraSoundGate 416 USB Audio device (Avisoft Bioacoustics) to a personal computer, where acoustic data were displayed in real time by Avisoft RECORDER (version 2.7; Avisoft Bioacoustics), and were recorded with a sampling rate of 214,285 Hz in16 bit format.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec10.p2"></a><p>For acoustical analysis, recordings were transferred to SASLab Pro (version 4.38; Avisoft Bioacoustics) and a fast Fourier transform was conducted (512 FFT-length, 100 % frame, Hamming window and 75 % time window overlap). Correspondingly, the spectrograms were produced at 488 Hz of frequency resolution and 0.512 ms of time resolution. The numbers of 22-kHz calls and 50-kHz calls were counted by experienced observers.</p>


<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec11.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec11.p1"></a><p>Non-parametric statistics were used, since several data sets were not normally distributed as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk-test. In more detail, the Friedman-test for repeated measurements was calculated to test whether overt or calling behavior is affected by presentation of acoustic stimuli. When appropriate, the Wilcoxon-test was used subsequently to determine whether overt or calling behavior during presentation of a given acoustic stimulus differ in comparison to other acoustic stimuli, or in comparison to phases without presentations of acoustic stimuli. For the last purpose, overt and calling behavior shown in the three min preceding stimulus application was averaged to eliminate habituation effects. Furthermore, the Wilcoxon-test was used to compare the entries into or the time spent on proximal or distal arms of the radial-maze during a given test period. Finally, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to test whether individual responses to different acoustic stimuli were stable and whether overt and calling behaviors were related to each other. The exact p-values of 2-tailed testing were taken as measures of effect.</p>

<h4>Experiment 1 – juvenile rats</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>This initial experiment was performed to test whether presentation of ultrasonic calls is effective to modify behavior in juvenile rats. Here, we used 22-kHz calls, for which we expected behavioral inhibition, and natural 50-kHz calls, for which we expected activation and orientation towards the source of stimulation.</p>


<h4>Locomotor activity</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>Locomotor activity of juvenile rats was affected by presentations of acoustic stimuli (see <a href="#pone-0001365-g002">Fig. 2</a>), since the distance travelled was dependent on a) whether acoustic stimuli were presented or not and b) which type of stimulus was presented. In detail, natural 50-kHz calls caused an increase in the distance travelled in comparison to test periods without presentations (Z = −2.353, p = .016), or to presentation of noise (Z = −2.934, p = .001). In contrast, locomotor activity was reduced when natural 22-kHz calls were presented, indicated by a decrease when compared versus natural 50-kHz calls (Z = −2.746, p = .003), and a trend for a decrease in comparison to test periods without presentations (Z = −1.955, p = .055), but not in comparison to presentation of noise (Z = −.415, p = .734). Finally, no difference in locomotor activity was found between test periods without presentations and background noise (Z = −1.070, p = .322).</p>
