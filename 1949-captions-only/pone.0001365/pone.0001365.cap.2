                Figure 2.  Locomotor activity of juvenile rats in Exp. 1.Bars depict the distance travelled during test phases without acoustic presentation (nothing), presentation of noise (noise), artificial 50-kHz sine wave tones (50-kHz tones), and natural 50-kHz calls (50-kHz calls). Values reflect meansÂ±SEM per minute. Animals of all stimulus orders were collapsed, i.e. n = 12. Comparisons with p&lt;.05 are marked with asterisks: *.
