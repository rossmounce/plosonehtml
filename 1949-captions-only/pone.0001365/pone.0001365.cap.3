                Figure 3.  Stimulus-directed locomotor activity of juvenile rats in Exp. 1.The time spent on the proximal arms in front of the loudspeaker is given for playback of natural 22-kHz calls (white bar) and natural 50-kHz calls (black bar) is depicted on the left. On the right, the time spent on the proximal arms in front of the loudspeaker is given for the 10 min after cessation of playback of natural 22-kHz calls (open symbols) and natural 50-kHz calls (filled symbols). Values reflect meansÂ±SEM per minute. In both cases, animals of all stimulus orders were collapsed, i.e. n = 12. Comparisons with p&lt;.05 are marked with asterisks: *.
