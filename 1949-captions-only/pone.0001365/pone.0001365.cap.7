                Figure 7.  Stimulus-directed locomotor activity of adult rats in Exp. 3.The number of entries into the distal (black bars) or proximal (white bars) arms from the loudspeaker is given for habituation (HAB), inter-stimulus-intervals (ISI), and playback of acoustic stimuli, i.e. natural 50-kHz calls (50-kHz calls), artificial 50-kHz sine wave tones (50-kHz tones), and background noise (noise) in the upper figure. The time spent on the distal (black bars) or proximal (white bars) arms from the loudspeaker is given for habituation (HAB), inter-stimulus-intervals (ISI), and playback of acoustic stimuli, i.e. natural 50-kHz calls (50-kHz calls), artificial 50-kHz sine wave tones (50-kHz tones), and background noise (noise) in the bottom figure. Values reflect meansÂ±SEM per minute. In both cases, animals of all stimulus orders were collapsed, i.e. n = 36. Comparisons with p&lt;.05 are marked with asterisks: *.
