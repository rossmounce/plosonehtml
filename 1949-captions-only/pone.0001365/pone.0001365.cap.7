The time spent on the distal (black bars) or proximal (white bars) arms from the loudspeaker is given for habituation (HAB), inter-stimulus-intervals (ISI), and playback of acoustic stimuli, i.e. natural 50-kHz calls (50-kHz calls), artificial 50-kHz sine wave tones (50-kHz tones), and background noise (noise) in the bottom figure. Values reflect meansÂ±SEM per minute. In both cases, animals of all stimulus orders were collapsed, i.e. n = 36. Comparisons with p&lt;.05 are marked with asterisks: *.</p>
