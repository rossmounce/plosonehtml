                Figure 1.  Stress-induced motor pattern failure is associated with surges of [K+]o.Simultaneous recordings of the ventilatory motor pattern (Vent), the temperature of the superfusing saline at the MTG (Temp in A) and the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o). A. An abrupt increase in [K+]o was reliably associated with heat-induced failure of the ventilatory motor pattern, which occurred in 100% of preparations (N = 17). [K+]o was restored to normal baseline levels if heat was removed and this was associated with recovery of ventilatory motor patterning. B. 10−3 M NaN3 was bath-applied until 1 minute post-failure (N = 6). [K+]o gradually decreased and the motor pattern recovered upon superfusion of standard locust saline. C. N2 was bubbled into the superfusing saline for 5 minutes, then blown over the preparation until 1 minute post-failure (N = 18). Re-oxygenation resulted in [K+]o clearance and recovery of the motor pattern. i and ii show expansions of the motor pattern trace pre- and post-stress to show more clearly the ventilatory motor pattern. In B and C the temperature was constant at room temperature (~22°C).
