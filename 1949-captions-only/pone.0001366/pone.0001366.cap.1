A. An abrupt increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was reliably associated with heat-induced failure of the ventilatory motor pattern, which occurred in 100% of preparations (N = 17). [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was restored to normal baseline levels if heat was removed and this was associated with recovery of ventilatory motor patterning. B. 10<sup>−3</sup> M NaN<sub>3</sub> was bath-applied until 1 minute post-failure (N = 6). [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> gradually decreased and the motor pattern recovered upon superfusion of standard locust saline. C. N<sub>2</sub> was bubbled into the superfusing saline for 5 minutes, then blown over the preparation until 1 minute post-failure (N = 18). Re-oxygenation resulted in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> clearance and recovery of the motor pattern. i and ii show expansions of the motor pattern trace pre- and post-stress to show more clearly the ventilatory motor pattern. In B and C the temperature was constant at room temperature (~22°C).</p>
