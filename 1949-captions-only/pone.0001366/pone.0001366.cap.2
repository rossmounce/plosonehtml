                Figure 2.  Characteristics of [K+]o surges.Simultaneous recordings of the ventilatory motor pattern (Vent), a monitor of pressure-injection of a bolus of K+ within the MTG (Trig in B) and the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o). A. Continuous bath application of 10−4 M ouabain elicited multiple surges in [K+]o (N = 13). In the experiment shown here it took 434 seconds for 10−4 M ouabain to penetrate the MTG and induce failure of motor pattern generation. B. A 35 nl pressure-injection of locust saline containing a 15-fold higher [K+] (150 mM compared to 10 mM) into the MTG neuropile was sufficient to bring [K+]o to threshold and induce an abrupt surge (N = 18). C. Two K+ -sensitive microelectrodes were inserted in different regions of the MTG (a and b) to illustrate propagation (dotted line). In this experiment the propagation speed was 1.9 mm/min.
