A. Continuous bath application of 10<sup>−4</sup> M ouabain elicited multiple surges in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (N = 13). In the experiment shown here it took 434 seconds for 10<sup>−4</sup> M ouabain to penetrate the MTG and induce failure of motor pattern generation. B. A 35 nl pressure-injection of locust saline containing a 15-fold higher [K<sup>+</sup>] (150 mM compared to 10 mM) into the MTG neuropile was sufficient to bring [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to threshold and induce an abrupt surge (N = 18). C. Two K<sup>+</sup> -sensitive microelectrodes were inserted in different regions of the MTG (a and b) to illustrate propagation (dotted line). In this experiment the propagation speed was 1.9 mm/min.</p>
