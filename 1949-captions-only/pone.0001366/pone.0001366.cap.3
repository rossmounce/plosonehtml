When the heater was turned off [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> remained elevated and motor pattern generation failed to recover (N = 11). B. Only the second plateau was evident during temperature increase to ~60°C following prior anoxic arrest of motor pattern generation. When the N<sub>2</sub> was turned off and internal temperature returned to room temperature [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> remained elevated and motor pattern generation failed to recover (N = 12).</p>
