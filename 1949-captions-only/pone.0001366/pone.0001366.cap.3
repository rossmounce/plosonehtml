                Figure 3.  The hyperthermic [K+]o event is not representative of complete collapse of the K+ gradient.A. During a continuous increase of temperature [K+]o increased sharply at ~40°C coincident with motor pattern failure and continued to rise until a second plateau was reached at ~60°C. When the heater was turned off [K+]o remained elevated and motor pattern generation failed to recover (N = 11). B. Only the second plateau was evident during temperature increase to ~60°C following prior anoxic arrest of motor pattern generation. When the N2 was turned off and internal temperature returned to room temperature [K+]o remained elevated and motor pattern generation failed to recover (N = 12).
