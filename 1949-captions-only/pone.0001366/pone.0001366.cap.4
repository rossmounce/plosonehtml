The hyperthermic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> event occurred at a significantly higher temperature (measured at dotted line) in the absence of electrical activity (46±1°C) compared to CON locusts (39±1°C) (C) (N<sub>CON</sub> = 17; N<sub>TTX</sub> = 15). B. 10<sup>−1</sup> M TEA significantly reduced the hyperthermic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> event (N<sub>CON</sub> = 17; N<sub>TEA</sub> = 6) (D). [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increased with continued temperature increase to ~60°C.</p>
