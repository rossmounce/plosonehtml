                Figure 4.  The hyperthermic [K+]o event is delayed by blocking Na+ channels and neural activity using TTX and is diminished by blocking K+ channels using TEA. A. 10−6 M TTX abolished electrical activity within minutes while [K+]o remained stable.The abrupt rise in [K+]o was not significantly diminished by TTX. The hyperthermic [K+]o event occurred at a significantly higher temperature (measured at dotted line) in the absence of electrical activity (46±1°C) compared to CON locusts (39±1°C) (C) (NCON = 17; NTTX = 15). B. 10−1 M TEA significantly reduced the hyperthermic [K+]o event (NCON = 17; NTEA = 6) (D). [K+]o increased with continued temperature increase to ~60°C.
