ATP levels did not differ from the pre-stress level (Normoxia at room temperature; N = 16) in locusts treated with 10<sup>âˆ’4</sup> M ouabain or hyperthermia (HS) at failure or recovery, or in all other groups at recovery following stress-induced failure with the exception of NaN<sub>3</sub>-treated locusts. There was a main effect of treatment driven by significant differences among groups within failure and recovery (not indicated by symbols). There was no effect of HS pre-treatment on ATP levels at failure or recovery of motor pattern generation. Asterisks indicate significant differences from the pre-stress level and daggers indicate significantly different ATP levels at failure and recovery in ganglia of NaN<sub>3</sub>-treated locusts. Sample sizes (failure, recovery): N<sub>Ouabain</sub> = 10,11; N<sub>HS-hyperthermia</sub> = 8,8; N<sub>Anoxia</sub> = 9,8; N<sub>CON-hyperthermia</sub> = 7,7; N<sub>Sodium azide</sub> = 8,9. B. CON and HS locusts did not have significantly different ATP levels during anoxia-induced coma or subsequent recovery. ATP levels dropped in both CON and HS locusts after 30 minutes of anoxia and remained stable until locusts were removed from the anoxic environment. ATP levels increased to around pre-anoxia values after one hour in normally oxygenated air. Sample sizes (CON, HS): N<sub>0min</sub> = 16,16; N<sub>15min</sub> = 12,11; N<sub>30min</sub> = 11,11; N<sub>60min</sub> = 9,9; N<sub>120min</sub> = 12,11; N<sub>150min</sub> = 11,12; N<sub>180min</sub> = 10,10. Asterisks indicate significant differences from 0 and 15 minutes and daggers indicate significant differences from 180 minutes (or 60 minutes recovery) according to <em>post hoc</em> Tukey tests (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05).</p>
