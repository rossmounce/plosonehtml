Heat shock preconditioning resulted in a significantly higher [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in HS locusts compared to CON locusts. All animals pooled: N<sub>CON</sub> = 25; N<sub>HS</sub> = 26. B. CON-OUA and HS-OUA locusts had a significantly greater increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> after 15 minutes of bath application with 10<sup>−5</sup> M ouabain compared to CON and HS locusts. HS pre-treatment did not have an effect on Δ[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> over this 15 minute period (N<sub>CON</sub> = 12; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 10; N<sub>HS</sub> = 17; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 8). C. CON and HS locusts had a markedly different Δ[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in response to a 5°C increase in temperature. Δ[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was positive in CON locusts and negative in HS locusts after only one minute of temperature increase. There was no effect of 10<sup>−5</sup> M ouabain treatment on Δ[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> one minute into the temperature ramp (N<sub>CON</sub> = 12; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 10; N<sub>HS</sub> = 17; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 8). Asterisks indicate a significant effect of ouabain and daggers indicate a significant effect of pre-treatment according to <em>t</em>-test (A) and <em>post hoc</em> Tukey tests (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05) (B,C).</p>
