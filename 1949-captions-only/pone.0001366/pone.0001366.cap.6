                Figure 6.  HS and ouabain affect [K+]o.A. Heat shock preconditioning resulted in a significantly higher [K+]o in HS locusts compared to CON locusts. All animals pooled: NCON = 25; NHS = 26. B. CON-OUA and HS-OUA locusts had a significantly greater increase in [K+]o after 15 minutes of bath application with 10−5 M ouabain compared to CON and HS locusts. HS pre-treatment did not have an effect on Δ[K+]o over this 15 minute period (NCON = 12; NCON-OUA = 10; NHS = 17; NHS-OUA = 8). C. CON and HS locusts had a markedly different Δ[K+]o in response to a 5°C increase in temperature. Δ[K+]o was positive in CON locusts and negative in HS locusts after only one minute of temperature increase. There was no effect of 10−5 M ouabain treatment on Δ[K+]o one minute into the temperature ramp (NCON = 12; NCON-OUA = 10; NHS = 17; NHS-OUA = 8). Asterisks indicate a significant effect of ouabain and daggers indicate a significant effect of pre-treatment according to t-test (A) and post hoc Tukey tests (P&lt;0.05) (B,C).
