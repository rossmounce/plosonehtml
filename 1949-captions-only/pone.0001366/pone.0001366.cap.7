                Figure 7.  HS delays the [K+]o event and speeds recovery by increasing the rate of [K+]o clearance.A. Time to recovery was positively correlated with failure temperature in CON and HS locusts (NCON = 13; NHS = 15). Animals whose ventilatory motor pattern failed at a higher temperature had a longer time to recovery when temperature returned to normal levels. B. The correlations seen in CON and HS animals were shifted in animals treated with 10−5 M ouabain (NCON-OUA = 9; NHS-OUA = 8). The relationship between failure temperature and time to recovery in HS-OUA animals resembled CON animals. Data points for each group were fitted with exponential curves that rise to a plateau (A, B). C. Ventilatory motor pattern generation in HS locusts failed at a significantly higher temperature than in CON locusts with and without 10−5 M ouabain treatment. There was a significant effect of ouabain on the ability to withstand high temperature stress in CON locusts but not in HS locusts (NCON = 15; NCON-OUA = 9; NHS = 17; NHS-OUA = 8). D. Ventilatory motor pattern generation in HS locusts took significantly less time to recover following heat-induced failure than in CON locusts with and without ouabain treatment. CON-OUA locusts took significantly more time to recover than CON locusts, however there was no significant effect of ouabain treatment on time to recovery in HS locusts (NCON = 13; NCON-OUA = 10; NHS = 15; NHS-OUA = 8). E. Overall there were no main effects of HS pre-treatment or ouabain treatment on the rate of [K+]o increase (mM/s) associated with failure of the motor pattern (NCON = 15; NCON-OUA = 10; NHS = 18; NHS-OUA = 7). F. The rate of [K+]o decrease (mM/s) associated with recovery of the motor pattern was significantly greater in HS locusts than in CON locusts and this effect of pre-treatment was conserved in ouabain-treated locusts. Ouabain treatment significantly decreased the rate of [K+]o clearance in CON locusts but not in HS locusts (NCON = 15; NCON-OUA = 10; NHS = 18; NHS-OUA = 8). Asterisks indicate a significant effect of ouabain and daggers indicate a significant effect of pre-treatment according to post hoc Tukey tests (P&lt;0.05) (C–F).
