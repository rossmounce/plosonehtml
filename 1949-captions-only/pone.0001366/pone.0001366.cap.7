Time to recovery was positively correlated with failure temperature in CON and HS locusts (N<sub>CON</sub> = 13; N<sub>HS</sub> = 15). Animals whose ventilatory motor pattern failed at a higher temperature had a longer time to recovery when temperature returned to normal levels. B. The correlations seen in CON and HS animals were shifted in animals treated with 10<sup>−5</sup> M ouabain (N<sub>CON-OUA = </sub>9; N<sub>HS-OUA = </sub>8). The relationship between failure temperature and time to recovery in HS-OUA animals resembled CON animals. Data points for each group were fitted with exponential curves that rise to a plateau (A, B). C. Ventilatory motor pattern generation in HS locusts failed at a significantly higher temperature than in CON locusts with and without 10<sup>−5</sup> M ouabain treatment. There was a significant effect of ouabain on the ability to withstand high temperature stress in CON locusts but not in HS locusts (N<sub>CON</sub> = 15; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 9; N<sub>HS</sub> = 17; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 8). D. Ventilatory motor pattern generation in HS locusts took significantly less time to recover following heat-induced failure than in CON locusts with and without ouabain treatment. CON-OUA locusts took significantly more time to recover than CON locusts, however there was no significant effect of ouabain treatment on time to recovery in HS locusts (N<sub>CON</sub> = 13; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 10; N<sub>HS</sub> = 15; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 8). E. Overall there were no main effects of HS pre-treatment or ouabain treatment on the rate of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increase (mM/s) associated with failure of the motor pattern (N<sub>CON</sub> = 15; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 10; N<sub>HS</sub> = 18; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 7). F. The rate of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> decrease (mM/s) associated with recovery of the motor pattern was significantly greater in HS locusts than in CON locusts and this effect of pre-treatment was conserved in ouabain-treated locusts. Ouabain treatment significantly decreased the rate of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> clearance in CON locusts but not in HS locusts (N<sub>CON</sub> = 15; N<sub>CON-OUA</sub> = 10; N<sub>HS</sub> = 18; N<sub>HS-OUA</sub> = 8). Asterisks indicate a significant effect of ouabain and daggers indicate a significant effect of pre-treatment according to <em>post hoc</em> Tukey tests (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05) (C–F).</p>
