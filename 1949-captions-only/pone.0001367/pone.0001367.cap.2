                Figure 2.  Estimated ln(probability of the data) and Var[ln(probability of the data)] for k from 2 to 5.Values are from STRUCTURE run three times at each value of k, using A) 89 SSRs; B) 847 SNPs; C) 554 SNP haplotypes; D) 89 SSRs+847 SNPs. The blue diamonds are ln(probability of the data) and the pink squares are var[ln(probability of the data)].
