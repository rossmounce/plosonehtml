                Figure 4.  Correlation between genetic distance based on SSRs and SNPs.Each point represents the genetic distance between a pair of individuals, based on sharing of SSR (x axis) or SNP (y axis) alleles. The top panel shows the relationship for pairs of individuals whose SSR distance is &lt;0.65; the bottom panel shows the relationship for pairs of individuals whose SSR distance is â‰¥0.65.
