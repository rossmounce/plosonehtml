<h4>Materials</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Synthetic 18:0-20:4 plasmenylethanolamine (pPtdEtn) and other synthetic phospholipids used in the study were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL, USA). Solvents for sample preparation and for MS analysis were obtained from Burdick and Jackson (Burdick and Jackson, Muskegon, MI, USA). All other chemical reagents were at least analytical grade or the best grade available and obtained from either Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) or Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA) or as indicated.</p>


<h4>Preparation of lipid extracts from biological samples</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Fresh bovine heart was obtained from a local slaughter house. Male mice (C57BL/6, 4 months of age) or male Sprague-Dawley rats (2 months of age) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) or Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA), respectively. Male New Zealand white rabbits (2–3 lbs. body weight) were purchased from Myrtles Rabbitry, Inc. (Thompson Station, TN, USA). Animals were sacrificed by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide. Brain, heart, kidney, liver, intestine, dorsal root ganglial tissues were dissected, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline to remove blood, blotted with Kim-wipes to remove excess buffer, and immediately freeze-clamped at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Wafers were pulverized into a fine powder with a stainless steel mortar and pestle. Each individual tissue sample (approximately 10 mg of fine powder) was weighed into a disposable glass test tube. A mixture of necessary internal standards were added to each individual homogenate prior to extraction by using a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure <a href="#pone.0001368-Bligh1">[21]</a> as described previously <a href="#pone.0001368-Cheng2">[22]</a>. Each lipid extract was reconstituted with a volume of 500 µl chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) per mg protein. The lipid extracts were finally flushed with nitrogen, capped, and stored at −20°C for ESI/MS analyses (typically within one week). PtdEtn from bovine heart was isolated by using HPLC of lipid extracts employing a silica based cation-exchange column as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Gross3">[23]</a>. Each lipid solution was diluted appropriately prior to infusion and lipid analysis to prevent aggregation and minimize the residual salt content.</p>


<h4>Instrumentation and mass spectrometry</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Lipid extracts were diluted in chloroform/methanol/isopropanol (1:2:4, v/v/v) to a final concentration of 10–50 pmol total lipids/µl followed by addition of a small amount of LiOH prior to direct infusion. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an automated nanospray apparatus (i.e., Nanomate HD, Advion Bioscience Ltd., Ithaca, NY, USA). An ionization voltage of 1.1 kV and a gas pressure of 0.3 psi on the Nanomate apparatus were employed in the analyses. The Nanomate was controlled by Chipsoft 6.3.2 software. The LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode under a resolution setting of 60,000. The temperature of the ion transfer tube in the ion source was set at 160°C. Product-ion analyses were conducted using a peak width setting of 1 Th by selection of the molecular ion in the linear ion trap, a normalized collision energy in the C-trap of 55%, and a gas pressure of 1 mT prior to analyses of the resultant product ions in the Orbitrap. Mass spectra in both full scan and MS/MS scan modes were acquired under the control of Xcalibur software.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>Shotgun lipidomics analyses of PtdEtn molecular species of all lipid extracts were also performed on a QqQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum Ultra Plus, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ion source as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Han8">[20]</a>. All ESI/MS analyses of lipids were conducted by direct infusion employing a Harvard syringe pump at a flow rate of 4 µl/min. Typically, a 1-min period of signal averaging was employed for each mass spectrum and a 2-min period of signal averaging was employed for each tandem MS spectrum. A mass resolution of 0.7 Th at half peak width was used for both MS and tandem MS analyses performed by the QqQ mass spectrometer. For tandem mass spectrometry, a collision gas pressure was set at 1.0 mT, but the collision energy varied with the classes of lipids analyzed as described previously <a href="#pone.0001368-Han6">[18]</a>.</p>


<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchroninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data from biological samples were normalized to the protein content and all data are presented as the mean±SD of n≥4 for lipid analyses.</p>

<h4>High mass accuracy and CID fragmentation analyses reveal the presence of paired, isomeric plasmenylethanolamine molecular species in isolated bovine heart PtdEtn</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>PtdEtn molecular species were readily analyzed as deprotonated molecular ions by ESI/MS in the negative-ion mode (<a href="#pone-0001368-g002">Figure 2</a>) as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Han6">[18]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001368-Han9">[24]</a>. Abundant pPtdEtn molecular species were present in isolated bovine heart PtdEtn as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Schwudke1">[25]</a>. However, isobaric ions to these pPtdEtn molecular species (corresponding to phosphatidylethanolamine (dPtdEtn) molecular species) were also present and were readily resolved using the high resolution present in an Orbitrap analyzer (Inset B of <a href="#pone-0001368-g002">Figure 2</a>). Tandem MS analysis of each individual isobaric ion peak corresponding to a representative deprotonated pPtdEtn molecular species always demonstrated the presence of multiple pPtdEtn isomers along with isomeric plasmanylethanolamine (aPtdEtn) and isobaric dPtdEtn molecular species (<a href="#pone-0001368-g002">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0001368-g003">3</a> and <a href="#pone-0001368-t001">Table 1</a>). For example, product-ion MS analysis of an isobaric ion at <em>m/z</em> 772.5 (0.26% relative abundance to the base peak at <em>m/z</em> 766.54, <a href="#pone-0001368-g002">Figure 2</a>, inset A of <a href="#pone-0001368-g002">Figure 2</a>, and <a href="#pone-0001368-t001">Table 1</a>) from bovine heart PtdEtn in the negative-ion mode was performed with a mass selection window of 1 Th using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer after collision-induced activation (CID). The CID analysis of this isobaric ion demonstrated multiple abundant fragment ions in the carboxylate region in an order of abundance at <em>m/z</em> 281.25 (i.e., 18:1 FA), <em>m/z</em> 329.25 (i.e., 22:5 FA), <em>m/z</em> 279.23 (i.e., 18:2 FA), <em>m/z</em> 327.23 (i.e., 22:6 FA), <em>m/z</em> 311.29 (i.e., 20:0 FA), <em>m/z</em> 309.28 (i.e., 20:1 FA), <em>m/z</em> 283.26 (i.e., 18:0 FA), and <em>m/z</em> 303.23 (i.e., 20:4 FA) (inset of <a href="#pone-0001368-g003">Figure 3A</a>). It is noteworthy that the ions at <em>m/z</em> 283.24 and 285.26 (inset of <a href="#pone-0001368-g003">Figure 3A</a>) correspond to aliphatic anions resulting from the loss of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule from 22:6 FA (<em>m/z</em> 327.23) and 22:5 FA (<em>m/z</em> 329.25), respectively. Loss of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule from polyunsaturated fatty acyl carboxylates (e.g., 20:5, 22:5, and 22:6 FA) is common as previously demonstrated <a href="#pone.0001368-Cheng1">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001368-Ejsing1">[17]</a>. Loss of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule from arachidonate (20:4 FA) can also be detected, but is relatively less rapid in comparison to other aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids. The most common fragmentation pathway likely results from the resonance stabilized anion conjugated to olefinic π clouds. Since the content of the selected molecular ion at <em>m/z</em> 772.5 was markedly decreased in the lipid mixture following treatment with acid vapor as described previously <a href="#pone.0001368-Cheng1">[5]</a>, this ion largely represented a deprotonated pPtdEtn or isomeric pPtdEtn mixtures. Based on the identified FA carboxylates through accurate mass analyses, the accurate mass of the precursor ion (i.e., <em>m/z</em> 772.53), and the known information about the ion (i.e., predominantly deprotonated pPtdEtn), gave rise to the conclusion that the ion at <em>m/z</em> 772.53 is comprised of at least four pPtdEtn isomers, including 18:2-22:5, 18:1-22:6, 22:6-18:1, and 22:5-18:2 pPtdEtn molecular species in the order of relative abundance. The molar ratio of these isomers was approximately 6:5:5:4 from the intensities of FA carboxylates after considering the differential fragmentation kinetics of different molecular species as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Han9">[24]</a>. The relative ratios of each individual molecular species are listed in parentheses underneath the corresponding molecular species in <a href="#pone-0001368-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
