                Figure 2.  Representative negative-ion ESI/MS analyses of bovine heart ethanolamine glycerophospholipid molecular species.Bovine heart lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure [21] and the PtdEtn fraction was separated by using HPLC with a cation-exchange column as previously described [23]. Analyses of PtdEtn molecular species were performed in the negative-ion mode by using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanomate device as described under “MATERIALS AND METHODS”.
