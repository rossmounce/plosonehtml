                Figure 3.  Product ion analyses of individual molecular species present in isolated bovine heart ethanolamine glycerophospholipids.Product ion ESI/MS analyses of PtdEtn molecular species in isolated bovine heart ethanolamine glycerophospholipids at m/z 772.5 (Panel A) and 774.5 (Panel B) were performed by using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Analyses were conducted using a peak width setting of 1 Th by selection of the molecular ion in the linear ion trap (LTQ), collision activation in the C-trap with a normalized collision energy of 55% and gas pressure of 1 mTorr, and analysis of the resultant product ions in the Orbitrap.
