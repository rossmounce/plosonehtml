                Figure 4.  Product ion analyses of synthetic 18:0-20:4 plasmenylethanolamine molecular species in the negative-ion mode.Product ion ESI/MS analysis of deprotonated 18:0-20:4 plasmenylethanolamine at m/z 750.54 was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a C-trap using an ion selective window of 1 Th by LTQ. Collision activation in C-trap was carried out with normalized collision energy of 55% and gas pressure of 1 mT. The resultant fragment ions were analyzed in the Orbitrap. The arrow indicates the absence of the 18:0 FA carboxylate in the spectrum after amplifying the position greater than1,000 fold.
