Collision activation in C-trap was carried out with normalized collision energy of 55% and gas pressure of 1 mT. The resultant fragment ions were analyzed in the Orbitrap. The arrow indicates the absence of the 18:0 FA carboxylate in the spectrum after amplifying the position greater than1,000 fold.</p>
