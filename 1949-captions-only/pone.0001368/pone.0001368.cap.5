                Figure 5.  Quantitative analyses of ether lysoPtdEtn produced by alkaline hydrolysis of fatty acyl esters in bovine heart PtdEtn.Bovine heart PtdEtn solution was treated with LiOMe leading to the cleavage of the FA ester bonds in the PtdEtn pool as previously described [26]. The resultant lysoPtdEtn mixture containing an ether aliphatic chain at the sn-1 position of glycerol was recovered using a modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer [21]. The mass spectrum in panel A was acquired in the negative-ion mode by using a QqQ mass spectrometer directly from the lysoPtdEtn solution that was diluted to less than 50 pmol of total lipids/µl. The mass spectrum in panel B was acquired in the negative-ion mode directly from a diluted lysoPtdEtn solution after addition of Fmoc chloride as previously described [16]. The mass spectrum in panel C was acquired in the negative-ion mode as that of spectrum B but in the neutral loss mode. The neutral loss scanning was conducted through coordinately scanning the first and third quadrupoles with a mass difference of 222.2 u (i.e., loss of a Fmoc) while the collisional activation was performed in the second quadrupole at collision energy of 32 eV. “IS” denotes internal standard. Panel D shows the comparison of ether aliphatic chain profiles in bovine heart PtdEtn determined by using different approaches: (1) direct quantitation of the resultant ether lysoPtdEtn molecular species from alkaline hydrolysis of PtdEtn (closed column) through a two-step quantitation procedure [5] from spectra A and C and (2) calculated composition (open column) derived from individual PtdEtn molecular species listed in Table 1.
