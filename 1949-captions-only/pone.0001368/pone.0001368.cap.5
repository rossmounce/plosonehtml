The resultant lysoPtdEtn mixture containing an ether aliphatic chain at the <em>sn</em>-1 position of glycerol was recovered using a modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer <a href="#pone.0001368-Bligh1">[21]</a>. The mass spectrum in panel A was acquired in the negative-ion mode by using a QqQ mass spectrometer directly from the lysoPtdEtn solution that was diluted to less than 50 pmol of total lipids/µl. The mass spectrum in panel B was acquired in the negative-ion mode directly from a diluted lysoPtdEtn solution after addition of Fmoc chloride as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Han5">[16]</a>. The mass spectrum in panel C was acquired in the negative-ion mode as that of spectrum B but in the neutral loss mode. The neutral loss scanning was conducted through coordinately scanning the first and third quadrupoles with a mass difference of 222.2 u (i.e., loss of a Fmoc) while the collisional activation was performed in the second quadrupole at collision energy of 32 eV. “IS” denotes internal standard. Panel D shows the comparison of ether aliphatic chain profiles in bovine heart PtdEtn determined by using different approaches: (1) direct quantitation of the resultant ether lysoPtdEtn molecular species from alkaline hydrolysis of PtdEtn (closed column) through a two-step quantitation procedure <a href="#pone.0001368-Cheng1">[5]</a> from spectra A and C and (2) calculated composition (open column) derived from individual PtdEtn molecular species listed in <a href="#pone-0001368-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
