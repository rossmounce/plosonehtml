Spectrum A was acquired in the negative-ion mode by using a QqQ mass spectrometer directly from a lipid extract that was diluted to less than 50 pmol of total lipids/µl after addition of approximately 25 pmol LiOH/µl to the lipid solution. Spectrum B was taken in the negative-ion mode after the diluted lipid solution used in spectrum A was treated with acid vapor and a small amount of LiOH (approximately 25 pmol LiOH/µl) was added to the infused solution. Spectrum C was acquired in the negative-ion mode as that of spectrum A but in the precursor-ion mode. The tandem mass spectrometry of precursor-ion scanning of 196 Th (i.e., phosphoethanolamine) was conducted through scanning the first quadrupole in the interested mass range and monitoring the third quadruple with the ion at <em>m/z</em> 196 while collision activation was performed in the second quadrupole at collision energy of 50 eV. Spectrum D was acquired in the negative-ion mode directly from a diluted mouse cerebellum lipid extract after addition of Fmoc chloride as previously described <a href="#pone.0001368-Han5">[16]</a>. Spectrum E was acquired in the negative-ion mode as that of spectrum D but in the neutral loss mode. Tandem mass spectrometry of neutral loss scanning was conducted through coordinately scanning the first and third quadrupoles with a mass difference of 222.2 u (i.e., loss of a Fmoc) while collisional activation was performed in the second quadrupole at collision energy of 32 eV. “IS” denotes internal standard. All mass spectral traces are displayed after normalization to the base peak in each individual spectrum. All spectra are displayed after being normalized to the base peak in individual spectrum.</p>
