                Figure 7.  Comparison of representative aliphatic or acyl chain profiles in different lipid domains of bovine heart.The profiles of both aliphatic chains (open column in Panel A) and fatty acyl chains (closed column in Panel A) of bovine heart ether-linked ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (PtdEtn) were derived from individual molecular species listed in Table 1. The fatty acyl chain composition of bovine heart diacyl PtdEtn (Panel B) was also calculated from the identified individual molecular species as listed in Table 1. The profile of acyl-CoA in bovine heart (Panel C) was re-plotted from previously published data [28].
