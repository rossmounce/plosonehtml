The fatty acyl chain composition of bovine heart diacyl PtdEtn (Panel B) was also calculated from the identified individual molecular species as listed in <a href="#pone-0001368-t001">Table 1</a>. The profile of acyl-CoA in bovine heart (Panel C) was re-plotted from previously published data <a href="#pone.0001368-DeMar1">[28]</a>.</p>
