In order to test the reliability of these patterns, ten cell lines on two separate days were tested using our adhesion assay. Two representative examples are shown. While the timing of peaks and troughs varied between runs, the maximum range of varying adhesion (MRVA) was remarkably consistent (p = 0.016). Calculation of the MRVA for each run of each cell line is shown.</p>
