                Figure 3.  The selective erbB2 antagonist AG825 dampens the NRG1α-induced MRVA.Administration of AG825 in DMSO vehicle (n = 5) caused a robust, dose-dependent decrease in the MRVA induced by NRG1α. Compared with the vehicle control, ** represents p&lt;0.01 and **** represents p&lt;0.0001. Compared with the low dose, + represents p&lt;0.05 and +++ represents p&lt;0.001.
