                Figure 4.  The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin is essential for variation in NRG1Î±-induced cell adhesion.Wortmannin in DMSO vehicle (n = 5) exhibited a strong, dose-dependent, dampening effect on the NRG/vehicle MRVA measure. Compared with the vehicle control, * represents p&lt;0.05, ** represents p&lt;0.01, and **** represents p&lt;0.0001. Compared with the low dose, + represents p&lt;0.05 and ++ represents p&lt;0.01.
