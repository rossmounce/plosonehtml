                Figure 5.  Akt inhibition causes a dampening of the NRG/vehicle MRVA measure.Administration of the Akt Inhibitor X in water vehicle (n = 5) caused a dose-dependent decline in the NRG/vehicle MRVA (A). Unlike PI3K inhibition, Akt inhibition was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean ICAM (B) and mean NRG (not shown) raw fluorescence values at the high dose only with no trend at lower doses. Compared with the vehicle control, * represents p&lt;0.05 and ** represents p&lt;0.01. Compared with the low dose, + represents p&lt;0.05 and ++ represents p&lt;0.01.
