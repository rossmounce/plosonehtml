Furthermore, at high dose, it caused a significant reduction in baseline ICAM attachment (C) and in mean NRG and PMA attachment (raw fluorescence values) (not shown). However, mean NRG/vehicle (D) and mean PMA/vehicle (E) were not significantly changed. Compared with the vehicle control, * represents p&lt;0.05 and ** represents p&lt;0.01. Compared with the low dose, ++ represents p&lt;0.01 and +++ represents p&lt;0.001.</p>
