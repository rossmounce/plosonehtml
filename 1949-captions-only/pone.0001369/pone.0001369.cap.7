                Figure 7.  Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is important for baseline attachment.Administration of the MLCK inhibitor ML-7 in DMSO vehicle (n = 5) caused a significant reduction in baseline attachment at the middle and high doses (A). Although this was associated with increases in mean NRG/vehicle and mean PMA/vehicle (not shown), these effects were merely a consequence of reductions in the denominator as both the raw PMA (B) and NRG (C) fluorescence values were unchanged. Compared with the vehicle control, ** represents p&lt;0.01 and *** represents p&lt;0.001. Compared with the low dose, +++ represents p&lt;0.001 and ++++ represents p&lt;0.0001.
