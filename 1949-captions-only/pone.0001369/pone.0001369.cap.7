Although this was associated with increases in mean NRG/vehicle and mean PMA/vehicle (not shown), these effects were merely a consequence of reductions in the denominator as both the raw PMA (B) and NRG (C) fluorescence values were unchanged. Compared with the vehicle control, ** represents p&lt;0.01 and *** represents p&lt;0.001. Compared with the low dose, +++ represents p&lt;0.001 and ++++ represents p&lt;0.0001.</p>
