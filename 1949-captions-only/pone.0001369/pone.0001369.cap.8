PMA/vehicle MRVA was similar between patient-derived and control-derived cell lines (B). The relative impairment in patient-derived cells did not seem to be isolated to attachment or detachment, but was indicative of an overall more constricted response with less variation from baseline adhesion in response to NRG1Î± (C). *** represents p&lt;0.001.</p>
