                Figure 9.  COMT Val108/158Met predicts variation in cell adhesion.COMT, a putative susceptibility gene for both schizophrenia and metastatic cancer, previously was shown to have genotype effects on cell migration with the risk genotype rs4680 V/V showing the most impaired migration. In our adhesion data (n = 40), there was a strong trend (p = 0.0632) towards decreased NRG1Î±-induced MRVA of risk homozygotes compared with non-risk homozygotes (no heterozygote cell lines are maintained).
