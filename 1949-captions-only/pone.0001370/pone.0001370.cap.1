Surfactant protein binding was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. SP-A binding was not detected. (B.) In contrast, <em>C. neoformans</em> (1×10<sup>5</sup>) treated with undiluted BAL exhibited a small amount of SP-A binding. Results are one representative experiment of at least three (A.) or two (B.) experiments performed.</p>
