                Figure 1.  SP-A does not directly bind to encapsulated C. neoformans yeast.(A.) C. neoformans (1×105) were treated with Alexa Flour 488 labeled SP-A (20 µg/ml) for 60 minutes at 37°C. Surfactant protein binding was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. SP-A binding was not detected. (B.) In contrast, C. neoformans (1×105) treated with undiluted BAL exhibited a small amount of SP-A binding. Results are one representative experiment of at least three (A.) or two (B.) experiments performed.
