Calcofluor was added to all samples to visualize the cell wall. SP-A binding to IgG opsonized (Panel C) but not non-opsonized (Panel A) <em>C. neoformans</em> was observed. Scale bar length is equal to 10 µm. (B.) IgG opsonized <em>C. neoformans</em> were treated with SP-A concentrations of 1, 10, 20, 40 µg/ml and binding was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. EDTA (1 mM) was included to determine if SP-A binding required the carbohydrate recognition domain. Histograms represent the mean fluorescence intensity of the AF 488 channel. At least 10,000 particles were interrogated for each sample.</p>
