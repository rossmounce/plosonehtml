                Figure 2.  SP-A can bind C. neoformans via an IgG dependent mechanism.(A.) C. neoformans yeast (1×105) were treated with AF488 labeled SP-A (Panel A), PE-Texas Red labeled anti-GXM IgG (Panel B) and PE-Texas Red labeled anti-GXM IgG and AF488 labeled SP-A (Panel C). Calcofluor was added to all samples to visualize the cell wall. SP-A binding to IgG opsonized (Panel C) but not non-opsonized (Panel A) C. neoformans was observed. Scale bar length is equal to 10 µm. (B.) IgG opsonized C. neoformans were treated with SP-A concentrations of 1, 10, 20, 40 µg/ml and binding was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. EDTA (1 mM) was included to determine if SP-A binding required the carbohydrate recognition domain. Histograms represent the mean fluorescence intensity of the AF 488 channel. At least 10,000 particles were interrogated for each sample.
