                Figure 3.  SP-A inhibits the uptake of IgG opsonized C. neoformans by alveolar macrophages.Non-IgG opsonized C. neoformans were attached/phagocytosed by less than 1% of the alveolar macrophage population in the presence or absence of SP-A, thus percent inhibition of uptake for these conditions is presented as ~100%. SP-A (20, 40 and 80 µg/ml) significantly (P&lt;0.001) inhibited the uptake of IgG opsonized C. neoformans (1×105) by alveolar macrophages (1×105) in a dose dependent manner (16±3.1%, 34±2.7% and 46±3.0%, respectively). Results represent the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean of three experiments.
