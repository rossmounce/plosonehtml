SP-A (20, 40 and 80 µg/ml) significantly (<em>P</em>&lt;0.001) inhibited the uptake of IgG opsonized <em>C. neoformans</em> (1×10<sup>5</sup>) by alveolar macrophages (1×10<sup>5</sup>) in a dose dependent manner (16±3.1%, 34±2.7% and 46±3.0%, respectively). Results represent the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean of three experiments.</p>
