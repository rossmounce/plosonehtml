Three days post infection the fungal burdens of lung tissue and BALs from wild-type (n = 4 and n = 7, respectively) and <em>SP-A-/-</em> (n = 3 and n = 8, respectively) mice were equivalent. (B.) A similar trend was observed at day seven post infection; no difference between groups were observed. (C.) Quantitative differentials showed no differences in the numbers of macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils or lymphocytes present in BALs collected from wild-type (n = 3) and <em>SP-A-/-</em> (n = 3) mice seven days post infection. (D.) There were also no differences in the numbers of macrophages from <em>SP-A-/-</em> (n = 3) and wild-type mice (n = 3) that had phagocytosed <em>C. neoformans</em>. TNFÎ± levels (measured by ELISA) in the lungs of wild-type and <em>SP-A-/-</em> mice at day three (n = 8 and n = 7, respectively) and seven (n = 16 and n = 17, respectively) post infection were equivalent (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05). Results represent the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean for the indicated number of experiments.
