                Figure 4.  C. neoformans infection appears to progress equivalently in SP-A-/- and wild-type mice.(A.) Three days post infection the fungal burdens of lung tissue and BALs from wild-type (n = 4 and n = 7, respectively) and SP-A-/- (n = 3 and n = 8, respectively) mice were equivalent. (B.) A similar trend was observed at day seven post infection; no difference between groups were observed. (C.) Quantitative differentials showed no differences in the numbers of macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils or lymphocytes present in BALs collected from wild-type (n = 3) and SP-A-/- (n = 3) mice seven days post infection. (D.) There were also no differences in the numbers of macrophages from SP-A-/- (n = 3) and wild-type mice (n = 3) that had phagocytosed C. neoformans. TNFÎ± levels (measured by ELISA) in the lungs of wild-type and SP-A-/- mice at day three (n = 8 and n = 7, respectively) and seven (n = 16 and n = 17, respectively) post infection were equivalent (P&gt;0.05). Results represent the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean for the indicated number of experiments.
