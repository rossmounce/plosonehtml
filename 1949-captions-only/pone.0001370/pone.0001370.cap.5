                Figure 5.  SP-A deficiency does not enhance susceptibility to infection by C. neoformans.Groups of 5 SP-A-/- and wild-type mice were infected with C. neoformans (H99, 1Ã—105) via intranasal inhalation. All mice succumbed to infection and died by day 32. There was no difference in the mean time to death of SP-A-/- and wild-type C57BL/6 mice.
