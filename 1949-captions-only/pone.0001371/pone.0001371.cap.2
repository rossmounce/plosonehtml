                Figure 2.  CSP-specific T cells induced by immunization with irradiated P. berghei sporozoites do not cross-react with the P. falciparum CSP expressed by the P. berghei [PfCS].IFN-γ ELISPOT was used to determine the frequency of epitope-specific T cells in the spleens of immunised animals, using long peptides corresponding to the N-terminus (PbNt or PfNt) or the C-terminus (PbCt or PfCt) of P. berghei and P. falciparum, respectively. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM of T cells from groups of 5 mice.
