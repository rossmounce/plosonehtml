                Figure 3.  Antibody reactivity induced by immunization with irradiated sporozoites.Pooled serum samples from groups of mice immunized with sporozoites from the different parasite lines were analyzed by ELISA to assay IgG and IgM responses induced against P. berghei CSP (A), or P. falciparum CSP (B), using long peptides covering the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the antigen, and short peptides that include some of the repeat units of the central repetitive region. Serums were also tested by IFAT against wet sporozoites to detect anti-CSP IgG and IgM antibodies(C). Titres are expressed as the log of the highest dilution of serum giving a positive staining.
