                Figure 4.  Sterile protection in mice immunized with P. berghei irradiated sporozoites and challenged with P. berghei or P. berghei [PfCS] sporozoites.Mice were immunized with 1 or 3 injections of P. berghei (indicated on the left of the panel) before challenge with 5 000 P. berghei or P. berghei [PfCS] sporozoites. All naive control mice developed a patent blood-stage infection. The data are representative of those obtained in duplicate experiments.
