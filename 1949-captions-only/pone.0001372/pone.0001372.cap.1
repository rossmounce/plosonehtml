A. Representative Mallory's trichrome stain for liver fibrosis (in blue; arrowheads). All C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> (wt) mice (<em>n</em>: 12) developed severe liver fibrosis. The C/EBPβ-Ala217 (<em>n</em>: 12; <em>P&lt;0.0001</em>) and C/EBPβ<sup>−/− </sup>[ko] (<em>n</em>: 6; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>) mice had either no fibrosis or only minimal liver fibrosis. B. Representative Sirius red immunohistochemistry for collagen (in red; arrowhead). Marked increase in liver collagen in a cirrhotic pattern was observed in C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in C/EBPβ-Ala 217 or C/EBPβ<sup>−/−</sup> [ko], mice. C. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the Sirius red collagen–binding assay, showed a ~2.5-fold increase in C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 12), compared to C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 12; <em>P&lt;0.001</em>). C/EBPβ<sup>−/−</sup> mice were also refractory to the induction of liver fibrosis by CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 6; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>). D. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the hydroxyproline assay, showed a ~2-fold increase in C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 7), compared to C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 6; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>). C/EBPβ<sup>−/−</sup> mice were also refractory to the induction of liver fibrosis by CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 6; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>).</p>
