A. RT-PCR for collagen α1 type 1 was induced in C/EBPβ <sup>+/+</sup> [wt] mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 12 or 16 weeks (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>). Treatment of these animals after week 8 with the RSK-inhibitory peptide while continuing the exposure to the hepatotoxin, as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> blocked this increase at week 16 (<em>P&lt;0.05</em>). Collagen α1 type 1 was not increased in livers of C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice at 12 or 16 weeks (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>). B. RT-PCR for α-SMA was induced in C/EBPβ <sup>+/+ </sup>[wt] mice treated with CCl<sub>4 </sub>for 12 or 16 weeks (<em>P&lt;0.05</em>).

C. RT-PCR for TGF-β was induced in C/EBPβ <sup>+/+ </sup>[wt] mice treated with CCl<sub>4 </sub>for 12 or 16 weeks (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>). Treatment of these animals after week 8 with the RSK-inhibitory peptide while continuing the exposure to the hepatotoxin, as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>, blocked this increase at week 16 (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>).
