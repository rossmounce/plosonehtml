                Figure 3.  Mice expressing the RSK-inhibitory C/EBPβ-Ala217 transgene are resistant to hepatotoxin-induced liver inflammation.Mice were treated with CCl4 or control mineral oil for 16 weeks as described in Materials and Methods. A. Activated monocytes/macrophages, identified by confocal microscopy for CD-68 (green), were increased in livers of C/EBPβ +/+ [wt] mice treated with CCl4 for 16 weeks (middle panels). Treatment of these animals after week 8 with the RSK-inhibitory peptide while continuing the exposure to the hepatotoxin, as described in Material and methods, blocked the monocytes/macrophage inflammatory reaction at week 16 (lower panels). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Only background staining was observed when omitting the first antibody. Microscopy shown is representative of six animals in each group. B. Activated monocytes/macrophages, were not increased in livers of C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice as much as in the livers of C/EBPβ +/+ [wt] mice after treatment with CCl4 for 16 weeks (lower panel). Microscopy shown is representative of six animals in each group.
