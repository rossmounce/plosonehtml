A. Activated monocytes/macrophages, identified by confocal microscopy for CD-68 (green), were increased in livers of C/EBPβ <sup>+/+</sup> [wt] mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 16 weeks (middle panels). Treatment of these animals after week 8 with the RSK-inhibitory peptide while continuing the exposure to the hepatotoxin, as described in <a href="#s4">Material and methods</a>, blocked the monocytes/macrophage inflammatory reaction at week 16 (lower panels). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Only background staining was observed when omitting the first antibody. Microscopy shown is representative of six animals in each group. B. Activated monocytes/macrophages, were not increased in livers of C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice as much as in the livers of C/EBPβ <sup>+/+</sup> [wt] mice after treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 16 weeks (lower panel). Microscopy shown is representative of six animals in each group.</p>
