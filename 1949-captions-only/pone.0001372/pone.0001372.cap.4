A. Activated stellate cells, identified by confocal microscopy for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; red), displayed C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (green) in livers of C/EBPβ <sup>+/+</sup> [wt], but not C/EBPβ-Ala217, mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>. Colocalization of α-SMA and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 is shown in yellow (merge). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Only background staining was observed when omitting the first antibody. B. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; red) was present in activated stellate cells only in livers of C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> [wt] mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>, while active caspase 3 (green) was found in HSC only in livers of C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>. Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue).</p>
