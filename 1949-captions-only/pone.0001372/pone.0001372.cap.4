                Figure 4.  Mice expressing the RSK-inhibitory C/EBPβ-Ala217 transgene are refractory to hepatic stellate cell activation and proliferation.Mice received CCl4 or mineral oil injections for 12 weeks as described in Materials and methods. A. Activated stellate cells, identified by confocal microscopy for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; red), displayed C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (green) in livers of C/EBPβ +/+ [wt], but not C/EBPβ-Ala217, mice treated with CCl4. Colocalization of α-SMA and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 is shown in yellow (merge). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Only background staining was observed when omitting the first antibody. B. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; red) was present in activated stellate cells only in livers of C/EBPβ+/+ [wt] mice treated with CCl4, while active caspase 3 (green) was found in HSC only in livers of C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl4. Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue).
