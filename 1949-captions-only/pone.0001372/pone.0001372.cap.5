A phospho-RSK immunoblot was performed on RSK immunoprecipitates from protein lysates of purified HSC in an experiment conducted as described in (<a href="#pone-0001372-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Phosphorylated RSK (RSKp380) was decreased in HSC isolated from C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice. C/EBPβ and RSK were similar in the different experimental groups. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. Results from triplicate samples of three independent experiments are shown. B. RSK activity was determined in a cell-free system as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. Recombinant RSK was activated with ATP (125 µM) in the presence or absence of Ac-KThrVD-CHO (200 µM), Ac-KAlaVD-CHO (200 µM), or C/EBPβ216-253-Ala217 (0.25 nM) peptides. Staurosporine was used as a control inhibitor (0.01 nM). All C/EBPβ peptides inhibited RSK activity to a similar extent as staurosporine (P&lt;0.01). Results from triplicate samples of two independent experiments are shown. C. Primary human C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> HSC were transfected with vectors (1 µg each) expressing green fluorescent protein with control wt RSK (GFP), a dominant negative RSK mutant, or C/EBPβ-Ala217. Transfected HSC were selected by sorting for GFP, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with C/EBPβ specific antibodies. C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (C/EBPβp217), and caspase 8 immunoblots were performed in C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates. Dominant negative RSK or C/EPBβ-Ala217 prevented C/EPBβ phosphorylation and stimulated the association of unphosphorylated C/EBPβ with active caspase 8. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. Results from triplicate samples of three independent experiments are shown.</p>
