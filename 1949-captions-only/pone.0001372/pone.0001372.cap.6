A caspase 8 immunoblot was performed on C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates from protein lysates from samples described in (<a href="#pone-0001372-g005">Fig 5 A</a>). The association between C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8 was increased in HSC isolated from C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice. Phosphorylated C/EBPβ-Thr217 was decreased in HSC from C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>. C/EBPβ and RSK were similar in the different experimental groups. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. B. Reciprocal caspase 8 immunoprecipitation of experiment described in (A) confirmed the association of C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. C. Reciprocal caspase 8 immunoprecipitation of experiment described in (<a href="#pone-0001372-g005"><span class="underline">Figure 5C</span></a>), confirmed the association of C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations.</p>
