                Figure 6.  C/EBPβ-Ala217 associates with active caspase 8 in hepatic stellate cells.A. A caspase 8 immunoblot was performed on C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates from protein lysates from samples described in (Fig 5 A). The association between C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8 was increased in HSC isolated from C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice. Phosphorylated C/EBPβ-Thr217 was decreased in HSC from C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl4. C/EBPβ and RSK were similar in the different experimental groups. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. B. Reciprocal caspase 8 immunoprecipitation of experiment described in (A) confirmed the association of C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. C. Reciprocal caspase 8 immunoprecipitation of experiment described in (Figure 5C), confirmed the association of C/EBPβ-Ala217 with active caspase 8. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations.
