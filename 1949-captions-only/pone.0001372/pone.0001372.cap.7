TRADD, C/EBPβ, RIP and caspase 8 immunoblots were performed on C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates from primary human HSC treated with an ERK1/2 inhibitor (10 µM) or the cell permeant Ac-KA217VD-CHO peptide (200 µM). Blocking the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by RSK with the ERK1/2 inhibitor or the cell permeant Ac-KA217VD-CHO (KAVD) peptide, increased the association between C/EBPβ, active caspase 8, TRADD and RIP. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. B. TNFR1 and C/EBPβ immunoblots were performed on C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates from HSC isolated from mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 12 or 16 weeks as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Blocking the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by RSK with C/EBPβ-Ala217 transgene or the cell permeant Ac-KA217VD-CHO peptide increased the association between C/EBPβ and TNFR1. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. C. TRAF2 and C/EBPβ immunoblots were performed on C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates from HSC isolated from mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 12 or 16 weeks as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Blocking the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by RSK with C/EBPβ-Ala217 transgene or the cell permeant Ac-KA217VD-CHO peptide increased the association between C/EBPβ and TRAF2. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations. D. Cytochrome C and Apaf1 immunoblots were performed on cytochrome C immunoprecipitates in livers from mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 12 or 16 weeks as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Blocking the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by RSK with C/EBPβ-Ala217 transgene or the cell permeant Ac-KA217VD-CHO peptide increased the association between cytochrome C and Apaf1. β-Actin was used as an internal control for the immunoprecipitations.</p>
