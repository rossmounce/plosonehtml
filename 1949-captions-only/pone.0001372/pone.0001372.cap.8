                Figure 8.  The RSK-inhibitory peptide blocks hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis induced by CCl4.A Caspase 8 activity was measured in lysates from HSC isolated from C/EBPβ+/+ [wt] and C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice untreated or treated with CCl4 for 24 hr. Caspase activity was increased in C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl4. Results from triplicate samples of two independent experiments are shown. B. Caspase activation in a cell-free system was determined as described in Methods. The Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide enhanced the activation of caspase 8 at picomolar concentrations. Baseline caspase 8 activity was 3.8 U (100%). Results from triplicate samples of three independent experiments are shown (P&lt;0.01 for the Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide). C. Animals received a single injection of CCl4 or mineral oil as described in Methods. α-SMA (red) and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (green) were identified as described in Materials and methods. Treatment with the cell permeant Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide blocked the expression of α-SMA and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217. D. PCNA (red) and active caspase 3 (green) were identified as described in Materials and methods. Treatment with the Ac-KAla217VD–CHO peptide blocked the expression of PCNA and induced active caspase 3. E. C/EBPβ+/+ (wt) mice with severe liver fibrosis after treatment with CCl4 for 8 weeks, while continuing on CCl4, received the RSK inhibitory peptide (5 µg IP, three times/week, for week 9 followed by 1 µg IP, three times/week for weeks 10–12 or 10–16). These are representative Mallory's trichrome stain for liver fibrosis (in blue). All control mice (n: 8 at 8-weeks; n: 8 at 12-weeks; and n: 8 at 16-weeks) developed severe liver fibrosis, while mice receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (n: 8 at 12-weeks; and n: 8 at 16-weeks) had no fibrosis or only minimal liver fibrosis (P&lt;0.01). F. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the Sirius red collagen–binding assay showed a ~2.5 to 3-fold increase in C/EBPβ+/+ mice treated with CCl4 (n: 8 for 8 weeks; n: 8 for 12 weeks and n: 8 for the 16 weeks), compared to animals also receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (n: 6 for 12weeks; n: 8 for 16 weeks; P&lt;0.01). G. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the hydroxyproline assay, showed a 2.2-, 3.5- and 5.3-fold increase in C/EBPβ+/+ mice treated with CCl4, respectively (n: 8 for 8 weeks; n: 7 for 12 weeks and n: 7 for the 16 weeks), compared to animals also receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (n: 6 for 12weeks; n: 8 for 16 weeks; P&lt;0.01).
