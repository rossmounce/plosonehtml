Caspase activity was increased in C/EBPβ-Ala217 mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>. Results from triplicate samples of two independent experiments are shown. B. Caspase activation in a cell-free system was determined as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. The Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide enhanced the activation of caspase 8 at picomolar concentrations. Baseline caspase 8 activity was 3.8 U (100%). Results from triplicate samples of three independent experiments are shown (<em>P&lt;0.01</em> for the Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide). C. Animals received a single injection of CCl<sub>4 </sub>or mineral oil as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. α-SMA (red) and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (green) were identified as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>. Treatment with the cell permeant Ac-KAla217VD-CHO peptide blocked the expression of α-SMA and C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217. D. PCNA (red) and active caspase 3 (green) were identified as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>. Treatment with the Ac-KAla217VD–CHO peptide blocked the expression of PCNA and induced active caspase 3. E. C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> (wt) mice with severe liver fibrosis after treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 8 weeks, while continuing on CCl<sub>4</sub>, received the RSK inhibitory peptide (5 µg IP, three times/week, for week 9 followed by 1 µg IP, three times/week for weeks 10–12 or 10–16). These are representative Mallory's trichrome stain for liver fibrosis (in blue). All control mice (<em>n</em>: 8 at 8-weeks; <em>n</em>: 8 at 12-weeks; and <em>n</em>: 8 at 16-weeks) developed severe liver fibrosis, while mice receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (<em>n</em>: 8 at 12-weeks; and <em>n</em>: 8 at 16-weeks) had no fibrosis or only minimal liver fibrosis (<em>P&lt;0.01</em>). F. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the Sirius red collagen–binding assay showed a ~2.5 to 3-fold increase in C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<em>n</em>: 8 for 8 weeks; <em>n</em>: 8 for 12 weeks and <em>n</em>: 8 for the 16 weeks), compared to animals also receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (<em>n</em>: 6 for 12weeks; <em>n</em>: 8 for 16 weeks; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>). G. Analysis of hepatic collagen content by the hydroxyproline assay, showed a 2.2-, 3.5- and 5.3-fold increase in C/EBPβ<sup>+/+</sup> mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>, respectively (<em>n</em>: 8 for 8 weeks; <em>n</em>: 7 for 12 weeks and <em>n</em>: 7 for the 16 weeks), compared to animals also receiving the RSK-inbitory peptide (<em>n</em>: 6 for 12weeks; <em>n</em>: 8 for 16 weeks; <em>P&lt;0.01</em>).</p>
