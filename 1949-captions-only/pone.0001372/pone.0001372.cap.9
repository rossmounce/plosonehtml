A. Activated HSC, identified by confocal microscopy for their morphology and fluorescence for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; red), displayed activated RSK-PhosphoSer380 in livers of patients with severe liver fibrosis (lower panel) but not in the livers of control subjects (upper panel). Colocalization of RSK-PhosphoSer380 and GFAP is shown in yellow (merge). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue). Only background staining was observed when omitting the first antibody. B. C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 (green) was present in activated HSC only in livers of patients with liver fibrosis (lower panel). Colocalization of C/EBPβ-PhosphoThr217 and GFAP (red) is shown in yellow (merge). Nuclei are identified with TO-PRO-3 (blue).</p>
