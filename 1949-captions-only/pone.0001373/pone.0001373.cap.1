Red represents high probability of pathway deregulation, blue represents low probability of pathway deregulation. Five clusters emerge based on pathway patterns. B) Kaplan Meier survival analysis based on pathway patterns: good prognosis (cluster 4), intermediate prognosis (clusters 2, 3, 5), and poor prognosis (cluster 1), (p = 0.14). C) Kaplan Meier survival analysis comparing clinically-significant differences between clusters 1 and 4 (HR 4.15).</p>
