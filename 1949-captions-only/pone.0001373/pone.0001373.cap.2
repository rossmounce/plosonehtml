Red represents high probability of pathway deregulation, blue represents low probability of pathway deregulation. Six clusters emerge based on pathway patterns. B) Kaplan Meier survival analysis for breast cancer patients aged ≥65 years based on pathway patterns: good prognosis (clusters 3,5) and poor prognosis (clusters 1,6), (p = 0.04). C) Kaplan Meier survival analysis for breast cancer patients comparing clinically-significant differences between clusters 1 and 3 (HR = 2.7).</p>
