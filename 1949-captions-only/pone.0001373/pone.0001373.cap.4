                Figure 4.  Chemosensitivity patterns among women aged ≤45 years and ≥65 years with early stage breast cancer.A) LEFT PANEL Hierarchical clustering of the probability of sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), paclitaxel, docetaxel, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide among 200 breast tumors arising in women aged ≤45 years; RIGHT PANEL Linear regression analysis of sensitivity to adriamycin among women in genomic cluster 1 (poor prognosis) vs. 4 (good prognosis) aged ≤45 years. B) LEFT PANEL Hierarchical clustering of the probability of sensitivity to 5FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide among 211 breast tumors arising in women aged ≥65 years. RIGHT PANEL Linear regression analysis of sensitivity to adriamycin among women in genomic cluster 1 (poor prognosis) vs. genomic cluster 3 (good prognosis), demonstrating a statistically significant (p = 0.02, log rank) relationship between clusters (of pathway deregulation) and adriamycin sensitivity.
