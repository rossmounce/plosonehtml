                Figure 1.  The density of beta cells within a cross-section of a pancreas as a function of age.The density of beta cells were reported for non-diabetic controls (filled circles) and Type 1 diabetics (open squares) reported by Gepts [10]. A non-linear regression was used to estimate the expected density of beta cells in non-diabetic controls as a function of age (solid line). In diabetics, the percentage reduction in beta cell mass is estimated by the ratio of the observed beta cell density in diabetics to the expected density provided by the non-linear regression.
