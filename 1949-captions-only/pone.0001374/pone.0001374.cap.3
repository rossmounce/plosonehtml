                Figure 3.  A computational Bayesian estimate of the two-dimensional 95% confidence regions for the linear regression parameters.The confidence regions for the slope and intercept were estimated from the Gepts data (red) [10], Foulis et al. data (blue) [8], [9], and combined data (black). The curves indicate the parameter values that are enclosed within 95% of the posterior probability density function. The confidence regions associated with the combined data is a non-linear combination of the confidence regions associated with the Gepts data only and the Foulis et al. data only.
