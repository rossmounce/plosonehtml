                Figure 4.  The growth rates for beta cell mass and total body weight exhibit different kinetics.The changes in beta cell mass (dotted line) and body weight in kg (solid line) are shown a function of age. The beta cell mass is the product of beta cell density [10] and volume of the pancreas [10]. The change in body weight as a function of age is an average value from male and female growth charts [25].
