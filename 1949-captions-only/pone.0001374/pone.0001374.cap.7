Patients are grouped into three subsets. The first subset is patients who died within three weeks of diagnosis (red triangles). The second subset is patients who died between three and 23 weeks following diagnosis (black squares). The third subset is patients who died greater than 23 weeks following diagnosis (blue circles). Patients who died greater than 23 weeks following diagnosis exhibited a greater reduction in beta cell mass compared to other groups. The p-values indicate the level of confidence associated with the hypothesis that the mean residual values are different between the two groups.</p>
