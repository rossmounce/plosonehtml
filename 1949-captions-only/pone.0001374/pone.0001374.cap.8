                Figure 8.  The influence of disease severity on the range of observed reduction in beta cell mass.The diagnosis for Type 1 diabetes occurs once the beta cell mass declines to a point where the excess beta cell mass (EBCM) is depleted (dotted line). The range of observed reduction in beta cell mass is greater in patients with severe autoimmunity to beta cells compared to patients with mild autoimmunity when Δage is greater than zero. As Δage is decreased, the difference in observed reduction in beta bell mass is also decreased.
