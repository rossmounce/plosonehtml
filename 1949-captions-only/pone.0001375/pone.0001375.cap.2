                Figure 2.  Pbs2 mutants that suppress YopJ inhibition thus survive on sorbitol plate.(A) Dilutions of yeast BY4741-pbs2Δ strain co-transformed with YopJ and Pbs2 wild type or mutants are plated on synthetic media containing 2% raffinose, 1% galactose and 1 M sorbitol and incubated at 30°C. (B) Dilutions of yeast BY4741-pbs2Δ strain cotransformed with YopJ and Pbs2 wild type or mutants are plated on synthetic media containing glucose and incubated at 30°C. (C) Sequence alignment shows all screened mutants are conserved in MKKs from yeast to human. (D) Structural mapping of the screened mutants on a canonical MKK structure: P1 on beta strand 4; P4 on the G α-helix; P5 at the end of the G α-helix.
