(B) Dilutions of yeast BY4741-<em>pbs2Δ</em> strain cotransformed with YopJ and Pbs2 wild type or mutants are plated on synthetic media containing glucose and incubated at 30°C. (C) Sequence alignment shows all screened mutants are conserved in MKKs from yeast to human. (D) Structural mapping of the screened mutants on a canonical MKK structure: P1 on beta strand 4; P4 on the G α-helix; P5 at the end of the G α-helix.</p>
