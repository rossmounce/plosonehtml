                Figure 4.  Acetylation by YopJ of Pbs2 mutants is impaired.Recombinant YopJ or YopJ(C172A) is incubated with purified Pbs2 kinase domain or its mutants in the presence and absence of 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA for 1 hour at 30Â°C. Samples are separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.
