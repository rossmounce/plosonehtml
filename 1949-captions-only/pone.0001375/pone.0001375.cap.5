The samples are separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and then analyzed by autoradiography. The same membrane is probed with an anti-HA antibody. (B) HEK293 cells are transfected with either Flag-tagged YopJ or YopJ(C172A), HA-tagged ERK and HA-tagged MKK1 wild type or M1 mutant. Cells are lysed and immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody and Protein G beads. Beads are separated using SDS-PAGE and probed with either anti-HA or anti-phospho ERK antibodies.</p>
