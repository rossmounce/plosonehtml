                Figure 1.  Drainage of N-α-Syn and MBP to CLN with macrophage activation and production of α-Syn serum antibodies after MPTP intoxication.(A) Western blot of tissue homogenates from VMB and CLN of mice 20 hrs following treatment with PBS or MPTP, were probed with antibodies to α-Syn. (B) N-α/β Syn IP with (clone nSyn12 antibodies) against CLN homogenates from PBS or MPTP-treated mice. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and the gel stained with SYPRO Red or blotted. The Western blot was probed with anti-α-Syn. (C) Proteins recovered from in-gel digestion of 12–18 kD fragments from anti-N-α/β Syn of CLN immunoprecipitates were were identified by LC-MS/MS. The sequence coverage by peptides identified by LC-MS/MS from the CLN of MPTP-treated mice is highlighted in yellow within the primary aa sequence of full-length mouse α-Syn. (D) Western blots of lymph node homogenates (Cervical, Axillary, and Inquinal) from mice treated with PBS or MPTP. Blots were probed with antibodies to nitrotyrosine (NT) or anti-myelin basic protein (MBP). (E) Flow cytometric analysis of CD11b and I-Ab expression in cells from CLN, show an increased number of CD11b+I-A+ cells 24 hrs after MPTP treatment compared to PBS administered animals (n = 3 mice/group). (F) Antibodies against α-Syn and N-α-Syn in sera of B6 WT mice on day 21 following MPTP intoxication (n = 8) or PBS control treatment (n = 5) as determined by anti-α-Syn specific ELISA. Sera from MPTP treated group contained significantly higher IgG antibodies directed against 4YSyn (p = 0.021) and N-4YSyn (p = 0.016) compared to PBS treated control sera. Comparisons of mean IgG concentrations ± SEM was by Student's t test.
