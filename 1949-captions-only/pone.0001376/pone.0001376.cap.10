T cells were cultured for 72 hrs and pulsed with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine for the final 18 hrs of culture. Harvested cells were counted for <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake by β-scintillation spectrometry and proliferation was expressed as mean counts per min (CPM)±SEM for quadruplicate samples and evaluated by ANOVA with Bonferroni <em>post-hoc</em> tests. <sup>a</sup>p&lt;0.01 compared with T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and cultured in media alone.</p>
