                Figure 10.  N-4YSyn-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation.Proliferative responses of anti-CD3 stimulated T cells from naïve B6 mice in presence of graded concentrations of 4YSyn or N-4YSyn (1, 3, 10, 30 µg/ml) or in media alone (0 µg/ml). T cells were cultured for 72 hrs and pulsed with 3H-thymidine for the final 18 hrs of culture. Harvested cells were counted for 3H-thymidine uptake by β-scintillation spectrometry and proliferation was expressed as mean counts per min (CPM)±SEM for quadruplicate samples and evaluated by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests. ap&lt;0.01 compared with T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and cultured in media alone.
