Antigen-stimulated SPC from N-4YSyn immune mice were induced <em>in vitro</em> with N-4YSyn, and cells and supernatants for use in the assay were harvested after 5 days of culture. Controls included macrophages cultured in the presence of SPC supernatants from antigen-stimulated SPC of N-4YSyn-immunized mice (Macrophages+SPC Sup); macrophages cultured in the presence of N-4YSyn alone (Macrophages+N4YSyn); and transwell cultures of plated MES 23.5 cells and macrophages in the transwell stimulated with N-4YSyn. Frequencies (Â±SEM) of dead (red) cells for 4-8 fields/assay are provided in the lower right corner of each panel. Differences in the mean frequencies of dead cells were evaluated by ANOVA and Bonferroni <em>post-hoc</em> tests. p&lt;0.01 compared to cultures treated with <sup>a</sup>Media, <sup>b</sup>N-4YSyn, or <sup>c</sup>N-4YSyn+SPC.</p>
