                Figure 11.  N-4YSyn activated immune SPC induces macrophage-mediated dopaminergic cell death.Representative fluorescence photomicrographs are shown of live (green) and dead (red) cells from 24 hr macrophage/MES 23.5 co-cultures in the presence of media alone, N-4YSyn, N-4YSyn and antigen-stimulated SPC of N-4YSyn-immunized mice (N-4YSyn+SPC), or N-4YSyn and the supernatants from antigen-stimulated SPC of N-4YSyn-immunized mice (N-4YSyn+SPC Sup). Antigen-stimulated SPC from N-4YSyn immune mice were induced in vitro with N-4YSyn, and cells and supernatants for use in the assay were harvested after 5 days of culture. Controls included macrophages cultured in the presence of SPC supernatants from antigen-stimulated SPC of N-4YSyn-immunized mice (Macrophages+SPC Sup); macrophages cultured in the presence of N-4YSyn alone (Macrophages+N4YSyn); and transwell cultures of plated MES 23.5 cells and macrophages in the transwell stimulated with N-4YSyn. Frequencies (Â±SEM) of dead (red) cells for 4-8 fields/assay are provided in the lower right corner of each panel. Differences in the mean frequencies of dead cells were evaluated by ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests. p&lt;0.01 compared to cultures treated with aMedia, bN-4YSyn, or cN-4YSyn+SPC.
