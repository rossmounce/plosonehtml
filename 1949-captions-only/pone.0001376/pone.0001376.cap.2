                Figure 2.  Nigral degeneration following MPTP-intoxication in B6 SCID mice before and after lymphoid cell reconstitution.(A) Photomicrographs of TH-immunostained SN (left panels) and CD3-immunostained spleen sections (right panels) from B6 (WT), SCID, and reconstituted SCID (RCS-SCID) mice treated with PBS or MPTP and obtained on day 21 post-MPTP intoxication. Immunostaining for expression of CD3 in spleens show normal distributions of CD3+ T cells in B6 WT and RCS-SCID mice treated with PBS or MPTP. Note the absence of CD3+ T cells in spleens from SCID MPTP mice. (B) Quantification of TH+ neurons in the SN of B6 WT, SCID, or reconstituted (RCS) SCID mice treated with PBS or MPTP. Values represent mean number of TH+ neurons Â± SEM for 5-9 mice per group. abcdefgPair-wise comparisons by Bonferroni post-hoc test: acdp&lt;0.0001, befp&lt;0.001, gp&lt;0.05. (C) Coronal VMB sections of MPTP intoxicated B6 mice reacted with antibodies against CD3, CD4 and CD8 show positive immunostaining of cells with small, round lymphocytic morphology (magnification = 400X).
