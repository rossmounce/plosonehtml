Immunostaining for expression of CD3 in spleens show normal distributions of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in B6 WT and RCS-SCID mice treated with PBS or MPTP. Note the absence of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleens from SCID MPTP mice. (B) Quantification of TH+ neurons in the SN of B6 WT, SCID, or reconstituted (RCS) SCID mice treated with PBS or MPTP. Values represent mean number of TH+ neurons Â± SEM for 5-9 mice per group. <sup>abcdefg</sup>Pair-wise comparisons by Bonferroni post-hoc test: <sup>acd</sup><em>p</em>&lt;0.0001, <sup>bef</sup><em>p</em>&lt;0.001, <sup>g</sup><em>p</em>&lt;0.05. (C) Coronal VMB sections of MPTP intoxicated B6 mice reacted with antibodies against CD3, CD4 and CD8 show positive immunostaining of cells with small, round lymphocytic morphology (magnification = 400X).</p>
