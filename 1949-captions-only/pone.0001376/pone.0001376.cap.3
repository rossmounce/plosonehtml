                Figure 3.  Characterization of purified and nitrated recombinant 4YSyn.(A) Primary aa sequence of His-tagged 4YSyn peptide. The His-Tag sequence is highlighted in yellow. The sequence of 4YSyn (Syn100–140) is shown underlined with 4 Tyr residues (magenta) as potent sites for nitration. Trypsin cleavage sites at Arg (arrowhead) and Lys (arrow) are shown. (B) Purified 4YSyn (lane 1) and N-4YSyn following nitration with peroxynitrite (lane 2) fractionated on a 10–20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using silver stain. Covalently cross-linked oligomers are indicated by arrowheads. (C) Western blot confirmation of purified 4YSyn and its associated NT modifications following peroxynitrite treatment. (D) MALDI-TOF spectra of purified 4YSyn (top panel), N-4YSyn (middle panel), and 4YSyn after tryptic digest (lower panel).
