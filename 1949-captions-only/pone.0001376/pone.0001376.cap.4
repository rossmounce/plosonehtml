                Figure 4.  Experimental protocol for adoptive transfer and lymphocyte proliferation assessment of donor SPC in B10.BR mice.(A) B10.BR (H-2K) mice were immunized with PBS, 50 µg 4YSyn, or 50 µg N-4YSyn emulsified in CFA. Mice were boosted 14 days later with PBS or their respective antigens in IFA. After 5 days, donor mice were sacrificed and single cell suspensions were prepared from the draining inguinal lymph nodes and spleen, and T cells were enriched by negative selection. Twelve hours after the final MPTP injection, 5×107 donor immune SPC or 2.5×107 T cells were adoptively transferred to MPTP-treated recipient mice. SPC were evaluated for antigen specificity prior to adoptive transfer by lymphocyte proliferation assays. SN of recipients were evaluated after 28 days of MPTP treatment for migration of T cells, survival of dopaminergic neurons, and reactive microglia. (B). SPC were tested for antigen specific proliferation by culturing in the presence of media alone or media containing 3 µg/ml of immunizing antigens for 5 days and using standard 3H-thymidine incorporation assays.
