Population of enriched T-cells was 94% CD3<sup>+</sup> prior to adoptive transfer to B10.BR mice. (B) Sections throughout the SNpc were immunostained for CD3 and counterstained with thionin. Clusters of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells are observed within the SNpc (arrowheads) as seen at 100Ã— magnification (left). Magnification (600X) of boxed area (left panel) is shown (right panel). CD3<sup>+</sup> cells are small and round exhibiting lymphocyte morphology.</p>
