                Figure 5.  Adoptive transfer of SPC and purified T cells from N-4YSyn vaccinated B10.BR donors leads to infiltration of T cells in the SNpc of MPTP mice on day 2.(A) Frequency of CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells before and after enrichment of T cells. Population of enriched T-cells was 94% CD3+ prior to adoptive transfer to B10.BR mice. (B) Sections throughout the SNpc were immunostained for CD3 and counterstained with thionin. Clusters of CD3+ cells are observed within the SNpc (arrowheads) as seen at 100Ã— magnification (left). Magnification (600X) of boxed area (left panel) is shown (right panel). CD3+ cells are small and round exhibiting lymphocyte morphology.
