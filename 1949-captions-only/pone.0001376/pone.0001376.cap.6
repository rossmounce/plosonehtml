                Figure 6.  SPC from N-4YSyn immunized B10.BR mice exacerbate MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and induce microglial responses in the SNpc.Photomicrographs from VMB sections stained with Fluoro-Jade C (left and middle panels) and Mac-1 antibody (right panels). PBS controls (PBS/none) exhibit an absence of Fluoro-Jade C stained dead neurons on days 2 and 7, and only faint Mac-1 immunoreactivity on day 4 post-treatment. In MPTP-treated mice that received SPC from PBS/adjuvant treated donors (MPTP/PBS), Fluoro-Jade C stained neurons are evident at day 2, but not detectable by day 7. MPTP-treated mice that received SPC from 4YSyn immunized donors (MPTP/4YSyn), also exhibits dead fluorescent neurons by day 2 comparable to the MPTP/PBS control group, and only rare degenerating neurons are visible by day 7. Mac-1 immunoreactivity in those mice is comparably resolved to levels seen in MPTP/PBS control group. SPC transfers from N-4YSyn immunized donors to MPTP-treated mice (MPTP/N-4YSyn) induced a robust and prolonged microglial response, conspicuously enhanced when compared to MPTP/PBS-treated controls, with concomitant neuronal death still evident by Fluoro-Jade C staining at day 7.
