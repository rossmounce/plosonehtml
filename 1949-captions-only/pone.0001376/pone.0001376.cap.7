Tissues collected 28 days post-MPTP treatment (B) Counts of nigral Nissl+ (blue bars), TH+ (red bars), and TH- (green bars) neurons on day 28 after MPTP treatment as determined by stereological analysis. Control groups included mice treated with PBS alone (n = 4), MPTP alone (n = 8), and PBS animals that received immune effector SPC from N-4YSyn immunized donor mice PBS/N-4YSyn/SPC (n = 6). Experimental groups included MPTP/PBS/SPC (n = 6), MPTP/4YSyn/SPC (n = 8), MPTP/N-4YSyn/SPC (n = 9), and MPTP mice which received purified T cells from N-4YSyn vaccinated donors. Values are means Â± SEM. <em>p</em>&lt;0.01 compared to the following treatment groups: <sup>a</sup>PBS, <sup>b</sup>MPTP, <sup>c</sup>MPTP/4YSyn/SPC.</p>
