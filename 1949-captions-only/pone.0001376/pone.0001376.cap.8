                Figure 8.  Scheme for immunization, lymphocyte proliferation assessment, and adoptive transfer of donor SPC in B6 mice.(A) B6 (H-2b) mice were immunized with 10 µg 4YSyn in PBS, 50 µg N-4YSyn in CFA, 10 µg N-4YSyn in PBS or PBS in CFA. Mice were boosted 14 days later with their respective antigens as formulated previously with or without IFA. After 5 days, single lymphoid cell suspensions were prepared and assessed for antigen-specific responses in standard lymphocyte proliferation assays. Single cell suspensions were pooled and adoptively transferred to MPTP-treated syngeneic recipients 12 hrs after the final MPTP injection. 5×107 donor immune SPC were adoptively transferred to MPTP-treated recipient mice. Survival of dopaminergic neurons in the SN of recipient mice were evaluated after 7 days. (B) Antigen specific proliferation of SPC from B6 (H-2b) mice (n = 5/group) immunized with PBS/CFA or N-4YSyn/CFA, and cultured for 5 days in media alone (green bars) or in the presence 1 µg/ml of 4YSyn (blue bars) or N-4YSyn (red bars). Cultures were pulsed for 18 hrs, cells harvested and 3H-thymidine incorporation counted by β-scintillation spectrometry. Values represent mean stimulation indices±SEM and analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests. ap = 0.0478.
