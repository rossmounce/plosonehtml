                Figure 9.  Lymphocytes from N-4YSyn immunization exacerbate nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss in B6 mice.(A) All panels show TH+ neurons in the SN from mice treated with PBS or MPTP alone, MPTP and SPC from 4YSyn immunized donors (MPTP+4YSyn), MPTP and SPC from N-4YSyn immunized donors (MPTP+N-4YSyn) and lastly, MPTP and SPC from N-4YSyn+CFA immunized donors (MPTP+N-4YSyn CFA). (B) Counts of nigral TH+ and TH− neurons on day 7 after MPTP treatment. Experimental groups included mice treated with PBS alone (n = 7), MPTP alone (n = 7), MPTP/4YSyn (n = 7), MPTP/N-4YSyn/CFA (n = 6) and MPTP/N-4YSyn (n = 6). Values are means ± SEM. Analysis by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests indicated ap&lt;0.0001 compared to PBS control: bp&lt;0.001 compared to MPTP group; cp&lt;0.001 compared to MPTP/4YSyn group; and dp&lt;0.03 compared to MPTP/4YSynCFA SPC.
