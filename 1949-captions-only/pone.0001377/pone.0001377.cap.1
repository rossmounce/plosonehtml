                Figure 1.  Spatio-temporal spike pattern.Here we show in red a repeating 50 ms long pattern that concerns 50 afferents among 100. The bottom panel plots the population-averaged firing rates over 10 ms time bins (we chose 10 ms because it is the membrane time constant of the neuron used later in the simulations), and demonstrates that nothing characterizes the periods when the pattern is present. The right panel plots the individual firing rates averaged over the whole period. Neurons involved in the pattern are shown in red. Again, nothing characterizes them in terms of firing rates. Detecting the pattern thus requires taking the spike times into account.
