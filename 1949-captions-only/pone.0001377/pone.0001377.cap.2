                Figure 2.  The STDP modification function.We plotted the additive weight updates as a function of the difference between the presynaptic spike time and the postsynaptic one. We used an exponential law (see Materials and Methods). The left part corresponds to Long Term Potentiation (LTP) and the right part to Long Term Depression (LTD).
