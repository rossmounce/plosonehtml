                Figure 3.  Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron.Here is an illustrative example with only 6 input spikes. The graph plots the membrane potential as a function of time, and clearly demonstrates the effects of the 6 corresponding Excitatory PostSynaptic Potentials (EPSP). Because of the leak, for the threshold to be reached the input spikes need to be nearly synchronous. The LIF neuron is thus acting as a coincidence detector. When the threshold is reached, a postsynaptic spike is fired. This is followed by a refractory period of 1 ms and a negative spike-afterpotential.
