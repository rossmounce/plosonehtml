Grey rectangles indicate pattern presentations. (a) At the beginning of the simulation the neuron is non-selective because the synaptic weights are all equal. It thus fires periodically, both inside and outside the pattern. (b) At tâ‰ˆ13.5 s, after about 70 pattern presentations and 700 discharges, selectivity to the pattern is emerging: gradually the neuron almost stops discharging outside the pattern (no false alarms), while it does discharge most of the time the pattern is present (high hit rate), here even twice (c) End of the simulation. The system has converged (by saturation). Postsynaptic spike latency is about 4 ms. Hit rate is 99.1% with no false alarms (estimated on the last 150 s).</p>
