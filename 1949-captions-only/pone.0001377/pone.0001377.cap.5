                Figure 5.  Latency reduction.Here we plotted the postsynaptic latency as a function of the number of discharges (by convention the latency is 0 when the neuron discharged outside the pattern, i.e. when it generated a false alarm). We clearly distinguish 3 periods: the beginning, when the neuron is non-selective; the middle, when selectivity has emerged and STDP is ‘tracking back’ through the pattern; and the end, when the system has converged towards a fast and reliable pattern detector.
