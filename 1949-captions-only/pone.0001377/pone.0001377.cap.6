This allows the visualization of the spikes which generate a significant EPSP and those which do not. The pattern is represented with a grey line rectangle. Notice the cluster of white spikes at the beginning of it: STDP has potentiated most of the synapses that correspond to the earliest spikes of the pattern. Note that virtually all the synaptic connections with afferents not involved in the pattern have been completely depressed. (b) The membrane potential is plotted as a function of time, over the same range as above. We clearly see the sudden increase that corresponds to the above-mentioned cluster.</p>
