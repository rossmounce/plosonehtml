The pattern needs to be consistently present, at least at the beginning, for the STDP to start the learning process. (b) Percentage of successful trials as a function of jitter. For jitter greater than 3 ms spike coincidences are lost and the STDP weight updates are inaccurate, so the learning is impaired (c) Percentage of successful trials as a function of the proportion of afferents involved in the pattern. Performance is good if this proportion is above 1/3 (d) Percentage of successful trials as a function of the initial weights. With a high value the neuron can handle more discharges outside the pattern. (e) Percentage of successful trials as a function of the proportion of spikes deleted. With a 10% deletion the pattern was correctly learnt in 82% of the cases.</p>
