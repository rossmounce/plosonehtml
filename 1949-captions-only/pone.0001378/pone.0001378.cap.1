Reported is the total number of bacteria for each phylum and the numbers of bacteria that utilize a given cuproprotein. Numbers across the top refer to the cuproproteins in <a href="#pone-0001378-t001">Table 1</a>. The last two columns (Users and Nonusers) refer to the number of organisms in the specific phylum that are users and nonusers, respectively. Fields colored in red represent phyla where all bacteria belonging to that phylum were classified as either users or nonusers. The “# Cuproproteins” column shows the total number of cuproproteins utilized by all bacteria belonging to a particular phylum.</p>
