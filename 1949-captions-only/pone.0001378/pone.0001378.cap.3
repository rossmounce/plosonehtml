                Figure 3.  Occurrence of transporters, repressors and chaperones in bacteria.Phylogenetic tree was adapted from [37]. Reported are the number of bacteria (by phylum) which utilized a given transporter, repressor, or chaperone. Numbers across the top refer to specific transporters or chaperones (see Table 1 for protein names). Columns 10–17 are exporters, column 18 is the sole importer, columns 19–20 are chaperones, and column 21 is a transporter whose exact function has not been characterized. The last four columns report the number of exporters, importers, and chaperones present in each phyla.
