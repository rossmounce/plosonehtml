                Figure 4.  Bacterial cuproproteomes.Phylogenetic tree adapted from [37]. Numbers across the top (1â€“5) show the size of cuproproteomes (i.e., the number of cuproproteins in a phylum or organism). Displayed is the number of organisms from each phylum with the cuproproteome of the particular size.
