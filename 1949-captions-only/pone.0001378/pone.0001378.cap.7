                Figure 7.  Occurrence of Cu users and nonusers among archaea differing in their dependence on oxygen.Archaea were divided based on their oxygen requirement into anaerobic, aerobic, facultative, and microaerophilic. Shown are the numbers of users/nonusers for each of these groups of organisms.
