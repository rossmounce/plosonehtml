                Figure 2.  There was a highly significant correlation (r = −0.66, P&lt;0.002) between changes in serum phosphorus level and changes in temperature in the 19 patients who had repeated measurements of both variables.For each 1°C decline in temperature, serum phosphorus level increased by 0.16 mmol/L [0.51 mg/dL].
