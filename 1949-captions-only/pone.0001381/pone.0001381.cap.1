A schematic presentation of the Kv2.1 channel showing fragments generated as GST fusion proteins. The grey box on the left, the 6 dark boxes and the grey box on the right denote the N terminus, the 6 trans membrane and the C terminus domains, respectively. Numbers denote amino acids. B. GST fusion proteins corresponding to Kv2.1 C terminus but not N terminus pull down syntaxin from PC12 cell lysate. Proteins (each at 150 pmol) immobilized on glutathione affinity beads were incubated with 10<sup>6</sup> cells in K-Glu buffer with 1% Triton X-100 for 12 hr at 4°C. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) and immunobloted with syntaxin antibody (<em>IB Syx</em>), or stained with Ponceau S (lower panel). PC12 lysates (0.5% of that processed in the pull down reaction) were loaded for reference. Right and left panels are two separate experiments. Molecular weights are marked on the right. C. GST-fused Kv2.1-C1a protein or GST alone (150 pmole each) immobilized on glutathione affinity beads were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled synaptotagmin (<em>Syt</em>), <sup>35</sup>S-labeled syntaxin (<em>Syx</em>), <sup>35</sup>S-labeled SNAP-25 or <sup>35</sup>S-labeled VAMP2 for 1 h. in 1 ml 0.1% Triton X-100. Gluthation-eluted proteins (<em>right panel</em>) and input (20 µl out of 1000 µl of reaction mixture taken before the addition of beads; <em>left panel</em>) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p>
