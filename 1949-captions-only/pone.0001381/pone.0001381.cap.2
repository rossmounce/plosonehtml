Cells were pelleted and the secreted [<sup>3</sup>H]-NE in the supernatant was quantified by scintillation counting and expressed as a percentage of the total [<sup>3</sup>H]-NE in the cell. 10<sup>6</sup> cells per reaction were used. The difference between the amounts of [<sup>3</sup>H]-NE secreted in the two reactions on the two bars on the right was defined and is referred to hereafter as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release. (B) Cracked cells preloaded with [<sup>3</sup>H]-NE underwent priming and triggering reactions in the absence or presence of 10–20 µM GST-fusion peptides corresponding to cytosolic parts of Kv2.1 and Kv1.1 (shown in <a href="#pone-0001381-g001">Fig. 1A</a>) or to GST itself (as indicated below bars). Values of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release measured in the presence of the peptides (see <a href="#pone-0001381-g002">Fig. 2A</a>) were normalized to the control release determined in the absence of peptides (defined as 100%). Each bar in A and B depicts the mean±s.e.m from several independent experiments (numbers of experiments are in parentheses above bars). **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 (compared with GST). (C) Cells were stimulated to release NE in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-fused Kv2.1-C1 protein. Each point in the curve represents mean±s.e.m values from several independent experiments (numbers of experiments in parentheses above bars). **, p&lt;0.001 (compared with 10 nM GST-C1).</p>
