                Figure 3.  Inhibition of Ca2+-triggered release from cracked PC12 cells by a Kv2.1 syntaxin-binding peptide is conferred at the triggering step.Cells were stimulated to secrete [3H]-NE in the presence of GST-C1a, which was introduced during both the priming and the triggering phases (ATP and cytosol were present throughout (as in Fig. 2); middle bar) or during the triggering phase only (ATP was washed out before the triggering phase; right bar). Data shown are meanÂ±s.e.m values from a single experiment performed in triplicate and normalized to the values determined in the absence of the peptide (left bar).
