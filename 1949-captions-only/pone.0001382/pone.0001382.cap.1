                Figure 1.  Distribution of pair-wise allele sharing among the INTERHEART European individuals.The graph shows the QQ plot of the distribution of all pair-wise measures of allele sharing against a normal distribution (the red line displays the expectation). The green line shows to the empirical cut-off used to identify related individuals (correspond to an allele sharing larger than 83%). The deviation on the left-hand side of the graph (i.e. low allele sharing) corresponds to pairs of individuals originating from different sub-populations.
