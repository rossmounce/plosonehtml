The coefficients of ancestry display separately for each population samples were inferred from a single analysis (i.e. all individuals combined) and are represented using the same axes. See also Supplemental <a href="#pone.0001382.s002">Figure S2</a> for the distribution of the coefficients of ancestry.</p>
