                Figure 2.  Genetic clustering of the INTERHEART individuals inferred by STRUCTURE.“European” (blue dots), “Arabs” (green dots) and “South Asian” (pink dots) individuals are displayed according to their coefficients of ancestry in three populations (K = 3) as estimated by STRUCTURE using 127 SNPs. The coefficients of ancestry display separately for each population samples were inferred from a single analysis (i.e. all individuals combined) and are represented using the same axes. See also Supplemental Figure S2 for the distribution of the coefficients of ancestry.
