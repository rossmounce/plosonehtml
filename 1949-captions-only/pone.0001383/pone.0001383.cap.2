Numbers on the branches represent statistical support expressed in Bayesian posterior probabilities/maximum likelihood bootstrap support computed with RAxML. Asterisks (*) indicate a bootstrap value of &lt;50%. In (B) brief names of the proteins annotated according to GenBank nomenclature follow the taxon names. The statistical support for non-relevant nodes was not included for simplicity.</p>
