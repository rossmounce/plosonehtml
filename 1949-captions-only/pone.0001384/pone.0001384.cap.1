                Figure 1.  Knockout serum replacement (KOSR) stimulates hESC self-renewal.(A) HUES9 cells cultured for five passages in the indicated media were fixed and stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (top row) or stained with propidium iodide to visualize DNA (bottom panel). (B) HUES7 cells cultured for five passages in the same media as above were stained with an anti-TRA-1-60 antibody (green) and with DAPI to visualize DNA (blue). Note how the majority of cells cultured in N2/B27-CDM are negative for the pluripotency markers ALP and TRA-1-60 whereas practically all cells cultured in N2/B27-CDM+15% KOSR or MEFCM are positive for these markers.
