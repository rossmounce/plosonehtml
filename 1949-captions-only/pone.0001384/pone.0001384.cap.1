(B) HUES7 cells cultured for five passages in the same media as above were stained with an anti-TRA-1-60 antibody (green) and with DAPI to visualize DNA (blue). Note how the majority of cells cultured in N2/B27-CDM are negative for the pluripotency markers ALP and TRA-1-60 whereas practically all cells cultured in N2/B27-CDM+15% KOSR or MEFCM are positive for these markers.</p>
