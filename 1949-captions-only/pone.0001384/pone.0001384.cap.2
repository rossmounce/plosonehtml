For each filter, two fractions were obtained corresponding to the low and high MW fractions. The latter fractions were obtained by resuspending the molecules retained by the filters in a volume of D-PBS equal to the original KOSR volume. (B) The six fractions obtained in this manner were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure that filters were working properly. Coomassie blue staining of the gel revealed that filters were indeed preventing high MW components to go through them. Lipid-rich BSA is the most abundant protein component in KOSR by a factor of about 1000 times and this is why no other proteins are seen in the gel. (C) HUES7 cells were cultured for five passages in N2/B27-CDM+15% (V:V) of each of the six fractions. After this period of time cells were fixed and stained for ALP activity. As seen in the top panel for the &gt;50 kDa fraction, all high MW fractions were able to maintain widespread ALP expression whereas, as shown in the bottom panel for the &lt;50 kDa fraction, all low MW fractions failed to maintain hESC pluripotency, as assessed by ALP expression.</p>
