Note how the vast majority of cells cultured with N2/B27-CDM alone have lost ALP expression whereas cells cultured in the presence of KOSR, AlbuMAX or even trypsinized AlbuMAX still maintain high levels of ALP activity. (B) HUES7 cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated media for five passages and subsequently used to analyze expression of TRA-1-60 by flow cytometry. Note how TRA-1-60 expression has been lost in most of the cells cultured with N2/B27-CDM alone or with N2/B27-CDM+BSA (lipid-poor), whereas TRA-1-60 expression remains much higher in the presence of lipid-rich BSA (AlbuMAX) or KOSR, even after trypsinization of the latter. Percentages shown correspond to the % of cells in each sample (blue curves) giving a fluorescence signal higher than 10<sup>2</sup> minus the % of cells giving this signal in the negative control (in grey, 5.8% of cells above 10<sup>2</sup>). (C) HUES9 cells were cultured for five passages in the indicated media, fixed and stained for TRA-1-60 expression (green) and with propidium iodide for DNA (red). Again, TRA-1-60 expression is lost in cells cultured with N2/B27-CDM alone but not when this medium is supplemented with KOSR, AlbuMAX or trypsinized AlbuMAX. (D) HUES9 cells cultured in the indicated media for five passages were used to analyze Oct4 and Nanog mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. As before, supplementation with KOSR, AlbuMAX or trypsinized AlbuMAX significantly reduced the loss of Oct4 and Nanog that occurs with N2/B27-CDM alone as compared with MEFCM. Data are shown as mean +/âˆ’ standard error of the mean (SEM) of two completely independent experiments. (E) Trypsinization of KOSR and AlbuMAX leads to the disappearance of BSA and other protein bands from these fractions, as observed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining</p>
