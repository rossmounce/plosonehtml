At the end of the EB formation and differentiation protocol (26 days in total), RNA was extracted from cells and used to measure the expression of different genes by quantitative RT-PCR. As a control, gene expression was also analyzed in undifferentiated HUES9 cells (cultured in MEFCM). As can be seen, differentiation occurred efficiently under all four conditions leading to an almost complete reduction in the expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4 and Nanog) as well as to very significant increases in the expression of ectoderm (GFAP and Sox1), endoderm (Sox17) and mesoderm (cTnT) markers. (B) Metaphase spread of HUES9 cells cultured for ten passages in N2/B27-CDM+1% AlbuMAX. The two pictures are the same, with the one below showing that there were 46 chromosomes in this cell.</p>
