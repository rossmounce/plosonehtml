At the end of this period cells were (A) stained for ALP activity and their DNA visualized with propidium iodide or (B) RNA was extracted from cells and the expression of Oct4 and Nanog mRNAs was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Lipids used are: lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and a chemically-defined mixture of saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) known commercially as chemically defined lipid concentrate (Invitrogen).</p>
