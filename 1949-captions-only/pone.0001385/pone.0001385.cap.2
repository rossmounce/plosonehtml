                Figure 2.  Summary of functional categories of genes expressed at higher levels in men than in women (nominal P&lt;0.01).The percentage of genes expressed at a higher level in men that were assigned to the functional categories (rectangular boxes) was higher than would be expected by chance based on the percentage of all genes in these categories (Bonferroni P&lt;0.05 according to EASE program). The ovals show the numbers of genes in more specific functional categories, with arrows showing how they relate to the broader categories.
