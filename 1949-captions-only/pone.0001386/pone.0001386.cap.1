                Figure 1.  Multiple Copies of the clpP1 Gene Region Found in Two Species.DNA fragments sequenced from the clpP1 region (thick black bars) for Lychnis chalcedonica (Lc) and Silene fruticosa (Sf). Shown in gray is the corresponding region, with the genes (boxes) and introns (dotted lines), in Spinacia. Thick white bars indicate non-homologous flanking regions (Lc2 is located differently in the chloroplast genome). Fragments with arrows on the left side consist of a continuous sequence from rbcL to petB (c. 18 kb). Thin lines mark lack of introns. Î¨ indicates stop codon. ? indicates unknown flaking regions.
