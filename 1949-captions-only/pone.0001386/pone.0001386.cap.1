Shown in gray is the corresponding region, with the genes (boxes) and introns (dotted lines), in <em>Spinacia</em>. Thick white bars indicate non-homologous flanking regions (Lc2 is located differently in the chloroplast genome). Fragments with arrows on the left side consist of a continuous sequence from <em>rbcL</em> to <em>petB</em> (c. 18 kb). Thin lines mark lack of introns. Î¨ indicates stop codon. ? indicates unknown flaking regions.</p>
