                Figure 2.  Positive Selection in the Chloroplast clpP Gene.A) dN/dS ratios calculated on the Eudicot tree topology. Numbers on nodes indicate classification as follows: 1 Myrtales, 2 Eurosids II, 5 Eurosids I, 6 Rosids, 13 Caryophyllales, 17 Euasterids I, 19 Euasterids II, 20 Asterids [36]; 3 Hologalegina, 4 Fabaceae [37]; 7, 8, 9 subgenus Behen, 10 subgenus Silene, 11, 12 Sileneae [17]; 14 Solaneae, 15 Solanoideae, 16 Solanaceae [38]. Values on branches are the dN/dS ratios, S: dN = 0, N: dS = 0. Ratios significantly above one (Bonferroni-corrected) are indicated by asterisks: ***P&lt;0.001, *P&lt;0.05. B) dN- and dS-branch (in grey and black, respectively) lengths imposed on topology from Bayesian analysis of third codon positions from the clpP1 exons Numbers on nodes are Bayesian posterior probabilities (Bpp). Only Bpp values&gt;0.50 are shown.
