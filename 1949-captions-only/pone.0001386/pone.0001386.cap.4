                Figure 4.  Bayesian Consensus Phylograms of the Tribe Sileneae.A) The clpP1 exon sequences, and B) the clpP1 intron sequences. Branches in bold have Bayesian posterior probabilities (Bpp) of 1.00. Only Bpp values above 0.90 are shown at nodes. Note that A and B are drawn at different scales. ** indicates taxa that lack introns in clpP1.
