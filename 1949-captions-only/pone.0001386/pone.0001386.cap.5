                Figure 5.  The clpP1 Gene and Flanking Regions with Primer Sites.Approximate position of general primers for Sileneae [18] with reference to Spinacia. Boxes correspond to protein coding genes with their name and position in Spinacia. Boxes above the line denote genes that are transcribed from left to right, and those below are transcribed from right to left. Dotted lines represent introns.
