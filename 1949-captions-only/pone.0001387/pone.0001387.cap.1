For (D-F), the average of anthocyanin contents from three replicates, each with 8–10 seedlings, is shown, with the bar representing the SD. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between <em>osu1-1</em> or <em>osu1-2</em> and wild-type (WT) under the same nutrient condition. (A) T3 seedlings of the two <em>P<sub>ROP2</sub>:GUS</em> lines (23G13-2 and 23G9-8) exhibited segregation of reddish purple cotyledons (indicated by arrows) and normal green cotyledons when grown in the presence of 1% sucrose (approximately 30 mM Suc, designated 30C) and 50 µg/mL hygromycin. Other T3 seedlings from the two parental plants (23G13-4 and 23G9-1) did not show such a phenotype. (B) Failure of 23G13-2 to complement 23G9-8-1 under 120 mM sucrose. 13-2 represents 23G13-2, which is designated <em>osu1-1</em>; 9-8-1 represents 23G-9-8-1, which is designated <em>osu1-2</em>; F1, the progeny from the cross of <em>osu1-1</em> X <em>osu1-2</em>. (C) The two mutants, <em>osu1-1</em> and <em>osu1-2</em>, showed enhanced sensitivities to increasing concentrations of sucrose (0C to 210C) at 30N after 7 days of vertical growth. For 30C/30N+180 Man, 180 mM of mannitol was added to the medium containing 30 mM Suc, so that the total carbohydrate concentration of the medium was equivalent to 210 mM Suc. (D) Quantitative analysis of cotyledon anthocyanin accumulation in response to various Suc (C) concentrations at 30N. FW, fresh weight. (E) Quantitative analysis of cotyledon anothcyanin accumulation in response to the same concentration (210 mM) of Suc, glucose (Glc) and Mannitol (Man). No sugar supplementation was used as the control. (F) Quantitative analysis of cotyledon anothcyanin accumulation in response to various concentrations of maltose and 3-<em>O</em>-methylglucose (OMG). No sugar supplementation was used as the control.</p>
