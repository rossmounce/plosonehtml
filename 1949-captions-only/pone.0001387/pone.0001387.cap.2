(B) Quantitative analysis of cotyledon anthocyanin accumulation under various C/N conditions. Cotyledons excised from the 7-day-old seedlings were used to measure anthocyanin levels in relative units per g of fresh weight (FW). Shown are the average and the SD of three replicates, each with 8–10 seedlings. (C) Quantitative analysis of root growth inhibition under various C/N. Primary root lengths were measured. The average of four replicates (each with 8–10 seedlings) is shown, with the bar representing the SD. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between <em>osu1-1</em> or <em>osu1-2</em> and wild-type (WT) under the same C/N condition.</p>
