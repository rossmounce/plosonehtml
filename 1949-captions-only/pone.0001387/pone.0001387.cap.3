Seeds were germinated and grown vertically on two C/N (0C/4N or 15C/4N) conditions with various phosphate (P) concentrations (0, 0.05, and 1.25 mM) for seven days. The average of three replicates (each with 6â€“8 seedlings) is shown, with the bar representing the SD. (B) Anthocyanin accumulation under sulphate deficiency. Seven-day-old seedlings vertically grown on the 15C/4N plates were transferred to liquid 0C/4N or 15C/4N medium supplemented with various sulphate (S) concentrations (0.0001, 0.0301, and 1.6001 mM) for additional three days. The average of three replicates (each with 5 or 6 seedlings) is shown, with the bar representing the SD. FW, fresh weight. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between <em>osu1-1</em> or <em>osu1-2</em> and wild-type (WT) under the same C/N/P or C/N/S condition.</p>
