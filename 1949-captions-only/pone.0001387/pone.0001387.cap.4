                Figure 4.  OSU1 acts upstream of MYB75 in response to high C/low N.(A and B) The OSU1 mutations altered MYB75 and MYB90 expression in response to high C/low N. Four-day-old WT, osu1-1 and osu1-2 seedlings grown vertically on 15C/4N were transferred to freshly prepared media with four different C/N conditions for three days of treatment. MYB75 (A) and MYB90 (B) mRNA levels were normalized with those of the reference (ACT2), and the relative MYB75 or MYB90 mRNA level under 0.5C/0.05N was set at 1. The average and the SD bar for MYB75 (n = 4) and MYB90 (n = 3) are shown. (C) RT-PCR analysis of MYB75 expression in MYB75 sense (#16, 20 and 24) and dominant negative SRDX lines (#13 and 17). Primers were used to amplify both endogenous and transgenic MYB75 expression. ACT2, an internal control. (D) Anthocyanin accumulation of the transgenic lines under high C/low N. The averages and SDs of three replicates, each with 10-15 seedlings, are shown. FW, fresh weight. (E and F) The MYB75 co-suppression line (Sense #24) is epistatic to osu1-1 at high C/low N. (E) Anthocyanin levels, and (F) root lengths at four different C/N conditions, each with four replicates. osu1-1/Sense #24 represents a homozygous line of osu-1 and MYB75 co-suppression. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from wild-type (WT) under the same C/N condition.
