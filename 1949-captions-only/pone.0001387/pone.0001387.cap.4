Four-day-old WT, <em>osu1-1</em> and <em>osu1-2</em> seedlings grown vertically on 15C/4N were transferred to freshly prepared media with four different C/N conditions for three days of treatment. <em>MYB75</em> (A) and <em>MYB90</em> (B) mRNA levels were normalized with those of the reference (<em>ACT2</em>), and the relative <em>MYB75</em> or <em>MYB90</em> mRNA level under 0.5C/0.05N was set at 1. The average and the SD bar for <em>MYB75</em> (n = 4) and <em>MYB90</em> (n = 3) are shown. (C) RT-PCR analysis of <em>MYB75</em> expression in <em>MYB75</em> sense (#16, 20 and 24) and dominant negative SRDX lines (#13 and 17). Primers were used to amplify both endogenous and transgenic <em>MYB75</em> expression. <em>ACT2</em>, an internal control. (D) Anthocyanin accumulation of the transgenic lines under high C/low N. The averages and SDs of three replicates, each with 10-15 seedlings, are shown. FW, fresh weight. (E and F) The <em>MYB75</em> co-suppression line (Sense #24) is epistatic to <em>osu1-1</em> at high C/low N. (E) Anthocyanin levels, and (F) root lengths at four different C/N conditions, each with four replicates. <em>osu1-1</em>/Sense #24 represents a homozygous line of <em>osu-1</em> and <em>MYB75</em> co-suppression. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from wild-type (WT) under the same C/N condition.</p>
