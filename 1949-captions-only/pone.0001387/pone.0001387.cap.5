                Figure 5.  OSU1 suppresses ASN1 expression in response to low C/high N.Seedlings were treated with various C/N conditions and real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed as described in Figure 4 legend. mRNA levels were normalized with those of the ACT2 reference, and the relative ASN1 mRNA level under 0.5C/0.05N was set at 1. The bar represents the SD of three replicates. Statistical analysis by t-test; the asterisk (*) above the osu1-2 column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from wild-type (WT) under the same C/N condition.
