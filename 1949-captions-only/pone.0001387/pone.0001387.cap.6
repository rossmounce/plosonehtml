The number of recombinants (chromosomes) is indicated for each marker used on the BAC clones. The name and the primers for each marker are listed in <a href="#pone.0001387.s001">Table S1</a>. The <em>osu1-1</em> mutant gene is mapped to a region between two markers (470560 on the BAC clone T11I11, and (470251 on the BAC clone F3F9) that respectively gave one and two recombinants. (B) A schematic representation of the <em>OSU1</em> genomic structure. <em>osu1-3</em> had an insertion of T-DNA surrounded by its two left border (LB) sequences that eliminated 10 bp starting from the 54<sup>th</sup> bp of the eighth exon (sequencing data for the T-DNA and genomic DNA junction not shown). The positions of start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TGA) were indicated. (C) Regular RT-PCR analysis of At1g78240 mRNA expression in the three <em>osu1</em> alleles. PCR reactions with 35 or 39 cycles were used to amplify the 2,055 bp CDS region of At1g78240. <em>ACT2</em> was used as an internal control. (D) Real-time PCR analysis of At1g78240 transcript levels. A 98 bp fragment of At1g78240 cDNA located in the second exon was amplified. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from wild-type (WT). The bar represents the SD of three replicates. (E) <em>osu1-3</em> fails to complement <em>osu1-1</em> and <em>osu1-2</em>, respectively. The F1 seeds of the crosses were sown on the medium containing 15C/0.05N and 0.5C/4N, respectively, and two representative seedlings vertically grown for 7 days for each genotype are shown.</p>
