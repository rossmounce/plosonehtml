                Figure 6.  Molecular cloning of the OSU1 gene.(A) A diagram showing the osu1 mutant gene mapping. The number of recombinants (chromosomes) is indicated for each marker used on the BAC clones. The name and the primers for each marker are listed in Table S1. The osu1-1 mutant gene is mapped to a region between two markers (470560 on the BAC clone T11I11, and (470251 on the BAC clone F3F9) that respectively gave one and two recombinants. (B) A schematic representation of the OSU1 genomic structure. osu1-3 had an insertion of T-DNA surrounded by its two left border (LB) sequences that eliminated 10 bp starting from the 54th bp of the eighth exon (sequencing data for the T-DNA and genomic DNA junction not shown). The positions of start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TGA) were indicated. (C) Regular RT-PCR analysis of At1g78240 mRNA expression in the three osu1 alleles. PCR reactions with 35 or 39 cycles were used to amplify the 2,055 bp CDS region of At1g78240. ACT2 was used as an internal control. (D) Real-time PCR analysis of At1g78240 transcript levels. A 98 bp fragment of At1g78240 cDNA located in the second exon was amplified. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) from wild-type (WT). The bar represents the SD of three replicates. (E) osu1-3 fails to complement osu1-1 and osu1-2, respectively. The F1 seeds of the crosses were sown on the medium containing 15C/0.05N and 0.5C/4N, respectively, and two representative seedlings vertically grown for 7 days for each genotype are shown.
