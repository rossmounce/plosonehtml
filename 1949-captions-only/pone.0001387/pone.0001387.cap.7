WT seedlings were first grown vertically on agar-solidified 15C/4N medium for four days of optimal growth and then transferred to various C/N media for three days. mRNA levels were normalized with those of the <em>ACT2</em> reference, and the relative <em>OSU1</em> mRNA level under 0.5C/0.05N was set at 1. The bar represents the SD of three replicates. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA; the asterisk (*) above the column indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) compared to the control (0.5C/0.05N). (B) RT-PCR analysis of <em>OSU1</em> expression in different organs. Shown are shoots (Sh) and roots (R) of 7-day-old seedlings, mature leaves (L), stems (St) and flowers (F). <em>ACT2</em>, an internal control. (C-H) Expression patterns revealed by histochemical examination of the <em>OSU1</em> promoter activity using the <em>GUS</em> reporter. Shown are a 7-day-old young seedling stained for 4 hours (C) and another for 10 hours (D), enlarged views of root hairs (E) and a root tip (F), a mature leaf (G), and an inflorescence with several flowers (H).</p>
