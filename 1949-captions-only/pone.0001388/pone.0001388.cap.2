                Figure 2.  Odds ratio plot (with 95% confidence intervals) for CD209 -336A/G.The odds ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) for CD209 -336A/G for each of the studies are shown. Studies include the Barreiro study (ref. 30), The Gambia (A) (ref. 33), The Gambia (B) (ref. 34), Republic of Guinea (ref. 33), Guinea-Bissau (ref. 33) and Malawi (ref. 35). The central mark on each line indicates the odds ratio for each study and the line indicates that 95% confidence interval for each. The dashed line indicates the extent of the 95% confidence interval for the combined analysis of the populations analyzed for this study.
