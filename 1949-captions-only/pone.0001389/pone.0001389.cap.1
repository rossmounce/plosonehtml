                Figure 1.  DNA sequences used in this study.Sequence shows the PPT region of Ty1. All the oligonucleotides (RAGs) used in this study correspond either to the plus or minus strand of this sequence, depending on the direction of the arrow. The relative positions of the oligonucleotides and modifications are shown in this figure.
