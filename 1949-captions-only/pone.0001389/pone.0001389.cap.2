                Figure 2.  Pyrophosphorolysis by WT and D211N Ty1 RT of a recessed primer terminus.Pyrophosphorolysis reactions by WT or mutant D211N Ty1 RT in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate were analyzed by in vitro assay as described under materials and methods using 5â€² 32P-end labeled 14-mer/28-mer substrate (RAG*998/RAG 928, Fig. 1. Labeled end is depicted by *). A, represents time course of WT reactions in seconds with or without PPi. B represents time course of D211N reactions in seconds with or without PPi. Control reactions in both panels are in the absence of Mg2+ or enzyme.
