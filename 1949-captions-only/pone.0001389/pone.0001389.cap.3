                Figure 3.  Pyrophosphorolysis by WT and D211N Ty1 RT of a blunt-ended primer terminus.Pyrophosphorolysis reactions of WT or mutant D211N Ty1 RT were carried out under same conditions as Fig. 2 in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, using 5â€² 32P-end labeled 28-mer/14-mer substrate (RAG*928/998, Fig. 1). A, represents time course of WT reactions in seconds in the presence or absence of PPi. B, represents time course of D211N reactions with or without PPi. Control reactions are in the absence of Mg2+ or enzyme.
