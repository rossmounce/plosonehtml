Substrates are 5′ <sup>32</sup>P-end labeled primers of lengths 14, 20, 24, 27, 28-mer (RAG 998, RAG 1250, RAG 1249, RAG 1248, RAG 952 respectively, <a href="#pone-0001389-g001">Fig. 1</a>), each paired with the 28′-mer template oligo (RAG 1109, <a href="#pone-0001389-g001">Fig. 1</a>). A, shows WT reactions with different primer length substrates in the presence or absence of PPi. B, represents D<sub>211</sub>N reactions with or without PPi. Control reactions on both the panels are in the absence of enzyme or Metal <sup>2+</sup>. C and D represent bar graphs for WT and DN Ty1 RT reactions depicting ratios of intensities of cleaved products to the total products in reactions (I cleaved products/I total bands). Black bars are for reactions in Mg<sup>2+</sup> while grey bars are for reactions in Mn<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
