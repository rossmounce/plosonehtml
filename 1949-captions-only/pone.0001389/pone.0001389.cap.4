                Figure 4.  Effect of primer length on pyrophosphorolysis.Pyrophosphorolysis by WT or mutant D211N Ty1 RT were carried out for 60 minutes in the presence of either 10 mM Mg2+ or 2 mM Mn2+. Substrates are 5′ 32P-end labeled primers of lengths 14, 20, 24, 27, 28-mer (RAG 998, RAG 1250, RAG 1249, RAG 1248, RAG 952 respectively, Fig. 1), each paired with the 28′-mer template oligo (RAG 1109, Fig. 1). A, shows WT reactions with different primer length substrates in the presence or absence of PPi. B, represents D211N reactions with or without PPi. Control reactions on both the panels are in the absence of enzyme or Metal 2+. C and D represent bar graphs for WT and DN Ty1 RT reactions depicting ratios of intensities of cleaved products to the total products in reactions (I cleaved products/I total bands). Black bars are for reactions in Mg2+ while grey bars are for reactions in Mn2+.
