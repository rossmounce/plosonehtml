Substrates are 5′ <sup>32</sup>P-end labeled substrate (RAG*1249/1109, <a href="#pone-0001389-g001">Fig. 1</a>). A, shows WT reactions in the presence or absence of 200 fold excess of cold 24-mer/28′-mer DNA/DNA substrate trap and with or without PPi (depicted as + and – respectively). B, similarly represents D<sub>211</sub>N reactions. Control reactions on both the panels are in the absence of enzymes. Trap effectiveness controls are also shown.</p>
