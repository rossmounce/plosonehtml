                Figure 5.  Processivity of the Ty1 pyrophosphorolysis.Pyrophosphorolysis by WT or mutant D211N Ty1 RT were carried out for 60 minutes in the presence or the absence of trap and in the presence of either 10 mM Mg2+ or 2 mM Mn2+. Substrates are 5′ 32P-end labeled substrate (RAG*1249/1109, Fig. 1). A, shows WT reactions in the presence or absence of 200 fold excess of cold 24-mer/28′-mer DNA/DNA substrate trap and with or without PPi (depicted as + and – respectively). B, similarly represents D211N reactions. Control reactions on both the panels are in the absence of enzymes. Trap effectiveness controls are also shown.
