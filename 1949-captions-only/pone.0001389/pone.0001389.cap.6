A 5′ <sup>32</sup>P-end labeled substrate 15-mer/28′-mer (RAG*1316/1109, <a href="#pone-0001389-g001">Fig. 1</a>) was used for the experiment. For WT, samples were taken at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 60 second time points. For the mutant, samples were taken at 5 or 10 second intervals for the first minute and then every minute for the next 4 minutes. C and D show pre-steady-state rate dependence of nucleotide cleavage on PPi concentration for WT and mutant respectively, based on the rates derived from Equation 1 (see Experimental Procedures) in A and B. Curves represent the best fits to Equation 2 (see Experimental Procedures).</p>
