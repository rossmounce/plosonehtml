                Figure 7.  Scheme for phosphoryl transfer reaction by polymerases, from the perspective of pyrophosphorolysis.The polymerase active site contains both a P site (blue circle) in which the 3′ primer-end resides during polymerization, and an N site (pink circle) in which the templated dNTP resides during polymerization. Translocation is required for processive polymerization or pyrophosphorolysis and refers to movement of the 3′ primer-end between the P and N sites (cartoons 1–4). For pyrophosphorolysis to occur, both the 3′ primer-end and a PPi molecule must be correctly positioned in the N site (cartoon 4). It is not known how binding of PPi affects the equilibrium of the 3′ primer-end between the P and N sites (cartoon 2 vs. 4), or whether PPi-binding affinities are affected by the location of the 3′ primer-end (cartoons 1 to 2 versus 3 to 4). Once a ternary complex forms between enzyme, primer template and PPi (cartoon 4), a conformational change is postulated (cartoon 5) that favors the chemical step of nucleophilic attack by the PPi of the 5′ phosphodiester bond in the terminal templated nucleoside monophosphate, and the breakage of the phosphodiester bond to form a dNTP and a new 3′ OH in the P site (cartoon 6 ). Subsequent conformational change in the enzyme (cartoon 7) allows removal of the dNTP and subsequent translocation of the new 3′ primer-end from the P site to the N site (cartoons 1–4).
