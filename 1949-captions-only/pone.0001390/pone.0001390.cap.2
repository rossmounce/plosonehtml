                Figure 2.  Likelihood mapping of HIV-1A and B pol sequences.Each dot represents the likelihoods of the three possible unrooted trees for a set of four sequences (quartets) selected randomly from the data set (see Materials and Methods): dots close to the corners or the sides represent, respectively, tree-like, or network-like phylogenetic signal in the data. The central area of the likelihood map, highlighted by a smaller blue triangle inside the map, represents star-like signal. The percentage of dots in the central area is given at the basis of each map. A. Likelihood mapping of 10,000 random quartets of HIV-1A (left) and HIV-1B (right) Albanian sequences. B. Likelihood mapping of 10,000 random quartets of HIV-1A (left) and HIV-1B (right) Albanian+reference sequences downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV databases.
