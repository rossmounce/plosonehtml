The central area of the likelihood map, highlighted by a smaller blue triangle inside the map, represents star-like signal. The percentage of dots in the central area is given at the basis of each map. A. Likelihood mapping of 10,000 random quartets of HIV-1A (left) and HIV-1B (right) Albanian sequences. B. Likelihood mapping of 10,000 random quartets of HIV-1A (left) and HIV-1B (right) Albanian+reference sequences downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV databases.</p>
