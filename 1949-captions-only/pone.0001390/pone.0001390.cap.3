Genetic distances were transformed into a timescale of years taking into account the different sampling times of the viral strains and by enforcing a relaxed molecular clock model (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Solid lines indicate median, and 95% upper and lower high posterior density (HPD) estimates of Ne, according to the color legend to the right; dotted blue lines are parametric estimate of Ne(t) according to the exponential demographic model. Broken lines between the top and bottom panels highlight the time window common to the two epidemics. Top panel. HIV-1 subtype B. Each arrow indicates the estimated origin of the corresponding Albanian clade (indicated by the roman numeral) in the tree in <a href="#pone-0001390-g001">Figure 1B</a>. The first arrow from the left indicates the time of the MRCA. 95% HPD intervals are given in parenthesis below each estimate. Bottom panel. HIV-1 subtype A. The arrow indicates the estimated origin of the MRCA of the Albanian clade shown by the tree in <a href="#pone-0001390-g001">Figure 1A</a>. 95% HPD intervals are given in parenthesis below each estimate.</p>
