                Figure 1.  Effects of recurring ethanol exposure on wild-type CS males.(A) Sedation profile. Flies were exposed to ethanol vapor in 70% Flypub (diamond) or 95% Flypub (triangle). MST in 70% Flypub was higher than that in 95% Flypub on all exposures and recurring treatment in both ethanol concentrations increased MST. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration and exposure, and a marginal interaction of two factors (concentration effect, F1,72 = 383.4, p&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, F5,72 = 40.5, p&lt;0.0001; interaction, F5,72 = 2.7, p = 0.03; n = 7). Post hoc Tukey-Kramer tests revealed the significant difference of the 1st from the other exposures in both ethanol concentrations. All data are reported as meanÂ±standard error of the mean. (B) Ethanol concentrations. CS males were subjected to ethanol treatment for 1, 2 or 6 days (1st, 2nd, 6th) in 95% Flypub and ethanol contents were measured at 16 or 30 min after the onset of ethanol exposure. CS males without ethanol treatment (No EtOH) were used to measure the basal level. There was no significant difference in the ethanol contents of the males on the 1st, 2nd and 6th exposure at 16 min (ANOVA, F2,11 = 1.75, p = 0.23, n = 4) or 30 min (F2,11 = 3.98, p = 0.06, n = 4).
