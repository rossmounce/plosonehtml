Flies were exposed to ethanol vapor in 70% Flypub (diamond) or 95% Flypub (triangle). MST in 70% Flypub was higher than that in 95% Flypub on all exposures and recurring treatment in both ethanol concentrations increased MST. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration and exposure, and a marginal interaction of two factors (concentration effect, <em>F<sub>1,72</sub></em> = 383.4, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, <em>F<sub>5,72</sub></em> = 40.5, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; interaction, <em>F<sub>5,72</sub></em> = 2.7, <em>p</em> = 0.03; <em>n</em> = 7). <em>Post hoc</em> Tukey-Kramer tests revealed the significant difference of the 1<sup>st</sup> from the other exposures in both ethanol concentrations. All data are reported as meanÂ±standard error of the mean. (B) Ethanol concentrations. <em>CS</em> males were subjected to ethanol treatment for 1, 2 or 6 days (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>) in 95% Flypub and ethanol contents were measured at 16 or 30 min after the onset of ethanol exposure. <em>CS</em> males without ethanol treatment (No EtOH) were used to measure the basal level. There was no significant difference in the ethanol contents of the males on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> exposure at 16 min (ANOVA, <em>F<sub>2,11</sub></em> = 1.75, <em>p</em> = 0.23, <em>n</em> = 4) or 30 min (<em>F<sub>2,11</sub></em> = 3.98, <em>p</em> = 0.06, <em>n</em> = 4).</p>
