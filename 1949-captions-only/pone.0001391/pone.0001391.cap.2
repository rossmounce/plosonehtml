                Figure 2.  Effects of recurring ethanol exposure on courtship behavior of CS males.(A) The percentage of males engaged in intermale courtship progressively increased upon additional ethanol treatments in 95% Flypub. Least squares regression showed the significant effect of exposure (r2 = 0.68, p&lt;0.0001, n = 10). (B) CS males subjected to daily ethanol exposure in 70% Flypub exhibited the exposure-dependent increase in intermale courtship but at the significantly reduced levels compared to those challenged with 95% ethanol. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration, exposure, and interaction (concentration effect, F1,24 = 54.02, p&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, F3,24 = 138.2, p&lt;0.0001; interaction, F3,24 = 6.7, p = 0.0019; n = 4). Post hoc two-tailed Student t-test showed the significant difference of the courtship scores on the 2nd (p&lt;0.005) or 3rd exposure (p&lt;0.0005) (marked by double asterisks). (C) The chronic-ethanol-treated males displayed active courtship toward the decapitated previously-ethanol-na誰ve males under the influence of ethanol (chronic to na誰ve), whereas the ethanol-na誰ve males, on the 1st ethanol exposure, displayed negligible courtship toward the decapitated chronic-ethanol-exposed males (na誰ve to chronic). Two-tailed Student t-test showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.0001, n = 6, marked by double asterisks). (D) Two or 4 wk-old CS males exhibited the increased levels of intermale courtship compared to 4 d-old males when tested in 95% Flypub. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of age and exposure, and a marginal interaction (age effect, F2,36 = 16.6, p&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, F3,36 = 61.7, p&lt;0.0001; interaction, F6,36 = 2.58, p = 0.035; n = 4). Tukey-Kramer tests showed that the intermale courtship activities of 2 and 4 wk-old males were significantly different from that of 4 d-old males on the 2nd exposure (marked by double asterisks).
