Least squares regression showed the significant effect of exposure (<em>r<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.68, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001, <em>n</em> = 10). (B) <em>CS</em> males subjected to daily ethanol exposure in 70% Flypub exhibited the exposure-dependent increase in intermale courtship but at the significantly reduced levels compared to those challenged with 95% ethanol. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration, exposure, and interaction (concentration effect, <em>F<sub>1,24</sub></em> = 54.02, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, <em>F<sub>3,24</sub></em> = 138.2, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; interaction, <em>F<sub>3,24</sub></em> = 6.7, <em>p</em> = 0.0019; <em>n</em> = 4). <em>Post hoc</em> two-tailed Student <em>t</em>-test showed the significant difference of the courtship scores on the 2<sup>nd</sup> (<em>p</em>&lt;0.005) or 3<sup>rd</sup> exposure (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0005) (marked by double asterisks). (C) The chronic-ethanol-treated males displayed active courtship toward the decapitated previously-ethanol-na誰ve males under the influence of ethanol (chronic to na誰ve), whereas the ethanol-na誰ve males, on the 1<sup>st</sup> ethanol exposure, displayed negligible courtship toward the decapitated chronic-ethanol-exposed males (na誰ve to chronic). Two-tailed Student <em>t</em>-test showed a significant difference (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001, <em>n</em> = 6, marked by double asterisks). (D) Two or 4 wk-old <em>CS</em> males exhibited the increased levels of intermale courtship compared to 4 d-old males when tested in 95% Flypub. Two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of age and exposure, and a marginal interaction (age effect, <em>F<sub>2,36</sub></em> = 16.6, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, <em>F<sub>3,36</sub></em> = 61.7, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; interaction, <em>F<sub>6,36</sub></em> = 2.58, <em>p</em> = 0.035; <em>n</em> = 4). Tukey-Kramer tests showed that the intermale courtship activities of 2 and 4 wk-old males were significantly different from that of 4 d-old males on the 2<sup>nd</sup> exposure (marked by double asterisks).</p>
