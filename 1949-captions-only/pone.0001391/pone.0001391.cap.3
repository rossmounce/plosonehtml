                Figure 3.  Effects of chronic ethanol on courtship behavior of fru males.fru1 and fru3 males showed vigorous intermale courtship in Flypub without ethanol (No EtOH). Upon daily ethanol treatments in 95% Flypub, their courtship activities did not change with additional ethanol treatment while the courtship levels under ethanol were lower than those without ethanol (ANOVA: fru1, F3,27 = 3.24, p = 0.0396, Tukey-Kramer showed a significant difference between No EtOH and 3rd EtOH; fru3, F3,27 = 16.94, p&lt;0.0001, No EtOH was significantly different from the others by Tukey-Kramer; n = 7). NS, not significant. CS males tested together with fru males as a control showed negligible intermale courtship in the absence of ethanol and on the 1st ethanol exposure (marked by diamonds); however, their courtship activities were enhanced under the influence of ethanol on the 2nd and 3rd ethanol treatments (F3,27 = 42.86, p&lt;0.0001; double asterisks, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer).
