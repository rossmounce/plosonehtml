Upon daily ethanol treatments in 95% Flypub, their courtship activities did not change with additional ethanol treatment while the courtship levels under ethanol were lower than those without ethanol (ANOVA: <em>fru<sup>1</sup></em>, <em>F<sub>3,27</sub></em> = 3.24, <em>p</em> = 0.0396, Tukey-Kramer showed a significant difference between No EtOH and 3<sup>rd</sup> EtOH; <em>fru<sup>3</sup></em>, <em>F<sub>3,27</sub></em> = 16.94, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001, No EtOH was significantly different from the others by Tukey-Kramer; <em>n</em> = 7). NS, not significant. <em>CS</em> males tested together with <em>fru</em> males as a control showed negligible intermale courtship in the absence of ethanol and on the 1<sup>st</sup> ethanol exposure (marked by diamonds); however, their courtship activities were enhanced under the influence of ethanol on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> ethanol treatments (<em>F<sub>3,27</sub></em> = 42.86, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; double asterisks, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer).</p>
