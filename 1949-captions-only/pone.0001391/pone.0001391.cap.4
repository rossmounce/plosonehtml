                Figure 4.  Ethanol-induced courtship and sedation of w and transgenic w males.w1118 males did not display any discernible ethanol-induced intermale courtship upon recurring ethanol treatment, which was reversed by transgenic w expression in mw+/+, mw+/mw+, and hs-mw+/+ without (hs-mw+/+) and with heat shock (hs-mw+/+ Hs). Diamonds denote no courtship observed. General linear model revealed the significant effects of exposure, genotype, and interaction (exposure effect, F3,167 = 266.85, p&lt;0.0001; genotype effect, F5,167 = 181.04, p&lt;0.0001; double asterisks, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer tests in each exposure; interaction, F15,167 = 28.23, p&lt;0.0001; n = 3â€“11).
