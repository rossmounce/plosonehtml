                Figure 5.  Effects of inhibited dopamine neuronal activities on the ethanol-induced courtship.(A) TH-GAL4/UAS-Shits and DDC-GAL4/UAS-Shits males, when subjected to daily ethanol exposure at 32°C to block synaptic output of dopamine neurons, displayed drastically reduced intermale courtship compared to the control mw+/UAS-Shits males on all exposures (1st exposure, F2,21 = 18.24, p&lt;0.0001; 2nd, F2,21 = 35.26, p&lt;0.0001; 3rd, F2,21 = 27.02, p&lt;0.0001; n = 7–8). Double asterisks, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer tests. (B) TH-GAL4/UAS-Shits males, when subjected to daily ethanol exposure at room temperature, showed intermale courtship activities comparable to those of the control TH-GAL4/UAS-GFP males, indicating that Shits expressed in dopamine neurons without the dominant negative activity has no effect on the ethanol-induced intermale courtship (Student t-test on all exposures, p&gt;0.5, n = 7).
