                Figure 6.  Effects of ethanol on male sexual behavior toward females.(A) Courtship. The wings of CS males or females were clipped to distinguish the sex. The ethanol-na√Øve or ethanol-treated males were housed with an equal number of virgin females and subjected to ethanol exposure in 95% Flypub. Two-factor ANOVA revealed the significant effects of partner, exposure, and interaction in both sets of experiments (intact male with wing-clipped female: partner effect, F1,27 = 75.8, p&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, F1,27 = 93.9, p&lt;0.0001; interaction, F1,27 = 53.2, p&lt;0.0001; n = 7. Wing-clipped male with intact female: partner effect, F1,27 = 120.8, p&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, F1,27 = 239.5, p&lt;0.0001; interaction, F1,27 = 43.2, p&lt;0.0001; n = 7). Double asterisks, significant difference by planned Student t-tests. (B) Copulation. CS males under the influence of ethanol on the 1st and 6th exposures displayed significantly reduced copulation with virgin females (ANOVA, F2,20 = 47.7, p&lt;0.0001; double asterisk, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer; n = 7).
