The wings of <em>CS</em> males or females were clipped to distinguish the sex. The ethanol-na√Øve or ethanol-treated males were housed with an equal number of virgin females and subjected to ethanol exposure in 95% Flypub. Two-factor ANOVA revealed the significant effects of partner, exposure, and interaction in both sets of experiments (intact male with wing-clipped female: partner effect, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 75.8, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 93.9, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; interaction, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 53.2, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; <em>n</em> = 7. Wing-clipped male with intact female: partner effect, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 120.8, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; exposure effect, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 239.5, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; interaction, <em>F<sub>1,27</sub></em> = 43.2, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; <em>n</em> = 7). Double asterisks, significant difference by planned Student <em>t</em>-tests. (B) Copulation. <em>CS</em> males under the influence of ethanol on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> exposures displayed significantly reduced copulation with virgin females (ANOVA, <em>F<sub>2,20</sub></em> = 47.7, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001; double asterisk, significant difference by Tukey-Kramer; <em>n</em> = 7).</p>
