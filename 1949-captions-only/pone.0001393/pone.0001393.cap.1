                Figure 1.  Inactivated S. aureus stimulates epithelial wound repair.Mechanically wounded NCI-H292 cell monolayers (A) and differentiated human PBECs (B) were exposed to heat-inactivated S. aureus (~0.5Ã—108 CFU/ml) or medium alone (control). Wound repair was assessed by measuring the remaining wound area (RWA) for NCI-H292 cells (n = 5 in both groups; * P&lt;0.001) and TER for PBECs (n = 6 in control group; n = 17 in S. aureus group; * P&lt;0.01) 24 h after injury. Bars represent SD.
