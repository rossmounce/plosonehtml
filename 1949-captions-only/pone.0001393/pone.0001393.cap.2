                Figure 2.  TLR ligands regulate epithelial wound repair and migration.(A) Mechanically wounded NCI-H292 cell monolayers were stimulated with 2 µg/ml PGN, 1 µg/ml Pam3CSK4, 10 µg/ml MDP, or SFM alone. RWA was measured during 3 days after damage (n = 3; * P&lt;0.05 as compared to SFM); (B) Representative micrographs of wounds in SFM and PGN groups after 24 h, the areas of increased cellularity (left) and lamellipodia formation (right) are marked with the arrows; bar = 500 µm (left panel);  = 150 µm (right panel). (C) Small linear (~0.2 mm in width) wounds were generated by scraping of NCI-H292 cell monolayers and cell migration in control and stimulated (10 µg/ml PGN) was analyzed 1 day after injury as shown in the representative micrograph; bar = 300 µm. (D) Differentiated human PBECs were mechanically injured and then stimulated with LTA (10 and 50 µg/ml); TER was monitored during 3 days after wounding (n = 6; * P&lt;0.02); (E) Mechanically wounded NCI-H292 cell monolayers were stimulated with PGN, Pam3CSK4 (Pam), poly(I:C), ultra pure LPS, flagellin (Flag), CL097 (CL), and ODN2006 type B at indicated concentrations (µg/ml), or SFM alone; RWA at 24 h after injury was measured (n = 5; * P&lt;0.01). Bars represent SD.
