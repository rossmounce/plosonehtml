NCI-H292 cells were assayed after 18 h of serum starvation, PBECs-without serum starvation. In B, the value of starting WST measurement at the beginning of experiment (before changing to serum-free conditions) is shown as “Start”. (C) Semi-confluent human PBECs were exposed to TLR2 ligands Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK4, PGN, or LTA for 24 h. The numbers of apoptotic cells, which correlate positively with binding to exogenously added annexin V, were analyzed by an annexin-binding assay using FACS. Black histograms refer to SFM group, and colored histograms refer to different stimuli (concentrations are indicated at the upper rows immediately below the names of the groups). At the lower rows, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of annexin binding is indicated. The data of representative experiments is shown. Bars represent SD.</p>
