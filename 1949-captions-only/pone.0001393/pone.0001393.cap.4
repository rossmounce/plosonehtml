                Figure 4.  Microbial factors regulate epithelial repair using TLR and EGFR pathways independently of inflammatory cytokines.(A) At the day of seeding, NCI-H292 cells were transfected with 5 nM of one of two different siRNAs against TLR2 (si1 and si2), control siRNA (contr si), or remained untransfected; 48 h after, the cells were subjected to serum-starvation for 16 h. Confluent monolayers were wounded mechanically and then immediately stimulated with 10 µg/ml PGN or SFM; 24 h after stimulation the RWA was measured (n = 5; * P&lt;0.001 as compared to the PGN group, N.S. = not significant). (B) Mechanically wounded NCI-H292 cell monolayers were stimulated with 10 µg/ml PGN in the presence of a mixture of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 (each at 1 µg/ml); RWAs were calculated at the end of day 1 after injury (n = 4 in PGN group, n = 5 in other groups; * P&lt;0.001, N.S. = not significant). (C) Serum-starved NCI-H292 cells were stimulated with 1 µg/ml Pam3CSK4 (Pam) or SFM (control) during 10 min and then lysed with RIPA, centrifuged and subjected for phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) antibody microarray; representative membranes corresponding to control (upper) and Pam (lower)-stimulated cells are shown; activated RTKs are indicated. (D-E) Confluent NCI-H292 monolayers were exposed to the selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase AG1478 (AG, 1 µM), 1 h before and immediately after wounding prior to addition of 10 µg/ml PGN, 20 ng/ml TGF-α, or SFM, or treated with same stimuli without exposure to AG1478; (D) RWAs were measured 24 h after wounding (n = 5, * P&lt;0.001). (E) Wound edges of NCI-H292 monolayers were analyzed for cell migration; micrographs of representative experiment; asterisk = lamellipodia formation; bar = 500 µm. Bars represent SD.
