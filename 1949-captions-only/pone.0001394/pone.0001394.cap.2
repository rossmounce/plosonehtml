                Figure 2.  High classification rank accuracies for object exemplars.Reliable (p&lt;0.001) accuracies for the classification of object exemplars within participants (filled bars) were reached for eleven out of twelve participants, and reliable (p&lt;0.001) accuracies for the classification of object exemplars when training on the union of data from eleven participants (unfilled bars) were reached for eight out of twelve participants. The dashed line indicates the highest mean of the permutation distribution across participants under the null hypothesis of no difference, i.e., chance level, among object exemplars for cross-participants object exemplar identification.
