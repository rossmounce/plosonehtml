                Figure 4.  High classification accuracies for object categories.Reliable (p&lt;0.001) accuracies for classification of objects by category (filled bars) were reached for all participants and reliable (p&lt;0.001) accuracies for classification of objects by category when training on the union of data from eleven participants (unfilled bars) were reached for ten out of twelve participants. The dashed line indicates the highest mean of the permutation distribution across participants under the null hypothesis of no difference among the categories (i.e., chance level) for cross-participants category identification.
