                Figure 5.  Commonality in voxel locations across the three participants having the highest category classification accuracies.Voxel locations for the tools category are shown in red, and voxel locations for the dwellings category are shown in blue on the three-dimensional rendering of the T1 MNI single-subject brain. Yellow ellipses indicate commonality in voxel locations for the tools category in LIPL across participants.
