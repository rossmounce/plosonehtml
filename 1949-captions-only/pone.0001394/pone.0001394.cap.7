                Figure 7.  Brain regions in the space of the first two principal components of the compromise matrix based on the regions' confusion errors.The first principal component separates anterior and posterior regions, and accounts for 8% of the variance. The second principal component separates parietal and temporal regions, and accounts for 6% of the variance in the data. Region labels are color-coded by lobe, and are described in Table 1. The arrows are used to separate labels that are close to each other.
