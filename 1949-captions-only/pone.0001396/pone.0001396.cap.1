                Figure 1.  Spatial and temporal expression profile of miR-10c.A) RT-PCR with primers located 5â€² of miR-10c and within the coding region of exon 1 of HoxB4a shows inclusion of miR-10c and HoxB4a on the same transcript. PCR 35 cycles, -RT: no reverse transcriptase added. B) RT-PCR shows similar temporal expression during development of HoxB4a (28 cycles) and miR-10c pre-miRNA (35 cycles). C) Whole mount in situ hybridization on different stage Zebrafish embryos shows mutually exclusive expression of the HoxB3a rhombomere 5/6 domain (red) with miR-10c (purple).
