Known and EST database inferred mature <em>Hox</em> transcripts are indicated in blue. The <em>miR-10c</em> microRNA gene is indicated in green. B) Schematic representation of the <em>HoxB1a</em> and <em>HoxB3a E-YFP</em> sensor constructs and the <em>HoxB3a</em> overexpression construct. Red boxes indicate the position of the seed sequences. The light red box in the <em>HoxB1a</em> 3â€² UTR is a target site flanked at position one by a T instead of an A. C) Validation of the <em>HoxB1a</em> and <em>HoxB3a E-YFP</em> sensor constructs by injection of wildtype (WT) and seed mutant (mut) constructs in presence and absence of <em>miR-10</em> siRNA. <em>E-CFP</em> was co-injected as a loading control. D) Phenotypic sensor assay to validate the <em>HoxB3a</em> ORF <em>miR-10</em> target sites. Overexpression of 40pg <em>HoxB3a</em> results in severe anterior and posterior truncations that are rescued by co-injection with <em>miR-10</em> siRNA</p>
