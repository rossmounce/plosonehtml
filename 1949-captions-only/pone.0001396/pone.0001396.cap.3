                Figure 3.  Morpholino knockdown of miR-10.A) ClustalW alignment of the 5 Zebrafish miR-10 precursor sequences. Indicated are the positions of the mature microRNA, the hairloop and the miR-10* (antisense pairing sequence in the hairpin). The target sequences for both morpholino reagent 1 and 2 are indicated with yellow bars (MO1 and MO2). B) Northern blot for all 4 different miR-10 isoforms in morpholino injected embryos at 24, 48 and 72 hpf. There is an absence or very strong downregulation of the mature microRNA in the morpholino injected samples. C) LNA in situ hybridization for miR-10b and miR-10c in 72 hpf miR-10 morphants. The endogenous expression of miR-10b and miR-10c is no longer detected.
