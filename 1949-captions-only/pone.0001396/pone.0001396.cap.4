To allow quantitative detection, embryos hybridized with the same probe were stained equally long and staining was continuously monitored and stopped before reaching signal saturation. <em>HoxB1a</em> and <em>HoxB3a</em> respond to both gain and loss of function (arrows) of <em>miR-10</em> with a decrease and increase in expression levels respectively. <em>HoxB2a</em>, <em>HoxB4a</em> and <em>HoxB5a</em> are unresponsive to <em>miR-10</em> overexpression or knockdown. B) Double whole mount <em>in situ</em> hybridization on 24 hr embryos using probes for <em>hoxB1a</em> and <em>hoxB4a</em> showing the different responses of the genes. Embryos were stained equally long till adequate staining was obtained for the <em>hoxB4a</em> probe. C) <em>In situ</em> hybridization with <em>HoxA1a and HoxA3a</em> on 24 hpf embryos injected with MO1, MO2 or <em>miR-10</em> siRNA. <em>HoxA1a</em> responds to both overexpression and knockdown. The transcript level of <em>HoxA3a</em> does not respond to either overexpression or knockdown. D) <em>In situ</em> hybridization with <em>HoxB1b</em> on 24 hpf embryos morphant and overexpression embryos. There is strong upregulation of <em>HoxB1b</em> expression in the morphants but no downregulation is observed in the <em>miR-10</em> siRNA injected embryos.</p>
