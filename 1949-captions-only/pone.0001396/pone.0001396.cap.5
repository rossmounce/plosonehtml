                Figure 5.  Retinoid induction of miR-10c and upregulation of HoxB1a in miR-10 morphants.A) LNA in situ hybridization for miR-10c in wildtype (WT) and 10−6M retinoic acid (RA) treated embryos. RA treatement results in miR-10c upregulation. B) Presence of a DR[2] type retinoic acid response element (RARE) 1kb 3′ of the Zebrafish HoxB1a gene. This sequence is conserved in the mouse in which it has been shown to mediate the neural response of HoxB1 to RA [38] C) Different response of HoxB1a to RA stimulation in wildtype or miR-10 morphant embryos. HoxB1a is strongly upregulated in miR-10 morphants. Injection with the miR-10 siRNA has no effect. HoxB4a responds similar to all conditions.
