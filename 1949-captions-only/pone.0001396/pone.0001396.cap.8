Seed sequences are shown in green, open reading frames are indicated in light blue. Note conserved association of target sites with the <em>HoxB3(a)</em> ORF and conserved presence of a putative target site in <em>Teleost HoxB1a</em>. B) The <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 polycistronic transcript includes one exon between <em>HoxB4a</em> and <em>HoxB5a</em>, two exons between <em>HoxB4a</em> and <em>HoxB3a</em> and the main <em>HoxB3a</em> coding sequence. The primary transcript for this isoforms includes <em>miR-10c</em>. The 5′ UTR sequence is shown in orange, this sequence corresponds to the probe used in C and D to specifically detect this splice isoforms. C) Comparison of the <em>HoxB3a</em> exon1 expression (red) and the expression of <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 (purple). <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 is expressed posterior to the main rhombomere 5/6 expression domain of <em>HoxB3a</em> as reported previously <a href="#pone.0001396-Hadrys2">[46]</a>. The staining reaction for <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 was developed for much longer than the reaction for the <em>HoxB3a</em> exon1 probe and the <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 is presumably expressed at a much lower level. D) <em>In situ</em> hybridization with <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2. Expression is upregulated in <em>miR-10</em> morphant embryos (arrows). E) Semi quantitative RT-PCR for the <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2 5′ UTR, <em>ß-actin</em> is used as loading control. <em>HoxB3a</em> is upregulated in <em>miR-10</em> morphant embryos. <em>HoxB3a</em> splv2: 31 cycles, <em>ß-actin</em>: 22 cycles.</p>
