The target genes <em>HoxB1a</em> and <em>HoxB3a</em> are expressed in a strong domain (dark colour) anterior in the anterior hindbrain and in a weaker domain (light colour) in the area where they overlap with <em>miR-10</em>. <em>HoxB1a</em> shows a gap in expression in r5 and 6, possibly due to stronger transcriptional repression. B) Schematic representation of the post-transcriptional relations within the hox clusters. <em>MiR-196</em> is known to represses <em>HoxB8</em>, <em>HoxC8</em>, <em>HoxD8</em> and <em>HoxA7</em> and we have identified <em>HoxB1a</em> and <em>HoxB3a</em> as targets for <em>miR-10</em>. The emerging view is that the microRNAs in the hox clusters target more anterior genes in their close proximity. C) Polycistronic transcripts identified from the EST database show inclusion of <em>miR-196</em> paralogues and <em>HoxB8</em> and <em>HoxC8</em> target genes on the same primary transcripts.</p>
