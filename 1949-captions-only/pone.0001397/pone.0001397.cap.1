                Figure 1.  UCP-2 protein is upregulated by glucose and oleic acid in human islets.A Human islets were cultured at 5.5 or 11 mM glucose for 24 hr. B Human islets were cultured at 11 mM glucose plus 1% BSA containing medium (control) or supplemented with 0.45 mM oleic acid for 24 hr. Total protein extracts were analyzed on a Western blot using UCP-2 antibodies. Upper panel, The intensities of the protein signal were quantified by scanning of images; lower panel, the UCP-2 and β-actin in one representative experiment. All values are mean±SE of at least four independent experiments from separate human islet donors (t-test; *, p&lt;0.05 relative to control).
