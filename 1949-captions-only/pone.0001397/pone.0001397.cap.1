B Human islets were cultured at 11 mM glucose plus 1% BSA containing medium (control) or supplemented with 0.45 mM oleic acid for 24 hr. Total protein extracts were analyzed on a Western blot using UCP-2 antibodies. <em>Upper panel,</em> The intensities of the protein signal were quantified by scanning of images; <em>lower panel</em>, the UCP-2 and β-actin in one representative experiment. All values are mean±SE of at least four independent experiments from separate human islet donors (<em>t</em>-test; *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05 relative to control).</p>
