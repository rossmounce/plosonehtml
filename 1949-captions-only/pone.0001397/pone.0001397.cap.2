B DnUCP-2 increases mitochondrial membrane potential. Human islets grown on extracellular-matrix-coated slides were transduced with Ad-dnUCP-2 or Ad-GFP. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by live staining with JC-1, and the JC-1 and islet cell area were measured using Image-Pro Plus software. Bar graph shows the percentage of JC-1 (area) divided by total islet area (<em>t</em>-test; *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05 relative to control). C Human islets were transduced with Ad-dnUCP-2 (▪) or Ad-GFP (□, control) and cultured in suspension at 5.5 mM glucose before perifusion. Islets were perifused at 4 mM and 16 mM glucose and insulin concentrations were measured every 4 min. Results are of four independent experiments using four separate human islet donors. Data are presented as means±SE and analyzed by <em>t</em>-test, *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
