                Figure 2.  Dominant negative UCP-2 enhances insulin secretion in human islets.A Levels of UCP-2 protein in human islets following adenoviral misexpression of dn-UCP-2 (+) or GFP (−). B DnUCP-2 increases mitochondrial membrane potential. Human islets grown on extracellular-matrix-coated slides were transduced with Ad-dnUCP-2 or Ad-GFP. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by live staining with JC-1, and the JC-1 and islet cell area were measured using Image-Pro Plus software. Bar graph shows the percentage of JC-1 (area) divided by total islet area (t-test; *, p&lt;0.05 relative to control). C Human islets were transduced with Ad-dnUCP-2 (▪) or Ad-GFP (□, control) and cultured in suspension at 5.5 mM glucose before perifusion. Islets were perifused at 4 mM and 16 mM glucose and insulin concentrations were measured every 4 min. Results are of four independent experiments using four separate human islet donors. Data are presented as means±SE and analyzed by t-test, *, p&lt;0.001.
