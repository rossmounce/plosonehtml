B Human islets were cultured at 5.5 or 11 mM glucose, and total protein extracts were analyzed on a western blot using UCP-3 antibodies. The intensities of the protein signal were quantified by scanning of images; blots for UCP-3 and β-actin is shown for one representative experiment. Data are expressed as means±SE, n = 3, * <em>p</em>&lt;0.05. C UCP-3 is expressed in human pancreatic islets, where it colocalizes with mitochondria. A representative layer of human pancreata is depicted showing UCP-3, mitochondria and overlay. Images were acquired using confocal microscope and imaged at x63 magnification, bar = 20 µm.</p>
