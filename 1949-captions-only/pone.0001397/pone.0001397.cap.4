B Isolated human pancreatic islets were cultured on extracellular matrix-coated dishes and transduced with adenoviruses expressing control virus (luciferase, Luc), UCP-3 or dnUCP-2. Basal and stimulated insulin secretion indicate the amount secreted during 1-hour incubations at 2.8 (basal) and 16.7 mM (stimulated) glucose following the 2-day culture period after transduction, normalized to whole islet insulin content. C Stimulatory index denotes the amount of stimulated divided by the amount of basal insulin secretion. Data represent results of two different experiments from two different organ donors in quadruplicate. Results are meansÂ±SE, *p&lt;0.05 compared to control.</p>
