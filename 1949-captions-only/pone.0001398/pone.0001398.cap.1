                Figure 1.  Cell cycle regulation.(A) x-fold change, p-value and Z-score of cell cycle regulators expression measured by microarray analysis between pre- and post-senescence MSC and post-senescence MSC and TMC. (B) Relative mRNA expression of Cyclin D1 (CCND1), and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 (CDK2) and 6 (CDK6) in pre- and post-senescence MSC, TMC and met-TMC analyzed by qRT-PCR. (C) Western blot analysis of cell cycle regulator protein expression in pre- and post-senescence MSC and two TMC samples. Î±-tubulin was used as loading control.
