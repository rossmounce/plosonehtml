(B) Relative mRNA expression of ERCC3, DNA ligase IV (LIG IV), DNA polymerase β (POLβ) and μ (POLμ), RAD51, XPA and XRCC4 in pre- and post-senescence MSC, TMC and met-TMC analyzed by qRT-PCR. (C) Western blot analysis of DNA repair-related protein expression in pre- and post-senescence MSC and two TMC samples. α-tubulin was used as loading control.</p>
