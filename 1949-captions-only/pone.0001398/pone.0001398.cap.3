(B) Relative mRNA expression of p16 analyzed by qRT-PCR in different samples of pre-senescence MSC (n = 4), post-senescence MSC (n = 3) and TMC (n = 3). (C) Homozygous deletion analysis of p14, p15 (D) and p16 (E) genes. β-actin was used as internal PCR control. Control cell lines were normal lymphocytes (NL), HCT116 and MDA-MB231. (F) Western blot analysis of p21 expression in pre- and post-senescence MSC, TMC and met-TMC. α-tubulin was used as loading control. (G) Analysis of p53 activation following UV irradiation of cells. p53 levels and phosphorylation were tested in pre- and post-senescence MSC, in two TMC samples and a sample of met-TMC. α-tubulin was used as loading control. (H) Rb protein levels and phosphorylation tested in pre- and post-senescence MSC, two samples of TMC and a met-TMC sample. α-tubulin was used as loading control.</p>
