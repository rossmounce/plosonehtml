The white broken-line contour lines show the regions of power significant at the 5% level computed based on 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The cone of influence (black curve) indicated the region without edge effects. The power values were coded from dark blue for low power to dark red for high power, as shown in the right panel.</p>
