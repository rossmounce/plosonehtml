                Figure 2.  Association between ILI consultation rates (per 1,000 consultations) and influenza virus isolation.(A) The normalized ILI consultation rates in GOPC (green) and in GP (red), and influenza virus isolation (black); (B) Wavelet coherence between ILI in GOPC and influenza virus isolation. The power values were colored as Figure 1(B). The white broken-line contour lines show the regions of power significant at the 5% level computed based on 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The cone of influence (black curve) indicated the region without edge effects. (C) Wavelet coherence between ILI in GP and influenza virus isolation (colors as in (B)). (D) Phases of time series (solid lines, colors as in (A)) at the annual cycle (48â€“56 week band) and phase difference between ILI in GOPC and influenza virus isolation (green dashed line), between ILI in GP and influenza virus isolation (red dashed line).
