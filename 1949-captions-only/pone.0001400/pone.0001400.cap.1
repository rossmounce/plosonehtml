Branch length is proportional to distances between peptide sequences. The bootstrap values are indicated near major nodes, calculated from 1000 replicates of the peptide and nucleotide sequence alignments, respectively. Bold characters: <em>I. ricinus</em> entries; *: <em>I. pacificus</em> sequence; all others are from <em>I. scapularis</em>. Prototypical ISAC is boxed. Sequences are identified by their accession number in databases or by descriptive names when available. Ad., isolated from adults; Ny., isolated from nymphs; NS, not specified.</p>
