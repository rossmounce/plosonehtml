                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic analysis of Ixodes anticomplement proteins.A distance dendrogram was constructed from an alignment of 41 tick mature anticomplement proteins using programs in the Phylip 3.65 package (see text). Branch length is proportional to distances between peptide sequences. The bootstrap values are indicated near major nodes, calculated from 1000 replicates of the peptide and nucleotide sequence alignments, respectively. Bold characters: I. ricinus entries; *: I. pacificus sequence; all others are from I. scapularis. Prototypical ISAC is boxed. Sequences are identified by their accession number in databases or by descriptive names when available. Ad., isolated from adults; Ny., isolated from nymphs; NS, not specified.
