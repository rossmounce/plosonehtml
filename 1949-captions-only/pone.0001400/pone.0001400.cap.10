The resulting cDNAs were submitted to PCR analysis using pairs of primers specific for the indicated IxACs. Non- reverse transcribed polyA+ RNA from the pool was included as negative control (Ctrl). PCR products were run on 1.2 % agarose gels. M, DNA size markers. B1 to B5, IxAC-B1 to IxAC-B5. Sizes in bp are indicated. Panel A: Analysis of salivary glands of a tick population (70 specimens, pool) and from individual female ticks at day 5 of the bloodmeal (A to J). Panel B: Analysis of pooled salivary glands of tick female populations at day 0 (25 specimens), day 3 (25 specimens) and day 5 (70 specimens) of the bloodmeal as well as from pooled gorged nymphs (25 specimens) and larvae (25 specimens).</p>
