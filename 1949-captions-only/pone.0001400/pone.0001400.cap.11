Panel A. Western blot analysis. The serum from a mouse immunized against IxAC-B1 by genetic immunization followed by a protein boost recognised solely recombinant IxAC B1. M, molecular weight markers (Mark12, Invitrogen). Panel B. Seroneutralization experiments. AP hemolysis assays were conducted with and without the seven recombinant IxACs. 100% hemolysis was obtained in the absence of anticomplement protein (light dotted histogram). Recombinant IxACs alone (dark dotted histogram) or recombinant IxACs plus heat-inactivated sera from mice immunized against IxAC-B1 (anti IxAC-B1, black histogram) or mock immunized mice (anti-PBS, white histogram) were added as indicated. Neutralization of activity as indicated by a recovery of hemolysis, was observed only on IxAC-B1. Upper panels: seroneutralization of IxAC-A subfamily. Lower panel: seroneutralization of IxAC-B subfamily. Error bars represent standard deviations.</p>
