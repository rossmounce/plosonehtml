Individual residues printed in white on a black background are conserved in all 9 aligned sequences; white residues on a grey background are conserved in 7 or 8 of 9 entries; black residues on a grey background are conserved in 5 or 6 entries; black residues on a white background are conserved in less than 5 entries. -, gap; ! !, region of predicted signal peptide cleavage; C1 to C4, conserved cysteine residues.</p>
