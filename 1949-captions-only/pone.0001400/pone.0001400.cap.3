                Figure 3.  Western blot analysis of recombinant IxAC-V5His proteins from I. ricinus.Standardised amounts of recombinant IxAC-V5His proteins from supernatants of transfected 293T cells were analysed by SDS/PAGE and detected by western blotting using an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. A) Parallel analysis of IxACs, B) N-deglycosylation of IxAC-B1-V5His.1, untreated, 2, incubated with PNGase (New England Biolabs).
