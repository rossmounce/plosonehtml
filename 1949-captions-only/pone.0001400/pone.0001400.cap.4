                Figure 4.  Comparison of Ixodes anticomplement protein tertiary structure.Aligned IxAC amino-acid sequences from I. ricinus were submitted to hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA). Groups of adjacent hydrophobic residues are outlined and shaded. Proline (asterisk), glycine (open rectangle), serine (dotted square) and threonine (open square) are highlighted. The overall distribution of hydrophobic clusters and their size, shape and orientation are very similar.
