Values for the percent inhibition of rabbit red blood cell lysis in the presence of human serum are indicated. The values are means Â± standard deviation of triplicates. RaHBP2 was used as negative control. Black diamond :IRAC I; black square:IRAC II; black triangle:IxAC-B1; cross:IxAC-B2; star:IxAC-B3; closed circle:IxAC-B4; Plus:IxAC-B5; open circle:RaHBP2.</p>
