                Figure 5.  Effect of recombinant I. ricinus IxAC proteins on the alternative and classical pathways of complement activation.Assays of the alternative (AP, solid lines) and classical (CP, dashed lines) complement activation pathway were conducted in the presence of normalized amounts of recombinant I. ricinus IxACs produced in the supernatant of transfected 293T cells. Values for the percent inhibition of rabbit red blood cell lysis in the presence of human serum are indicated. The values are means Â± standard deviation of triplicates. RaHBP2 was used as negative control. Black diamond :IRAC I; black square:IRAC II; black triangle:IxAC-B1; cross:IxAC-B2; star:IxAC-B3; closed circle:IxAC-B4; Plus:IxAC-B5; open circle:RaHBP2.
