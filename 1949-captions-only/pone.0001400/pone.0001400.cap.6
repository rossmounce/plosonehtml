Panel A: Blots from gels run under denaturing conditions were probed with monospecific anti-C3a serum. The Î±-chain of precursor C3 (116 kDa) and the C3a peptide (~10 kDa) are indicated by arrows. Panel B: Blots from gels run under non-denaturing conditions were probed with a antiserum to factor B. Purified factor B was used as a positive control.</p>
