                Figure 6.  Inhibition of C3a formation and factor B cleavage.Aliquots of supernatant from AP hemolysis assays conducted in the presence of standardized amounts of IxACs from I. ricinus and unrelated control RaHBP2 were analyzed by western blotting. Panel A: Blots from gels run under denaturing conditions were probed with monospecific anti-C3a serum. The Î±-chain of precursor C3 (116 kDa) and the C3a peptide (~10 kDa) are indicated by arrows. Panel B: Blots from gels run under non-denaturing conditions were probed with a antiserum to factor B. Purified factor B was used as a positive control.
