                Figure 7.  ELISA analysis of the binding of IxAC proteins to immobilized C3 convertase components.Panel A: Binding of IxACs to AP components. Purified recombinant IRAC II, IxAC-B1 or unrelated protein Iris were added to microtiter wells previously coated with purified factors C3, C3b, fB, fD or properdin (P). Bound proteins were detected with an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody using an ELISA format. Light dotted histogram: IRAC II; dark dotted histogram: IxAC-B1; black histogram: Iris. Panel B: Increasing amounts of normalized supernatant from transfected culture 293T cells were added to immobilized properdin. Bound IxACs were detected with an anti-V5 antibody. Black diamond: Iris; black square: IRAC I; black triangle: IRAC II; cross: IxAC-B1; star: IxAC-B2; closed circle: IxAC-B3; plus: IxAC-B4; minus : IxAC-B5. Panel C. Competition between properdin and IxACs for C3b binding. Purified properdin and increasing amounts of IRAC II, IxAC-B1 or unrelated control IRIS were added simultaneously to C3b-precoated microtiter wells. Bound properdin was detected with an anti-properdin monoclonal antibody. Black diamond: IRAC II; black square: IxAC-B1; black triangle: Iris.
