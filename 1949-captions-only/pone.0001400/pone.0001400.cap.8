                Figure 8.  Effect of IxAC proteins on the formation and stability of C3 convertase.Panel A and B: The effect of IxAC proteins on the formation of C3 convertase was evaluated by incubating simultaneously purified factors B, D and properdin with increasing amounts of IRAC II or IxAC-B1 on C3b-coated wells. Panel C and D: The effect of IxAC proteins on the stability of C3 convertase was assessed by incubating preformed C3 convertase (fB, fD and properdin pre-incubated for 1 hour) on C3b-coated plates with increasing amounts of recombinant IxACs. Bound factor B or properdin was detected with an anti-factor B antibody (A–C) or anti-properdin antibody (B–D), respectively. Recombinant IRIS was used as negative control. Black diamond: IRAC II; black square: IxAC-B1; black triangle: IRIS.
