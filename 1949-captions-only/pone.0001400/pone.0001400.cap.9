                Figure 9.  Effect of IxAC proteins on the deposition of C3b and factor B on agarose-coated plates.Loading human serum on agarose-coated microplate wells activates the alternative complement pathway. Purified recombinant IRAC II (A–B) or IxAC-B1 (C–D) were added after 30, 45 or 60 minutes. The reactions were stopped at various times. C3b and factor B deposition was detected using anti-C3 antibody (A–C) or anti-factor B antibody (B–D), respectively. Black diamond: no added protein; black square: 30 min.; black triangle: 45 min.; cross: 60 min.
