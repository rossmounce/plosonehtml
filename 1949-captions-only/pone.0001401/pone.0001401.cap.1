Post-vaccination serological assessments showed that the adjuvanted A/Vietnam vaccine formulations induced neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous A/Vietnam strain with 74% of responders (ferrets with neutralizing antibody titres &gt; 28) compared to 100% non responders in control groups (<a href="#pone-0001401-t002">Table 2</a>). Furthermore, the adjuvanted A/Vietnam vaccine induced inter-clade cross-neutralizing antibody responses to the heterologous A/Indonesia clade 2 strain (<a href="#pone-0001401-t002">Table 2</a>) with 61% responders, while no neutralizing antibody response (&lt;28) was observed in ferrets immunized with the non-adjuvanted A/Vietnam vaccine or the Adjuvant System alone. No antigen-dose dependent effect on neutralizing antibody titres was observed amongst ferrets immunized with adjuvanted A/Vietnam vaccines. Interestingly, all animals without a detectable neutralizing antibody response to A/Vietnam or to A/Indonesia exhibited lung virus load &gt; 8×10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g tissue, whereas 94% (16/17) of ferrets with anti-A/Vietnam neutralizing antibody response and 93% (13/14) with anti-A/Indonesia responses showed virus loads in their lungs below 10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g tissue. Of 22 animals surviving until the termination of the experiment at day five post-challenge, 17 (77%) were positive for the induction of an H5N1 neutralizing antibody response. Four of the five non-responder animals that were protected from mortality exhibited reduced virus loads in the lung relative to unvaccinated control animals (ranging from 9×10<sup>3</sup> to 5×10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g tissue), suggesting a possible role for vaccine induced cellular immune responses in the control of virus replication.</p>
