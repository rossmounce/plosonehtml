                Figure 2.  Principles of the IRAP, REMAP and ISSR procedures.IRAP: LTR primers (white arrows) facing outward from the ends of LTRs will amplify intervening DNA from retrotransposons or loose LTRs in opposite orientations. Retrotransposons or loose LTRs in the same orientation will not result in amplification products. REMAP: LTR primers are used together with SSR primers (black arrows), the products of amplification will be the combination of all retrotransposons or loose LTRs and SSRs in opposite orientations, sites with the same orientation will not result in amplification products. ISSR: SSR primers (black arrows) will amplify intervening DNA from SSRs in opposite orientations; sites with the same orientation will not result in amplification products.
