                Figure 5.  Sequence alignment of the clone Mob-11-1200 from T. aestivum with several copia retrotransposons.(a) Only partial sequences, corresponding to the conserved parts of Pol region are shown. The polypurine tract (PPT) are boxed and arrow indicate the inverted repeat (IR) signature just before the beginning of the 3â€² LTR. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of nucleotides separating the sequences. (b) Based on previous nucleotide alignment, a tree was constructed utilizing the Neighour-Joining method [24]. The numbers on the branches represent bootstrap support for 1,000 replicates. Numbers in bold represent cophenetic correlations, which confirm the stability of the tree nodes. Sequences were aligned using Bionumerics software (version 3.5). Accession numbers: Barbara retrotransposon (T. monococcum, AF326781); Claudia retrotransposon (gi:18496650); Ty1-copia retrotransposon (O. sativa gi: 57114405); T. monococcum 7Am (AF488415).
