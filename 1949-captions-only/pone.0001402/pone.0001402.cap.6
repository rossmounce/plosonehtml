                Figure 6.  Alignments of conceptual translation of clone Mob-111-1000R.(a) The alignment shows homology with sequences coding for a hydroxiproline-rich glycoprotein. (b) Based on the alignment of amino acid residues, the tree was constructed utilizing the Neighour-Joining method [24]. The numbers on the branches represent bootstrap support for 1,000 replicates. Sequences were aligned using Bionumerics software (version 3.5). Accession numbers: A. thaliana (gi: 18394153); O. sativa (gi:20270098); O. sativa (gi: 110288545).
