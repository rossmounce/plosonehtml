                Figure 1.  Transcriptional differences between M. tuberculosis-infected Mφs and DCs.(A) Hierarchical clustering of arrays indicating the donor # (1–9), the time of infection (0, 4, 18, 48 h) and the cell type (Mφs vs DCs). (B) Venn diagrams illustrating the number of up- and down-regulated genes in Mφs (upper panels) and DCs (lower panels) after 4, 18, or 48 h infection, as compared to basal expression levels at the time of infection. (C) Venn diagram showing the number of genes differently modulated in the direct comparison of Mφs and DCs after 4, 18, and 48 h infection.
