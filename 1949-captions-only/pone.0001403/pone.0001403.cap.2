                Figure 2.  Clustering of functional categories altered in Mφs and DCs upon M. tuberculosis infection.The 50 top ranking GO (A) and KEGG (B) functional categories according to enrichment p-values of differentially expressed genes in Mφs and DCs at 4, 18 and 48 h post-infection as compared to baseline levels at the time of infection, and in DCs as compared to Mφs at 4, 18 and 48 h post-infection. The order of gene families was determined by hierarchical clustering. Annotation is given according to GO and KEGG nomenclatures. See the online GO and KEGG databases for further details.
