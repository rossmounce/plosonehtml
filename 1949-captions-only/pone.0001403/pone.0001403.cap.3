                Figure 3.  Differential regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress, vacuole acidification and intracellular trafficking in M. tuberculosis-infected MÏ†s and DCs.Red-blue display showing hierarchical clustering according to normalized expression levels of genes involved in (A) phagocyte oxidase assembly and resistance to oxidative stress, (B) v-ATPase production and phagosome acidification, (C) intracellular trafficking machinery and (D) IFN response and TLR-related pathways. Log2 ratios of absolute expression values divided by the median of each gene across all donors and conditions are reported according to the colour codes indicated.
