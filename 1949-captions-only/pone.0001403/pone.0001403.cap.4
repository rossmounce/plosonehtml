                Figure 4.  Validation of candidate genes and phenotypic characterization of M. tuberculosis-infected Mφs and DCs.(A) Western blotting validation of selected candidate genes Rac1 and Rab9A. Each line contains 5 µg of total proteins. (B) Differential superoxide production expressed in relative light units (RLUs) by Mφs and DCs either treated with PMA (left panel), or infected with M. tuberculosis (right panel). (C) Differential multiplication of M. tuberculosis within human monocyte-derived Mφs and DCs.
