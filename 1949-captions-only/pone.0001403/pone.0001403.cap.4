Each line contains 5 µg of total proteins. (B) Differential superoxide production expressed in relative light units (RLUs) by Mφs and DCs either treated with PMA (left panel), or infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (right panel). (C) Differential multiplication of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> within human monocyte-derived Mφs and DCs.</p>
