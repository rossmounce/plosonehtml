                Figure 5.  Differential mycobacterial response to Mφ and DC infection.(A) Hierarchical clustering of arrays indicating the donor # (10–12), the time of infection (1, 18 h) and the cell type (Mφs vs DCs). Aerobic indicates log-phase cultivated bacteria in axenic conditions. (B) Venn diagrams illustrating the number of up- and down-regulated mycobacterial genes in Mφs (upper panels) and DCs (lower panels) after 1, 4 and 18 h infection relative to aerobically cultivated bacilli.
