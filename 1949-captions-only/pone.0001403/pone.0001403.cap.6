                Figure 6.  Functional and hierarchical clustering of the M. tuberculosis response to DCs and Mφs infection.(A) Red-green display showing 1,875 M. tuberculosis genes identified to be significantly differentially expressed at 1, 4 or 18 h in Mφs and DCs relative to aerobic in vitro growth. Genes are ordered in rows, conditions as columns. Red colouring indicates genes induced in intracellular vs. aerobic growth conditions (fold change); green colouring denotes repression. (B) Genes are highlighted that were significantly differentially regulated over time (18 h vs. 1 h) in the M. tuberculosis response to DCs (a) or Mφs (b), red colouring identifies genes induced with time, green repressed; together with (c) those genes identified to be over-expressed (red) or under-expressed (green) after infection of DCs compared to Mφs (DC18h vs. Mφ18h). (C) Genes previously identified in other intracellular studies as being modulated in specific conditions are marked, namely genes induced (red colouring) or repressed (green) inside murine Mφs (d) [12], and up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (green) in a hollow fibre murine model (e) [47].
