Genes are ordered in rows, conditions as columns. Red colouring indicates genes induced in intracellular <em>vs.</em> aerobic growth conditions (fold change); green colouring denotes repression. (B) Genes are highlighted that were significantly differentially regulated over time (18 h <em>vs</em>. 1 h) in the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> response to DCs (a) or Mφs (b), red colouring identifies genes induced with time, green repressed; together with (c) those genes identified to be over-expressed (red) or under-expressed (green) after infection of DCs compared to Mφs (DC18h <em>vs</em>. Mφ18h). (C) Genes previously identified in other intracellular studies as being modulated in specific conditions are marked, namely genes induced (red colouring) or repressed (green) inside murine Mφs (d) <a href="#pone.0001403-Schnappinger2">[12]</a>, and up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (green) in a hollow fibre murine model (e) <a href="#pone.0001403-Karakousis1">[47]</a>.</p>
