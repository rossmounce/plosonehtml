                Figure 7.  Cell-specific responses of M. tuberculosis to Mφs and DCs.(A) The transcriptional profiles of 191 genes (red colouring) and 153 genes (green) identified to be significantly over-expressed in DCs and Mφs respectively at 18 h post infection. Box plots showing the gene expression pattern (in fold change) of (B) kstR regulon [46], (C) dosR regulon [45], and (D) ribosomal gene family (functional category II.A.1 [63]), in DCs and Mφs at 1, 4 and 18 h timepoints relative to aerobic growth.
