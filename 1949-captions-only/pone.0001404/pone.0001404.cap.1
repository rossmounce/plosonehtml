A, D and G, normal (+/+) larvae, B, C, E, F, H and I, <em>smn</em> mutant larvae (<em>smn</em>/<em>smn</em>). A, B, D, E, G and H stained for Glutamate receptor subunit; C, F and I stained for a pre-synaptic marker (syntaxin). Comparing the accumulation of receptor clusters in the normal tissue across time to the mutant tissues, it is clear that the mutant displays a reduced number of glutamate receptor clusters across time.</p>
