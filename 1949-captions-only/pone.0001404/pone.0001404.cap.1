                Figure 1.  Confocal Scanning Fluorescent images of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions.A to C, early second instar larvae; D to F, late second instar larvae and G to I, third instar larvae (mid stage). A, D and G, normal (+/+) larvae, B, C, E, F, H and I, smn mutant larvae (smn/smn). A, B, D, E, G and H stained for Glutamate receptor subunit; C, F and I stained for a pre-synaptic marker (syntaxin). Comparing the accumulation of receptor clusters in the normal tissue across time to the mutant tissues, it is clear that the mutant displays a reduced number of glutamate receptor clusters across time.
