                Figure 2.  Smn gene expression analysis using two different methods.A) Results of micro-array hybridisations. “Sample” column lists the different RNA samples used for cRNA preparation. The control and smn mutant relative concentrations are shown. Expression is low in the RNA samples derived from whole animals but is significantly higher in neuromuscular tissues, especially in brain. The expression is reduced by 1.9 and 1.5 fold in the mutant animals in muscle and brain respectively. Note that these tissues are mutant for the somatic gene (a point mutation so transcripts will be produced) while still containing detectable maternal RNA (data not shown). B) Real Time-PCR analysis of smn expression across different tissues. The Bar figure shows the relative abundance of smn transcript in tissues versus either whole animals (thus containing the isolated tissues; all third instar larval stage derived) or versus isolated gut tissue (all adult derived), all from smn +/+. In both Central Nervous System (CNS) and muscle the expression of smn is higher. C) The significance of this finding increases in adults
