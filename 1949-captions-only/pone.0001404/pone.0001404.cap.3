The eight genes were CG6776, CG8836, Cyp4ac3, mthl3, Gip, CG4778, CG4511 and Tsp42Ed. The changes measured this way showed that mRNA synthesis in whole 3rd instar SMN mutant larvae compared to WT larvae for CG6776 was decreased 3.57 fold (P&lt;0.01), CG8836 was increased 14.6 fold (P&lt;0.05), Cyp4ac3 was increased 2.7 fold (P&lt;0.05), mthl3 was increased 8.9 fold (P&lt;0.05). mRNA synthesis in SMN mutant larval muscle for Gip was decreased 2.7 fold (P&lt;0.01), CG4778 was decreased 2.7 fold (&lt;P0.01), CG4511 was decreased 1.6 fold (P&lt;0.05), Tsp42Ed was increased 21.6 fold (P&lt;0.05) . The RT-PCR analysis validates the micro-array data: the overall directions of change are all identical and the fold changes are within the same range</p>
