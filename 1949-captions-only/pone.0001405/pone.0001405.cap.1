                Figure 1.  Gene structure, location and characteristics of the genotyped SNPs, linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs and the haplotype structure.A: The upper panel shows the 90-kb region of chromosome 11p15.5 containing the TUB gene and the 3â€² flanking RIC3 gene. Coding sequences (black), UTRs (white) and introns are indicated. B: Location (according to the NCBI 35 release), the alleles and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the SNPs. C: The pairwise LD plot, calculated as r2, among SNPs, with red colour indicating increasing level of LD as measured by D'. D: The three genotyped SNPs resulted in five common haplotypes.
