Coding sequences (black), UTRs (white) and introns are indicated. B: Location (according to the NCBI 35 release), the alleles and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the SNPs. C: The pairwise LD plot, calculated as r<sup>2</sup>, among SNPs, with red colour indicating increasing level of LD as measured by D'. D: The three genotyped SNPs resulted in five common haplotypes.</p>
