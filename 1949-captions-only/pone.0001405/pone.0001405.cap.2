The activation of NPY/AGRP neurons promotes food intake, whereas POMC/CART neurons have the opposite effect. Both signals project onto LHA neurons that express MCH and orexin (important stimulators of food intake), which are also mediated by dopamine, serotonin and endocannabinoids. The loss of the <em>TUB</em> function in tubby mice causes alteration in the expression of different neuropeptides, such as AGRP, NPY and POMC in ARC, as well as upregulation of NPY by ~30-fold in DMH/VMH and orexin by ~60-fold in LHA (highlighted in red). The image of tubby mice was provided by J.Naggert and P. Nishina (Nat. Genet. 39,149; 2007). Abbreviations: AGRP, agouti-related protein; ARC, arcuate nucleus; CART, cocaine–amphetamine-regulated transcript; DMH and VMH, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus; LHA, lateral hypothalamus; MCH, melanin-concentrating hormone; NPY neuropeptide Y; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin.</p>
