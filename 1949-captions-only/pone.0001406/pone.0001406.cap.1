                Figure 1.  A cluster of five water molecules as they would appear in ice1h or transiently in LDW.Each oxygen is linked to two hydrogen atoms to which it is covalently bonded and to two more, on other water molecules, to which the central oxygen is hydrogen-bonded. In LDW each H atom lies on a straight line between two O atoms.
