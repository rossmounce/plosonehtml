<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4"></a><p>Oscillations in cellulose acetate membranes were recognized by the OH stretch band at 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup>: it appears that the water spent some time as LDW (3200cm<sup>−1</sup>) and some time as HDW (probably 3600 cm<sup>−1</sup>) which averaged out at 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup>. It is no coincidence that this is the same as the OH stretch band of pure water, if pure water consists of a mixture of LDW (3200 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and HDW (3600 cm<sup>−1</sup>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p5"></a><p>That we were dealing with osmotic pressure gradients was confirmed by experiments which showed that internal KCl concentration could be increased by coequilibration with an excluded solute, such as MgCl<sub>2</sub>, betaine or butanol. It appeared that destruction of LDW by KCl could be prevented if it was balanced by an excluded solute, making the activity of water the same in the two compartments</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p6"></a><p>These results, together with many other results in different systems, illustrated some important principles: If water can move to eliminate an osmotic pressure gradient, it will move. That is always the first choice. Thus in the presence of an extremely low concentration of KCl or CsCl, accumulation of the ions into the internal LDW was accompanied by water, abolishing the osmotic pressure gradient, and allowing retention of the LDW . This requires, of course, that the water that entered the pores to eliminate the osmotic pressure gradient, was, or became LDW.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p7"></a><p>This is a second important principle which has many examples. A polymeric surface such as cellulose acetate is not smooth: there are projecting hydrophobic elements which, when they can, fold down on to the surface, reducing the area of contact between hydrophobic surface and water and avoiding a costly displacement of the HDW/LDW equilibrium. When, however, more water enters to abolish an osmotic pressure gradient, some elements detach from the surface, and the incoming water becomes LDW. This is possible only if the pore can expand to accommodate the extra water. Therefore pores expanded slightly at low concentrations of KCl, but were unable, because of their cross-linked structure, to expand enough to accommodate the amount of water needed to abolish a large osmotic pressure gradient. So 10 mM KCl continued to accumulate in the pores after the capacity of the pores to expand had been reached. The only choice left was for the water inside the pores to switch to HDW. That immediately stopped accumulation of KCl and initiated a total efflux. When the efflux of KCl was complete, water in the pores reverted to its LDW state. This had two experimental results: the concentration of internal KCl was not very different from its concentration ion the external solution, and the OH stretch band peaked at 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup> because it oscillated between 3200 cm<sup>−1</sup> while the water was LDW and 3600cm<sup>−1</sup> while the water was HDW.</p>


<h4>Synthesis of ATP from ADP and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> in cellulose acetate films</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>In the presence of 100 mM NaCl or of 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> no ATP was detected. In the presence of 100 mM KCl or of no additions other than the 5 mM potassium phosphate as reactant, ADP was converted quantitatively to ATP. The sum of ADP plus ATP remained constant while ATP increased and ADP decreased over an interval of several days.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>The conclusion was that the synthesis is a spontaneous reaction in LDW, but that the release of chaotropic ATP from the membranes required conversion of LDW to HDW. This was achieved by potassium phosphate or by added KCl, but was opposed by addition of 100 mM NaCl or 100 mM MgCl2, either of which stabilised LDW and prevented release of ATP. This requirement is consistent with the earlier findings that cellulose acetate pores have little flexibility and do not allow influx of much water.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>The relationship between work performance and energy consumption is best understood by reducing this simple unitary process of:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001406.e005&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>to a series of sequential partial reactions:</p>

</ol><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>Of these partial reactions, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are spontaneous. Their free energy changes were lost as heat. Only 7 has a positive free energy change. The criterion for such a composite but unitary reaction to proceed is simply that there is overall a decrease in free energy in going from reactants to products. Since the process occurred, it is safe to assume that the summation of all 8 free energy changes was negative. There was no need to donate energy to the partial reaction which had a positive free energy change. Heat was absorbed by this reaction, but over all 8 partial reactions, heat is evolved. Obviously for this to be a valid assumption, each partial reaction must contribute to the overall change in free energy.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p5"></a><p>The significance of analyzing it into partial reactions is that it demonstrates that the free energy changes that allow the overall reaction to happen are delivered in very small quanta, which means that the system is never far from equilibrium and the efficiency of utilisation of free energy is extremely high. If free energy had been released in a single large burst, efficiency would be low and the overall reaction might not proceed. This is one of the wonders of active processes in biochemistry (see the Na,K-ATPase).</p>


<h4>Cellulose acetate as a reverse osmosis membrane</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Reverse osmosis is an excellent method of production of water free of ions and most other solutes. Cellulose acetate membranes are still widely and successfully used. A plausible explanation for the mechanism of their action must take into account the properties of the water inside the pores. This water appears to be strongly enriched in LDW. Although it relatively excluded some ions, that exclusion was never absolute. Even MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the most strongly excluded salt, did reach a measurable concentration inside, and KCl had the same concentration inside and out.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>There appears to be no acceptable mechanism of action of these very simple membranes. Under reverse osmosis, pressure is applied to the solution side of the membrane. The response is movement of water free of solutes to the other side. The pressure acts upon water on the solution side of the membrane, on areas of membrane between pores and on water inside pores.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3"></a><p>According to the estimates of Robinson and coworkers <a href="#pone.0001406-Vedamuthu1">[4]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001406-Robinson1">[6]</a> most water at ambient pressure and temperature is HDW. Therefore, while applied pressure will convert some LDW into HDW in the solution, this will be a slight effect as it will operate only on the relatively sparse microdomains of LDW. Water in the pores, however, is, apparently pure, or, at least; greatly enriched LDW. The effect of applied pressure is therefore to convert all LDW in the pore into HDW.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4"></a><p>Here, then, isolated inside the pores, is a near-pure sample of HDW. Since it is not in equilibrium with LDW, as it is in bulk water, there is no thermodynamic constraint preventing it from boiling at its intrinsic boiling point, which <a href="#pone-0001406-t001">Table 1</a> suggests is well below ambient temperatures. Therefore it instantly vaporises, dropping all its solutes at the mouth of the pore. It is rapidly pushed, in the vapour state, through the membrane pore, emerging at the other end as pure vapour which, out of range of the applied pressure, immediately condenses into the mixture of LDW and HDW determined by the ambient pressure and temperature.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5"></a><p>This mechanism gains support from work on carbon nanopores, through which water moves with incredible speed <a href="#pone.0001406-Holt1">[27]</a>. These pores are less than 2 nm in diameter and bounded by hydrophobic surfaces. They, like cellulose acetate pores, will contain highly enriched LDW. Again the action of pressure is to convert LDW in the pores into HDW which immediately vaporises and moves extremely rapidly through the pores, condensing on the other side. A membrane containing such pores should make an excellent reverse osmosis membrane.</p>


<h4>Polyamide beads <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins7">[28]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins9">[30]</a></h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>The density of water in pores of polyamide beads was measured in density bottles, using hexane as a standard. As the size of the pores increased from P-2 to P-6 density of internal water increased <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins7">[28]</a>. This was, perhaps the greatest legacy of the beads. Using independent data from the manufacturers, it was possible to estimate the thickness of the zones of HDW and LDW. It was estimated (from the manufacturer's exclusion limits) that the pore diameter of P-2 was approximately 2 nm and of P-6, 2–3 nm. At this surface, at least, the zones appeared not to exceed 1–3 nm, because pores with higher exclusion showed little evidence for the existence of LDW. Most experiments used P-4 beads. As a highly concentrated slurry in electrolyte solutions, beads clearly demonstrated the oscillations that had been inferred in cellulose acetate membranes. The mechanism of the oscillations, however, was different. The internal volume of the beads was estimated by including in the external solution polyethylene glycol (MW 3000) labeled with <sup>14</sup>C. Changes in internal volume of the beads were calculated from the changes in concentration of this molecule as water moved into and out of the pores of the beads with time <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins8">[29]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins9">[30]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>When the external solution contained only 10 mM KNO<sub>3</sub> beads swelled slightly but measurably for 17 days. This suggested that the matrix of the beads was more flexible than that of the cellulose acetate films, so that water could continue to abolish an osmotic pressure gradient without reaching a barrier of inflexibility. When the external solution contained only water, NaCl or MgCl<sub>2</sub> there was no significant change in internal volume over many days. When, however, the external solution contained both chaotrope and kosmotropes the internal volume oscillated over days. The simplest example was potassium phosphate (pH 7) which consists of the powerful chaotrope KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and the potent kosmotrope K<sub>2</sub>HPO4. Beads swelled and shrank without stopping. This time the mechanism must have been that, initially KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> diffused into the LDW in the pores, water followed and the internal volume increased. This continued until the loss of water and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> from the external solution increased the concentration of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> until the osmotic pressure gradient was abolished. Water then stopped moving, but KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> continued to accumulate, LDW converted to HDW, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and water diffused out. When the pores contained no solutes, LDW reformed and the next cycle began. These movements were controlled by the rate at which the polyamide matrix could adjust itself to influx and efflux of water. The frequency was of the order of two days. <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins8">[29]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001406-Wiggins10">[31]</a> Other solutions which supported oscillations were phosphate-buffered saline, culture medium, Ringers solution: all contained high NaCl concentrations and lower concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>Polyamide beads both in a column and as a slurry were also used to separate optical isomers of glucose and amino acids. These were very difficult experiments to understand and control. Retention of D-glucose, for example, on a P-4 column, required an external solute excluded from LDW to prevent accumulation of D-glucose from demolishing LDW. The optimal concentration of that solute had to be found by trial and error and was not always the same for different batches of beads. Butanol was found to be a suitable compensating solute. A column was first washed several times with a butanol solution; equal concentrations of D- and L- glucose in the same concentration of butanol, were put on the column and eluted with water. Duplicate experiments with 20 mM L-glucose and 20 mM D-glucose were run: in one D_glucose was labeled with <sup>14</sup>C, and in the other L-glucose was labeled. Relative retention of D-glucose is shown in <a href="#pone-0001406-g003">Figure 3</a>, in which the concentration of each glucose was 20 mM and the concentration of butanol 100 mM.</p>
