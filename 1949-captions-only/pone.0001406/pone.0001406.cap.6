                Figure 6.  Glass beads (44–60 µm in diameter), made hydrophobic with dimethyldichloro silane.a, 2 g beads in 10 ml water; b, 4 g beads in 10 ml water with countercation K+. Cs+, Ca 2+ or Mg2+. c, 2 g beads in 10 ml water with countercation Li+, Na+ or H+; d, the same as c photographed immediately after setting up; the haziness in the water shows the dropping of beads through the water.
