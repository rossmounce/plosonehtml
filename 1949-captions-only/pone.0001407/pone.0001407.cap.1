B, Auditory fear conditioning in neurabin KO mice is similar to that in wild-type. C, There was no significant difference in response latencies between wild-type and neurabin KO mice in hotplate test. D, Spinal nociceptive tail-flick reflex between wild-type and neurabin KO mice is indistinguishable.</p>
