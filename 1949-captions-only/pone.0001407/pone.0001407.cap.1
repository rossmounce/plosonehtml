                Figure 1.  Impaired contextual but not auditory fear memory in neurabin KO mice.A, Contextual fear conditioning in neurabin KO mice (n = 6) is significantly reduced as compared with wild-type mice (n = 8) at 1 h and 1 and 3 d after training. B, Auditory fear conditioning in neurabin KO mice is similar to that in wild-type. C, There was no significant difference in response latencies between wild-type and neurabin KO mice in hotplate test. D, Spinal nociceptive tail-flick reflex between wild-type and neurabin KO mice is indistinguishable.
