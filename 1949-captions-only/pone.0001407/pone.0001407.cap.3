                Figure 3.  Normal function and expression of hippocampal NMDA receptor in neurabin KO mice.A, Input-output relationship for NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs in neurabin KO (n = 8) is similar to that in wild-type mice (n = 7). B, Current-voltage plots for NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs are not different between neurabin KO (n = 9) and wild-type mice (n = 7). C, Total expression of NMDA receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A, NR2B and PSD95 is unaltered in neurabin KO mice (n = 4 mice) compared with those in wild-type mice (n = 4 mice). D, The phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A and NR2B is similar in neurabin KO mice (n = 4 mice) and in wild-type mice (n =  4 mice).
