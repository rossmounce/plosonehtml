There is a significant increase of input-output relationship for AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in neurabin KO mice. C and D, Current-voltage plots for AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in neurabin KO (n = 7) and wild-type mice (n = 7). There were no significant difference between neurabin KO mice and wild-type mice. E, Western blot showing total expression of GluR1 and GluR2&amp;3 in neurabin KO mice (n = 4 mice) and wild-type mice (n = 4 mice). F, Western blot showing phosphorylation of GluR1 at sites of Ser845 and Ser831 in neurabin KO mice (n = 4 mice) and wild-type mice (n = 4 mice). G, Summarized results showing the relative expression of GluR1, GluR2&amp;3, and p-Ser845 and p-Ser831 on GluR1, in neurabin KO mice (n =  4 mice) compared with those in wild-type mice (n = 4 mice). Only p-Ser845 is significantly reduced in the KO mice.</p>
