                Figure 5.  Rescue of LTP by preconditioning with LTD induction but not by forskolin treatment in neurabin KO mice.A, In the presence of forskolin (10 ÂµM), LTP is induced in hippocampal CA1 neurons with pairing protocol in wild-type (n = 7) but not in neurabin KO mice (n = 8). The insets show averages of six EPSCs at baseline response and 30 min after LTP induction (arrow). Right panel shows the statistical result of LTP reduction in neurabin KO mice in the presence of forskolin. The dashed lines indicate the mean basal synaptic response. B, Pre-conditioning with LTD induction rescued LTP in neurabin KO mice (n = 9). The insets show averages of six EPSCs at baseline response (thick dark traces), 10 min (thin dark traces) after LTD induction (arrow) and 30 min (gray traces) after LTP induction (arrow). Right panel showing LTP in both wild-type (n = 5) and neurabin KO mice after preconditioning with LTD induction. The dashed lines indicate the mean basal synaptic response.
