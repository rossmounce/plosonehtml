Data are displayed as three-channel colour composites with the mean, phase and amplitude of the annual harmonic in the red, green and blue channel, respectively. For display purposes, values in each band were stretched across the full range of intensities within the image processing system using histogram equalization. The insets show the 229 MODLAND tiles that were processed, indicating the number of missing granules in each. Data are displayed in MODIS sinusoidal projection.</p>
