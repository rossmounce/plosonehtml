                Figure 2.  Temporal Fourier analysis of global (a) daytime Land Surface Temperature (dLST) and (b) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).The analyses were based on the period 2001â€“2005 using 230 images at 8-day intervals for dLST (a) and 115 images at 16-day intervals for EVI (b), both resampled at 5-day intervals after cubic spline interpolation. Data are displayed as three-channel colour composites with the mean, phase and amplitude of the annual harmonic in the red, green and blue channel, respectively. For display purposes, values in each band were stretched across the full range of intensities within the image processing system using histogram equalization. The insets show the 229 MODLAND tiles that were processed, indicating the number of missing granules in each. Data are displayed in MODIS sinusoidal projection.
