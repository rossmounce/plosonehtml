                Figure 3.  Examples of temporal Fourier processed artificially generated MODIS data for two years using (a) a standard TFA algorithm and (b) a standard TFA algorithm applied to spline-interpolated data.The signal (black line) is a daily time series artificially generated by summing annual, bi-annual and tri-annual cycles of known, randomly chosen amplitudes and phases. The ‘satellite sample’ (blue vertical lines) samples this signal at the MODIS 16-day interval and on the MODIS mid-sample date, which gives unequal intervals spanning each year end (upper tick marks on x-axis). The Fourier fit (red vertical lines) is the fit to the satellite signal that ignores this beginning/end of year anomaly and thus assumes a constant interval throughout, corresponding to the 23 images per year of the satellite sample (lower tick marks on x-axis). In (b) the daily spline fit (yellow line) is the cubic spline fit to these irregular satellite sample data. The Fourier fit (red vertical lines) is the TFA fit to the spline fit resampled every 5 days (lower tick marks on x-axis). Notice that there are no end-of-year anomalies here, resulting in a more accurate estimate of the harmonics used to generate the signal. The end of year anomaly is also present in MODIS data that run for only one year and hence affects TFA outputs in the same way, but is more clearly demonstrated visually in multi-year data.
