                Figure 4.  Comparisons between actual and calculated annual amplitudes (a,b) and phases (c,d) for artificially generated MODIS data.Amplitudes and phases were either calculated by standard temporal Fourier analysis (TFA) using the TFA module in IDRISI Andes (a,c) or by using the TFA algorithm described here (b,d). Lines represent least-squares regression slopes with the following equations: (a) 0.00393+0.99928x, F1,9898  = 1.159e+07, R2 = 0.9991; (b) âˆ’9.398e-06+1.0x, F1,9898 = 2.367e+10, R2 = 1.0; and (d) 7.140e-05+1.0x, F1,9898 = 38.9e+10, R2 = 1.0, all highly statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). IDRISI Andes provides phase estimates in radians which are here re-expressed in terms comparable to the input data. Because the points in the upper left part of (c) strongly influence regression calculations, no regression was fitted to these data. Instead, the line of equality (x = y) is shown in (c) to aid visual comparison of the results.
