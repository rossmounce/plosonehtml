(a) shows the observed NDVI time series (squares), the resampled cubic spline-fitted data (crosses and line), the five year mean synoptic annual series (thick black line, displaced by −0.1 to ease viewing), and the Fourier fit (grey line), i.e. the sum of the annual, bi-annual and tri-annual harmonics of the TFA. Drop-out values are shown as −0.2. Details of the annual (solid line), bi-annual (dashed) and tri-annual (dotted) harmonics are shown in (b). The sum of these three harmonics is shown in grey for 1.5 years, as in (a). The horizontal line represents the overall mean and the vertical lines indicate the phase (timing) of the first peak of each of the Fourier harmonics in year 2001. The inset magnifies one year.</p>
