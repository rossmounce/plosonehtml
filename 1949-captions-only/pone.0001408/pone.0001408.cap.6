Amplitude of the (d) annual, (e) bi-annual, and (f) tri-annual cycle are shown in addition to the phase of the (g) annual , (h) bi-annual, and (i) tri-annual cycle in months. Data are histogram-equalized for display from minimum (black) to maximum value (white). A coastline was added to (b) to show the missing values (white) more clearly. Data are displayed in the MODIS sinusoidal projection.</p>
