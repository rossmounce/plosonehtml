Transmission light (upper two rows) and fluorescence (lower two rows) micrographs (x 40) of control (upper panel) and <em>S. aureus</em>-infected cells (bottom panel) maintained in culture for 2h (A) and 1 day (B), 4- (C), 5- (D), and 6-days (E). Propidium iodide-positive cells represent infected host cells with leaky plasma membranes. B. BODIPY495/503 staining of lipid droplets of control and <em>S. aureus</em> infected hMDM cultures on five consecutive days post-phagocytosis. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 and stained as described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> section. All scale bars = 10 µm. C. Transmission electron micrographs of control (panel A) and infected cells (panels B and C) one day post-phagocytosis. Black arrowheads point to lipid droplets. Magnification: x10,000 (A and C) and ×7,500 (B). The photographs presented are representative of a minimum of 20 fields observed. D. Cytotoxicity (%) of <em>S. aureus</em> infection. Plasma membrane permeabilization or cell lysis induced in macrophage cultures by <em>S. aureus</em> infection at different MOI was determined as LDH activity levels. Cytotoxicity was calculated according to the formula: % cytotoxicity = [(experimental value–low control)/(high control–low control)] × 100, where a low control is the LDH activity in the conditioned medium of the control non-infected culture, while the LDH activity in the whole cell culture with cells lysed with detergent (2% Triton X-100) constitutes a high control. An experimental value was the activity in the conditioned medium from the culture infected with <em>S. aureus</em>. According to this calculation the control non-infected culture was assumed to show 0% cytotoxicity. All assays were performed in triplicate.</p>
