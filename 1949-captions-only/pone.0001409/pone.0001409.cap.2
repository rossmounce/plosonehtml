                Figure 2.  S. aureus infected macrophages retained their bactericidal functions.Control hMDMs, and cells 4 days post infection with S. aureus strain Newman, were stimulated to phagocytose either live bacteria at a MOI of 1:25 (1.25Ã—107 CFU) (panel A) or latex beads (panel B). Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) determined as the level of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured at various time intervals. The data shown is representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDMs derived from different donors.
