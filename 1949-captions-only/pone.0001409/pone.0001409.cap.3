                Figure 3.  After being phagocytosed by hMDM S. aureus strain Newman decreasingly persists intracellularly for several days until a burst of growth on day 6.A. CFU of S. aureus in cell lysates and culture medium on six consecutive days post-infection. Macrophages were allowed to engulf S. aureus at a MOI of 25 for 2 h, washed, and extracellular bacteria killed by gentamycin. Macrophages were cultured in media without antibiotics. At consecutive days post-phagocytosis media was aspired and hMDMs were lysed. Both conditioned media and cell lysates were plated onto TSA for CFU enumeration. The data shown details of one representative experiment (means±SD) of the 76 we performed in triplicate. B. CFU of S. aureus and LDH activity levels (A490 nm) in the conditioned culture medium on six consecutive days post infection (left panel); and transmission (upper row) and fluorescent (propidium iodide staining, lower row) light micrographs (x40) of S. aureus-infected cells maintained for the indicated time interval post infection. C. Confocal fluorescence microscopy images of hMDMs after 1, 3, and 5 days post-infection at MOI of 25. Cells were fixed, treated with RNase and stained with acridine orange (see Experimental Procedures section). Internalized bacteria are observed as green spots. All scale bars = 10 µm. D. Confocal fluorescence microscopy images of viable bacteria in hMDMs on the 5th day post-phagocytosis. Infected hMDMs were collected, permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 and double- labeled with propidium iodide and Syto9 (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Kit). Viable S. aureus cells are stained green while red signals represent dead bacteria and the host cell's nuclear DNA stained mainly with propidium. Scale bar = 7.5 µm. E. Specific PCR amplification of the S. aureus 16S rRNA gene (left panel) from cell lysates and the MLVF pattern (right panel) of bacteria infecting cells on consecutive days post-phagocytosis (numbers above lanes). Lane 0, sample collected immediately upon completion of phagocytosis (2h). Lane N, the MLVF pattern of S. aureus Newman before infection.
