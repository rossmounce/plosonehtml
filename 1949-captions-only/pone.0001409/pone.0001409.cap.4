Infected cultures were processed as described in the legend for <a href="#pone-0001409-g003">Fig. 3A</a> and live bacteria in the whole cultures (CFU) were enumerated up to 14 days postphagocytosis. Since at the longer timepoints no bacterial growth was detected (CFU = 0) these points were not presented on the graph. The data shown is representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDM derived from different donors. Bars represent mean CFU value ±SD. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001. NS-not significant.</p>
