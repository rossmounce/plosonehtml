                Figure 5.  Apparently structurally normal, intact dividing and viable S. aureus Newman cells persist in the intracellular vacuolar compartment on four consecutive days post-phagocytosis.The photographs presented are representative of a minimum of 20 fields observed. hMDMs were allowed to engulf bacteria for 2h at a MOI of 25, and infected macrophages were fixed with Karnovsky's fixative either immediately following phagocytosis (2 h), or on consecutive days post-phagocytosis, before being processed by standard electron microscopic techniques. At any given point post-phagocytosis dividing bacterial cells were visible (arrowheads). Magnified views of selected bacteria framed on main micrographs are shown in the bottom row labeled from A' to H', respectively. A. Control, non-infected hMDM has a morphological appearance typical for that of professional phagocyte, with vesicles localized around the nucleus (N) and only few lipid droplets (arrows). Magnification: x14,000. B. Immediately post-phagocytosis (2h), the bacteria were located predominantly in very tight membranous compartments (arrows). Magnification: x50,000. C. Already 1 day post-phagocytosis the majority of S. aureus cells were found in clearly defined membrane-enclosed vacuoles (arrows). A partially degraded bacterium in the vacuole is framed. Magnification: x20,000. D and E. At day 2 the cells of S. aureus can only be found in well defined vacuoles (arrows), occasionally spacious vacuoles (asterisk) containing several bacteria. Magnification: x32,500. F. On day 3 S. aureus persists in vacuoles which often reveal signs of partial membrane discontinuity (arrows). Magnification: x32,500. G and H. On day 4, the majority of bacteria were found in vacuoles with profoundly damaged or fully disintegrated membranes (arrow). Magnification: x54,000 (G) and x32,000 (H).
