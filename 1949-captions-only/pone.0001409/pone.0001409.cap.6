The data shown is representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDMs derived from different donors. Bars represent mean CFU value Â±SD. A. 8325-4, a natural <em>rsbU</em> defective strain lacking a functional SigB. B. SH1000, a derivative of strain 8325-4 with a restored <em>rsbU</em> gene and SigB activity. C.
