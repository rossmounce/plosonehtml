                Figure 6.  Functional sigB and agr operons, but not sarA, are indispensable for S. aureus to survive phagocytosis by hMDMs.Macrophages were allowed to engulf defined strains of S. aureus for 2h at a MOI of 25, and the intracellular survival of bacteria on consecutive days post-phagocytosis was monitored by enumeration of the CFU of cell lysates (see Fig. 3A legend). The data shown is representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDMs derived from different donors. Bars represent mean CFU value Â±SD. A. 8325-4, a natural rsbU defective strain lacking a functional SigB. B. SH1000, a derivative of strain 8325-4 with a restored rsbU gene and SigB activity. C. Newman sigB mutant D. Newman agr mutant E. Newman sarA mutant F. Newman wild-type
