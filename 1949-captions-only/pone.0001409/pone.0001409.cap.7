                Figure 7.  An α-hemolysin mutant of S. aureus strain Newman is efficiently killed in phago(lyso)somes within two days of phagocytosis.Intracellular persistence of S. aureus was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 3A. Bars represent mean CFU values ±SD and are representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDMs derived from different donors. An electron microphotograph of infected hMDMs was obtained 1 day post-phagocytosis and shows partially (white arrows) and totally degraded (black arrows) bacterial cells inside tight vacuoles. At this time point some apparently intact bacterial cells are also present (black arrowheads). Magnification: x32,500. The photograph presented is a representative of a minimum of 20 fields observed.
