                Figure 8.  Metalloprotease (Aur), protein A, and MSCRAMs, but not the V8 protease (SspA) and staphopain B (SspB), contribute to S. aureus intracellular persistence in infected hMDMs.Intracellular persistence of S. aureus was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 3A. Bars represent mean CFU value Â±SD and are representative of at least three separate experiments, performed in triplicate, using hMDMs derived from different donors. A. Newman aur mutant B. Newman srtA mutant C. Newman ssp operon mutant D. Newman spA mutant
