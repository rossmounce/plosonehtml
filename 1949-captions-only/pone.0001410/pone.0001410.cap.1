                Figure 1.  A designer self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold.A single peptide, approximately 6 nanometers, is shown. Thousands of peptides self-assemble to form a single nanofiber, trillions of peptides or billions of nanofibers form the scaffold that contains â‰ˆ99.5% water and 0.5% peptide materials [16]. Positive and negative charges are labeled in blue and in red, respectively.
