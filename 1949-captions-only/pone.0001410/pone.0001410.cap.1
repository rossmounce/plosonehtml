Thousands of peptides self-assemble to form a single nanofiber, trillions of peptides or billions of nanofibers form the scaffold that contains â‰ˆ99.5% water and 0.5% peptide materials <a href="#pone.0001410-Gelain1">[16]</a>. Positive and negative charges are labeled in blue and in red, respectively.</p>
