<h4>Accelerated Wound Reepithelialization by EGF Released from SAP</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Tissues were harvested 24 and 48 hours after wounding and stained using hematoxylin and eosin for morphological analysis. <a href="#pone-0001410-g004">Figure 4 C</a> demonstrates the means by which wound closure was evaluated by measuring the distance between the wound edge and the tip of the epithelializing tongue on each side to assess the percentage of wound closure. To evaluate the effect of EGF on wound re-epithelialization, we compared wound closure of control tissues in which no RADA was added to the wound surface (<a href="#pone-0001410-g005">Figure 5A</a>) to either 1% RADA without EGF (<a href="#pone-0001410-g005">Figure 5B</a>) or RADA 1%+EGF 100 µL (<a href="#pone-0001410-g005">Figure 5C</a>). After 48 hours, both the control wound and the wound covered with the SAP scaffold had a similar response characterized by a short epithelial tongue that initiated migration at the wound edge. However, a significant increase in the rate of reepithelization was observed when control wounds without EGF were compared to wounded tissues covered with RADA16-I containing EGF. In order to quantify wound closure, we calculated the percentage of reepithelialization after 24 hours (black boxes) and 48 hours (grey boxes) (<a href="#pone-0001410-g006">Figure 6</a>). We showed that wounds covered with the SAP scaffold containing EGF had undergone a 3-fold greater degree of reepithelization than either the control or RADA16-I wounds. 48 hours after wounding this difference was even greater as wounds treated with EGF showed 60±4% closure, whereas control and the RADA16-I only exhibited wound closure of 9±3% and 14±3%, respectively. Our observation that SAP hydrogel alone increases wound healing rates could be explained by the fact that the presence of the SAP offers a moist and protected environment that supports early cell migration and wound closure. We also tested a positive control by adding EGF (100 µg/ml) directly to the culture medium. In response to this type of EGF delivery, the wound was closed by 57±5%, thus showing no significant differences with the SAP containing EGF. Thus, the presence of EGF incorporated into the SAP scaffold and released when in contact with the wound had accelerated wound closure as efficiently as EGF delivered in the media.</p>
