                Figure 4.  Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of wounds (A,B) shows epithelial tongues migrating across the wound bed to close the wound.C is a schematic figure of the wound. The distance between the wound edges and between the epithelial tongues is measured to determine the percentage of wound closure. The scale bar in A,B is 500 µm, on figure C the scale bar is 100 µm.
