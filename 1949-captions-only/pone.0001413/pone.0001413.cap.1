                Figure 1.  EndoS has glycosidase activity on all four human IgG subclasses.Panel A. Glycan structure of human IgG. Glycan on the γ−chains of IgG attached to aspargine 297. GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Fuc, fucose; Man, mannose; Gal, galactose; NeuAc, sialic acid. Cleavage site for EndoS and recognation site for Lens culinaris agglutinin lectin (LCA) are indicated. Panel B. Purified IgG 1–4 incubated with EndoS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained. Panel C. IgG 1–4 incubated with EndoS and analyzed using LCA lectin blot.
