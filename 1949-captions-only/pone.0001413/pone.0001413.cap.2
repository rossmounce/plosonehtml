                Figure 2.  Hydrolysis of human IgG-subclasses by EndoS in plasma environment.Human plasma treated with EndoS or PBS and followed by IgG glycan hydrolysis detection using LCA lectin ELISA of the purified IgG fraction. The results are presented as percent hydrolysis of each subclass compared to signals from untreated plasma. Means and standard deviations, indicated with error bars, were calculated from three independed experiments using blood from three different donors.
