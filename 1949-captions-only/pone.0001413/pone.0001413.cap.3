                Figure 3.  EndoS(E235Q) binds to all IgG-subclasses.Panel A. Slot-blot representing the binding of EndoS and EndoS (E235Q) to each IgG subclass immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane in amounts: 3, 1.5 and 0.75 Âµg. The binding was detected using antiserum against EndoS. Panel B. Binding of EndoS (E235Q) to immobilized IgG-classes using BIAcore technology. The selected plot shows EndoS (E235Q) binding to IgG1 using hydrolysed IgG1 as a reference (bulk changes subtracted).
