Binding of purified IgG subclasses, with or without EndoS treatment, to FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb immobilized to a microtitter plate. HRP-labeled protein G was used for detection of bound IgG subclasses. (−) indicates intact IgG and (+) EndoS hydrolysed IgG. Means, standard deviations (indicated with error bars), and <em>p</em> values (calculated using Student's <em>t</em>-test) were determined from three separate experiments. Panel B. Binding of IgG subclasses to immobilized receptors as visualized using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance. Plot shows a typical sensorgram, here the IgG1 binding to FcγRIIa. An empty flow cell is used as reference (subtracted).</p>
