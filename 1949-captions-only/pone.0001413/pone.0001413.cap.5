                Figure 5.  EndoS treated IgG does not bind to FcÎ³RIIa on K562 cells. Panel A.The relative binding of radioactive IgG, With or without EndoS treatment, to K562 cells. The cells were incubated with 125iodine-labelled IgG (intact or EndoS-treated). The radioactivity of the washed cell pellets was detected. The binding of 125I- IgG (intact) to K562 cells, presented here as 100%, represents a specific IgG binding to K562 cells that could be inhibited by addition of cold IgG. Means, standard deviations (indicated with error bars), and p values (calculated using Student's t-test) were determined from three separate experiments. Panel B. K562 cells were incubated with human plasma treated with EndoS or PBS. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antiserum against human IgG.
