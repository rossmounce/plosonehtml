                Figure 6.  EndoS treated IgG does not bind to monocytes. Panel A.Monocytes were incubated with 125iodine-labelled IgG (intact or EndoS-treated). After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, the proteins from cell lysates, 10 Âµg total protein, were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Panel B. Flow cytometry analysis showing the decreased binding of IgG to activated monocytes in blood treated with EndoS. Human blood was treated with EndoS before addition of leukocyte activator fMLP. The IgG binding to monocytes was detected using mouse anti-human IgG and FITC-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody.
