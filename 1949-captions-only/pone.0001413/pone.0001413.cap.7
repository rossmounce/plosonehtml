K562 cells were incubated with plasma and subsequently with EndoS, EndoS(E235Q) or PBS. Cell lysates, 10 µg total protein, were analysed for IgG by SDS-PAGE and blot using antiserum against human IgG. Panel B. IgG bound to monocytes dissociates from FcγRs after treatment with EndoS. Monocytes were incubated with plasma and later with EndoS or PBS. Resuspended cell pellets were analyzed for IgG by blot using antiserum against human IgG. The glycan of IgG was detected by blot and reactivity with LCA lectin. Panel C. A BIAcore setup showing EndoS affecting the IgG1 dissociation from an immobilized receptor FcγRIIa. In two parallel experiments, the injection of EndoS (black curve) is compared to the injection of buffer (broken line) at the same time-point during the dissociation phase of the IgG1- FcγRIIa interaction.</p>
