(B) Affinity-purified anti-Dnmt2 antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitate Dnmt2 from whole cell protein extracts. (C) Anti-Dnmt2 specifically detects a 40 kDa protein. Whole-cell protein extracts from wildtype, homozygous mutants (Dnmt2Δ) and rescued mutants (pGenoDnmt2) were blotted and probed with anti-Dnmt2. (D) Early embryonic tissue (0–6 hr AEL) was fractionated, blotted as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and probed with anti-Dnmt2 and anti-〈-tubulin as control. (E) Developmental Western blot. Wildtype cytoplasmic protein extract from various embryonic, larval and adult stages were blotted and probed with anti-Dnmt2. Ponceau staining of blot is shown as loading control. hc-heavy chain, cytopl.-cytoplasmic, nucl.-nuclear, E-embryo, L1-first instar larvae, L2-second instar larvae, L3-third instar larvae, A-adult, f-female, m-males.</p>
