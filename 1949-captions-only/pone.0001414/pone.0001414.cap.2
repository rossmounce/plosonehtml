Whole protein extract from embryonic, larval and adult stages were blotted and probed with anti-Dnmt2. Ponceau staining is shown as a loading control. Right panel: Dnmt2-EGFP is expressed both in the cytoplasm and in nuclei. Fractionation efficiency was confirmed by probing the blot for cytoplasmic 〈-tubulin and nuclear Lamin C. Antibodies against EGFP reveal Dnmt2 in developing embryos (B), third instar larval salivary glands (C), ovaries (D) and testes (E). (F) Dnmt2-EGFP in a developing cyst of the female germline is mostly cytoplasmic. Nuclear staining can be observed in nurse cell nuclei. (G) Dnmt2-EGFP in the male germline is ubiquitous in all cells with the exception of somatic hub cells (marked by Armadillo, red). Scale bars: (B) 100 µm; (C) 10 µm; (D) 50 µm; (E) 100 µm; (F) 20 µm; (G) 10 µm.</p>
