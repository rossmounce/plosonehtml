                Figure 3.  Dnmt2 is present in nuclei and resides in an insoluble part of the nuclear matrix.(A) Developmental Western blot. Purified nuclei from embryonic and adult tissues were urea extracted, blotted and probed with anti-Dnmt2. Ponceau staining is shown as a loading control, lamin C staining is shown as a control for the enrichment of nuclear proteins. (B) Dnmt2 is not enriched in nucleoli. Sucrose density fractionation of nucleoli followed by blotting and tracing of nucleolar material using anti-Fibrillarin shows that Dnmt2 is part of other nuclear structures. (C) Dnmt2 is not enriched in nucleosomes. Micrococcal nuclease digest of purified nuclei releases histone H3 (EDTA supernatant), but not Dnmt2. The EDTA extracted nuclei still contain Dnmt2 suggesting association of Dnmt2 with non-chromatin structures. (D) Dnmt2 is associated with the nuclear matrix. Nuclear Dnmt2 is insoluble after DNAse digest, followed by high salt extraction and can only be solublilzed using urea extraction. CP-190 is included as a peripheral and lamin C as an integral nuclear matrix interacting protein. E-embryo, A-adult, f-female, m-males, MNase-micrococcal nuclease, sup-supernatant.
