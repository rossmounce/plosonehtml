Pictures show the distribution of Dnmt2-EGFP (gray, upper panel) and merged images (lower panel) with Dnmt2-EGFP in green and DNA in red. (B) Ectopic Dnmt2-EGFP localizes around metaphase chromosomes. Cell-type specific expression of UAS-Dnmt2-EGFP using asense-GAL4 causes Dnmt2 to localize to nuclear structures during mitosis. Ectopic protein localizes to prophase chromatin of CNS neuroblasts (upper panel) and aggregates densely around the mitotic metaphase plate (lower panel). (C) pGeno-Dnmt2-EGFP localizes to mitotic nuclei during larval development (upper panel). Frequently dividing optic lobe neuroblasts are enriched for Dnmt2-EGFP expression as visualized by anti-EGFP staining (lower panel). (D–E) Ventral ganglion neuroblasts express high levels of Dnmt2-EGFP, whereas ganglion mother cells (marked by Prospero, red, in E), which give rise to differentiated neurons and glia, do not express Dnmt2-EGFP. Scale bars: (A) 10 µm; (B) 10 µm; (C, D) 50 µm; (E, F) 20 µm; (G) 10 µm.</p>
