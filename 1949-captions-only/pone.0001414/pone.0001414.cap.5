Selected frames are shown for Dnmt2-EGFP (gray, upper panel) and as merged images (lower panel) with Dnmt2-EGFP in green and His2A-mRFP1 in red. A movie of the sequence is available as supporting material. (B) 1–3 h old embryos expressing pGeno-Dnmt2-EGFP were collected and fixed immediately (left panel), treated with colcemide (middle panel) or with taxol (right panel) in order to disrupt or stabilize microtubuli, respectively. Metaphase chromosomes are shown with Dnmt2 (gray), DNA (red) and 〈-tubulin (green). While Dnmt2-EGFP is maintained around metaphase plates in taxol-treated embryos, the protein is delocalized in colcemide-treated embryos. Scale bars: (A) 10 µm; (B) 5 µm.</p>
