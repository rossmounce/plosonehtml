                Figure 6.  Nuclear access reporter assay using GAL4:VP16-Dnmt2 fusion proteins.(A) Schematic representation of the nuclear access reporter assay. Ubiquitous expression of the GAL4:VP16 (GV) fusion proteins (black bar) causes the expression of EGFP only in some cells (green) due to selective nuclear access of the fusion protein. (B) GV-fusion proteins. GV-Dnmt2 (upper panel), Dnmt2-GV-Dnmt2 fusion expressing GV in the context of a split Dnmt2 protein (lower panel) which served as control. (C) GAL4:VP16-Dnmt2 expression in third instar larval brains causes widespread UAS-EGFP expression in the ventral ganglion. The magnification shows that regularly spaced cells (neuroblasts) express EGFP (green). (D) Ubiquitous GAL4:VP16-Dnmt2 in third instar larval eye discs causes specific UAS-EGFP expression behind the morphogentic furrow (arrow). Magnification of a field of cells shows robust expression in differentiated photoreceptor cells. (E) The control construct (GAL4:VP16 in a split Dnmt2 protein) causes background levels of UAS-EGFP expression. GAL4 (gray), EGFP (green), DNA (red). Scale bars: (C) 100 µm; (D, E) 70 µm.
