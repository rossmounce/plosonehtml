                Figure 1.  Meta-analysis of studies that report survival of honey bees exposed to Bt Cry proteins or plant tissues (pollen) that are active against lepidopterans and coleopterans.Effect size is Hedge's d, and error bars represent bias-corrected bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. Positive mean effect sizes indicate improved survival when exposed to Cry proteins compared to water or sugar-water control treatments. N = number of lines of independent data summarized by each bar.
