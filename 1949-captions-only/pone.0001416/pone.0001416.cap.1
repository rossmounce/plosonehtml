Periglomerular cells also receive glutamatergic input from mitral cell dendrites and provide GABAergic output to mitral cells of the same and neighbouring glomeruli. In addition, GABA (green arrow) and dopamine (not shown) released from periglomerular cells reduces glutamate release from olfactory sensory neuron axon terminals by acting on GABA<sub>B</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, respectively, in the same glomerulus <a href="#pone.0001416-Murphy1">[23]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001416-Wachowiak3">[49]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001416-Hsia1">[53]</a>. In subglomerular layers, glutamate release from mitral cell dendrites and axon collaterals stimulates granule cells via AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. Granule cells release GABA back onto GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on the same and other mitral cells. Glutamate release from a mitral cell can therefore cause recurrent inhibition of the same mitral cell and lateral inhibition of other mitral cells via periglomerular and granule cells. These interactions, here collectively referred to as the mitral cell→interneuron→mitral cell pathway, can extend over distances corresponding to multiple glomeruli. An additional pathway mediating lateral inhibition that is not detailed in this scheme is the short axon cell (SAC)→periglomerular→mitral cell pathway identified in rodents <a href="#pone.0001416-Wachowiak1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001416-Aungst1">[54]</a>. Centrifugal inputs from higher brain areas are also not shown in detail. Many of these inputs terminate on interneurons and are glutamatergic. Not included in the scheme are metabotropic glutamate receptors, interactions among interneurons in the granule cell layer <a href="#pone.0001416-Pressler1">[55]</a>, glutamate spillover <a href="#pone.0001416-Isaacson3">[56]</a>, and a small glutamatergic subpopulation of granule cells <a href="#pone.0001416-Didier1">[57]</a>. Strong excitatory interactions across glomeruli, as revealed in the antennal lobe of Drosophila <a href="#pone.0001416-Olsen1">[58]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001416-Root1">[60]</a>, have not been found in the vertebrate olfactory bulb.
