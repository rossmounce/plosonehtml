(B) Local field potential recording during odor stimulation (food extract; bar) before (black) and during (red) application of NBQX and AP5 and after washout (gray). Traces are band-pass filtered between 8–43 Hz. (C) Power spectrum of local field potential traces (average of 6 trials; from unfiltered data) for the examples shown in (B). (D) Average local field potential power (15–30 Hz) in the presence of NBQX and AP5, normalized to control (n = 4 olfactory bulbs). ***, P&lt;0.001.</p>
