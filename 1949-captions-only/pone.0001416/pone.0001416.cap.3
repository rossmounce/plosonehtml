(B1â€“B5) Five examples illustrating effects of NBQX on odor responses. Ticks denote individual action potentials. Each row shows one trial. Black: control; red: during NBQX application; gray: after wash-out of NBQX. Continuous lines are peri-stimulus time histograms, averaged over all trials under each condition. Thick portions depict time bins where peri-stimulus time histograms were significantly different (Student's t-test; P&lt;0.05) from the corresponding time bin in the control peri-stimulus time histogram (black). Bar indicates odor stimulation. Responses are from different cells and were recorded in the whole-cell, cell-attached or loose-patch configuration.</p>
