                Figure 5.  Effect of the NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5, on odor responses of mitral cells.(A) Whole-cell recording of a mitral cell response to odor stimulation (Lys, 10 µM; bar) before (black) and during (red) application of AP5. (B1–B5) Five examples illustrating effects of AP5 on odor responses. Conventions as in Fig. 3. Responses are from different cells and were recorded in the whole-cell, cell-attached or loose-patch configuration.
