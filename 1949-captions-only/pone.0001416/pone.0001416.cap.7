(B) Example of power spectra of local field potential responses before and during application of NBQX (average of 7 trials; calculated from unfiltered traces). (C) Example of a local field potential recording of an odor response before and during application of AP5 and after washout. (D) Example of power spectra before and during application of AP5 (average of 14 trials; calculated from unfiltered traces). (E) Average local field potential power (15–30 Hz) in the presence of NBQX (n = 6 olfactory bulbs) and AP5 (n = 4 olfactory bulbs), normalized to control. ***, P&lt;0.001; **, P&lt;0.01.</p>
