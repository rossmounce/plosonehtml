                Figure 8.  Effect of NBQX on mitral cell responses measured by 2-photon Ca2+ imaging.(A) Odor-evoked Ca2+ signals in mitral cells before, during and after application of NBQX (stimulus: Trp, 10 ÂµM). Arrows depict somata of neurons identified as mitral cells by expression of the genetically encoded fluorescence marker HuC-YC. (B) Average somatic Ca2+ signals before (control) and during application of NBQX, normalized to control. Error bars show standard deviation. **, P = 0.002 (sign test). (C) Cumulative distribution of Ca2+ signal amplitudes before (black) and during application of NBQX (red) and after washout (gray). (D) Comparison of Ca2+ signal amplitudes evoked by the same odors in the same mitral cells before and during application of NBQX. Data were pooled over all cells, odors and animals (n = 190 responses). r, Pearson correlation coefficient. Inset shows the density of data points in the boxed region. Lines are diagonals with slope one. (E) Left: mitral cell odor responses ranked according to the Ca2+ signal before application of NBQX. Inset shows an enlargement of a subregion. Right: Responses of the same mitral cells to the same odors in the presence of NBQX, ranked in the same order as in the control.
