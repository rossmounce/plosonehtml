A - anti-Flag-tag antibodies used for protein detection; B - anti-HA-tag antibodies used. Lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6 - starting point of chase (0 hours). Chase time: 3.5 hours (panel A, lanes 3 and 7), 7 hours (panel A, lanes 4 and 8), 8 hours (panel B, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8). Proteosome inhibitor MG132 added to samples in panel B, lanes 4 and 8. Lanes 1 and 5 contain ⅓ of total protein loaded to lanes 2–4 and 6–8, correspondingly. Position of molecular weight markers is shown.</p>
