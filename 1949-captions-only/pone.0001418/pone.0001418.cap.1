The GST protein served as a control. Immunodetection with anti-Sam68 and anti-GST antibodies is shown in the upper and lower panels, respectively. Black bars on the left indicate positions of marker bands. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation from LB17-lymphoma cell lysates with an anti-Sam68 antibody or a corresponding control antibody (CoAb). In lane 3, the lysate was loaded. Precipitates were analysed by immunoblotting with an anti-U2AF65 antibody. Arrows indicate U2AF65 band; asterisks denote bands caused by immunoglobulins. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation experiment as in (B), in the presence (+) or absence (âˆ’) of RNase A. Symbols are as in (B).</p>
