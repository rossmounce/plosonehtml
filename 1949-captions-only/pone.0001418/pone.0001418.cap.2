The Sam68 consensus binding site in the wild-type RNA sequence used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in panel B is boxed. The mutated nucleotide of the A/C mutant is indicated in red. (B) EMSA using recombinant Sam68 and radioactively labeled RNA oligonucleotide probes comprising either the wild-type or the A/C-mutant version of the intronic Sam68 binding site (see panel A). (C) v5-luciferase fusion activity from LB17 lymphoma cells transfected with different pETv5luc splice-reporter genes <a href="#pone.0001418-WegRemers1">[15]</a>. They were mutated for either the exonic (L/CC mutant <a href="#pone.0001418-Matter1">[19]</a>), the intronic (A/C mutant), or both Sam68 binding sites (double mutant). Cells were treated with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 40 ngml<sup>−1</sup>) (+) or with DMSO (solvent control) (−) for 6h prior to lysis and measurement of luciferase activity. Error bars indicate standard deviations from three independent transfections.</p>
