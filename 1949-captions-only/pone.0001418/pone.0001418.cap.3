                Figure 3.  Phosphorylation of Sam68 by ERK MAP-kinase impairs its binding to RNA in vitro.(A) Immunoblotting of non-phosphorylated (−) and ERK-phosphorylated (P) recombinant Sam68 preparations used in (B). Phosphorylation of Sam68 at ERK target sites results in a molecular weight shift (arrow) [19]. Black bar on the left indicates marker band. (B) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using RNA oligonucleotide probes comprising the exonic or intronic Sam68 binding sites and different amounts of either non-phosphorylated (−) or phosphorylated (P) recombinant Sam68.
