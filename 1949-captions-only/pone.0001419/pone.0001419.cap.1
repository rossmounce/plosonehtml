                Figure 1.  Western blots analysis of PrPres in the brains and spleens of tg650 mice infected with sporadic and variant CJD by intracerebral route.(A) Electrophoretic pattern of PrPres in the brain (upper panel) and spleen (lower panel) upon primary transmission. Note that vCJD case no. 4 shows either a typical vCJD or sCJD-like pattern in the brains of mice succumbing late or early with disease, respectively, while a vCJD-like pattern is consistently observed in the spleens. The PrPres profiles of variant and sporadic CJD in the brain of affected human patients are shown on the sides (left and right, respectively) of both immunoblots for comparison. (B) Ratio of diglycosylated and monoglycosylated PrPres species in the brains of mice following serial transmission of sporadic or variant CJD cases (data plotted as meansÂ±SEM). PrPvCJD and PrPsCJD patterns are represented by brown and grey colors, respectively. Variant CJD cases no. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are represented as diamond, circle, square, and triangle; sCJD cases no. 1, 2, 3 and 4 as polygon, star, ellipse, and rectangle. Secondary transmissions (when available) are represented by the same, unfilled symbols. Note the distinct glycoform ratio between early (grey triangle) and late brains upon transmission of vCJD case no. 4. (C) In early succumbing mice, the size of the PrPres fragments is higher in the brain (Br) than in the spleen (Sp), whereas in late succumbing it remains similar, as shown after deglycosylation by PNGase treatment. MM: molecular markers. (D) Electrophoretic pattern of PrPres in the brain and spleen upon secondary transmission. tg650 mice were inoculated with brain or spleen homogenates from either sCJD or vCJD case 4 late or early mice. The brain PrPres profile of human vCJD is shown on the left side of the gel for comparison.
