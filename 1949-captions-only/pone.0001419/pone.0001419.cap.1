Note that vCJD case no. 4 shows either a typical vCJD or sCJD-like pattern in the brains of mice succumbing late or early with disease, respectively, while a vCJD-like pattern is consistently observed in the spleens. The PrP<sup>res</sup> profiles of variant and sporadic CJD in the brain of affected human patients are shown on the sides (left and right, respectively) of both immunoblots for comparison. (B) Ratio of diglycosylated and monoglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> species in the brains of mice following serial transmission of sporadic or variant CJD cases (data plotted as meansÂ±SEM). PrP<sup>vCJD</sup> and PrP<sup>sCJD</sup> patterns are represented by brown and grey colors, respectively. Variant CJD cases no. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are represented as diamond, circle, square, and triangle; sCJD cases no. 1, 2, 3 and 4 as polygon, star, ellipse, and rectangle. Secondary transmissions (when available) are represented by the same, unfilled symbols. Note the distinct glycoform ratio between <em>early</em> (grey triangle) and <em>late</em> brains upon transmission of vCJD case no. 4. (C) In <em>early</em> succumbing mice, the size of the PrP<sup>res</sup> fragments is higher in the brain (Br) than in the spleen (Sp), whereas in <em>late</em> succumbing it remains similar, as shown after deglycosylation by PNGase treatment. MM: molecular markers. (D) Electrophoretic pattern of PrP<sup>res</sup> in the brain and spleen upon secondary transmission. <em>tg650</em> mice were inoculated with brain or spleen homogenates from either sCJD or vCJD case 4 <em>late</em> or <em>early</em> mice. The brain PrP<sup>res</sup> profile of human vCJD is shown on the left side of the gel for comparison.</p>
