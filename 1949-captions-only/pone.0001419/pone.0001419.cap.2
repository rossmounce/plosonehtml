                Figure 2.  Regional distribution of PrPres in the brains of tg650 mice infected with vCJD and sCJD.The distribution of PrPres deposits in the brains of tg650 mice infected with vCJD no. 4 late or early brain, vCJD (case no. 1), and sCJD (case no. 2) or non-TSE material (mock) is shown on representative histoblots in 4 different antero-posterior sections. Note the differing size and distribution of PrPres deposits between late and early brain, and their similarity to that observed with vCJD and sCJD, respectively.
