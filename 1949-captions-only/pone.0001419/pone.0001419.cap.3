                Figure 3.  PrPres plaques and spongiform changes in mice infected with vCJD no. 4 late or early brain.(A) PrP plaques were visible, here in the cortex of late brain passage, after periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Congo red staining. Note that their morphology and the surrounding ring of vacuoles are typical of florid plaques, a pathological hallmark of vCJD in human. (B) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of brain sections from mice infected with late or early brain. Note the distinct regionalization of vacuolation among the two agents. Th; thalamus. Bars: (A) = 200 µm. (B) = 100 µm.
