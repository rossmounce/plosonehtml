Note that their morphology and the surrounding ring of vacuoles are typical of florid plaques, a pathological hallmark of vCJD in human. (B) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of brain sections from mice infected with <em>late</em> or <em>early</em> brain. Note the distinct regionalization of vacuolation among the two agents.
