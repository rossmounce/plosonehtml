Empty symbols indicate PrP<sup>res</sup> negative tissue. Mock-infected mice (mock) were intraperitoneally inoculated with human brain without any TSE. (B) Quantification of PrP<sup>res</sup> levels in the spleens on secondary transmission of vCJD (<em>late</em> brain). Spleen tissue was collected from healthy mice euthanised in triplicates at regular time points or individually at the end of life (see above). PrP<sup>res</sup> was extracted, detected by western blot and quantified with a bio-imaging system for chemiluminescence applications (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>). Results are expressed in arbitrary units (logarithmic scale). The standard deviations for triplicates without error bars were too small to be represented. (C) Electrophoretic pattern of PrP<sup>res</sup> in brain (Br) spleen (Sp) at various times after inoculation of the indicated brain materials.</p>
