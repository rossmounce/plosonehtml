                Figure 4.  PrPres accumulation in tg650 mice intraperitoneally infected with vCJD.(A) PrPres electrophoretic pattern in spleen (sp, circle) and brain (br, square) of mice euthanised healthy in triplicates up to 550 days post-infection (broken line) or at end of life time. vCJD- and sCJD-associated PrPres pattern are represented as brown and grey color, respectively. Empty symbols indicate PrPres negative tissue. Mock-infected mice (mock) were intraperitoneally inoculated with human brain without any TSE. (B) Quantification of PrPres levels in the spleens on secondary transmission of vCJD (late brain). Spleen tissue was collected from healthy mice euthanised in triplicates at regular time points or individually at the end of life (see above). PrPres was extracted, detected by western blot and quantified with a bio-imaging system for chemiluminescence applications (see Methods). Results are expressed in arbitrary units (logarithmic scale). The standard deviations for triplicates without error bars were too small to be represented. (C) Electrophoretic pattern of PrPres in brain (Br) spleen (Sp) at various times after inoculation of the indicated brain materials.
