                Figure 1.  Nearly full-length RT-PCR method.Viral RNA was reverse-transcribed by priming with UNINEF 7′ or with VIF-VPUoutR1 using SuperScriptTM III RNase H− RT. The locations of all the primers used for cDNA synthesis and nested PCR were depicted in this diagram with the map of the complete HIV-1 genome. Two different strategies were employed to amplify the nearly full-length genome: one amplified the 2.6-kb (gag-pol) and 7.0-kb (pol-nef) fragments with the overlap of 797-bp, and the other amplified three overlapping fragments of 2.6-kb (gag-pol), 3.7-kb (pol-vpu) and 3.3-kb (env-nef) with the 797-bp and 321-bp over lap regions, respectively.
