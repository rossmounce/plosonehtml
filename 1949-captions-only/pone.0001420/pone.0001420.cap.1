The locations of all the primers used for cDNA synthesis and nested PCR were depicted in this diagram with the map of the complete HIV-1 genome. Two different strategies were employed to amplify the nearly full-length genome: one amplified the 2.6-kb (<em>gag-pol</em>) and 7.0-kb (<em>pol-nef</em>) fragments with the overlap of 797-bp, and the other amplified three overlapping fragments of 2.6-kb (<em>gag-pol</em>), 3.7-kb (<em>pol-vpu</em>) and 3.3-kb (<em>env-nef</em>) with the 797-bp and 321-bp over lap regions, respectively.</p>
