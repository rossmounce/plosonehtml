                Figure 3.  Celastrol does not inhibit the interaction between ubiquitylated proteins and S5a.Cellular lysates were incubated with either GST or GST-S5a coupled to glutathione-sepharose in the presence or absence of celastrol, as indicated. Associated proteins were precipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed for ubiquitin by Western blotting. A representative result of three independent experiments is shown.
