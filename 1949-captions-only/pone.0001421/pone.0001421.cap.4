                Figure 4.  Celastrol is not a potent inhibitor of the proteasome in vitro.(A) The chymotrypsin-like (black bars), caspase-like (white bars), and trypsin-like (grey bars) activities of purified 26S proteasome were assessed in the presence or absence of celastrol or MG132. (B) The chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome was assessed in the presence or absence of celastrol or MG132. (C) The chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in RAW264.7 cell lysate was assessed in the presence or absence of celastrol or MG132. Values represent the means of three experimentsÂ±SEM.
