                Figure 5.  Celastrol prevents LeTx-mediated activation of IL-18 processing.RAW264.7 or J774A.1 cells were treated for 2 h with LeTx (10−8 M PA, 5×10−10 M LF) in the absence or presence of 3 µΜ celastrol, as indicated. Cellular lysates were prepared and probed for IL-18 and α-tubulin by Western blotting. Cellular supernatants were collected and probed for IL-18 by Western blotting. Representative results of three independent experiments are shown.
