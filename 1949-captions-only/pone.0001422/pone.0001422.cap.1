                Figure 1.  Expression of neuronal markers in hESCs during dopaminergic differentiation and in FACS-isolated NCAM+ cells.(A) A culture of hESCs differentiated for 16 days on PA6 cells immunostained for β-III-tubulin. (B) Immunostaining for TH after 21 days. Bar = 50 µm. (C) Quantification of hESC colonies positive for PSA-NCAM, during differentiation of hESCs co-cultured with PA6 cells. (D) Expression of PSA-NCAM in day 14 hESCs by immunocytochemistry. Bar = 50 µm. (E) Morphology of FACS-isolated hESC by PSA-NCAM after 14 days of subsequent differentiation. (F) Expression of markers for undifferentiated hESC and neuronal markers in FACS-isolated NCAM+ cells by RT-PCR.
