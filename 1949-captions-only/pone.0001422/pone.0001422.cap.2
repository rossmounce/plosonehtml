(A) Representative TH staining (Calibration bar = 100 µm). (B) A representative PSA-NCAM sorted cell. (C–D) The downward deflections are inward currents mediated by sodium channels. They are followed by the prolonged upward currents, the delayed rectifier, mediated by potassium channels. (E) Action potentials trigged by a step injection of current in the cell under the current clamp mode of recording. (F–H) Responses to neurotransmitters GABA (F), Glutamate (G) and acetylcholine (H).</p>
