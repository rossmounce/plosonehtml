                Figure 2.  FACS-isolated NCAM+ cells derived from hESCs differentiated into dopaminergic neurons sorted in vitro NCAM+.Cells were differentiated in medium conditioned on PA6 cells for 21 days prior to immunocytochemical staining and electrophysiological recording. (A) Representative TH staining (Calibration bar = 100 µm). (B) A representative PSA-NCAM sorted cell. (C–D) The downward deflections are inward currents mediated by sodium channels. They are followed by the prolonged upward currents, the delayed rectifier, mediated by potassium channels. (E) Action potentials trigged by a step injection of current in the cell under the current clamp mode of recording. (F–H) Responses to neurotransmitters GABA (F), Glutamate (G) and acetylcholine (H).
