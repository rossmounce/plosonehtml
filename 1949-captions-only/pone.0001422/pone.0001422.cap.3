                Figure 3.  Chromosomal distribution of genes in NCAM+ sorted cells mapped to chromosomes.(A) Plot of percentages of total detected genes expressed on each chromosome. (B) Representation of the locations of the highly-expressed genes in 11p15.5, as described in the text. (C) Expression levels (tpm) for genes in the 11p15.5 region in NCAM+ neuronal precursor cells as compared to undifferentiated hESCs.
