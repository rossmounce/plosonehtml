                Figure 4.  Verification of genes uniquely expressed in NCAM+ cells by RT-PCR and qPCR.Eighteen genes that were highly expressed in NCAM+ cells were selected for verification by RT-PCR. (A) Expression of EMP3, SLC7A7, Pitx1, Msx1, Pitx2, SDF2L1, NPY and NINJ1 was detected in NCAM+ cells by RT-PCR. Of these, two (SDF2L1 and NINJ1) were also expressed in undifferentiated cells, and the other 6 genes (EMP3, SLC7A7, Pitx1, Pitx2, Msx1 and NPY) were expressed only in NCAM+ cells but were absent or expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated hESCs. (B) qPCR results for Pitx1 and Sdf2l1 expression in NCAM+ cells and undifferentiated hESCs. (C) Expression of seven unknown genes lacking known protein products in undifferentiated hESCs and in NCAM+ sorted cells. Hs.534052, Hs.473109, Hs.479491, Hs.19193 and Hs.551588 (H19) were detected only in NCAM+ sorted cells. Hs.446315 was detected in undifferentiated hESC, but at a lower level than for NCAM+ sorted cells. No difference in expression was detected for Hs.109798 or Hs.211282. (D) RT-PCR examination of IGF2 and TSSC4 expression in undifferentiated hESCs and NCAM+ sorted cells IGF2 and TSSC4 were also examined in 12-day differentiated, unsorted cultures (Diff D12). IGF2 was not detected in the undifferentiated hESCs, whereas no difference was seen for TSSC4.
