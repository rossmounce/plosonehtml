                Figure 5.  Expression of H19, CDKNIC and 1GF1 in mature human dopaminergic neurons.(A) Amplification plot for tyrosine hydroxylase copy RNA from neuromelanin-positive cells collected by laser capture microdissection in 4 control and 4 Parkinson disease cases (samples 1–8 in Fig. 2). For all samples analyzed, a sequence specific for tyrosine hydroxylase (Ct 22-32) was amplified, indicating the selection of dopaminergic cells. (B) Images of ethidium bromide gels showing the PCR products amplified from reversed-transcribed RNA extracted from the substantia nigra. Lines 1–8 correspond to amplified copy RNA from neuromelanin (+) neurons collected by laser capture microdissection from Parkinson's disease patients (1–4) and age-matched controls (5–8). Line 9 corresponds to total RNA isolated from the substantia nigra of an age-matched control. DNA size markers (1 kb plus ladder, Life tech) are shown on left and right.
