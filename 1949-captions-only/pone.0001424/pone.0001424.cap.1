(A) and (B) respectively show the log viral loads and the CD4 counts plotted as a function of the number of predicted HIV-1 epitopes identified per proteome for the individuals with CD4 counts above 400 (n = 81). (C) Shows the number of predicted HIV-1 epitopes for individuals belonging to the highest (mean = 65) and lowest (mean = 76) viremia quartile. (D) Shows the average viral loads of individuals presenting a specific allele as a function of the average number of HIV-1 predicted epitopes for that allele (only alleles presented by at least 3 individuals in the South-African cohort were included).</p>
