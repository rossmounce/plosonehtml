The ratio of predicted epitopes predicted for each protein corresponded to the number of epitope-fulfilling motifs identified in each protein over the total number of epitopes identified for the whole proteome. (A) Shows the distribution of epitopes for “good” alleles, i.e., those associated with the lowest viral loads in the cohort (lowest quartile: VL&lt;125,437; mean = 65,384; median = 58,229). (B) Shows the epitope distribution for “bad” alleles, those associated with the highest viral loads in the cohort (highest quartile: VL&gt;320,643; mean = 971,587; median = 531,208). For each allele belonging to a quartile, average values per allele were calculated based on the viral loads of HLA-matched individuals). (C) Illustrates the percentage of epitopes restricted by “good” and “bad” HLA alleles for each protein.</p>
