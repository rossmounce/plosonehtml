                Figure 1.  Pharmacokinetics of carbohydrates in plasma after oral administration and injection.Plots of mean (±s.e.m.) plasma L-rhamnose (upper plot), cellobiose (middle) and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (lower plot) concentration as a function of time since each compound was consumed (oral) or injected into bats (n = 8). Each concentration (µg g−1 plasma) was normalized to the dose administered to the bat. Each inset displays the mean values on a semi-log plot. The line through points from the injection trial is the nonlinear fit to the biexponential model: Ct = A e−αt+B e−βt (see Methods, and Table 1 for derived parameters).
