Each concentration (µg g<sup>−1</sup> plasma) was normalized to the dose administered to the bat. Each inset displays the mean values on a semi-log plot. The line through points from the injection trial is the nonlinear fit to the biexponential model: <em>C<sub>t</sub></em> = A e<sup>−αt</sup>+B e<sup>−βt</sup> (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>, and <a href="#pone-0001425-t001">Table 1</a> for derived parameters).</p>
