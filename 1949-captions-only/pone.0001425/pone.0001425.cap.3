The mucosa (i.e., villous) to serosa (i.e., nominal) surface enlargement factor, which varied significantly with intestinal position (Fig. 3E), was calculated from measures of villus length (Fig. 3B; also varied significantly with position), villus width (Fig. 3C), and crypt width (Fig. 3D). Villi, overall, increased intestinal surface area by 16.8±1.0 times.</p>
