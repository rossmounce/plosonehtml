A gene model for glycerate kinase (GK) could not be found in either genome. The bacterial-type glyoxylate to glycerate metabolism is not shown due to uncertainty in the localization of the enzymes. Enzyme Abbreviations: ACS: acetyl CoA synthetase; CTS: citrate synthase; GDC: glycine decarboxylase; GOX: glycolate oxidase; GK: glycerate kinase; HPR: hydroxypyruvate reductase /glycerate dehydrogenase; ICL: isocitrate lyase; ME1: NAD malic enzyme; MLS: malate synthase; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGP: 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase; RUBISCO: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase; SHMT: serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SPT/AGT: serine-pyruvate/alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase.</p>
