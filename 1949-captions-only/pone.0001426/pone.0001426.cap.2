                Figure 2.  Model for photorespiration and associated pathways in diatoms based on the annotations of the Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana genomes.For simplicity, the number of oragenelle membranes has been reduced in this figure. A gene model for glycerate kinase (GK) could not be found in either genome. The bacterial-type glyoxylate to glycerate metabolism is not shown due to uncertainty in the localization of the enzymes. Enzyme Abbreviations: ACS: acetyl CoA synthetase; CTS: citrate synthase; GDC: glycine decarboxylase; GOX: glycolate oxidase; GK: glycerate kinase; HPR: hydroxypyruvate reductase /glycerate dehydrogenase; ICL: isocitrate lyase; ME1: NAD malic enzyme; MLS: malate synthase; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGP: 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase; RUBISCO: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase; SHMT: serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SPT/AGT: serine-pyruvate/alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase.
