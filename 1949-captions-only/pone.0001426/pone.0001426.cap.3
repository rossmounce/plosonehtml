                Figure 3.  Model of the oxidative and reductive pentose phosphate pathways and related reactions in P. tricornutum.For simplicity, the number of organelle membranes has been reduced in this figure. The superscript numbers attached to the enzyme names indicate the number of isoenzymes within the respective compartment. Enzyme abbreviations: AL: aldolase; FBA: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; FBP: fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GPI: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; GPDH: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGL: phosphor-gluconate lactonase; PRK: Phosphoribulokinase; RUBISCO: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase; PGDH: 6-phospho-gluconolactone dehydrogenase, PGK: phospho-glycerate kinase; RPI: ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; RPE: ribulose-phosphate epimerase; RPI: ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; TKL: transketolase; TAL: transaldolase; TPI: triose-phosphate isomerase; SBP: seduheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase.
