                Figure 1.  Mutation of D469 to alanine in a putative pseudosubstrate domain of Chk1 compromises function.A. Comparison of the region of fission yeast Chk1 that matches the Chk1 substrate recognition motif [24]. Mutations to alanine were generated at positions 464, 466 and 469 as indicated. B. The chk1Δ strains expressing the indicated plasmids, as well as the pSP1 empty vector as a control, were grown to mid-log phase, ethanol fixed, and DAPI stained for microscopic analysis. Expression of the mutant plasmids does not affect cellular length or morphology as compared to cells expressing the wt chk1. C. The chk1Δ strains expressing the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, spread on PMA plates in triplicate, exposed to 0, 40, 80, 120, or 160 J/m2 UV, and incubated for 3 days at 30°C. Mean survival was calculated as the percentage of colonies appearing on untreated plates. The data shown is from one experiment that is representative of 3 independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. D. Mutations at I464 and R466 do not compromise Chk1 phosphorylation upon exposure to UV light. Cycling cells were exposed to 40 µM CPT for 2 hours then collected and processed for Western blot analysis with antibody to the HA epitope at the C-terminus of each of the Chk1 proteins. E. Mutation of D469 to alanine compromises function. Cells were assayed as in B.
