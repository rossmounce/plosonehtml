The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were assayed for UV survival as described in <a href="#pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. B. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase than treated or not with 40 µM CPT for 2 hours. Cells were collected and fixed for staining with calcofluor to monitor septation index. Graphed data is representative of three independent experiments. A total of 300 cells were counted for each strain and condition tested. C. A strain with <em>chk1D469G</em> integrated at the genomic <em>chk1</em> locus does not survive exposure to UV light. The indicated strains were assayed for UV sensitivity as described in <a href="#pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</a> except that cells were grown and plated on rich media (YEA).</p>
