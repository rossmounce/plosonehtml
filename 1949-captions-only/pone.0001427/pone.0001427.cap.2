                Figure 2.  When expressed in multiple copies Chk1D469G does not compromise survival in response to UV light or CPT treatment.A. The chk1Δ strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were assayed for UV survival as described in Fig. 1B. B. The chk1Δ strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase than treated or not with 40 µM CPT for 2 hours. Cells were collected and fixed for staining with calcofluor to monitor septation index. Graphed data is representative of three independent experiments. A total of 300 cells were counted for each strain and condition tested. C. A strain with chk1D469G integrated at the genomic chk1 locus does not survive exposure to UV light. The indicated strains were assayed for UV sensitivity as described in Fig. 1B except that cells were grown and plated on rich media (YEA).
