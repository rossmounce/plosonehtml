                Figure 3.  Chk1D469G exhibits a low level of phosphorylation in response to UV-irradiation or CPT treatment.A. Chk1D469G fails to display a mobility shift when whole cell lysates from UV irradiated cells are analyzed by Western blot. The chk1Δ strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469A, Chk1D469G, or the empty vector (pSP1) were grown to mid-log phase, irradiated at a dose of 100 J/m2, and harvested for lysate preparation. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blot analysis for the HA tag on Chk1. B. The chk1Δ strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469A, or ChklD469G were grown to mid-log phase and either treated with 100 J/m2 UV (upper panels) or 40 µM CPT (lower panels). Lysates were prepared and subject to immunoprecipitation with the F7 anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed with either the S345-phosphopeptide antibody or the Y11 anti-HA antibody. C. Rad3 activity is required for Chk1D469G survival in response to UV damage. The WT strain (972) and the chk1Δ rad3.T80 strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469G, or the empty vector control (pSP1) were grown to mid-log phase, spread on PMA plates, exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 J/m2 UV, and incubated at 30°C. Survival was determined as described for Fig. 1B.
