Chk1D469G fails to display a mobility shift when whole cell lysates from UV irradiated cells are analyzed by Western blot. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469A, Chk1D469G, or the empty vector (pSP1) were grown to mid-log phase, irradiated at a dose of 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>, and harvested for lysate preparation. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blot analysis for the HA tag on Chk1. B. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469A, or ChklD469G were grown to mid-log phase and either treated with 100 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV (upper panels) or 40 µM CPT (lower panels). Lysates were prepared and subject to immunoprecipitation with the F7 anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed with either the S345-phosphopeptide antibody or the Y11 anti-HA antibody. C. Rad3 activity is required for Chk1D469G survival in response to UV damage. The WT strain (972) and the <em>chk1Δ rad3.T80</em> strains expressing WT Chk1, Chk1D469G, or the empty vector control (pSP1) were grown to mid-log phase, spread on PMA plates, exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV, and incubated at 30°C. Survival was determined as described for <a href="#pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</a>.</p>
