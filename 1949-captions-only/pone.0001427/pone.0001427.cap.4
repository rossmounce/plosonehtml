Chk1D469G has a reduced level of basal activity that increases in response to UV-irradiation. Chk1, Chk1D469G, and Chk1D155A immunoprecipitates from either untreated or UV-irradiated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate. The data shown depicts values for a single experiment with triplicate samples. It is representative of 3 independent experiments. B. The <em>chk1Î”</em> strains expressing the indicated plasmids were assayed for sensitivity to UV light as described in <a href="#pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. C. Chk1 and Chk1D469G immunoprecipitates from either untreated, UV-irradiated, or CPT-treated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate over the course of 45 minutes. The reduced level of Chk1D469G catalytic activity is not due to a delay in the onset of activation. D. Chk1D469A and Chk1D469G immunoprecipitates from either untreated, UV-irradiated, or CPT-treated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate over the course of 45 minutes. Chk1D469G displays higher levels of catalytic activity that increases in response to DNA damage compared to Chk1D469A. The data shown in C and D is representative of 3 independent experiments.</p>
