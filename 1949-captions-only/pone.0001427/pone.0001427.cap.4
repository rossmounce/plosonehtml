                Figure 4.  Chk1D469G has catalytic activity that increases in response to DNA damage.A. Chk1D469G has a reduced level of basal activity that increases in response to UV-irradiation. Chk1, Chk1D469G, and Chk1D155A immunoprecipitates from either untreated or UV-irradiated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate. The data shown depicts values for a single experiment with triplicate samples. It is representative of 3 independent experiments. B. The chk1Î” strains expressing the indicated plasmids were assayed for sensitivity to UV light as described in Fig. 1B. C. Chk1 and Chk1D469G immunoprecipitates from either untreated, UV-irradiated, or CPT-treated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate over the course of 45 minutes. The reduced level of Chk1D469G catalytic activity is not due to a delay in the onset of activation. D. Chk1D469A and Chk1D469G immunoprecipitates from either untreated, UV-irradiated, or CPT-treated cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate over the course of 45 minutes. Chk1D469G displays higher levels of catalytic activity that increases in response to DNA damage compared to Chk1D469A. The data shown in C and D is representative of 3 independent experiments.
