                Figure 5.  Chk1D469G, but not Chk1D469A, induces a cell cycle delay in response to UV treatment.A. The chk1Δ cdc25-22 strains expressing the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase at 25°C and shifted to 36.5°C for 2.5 hours to synchronize cell populations in G2. Cells were exposed to 100 J/m2 UV (untreated as a control) and released to 25°C to permit cycling. The percentage of binucleate cells was scored over the course of 4 hours. UV treatment groups are indicated by ‘+’ in the figure. B. The chk1Δ strain expressing the indicated plasmids were assayed for UV survival as described in Fig. 1B.
