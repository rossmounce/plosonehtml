The <em>chk1Δ cdc25-22</em> strains expressing the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase at 25°C and shifted to 36.5°C for 2.5 hours to synchronize cell populations in G2. Cells were exposed to 100 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV (untreated as a control) and released to 25°C to permit cycling. The percentage of binucleate cells was scored over the course of 4 hours. UV treatment groups are indicated by ‘+’ in the figure. B. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strain expressing the indicated plasmids were assayed for UV survival as described in <a href="#pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</a>.</p>
