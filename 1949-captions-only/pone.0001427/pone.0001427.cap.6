The <em>chk1Δ cdc25-22</em> strains expressing WT Chk1 or Chk1D469G were grown to mid-log phase at 25°C, shifted to 36.5°C for 2.5 hours to synchronize in G2, released to 25°C for 30 minutes, and treated with 20 µM CPT (untreated as a control). After a 1-hour incubation with CPT (time period indicated by black bar in figure and treatment groups indicated by ‘+’), cells were washed and maintained at 25°C for an additional 6 hours. The percentage of binucleate cells was scored over the course of 7.5 hours. B. The <em>chk1Δ cdc25-22</em> strains expressing WT Chk1 or Chk1D469A were examined as in A. C. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains expressing the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, resuspended to 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ ml and 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on PMA plates containing 20 µM CPT (or no drug as a control). Plates were photographed after three days of growth at 30°C.</p>
