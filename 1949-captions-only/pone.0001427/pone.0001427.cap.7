                Figure 7.  Chk1D469G, but not Chk1D469A, confers survival when cells are exposed to MMS, 4-NQ or gamma radiation.A. The chk1Δ strains prepared as in Fig. 6C were spotted on PMA plates containing 0.01% MMS (upper panel) or 62 ng/ml 4-NQ (lower panel). B. The chk1Δ strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, plated on PMA and irradiated with the indicated doses of gamma radiation from a 60Co source. Survival was calculated by determining colony number relative to unirradiated controls after 3 days of growth at 30°C.
