The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains prepared as in <a href="#pone-0001427-g006">Fig. 6C</a> were spotted on PMA plates containing 0.01% MMS (upper panel) or 62 ng/ml 4-NQ (lower panel). B. The <em>chk1Δ</em> strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, plated on PMA and irradiated with the indicated doses of gamma radiation from a <sup>60</sup>Co source. Survival was calculated by determining colony number relative to unirradiated controls after 3 days of growth at 30°C.</p>
