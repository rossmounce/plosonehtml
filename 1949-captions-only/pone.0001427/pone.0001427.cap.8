                Figure 8.  Chk1D469G cannot confer checkpoint function when replication forks stall or when DNA ligase activity is limited.A. A cds1Δ chk1Δ strain was transformed with the plasmids indicated in the legend. Mid-log phase cells were treated with 12 mM HU for the indicated period of time and monitored for the percentage of cells displaying aberrant mitosis. The key depicts cellular morphologies scored as aberrant mitosis. B. A chk1Δ strain transformed with WT Chk1 (cdc17+/pChk1) and chk1Δ cdc17-K42 strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, resuspended to 1×107 cells/ml and 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on PMA plates. The plates were incubated at 25° and 32°C for 3 days.
