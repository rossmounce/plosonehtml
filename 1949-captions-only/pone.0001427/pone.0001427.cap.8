A <em>cds1Δ chk1Δ</em> strain was transformed with the plasmids indicated in the legend. Mid-log phase cells were treated with 12 mM HU for the indicated period of time and monitored for the percentage of cells displaying aberrant mitosis. The key depicts cellular morphologies scored as aberrant mitosis. B. A <em>chk1Δ</em> strain transformed with WT Chk1 (<em>cdc17<sup>+</sup></em>/pChk1) and <em>chk1Δ cdc17-K42</em> strains transformed with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase, resuspended to 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on PMA plates. The plates were incubated at 25° and 32°C for 3 days.</p>
