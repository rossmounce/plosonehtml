                Figure 1.  The three urg genes are induced with uracil and clustered in genome.(A) Scatter plot showing microarray signal intensities for transcripts from cells grown in the presence (Y-axis) or absence (X-axis) of uracil, whose transcriptomes were competitively hybridized on the same microarray. The urg1, urg2, and urg3 genes are most strongly induced in response to uracil, a condition that otherwise triggers only minor gene expression changes. The grey dots reflect transcripts that were flagged ‘absent’ during initial data processing [37]. (B) Genomic arrangement of urg1, urg2, and urg3 genes on chromosome I. Arrowheads indicate transcriptional direction. The SPAC1002.21 open reading frame between urg1 and urg3 may not be a real gene: it is annotated as ‘dubious’ in S. pombe GeneDB and does not seem to be expressed in any conditions based on microarray data (unpublished observations).
