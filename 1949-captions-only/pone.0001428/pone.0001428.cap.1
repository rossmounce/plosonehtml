The <em>urg1, urg2,</em> and <em>urg3</em> genes are most strongly induced in response to uracil, a condition that otherwise triggers only minor gene expression changes. The grey dots reflect transcripts that were flagged ‘absent’ during initial data processing <a href="#pone.0001428-Lyne1">[37]</a>. (B) Genomic arrangement of <em>urg1, urg2,</em> and <em>urg3</em> genes on chromosome I. Arrowheads indicate transcriptional direction. The SPAC1002.21 open reading frame between <em>urg1</em> and <em>urg3</em> may not be a real gene: it is annotated as ‘dubious’ in <em>S. pombe</em> GeneDB and does not seem to be expressed in any conditions based on microarray data (unpublished observations).</p>
