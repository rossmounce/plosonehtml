The Y-axis shows gene expression ratios relative to the same cells grown without uracil (0 minute timepoint). Gene expression ratios were determined using microarrays. Note that the presence of a second <em>urg1</em> promoter in the same cells (P<em>urg1-pom1</em>) did not affect the expression characteristics of the <em>urg1</em> gene.</p>
