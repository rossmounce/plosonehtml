                Figure 2.  The urg promoters control changes in mRNA levels in response to uracil.Timecourse experiment showing the gene expression profiles of urg1, urg2, urg3, and Purg1-pom1 at 5, 10, 30, and 240 minutes after uracil addition, and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after uracil removal. The Y-axis shows gene expression ratios relative to the same cells grown without uracil (0 minute timepoint). Gene expression ratios were determined using microarrays. Note that the presence of a second urg1 promoter in the same cells (Purg1-pom1) did not affect the expression characteristics of the urg1 gene.
