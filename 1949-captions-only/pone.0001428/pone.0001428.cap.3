                Figure 3.  Modules for PCR-based gene targeting to place genes under Purg1 control and N-terminal tagging of proteins.These modules are derived from previously published modules [26], [28] using a 675 bp fragment immediately upstream of the urg1 open reading frame. Transcriptional directions are indicated by arrows. Restriction sites and tags are as described before (Figure 2 in [26]); the GFP tag carries the S56T mutation [39]. The approximate sizes of the expected PCR products are indicated at right.
