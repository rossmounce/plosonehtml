Transcriptional directions are indicated by arrows. Restriction sites and tags are as described before (Figure 2 in <a href="#pone.0001428-Bhler1">[26]</a>); the GFP tag carries the S56T mutation <a href="#pone.0001428-Heim1">[39]</a>. The approximate sizes of the expected PCR products are indicated at right.</p>
