Expression levels were determined under both induced (ON) and repressed (OFF) conditions for the two promoter systems. (B) Histogram as in (A) comparing mRNA expression levels of <em>pom1</em> under control of P<em>urg1,</em> P3<em>nmt1,</em> and P81<em>nmt1.</em> The same arbitrary units are used for (A) and (B). Cells were grown for two hours either in the presence or absence of uracil (for P<em>urg1</em>), or for 21 hours in the presence or absence of thiamine (for P3<em>nmt1</em> and P81<em>nmt1</em>).</p>
