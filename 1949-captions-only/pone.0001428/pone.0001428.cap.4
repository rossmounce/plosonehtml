                Figure 4.  Quantitative comparison of regulation by urg1 and nmt1 promoters using pom1 as reporter.(A) Histogram showing mRNA expression levels determined by qRT-PCR for pom1 under control of Purg1 and P3nmt1 compared to expression levels of urg1 and nmt1 genes themselves (colour-coded as indicated in the Figure). Expression levels were determined under both induced (ON) and repressed (OFF) conditions for the two promoter systems. (B) Histogram as in (A) comparing mRNA expression levels of pom1 under control of Purg1, P3nmt1, and P81nmt1. The same arbitrary units are used for (A) and (B). Cells were grown for two hours either in the presence or absence of uracil (for Purg1), or for 21 hours in the presence or absence of thiamine (for P3nmt1 and P81nmt1).
