                Figure 5.  Expression of pom1 under control of Purg1 leads to cell branching in G2-phase.(A) Purg1-pom1 cells were gown without uracil (left); uracil was then added to the same culture and cells were grown for another two hours (right). Cells show no morphological aberrations under repressed conditions but form misplaced growth sites after activation of Purg1. (B) cdc10 and cdc10 Purg1-pom1 cells grown for two hours at restrictive temperature without uracil and two hours at restrictive temperature with uracil. Activation of Purg1 has little effect on cell morphology. (C) cdc25 and cdc25 Purg1-pom1 cells grown for two hours at restrictive temperature without uracil and two hours at restrictive temperature with uracil. Activation of Purg1 leads to misplaced growth sites. (D) Histogram comparing percentage of branched cells when Purg1-pom1 is activated in either cdc10 or cdc25 backgrounds.
