Cells show no morphological aberrations under repressed conditions but form misplaced growth sites after activation of P<em>urg1.</em> (B) <em>cdc10</em> and <em>cdc10</em> P<em>urg1-pom1</em> cells grown for two hours at restrictive temperature without uracil and two hours at restrictive temperature with uracil. Activation of P<em>urg1</em> has little effect on cell morphology. (C) <em>cdc25</em> and <em>cdc25</em> P<em>urg1-pom1</em> cells grown for two hours at restrictive temperature without uracil and two hours at restrictive temperature with uracil. Activation of P<em>urg1</em> leads to misplaced growth sites. (D) Histogram comparing percentage of branched cells when P<em>urg1-pom1</em> is activated in either <em>cdc10</em> or <em>cdc25</em> backgrounds.</p>
