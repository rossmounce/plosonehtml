                Figure 2.  Descriptions of possible interactions between the two eyes' images and the predicted perceptual consequences, in experiment 2.A and B: interactions between temporally resolved patterns in the two eyes in cases of temporally symmetric (A) and asymmetric (B) stimulation. The presumed inhibitory interactions are drawn (lines with disk-heads), assuming inhibitory interactions are strongest at shorter and decrease at longer delays [7]. The strength of inhibition is indicated by the width of the lines. Below each panel are schematized representations of the predicted perceptual outcomes (time-scale is different from the upper images), showing that in (A), normal rivalry should be observed, whereas in (B) a strong bias is expected, based on the masking literacture (see text). C The predicted perceptual consequences of introducing asymmetric stimulation. The ratio of the percept duration of the lagging stimulus over total percept duration is shown on the y-axis (“predominance of lagging stimulus”). For temporally symmetric presentations (left, see icon bottom) the inhibitory interactions between the patterns are equal and therefore the percept should be unbiased (i.e. a bias of 0.5, as in Exp 1). For temporally asymmetric presentations (see icon on the bottom right), perception should be biased towards the temporally leading stimulus because its inhibitory forces are stronger than the inhibition it receives from the lagging stimulus (see B). The vertical dashed line represents the approximate position of the temporal limit found in Experiment 1. The dark and light green rectangles represent the presentation of the leading and lagging patterns, respectively.
