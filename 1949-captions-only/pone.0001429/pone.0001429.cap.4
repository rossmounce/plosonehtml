                Figure 4.  Overview of the obtained temporal limits.(A) Experiments 1-5. Individual subject data are denoted by different symbols. The label “Basic” refers to Experiment 1. Data in the Contrast (ctrl) condition was obtained with stimuli identical to those of experiment 1, which were interspersed with the stimuli of the contrast polarity experiment (“Contrast”, experiment 4). The numbers refer to the Experimental condition. The expected positions of the data points, if the experimental manipulations were effective, are indicated with grey boxes. The results show that the data cluster around a much higher temporal limit. The horizontal blue line represents the position of the estimated temporal limit, based on these experiments (363±11 ms, mean±s.e. over experiments 1-5). (B) Experiment 6. The Form+Motion conditions exhibited the same ~350 ms temporal limits as Experment 1-5, while the Motion-only conditions did not.
