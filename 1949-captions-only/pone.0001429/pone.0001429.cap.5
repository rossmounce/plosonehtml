                Figure 5.  Independence from stimulus energy (Experiment 5).The results depict the percentage of trials per condition categorized as containing binocular rivalry, averaged over subjects. The ‘on’-times (Ton) and ‘off’-times (Toff) were independently varied between 13 and 200 ms, in steps of 26.6 ms. There was no significant dependence of the temporal limit ( = 2(Ton+Toff)) on the size of Ton, and therefore on luminance (one-way ANOVA F(7,46) = 0.51; p&gt;0.8). Instead the transition occurred at a repetition period of ~400 ms (represented by the dashed line), irrespective of the size of Ton.
