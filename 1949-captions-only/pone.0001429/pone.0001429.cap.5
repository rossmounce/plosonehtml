The ‘on’-times (T<sub>on</sub>) and ‘off’-times (T<sub>off</sub>) were independently varied between 13 and 200 ms, in steps of 26.6 ms. There was no significant dependence of the temporal limit ( = 2(T<sub>on</sub>+T<sub>off</sub>)) on the size of T<sub>on</sub>, and therefore on luminance (one-way ANOVA F(7,46) = 0.51; p&gt;0.8). Instead the transition occurred at a repetition period of ~400 ms (represented by the dashed line), irrespective of the size of T<sub>on</sub>.</p>
