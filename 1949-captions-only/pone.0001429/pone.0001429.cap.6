                Figure 6.  The temporal limit for binocular rivalry is preserved with form conflict, but not with motion conflict (Experiment 6).A. Stimuli for the motion-conflict-only conditions have identical orientation, but different motion directions in the two eyes (see arrows on the right and dotted lines that trace some of the edges' motions over time). B. Stimuli for the motion-and-form-conflict conditions have both different orientation and motion-direction. C. Rivalry ensues in the form-and-motion conflict condition for repetition periods smaller than ~350 ms (blue dashed line), causing most of the trial being spent in one of two motion percepts. In the motion-only-conflict condition (red continuous line), rivalry was only observed for continuous presentations, and therefore it does not show the 350 ms temporal limit. At repetition periods of 213 and 640 ms, a static pattern was observed. Motion was, however, clearly perceived for all repetition periods when presented in non-rivalrous conditions (green dot-dashed line). Error bars are between-subject standard errors. The vertical Gaussian profile represents the estimated size of the temporal limit (363±11 ms; mean±s.e.m over experiments 1-5).
