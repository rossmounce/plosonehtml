Landings from Palma de Mallorca fishing harbor (purple ship) are included as supporting information (<a href="#pone.0001431.s005">Figure S5</a>). Moorings in the Cap de Creus Canyon (red circle) and in the basin (green square), and the Wavescan buoy deployed at 1200 m water depth off Palamós (black triangle) are also shown. Pale blue arrows indicate the pathway of the dense shelf water cascading mechanism extending from the Gulf of Lions along and across the continental slope, and the faded pink area represents the region affected by the thermo-haline and turbidity anomaly observed in the Western Mediterranean Deep Water after the 1999 and 2005 major cascading events. Both phenomena are inferred from published data <a href="#pone.0001431-Merino1">[27]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001431-Salat1">[33]</a>.</p>
