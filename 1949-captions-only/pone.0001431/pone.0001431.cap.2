(D–G) Daily landings of <em>Aristeus antennatus</em> at the studied harbors are plotted as red bar charts, ordered from northeast (Roses) to southwest (Arenys de Mar). (H) Downward mass fluxes recorded at 2100 m depth by the sediment trap moored in the basin at 2350 m depth (i.e. 250 m above bottom) are illustrated by the orange bar chart.
