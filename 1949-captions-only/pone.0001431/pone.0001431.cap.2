                Figure 2.  Mooring time series and daily catches.(A–C) Current speed (A), temperature (B) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) (C), recorded in the Cap de Creus Canyon at 500 m depth (placed at 5 m above bottom), before, during and after the cascading event of winter 2005. (D–G) Daily landings of Aristeus antennatus at the studied harbors are plotted as red bar charts, ordered from northeast (Roses) to southwest (Arenys de Mar). (H) Downward mass fluxes recorded at 2100 m depth by the sediment trap moored in the basin at 2350 m depth (i.e. 250 m above bottom) are illustrated by the orange bar chart. See locations in Figure 1.
