Captures show a marked pattern of intra-annual variability with higher landings in spring-summer and lower landings in autumn, which has been attributed to reproductive displacements of the population <a href="#pone.0001431-Sard2">[19]</a>. The pale yellow band shows the period affected by the temporary fishery collapse caused by the winter 2005 dense shelf water cascading event, disrupting the intra-annual variability of precedent years.</p>
