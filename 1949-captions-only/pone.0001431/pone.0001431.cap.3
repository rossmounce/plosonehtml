                Figure 3.  Intra-annual variability of daily catches.(A and B) Daily landings of Aristeus antennatus since 2001 at Palam√≥s (A) and Blanes (B), the most representative studied harbors. Captures show a marked pattern of intra-annual variability with higher landings in spring-summer and lower landings in autumn, which has been attributed to reproductive displacements of the population [19]. The pale yellow band shows the period affected by the temporary fishery collapse caused by the winter 2005 dense shelf water cascading event, disrupting the intra-annual variability of precedent years.
