                Figure 4.  Temporal evolution of annual landings.(Aâ€“D) Available annual landings of Aristeus antennatus at the studied harbors since 1977. Green dashed lines indicate years when strong cascading events occurred. A similar temporal evolution of landings can be observed in all harbors, with an increasing trend and a peak of captures between 3 and 5 years after the cascading events (pale yellow bands).
