                Figure 5.  Temporal evolution in population structure.(Aâ€“D) Estimation of the abundance of small (continuous red line) and large (dotted blue line) individuals of Aristeus antennatus derived from the annual landings in the studied harbors. Green dashed lines indicate the years when major cascading events occurred. The temporal evolution of the population structure of Aristeus antennatus in all harbors was linked to those cascading events. The number of small individuals increased two and three years after the event, prior the increase in the number of large individuals, indicating that cascading events enhance the recruitment process of this species.
