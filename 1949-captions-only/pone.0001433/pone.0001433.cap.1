A: Concentration of rotenone in the plasma was determined on an HPLC system from 200 µl of blood samples drawn from the tail vein from 4 rats every week for 60 days. Values are given with standard deviation (SD). B: Rat brain coronal sections at the level of SN were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibody against α-synuclein or ubiquitin. Left panel, Lewy body-like cytoplasmic inclusions in SN neurons (arrows). Scale bar is 10 µm. Right panels, images at a higher magnification. C: The rat SN sections were stained with antibody specific for 8-oxo-dG. Oxidatively modified DNA appeared in green. Nuclei were stained in blue with DAPI. The image shows the damage to both mitochondrial DNA (left arrow) and nuclear DNA (right arrow) in SN neurons. Scale bar is 15 µm.</p>
