Control rats were injected with PBS. After the expression of the Ndi1 protein has been established, microspheres containing rotenone were injected subcutaneously. For control, microspheres with PBS were used. Thirty or 60 days later, brains were collected for analysis. A: After 30 days of rotenone exposure, brain sections at the level of SN were stained for the NADH dehydrogenase (diaphorase) activity. The right SN that received the <em>NDI1</em> gene showed high NADH dehydrogenase as revealed by dense staining in both rotenone-treated (b) and PBS-treated (a) group. Non-NDI1 control rats did not exhibit discernible staining (c and d). B: Brain sections from the same groups of rats as A were double-stained for TH (red) and the Ndi1 protein (green). The staining intensities across the right SN (<em>NDI1</em> injection side) and the left SN are plotted in arbitrary units below each set of the images. Each picture displays a representative section of an animal from each group. C: Rats expressing the Ndi1 protein (NDI1) and non-NDI1 control group (Ctl) were treated with rotenone (Rot) for 60 days and immunohistochemical staining for TH staining were carried out as in B. The fluorescence images of the brain sections were collected and the staining intensity of TH from the left and the right SN was statistically analyzed (student T-test) using ImageJ <a href="#pone.0001433-Abramoff1">[39]</a>. Note that the right SN received the <em>NDI1</em> injection. The number of sections used was; Ctl (n = 6), Ctl+Rot (n = 9), NDI1 (n = 18) and NDI1+Rot (n = 18). Images in each group were collected from evenly spaced sections that cover the entire SN in which the presence of the Ndi1 protein was detected. Error bars represent standard deviation. D: Levels of TH staining in the left and right striatum from the same four groups of rats as in C are compared. The right striatum is ipsilateral to the SN expressing the Ndi1 protein. Representative images of DAB staining of TH are given in <a href="#pone.0001433.s002">Figure S2</a>. The number of sections used for analysis was; Ctl (n = 6), Ctl+Rot (n = 9), NDI1 (n = 9) and NDI1+Rot (n = 18). Error bars represent standard deviation.</p>
