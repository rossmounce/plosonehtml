A: Sections were subjected to Nissl staining and representative images are displayed (upper panel). The number of viable neurons was compared between the left and right SN by counting Nissl-positive cells in a given area of the SN (lower panel). The number of sections used for analysis was; control (2 animals, 3 sections), control+rotenone (5 animals, 12 sections) and NDI1+rotenone (9 animals, 9 sections). In each group, images were collected from the sections with the matching anterior-posterior position and, when multiple sections were used in a given animal, they were separated by at least 30 Âµm to eliminate possible span of neuron cell bodies over multiple sections. B: Sections were stained for 8-oxo-dG to evaluate oxidative damage to DNA (upper panel). The SN neurons that are positively stained were counted (lower panel). The number of sections used for analysis was; control (2 animals, 3 sections), control+rotenone (3 animals, 5 sections) and NDI1+rotenone (3 animals, 6 sections). Selection of the sections was done as described in A. Statistic analysis was done using student T-test. Error bars represent standard deviation.</p>
