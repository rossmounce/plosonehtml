The striatal portions of unfixed brains were dissected and homogenized. Samples were analyzed for dopamine contents on an HPLC system coupled with an electrochemical detector. The dopamine contents were determined for the left and right hemisphere from the four groups, Ctl (n = 3), Ctl+Rot (n = 8), NDI1 (n = 3) and NDI1+Rot (n = 11). n = number of animals. All values are presented with standard deviation.</p>
