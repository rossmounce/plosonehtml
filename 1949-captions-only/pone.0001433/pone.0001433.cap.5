                Figure 5.  Behavioral tests of rotenone-exposed rats.Rotenone exposure was carried out as described in Figure 2. Each rat was placed in a round bucket after apomorphine administration and the movement was video-taped for 30 min. Data were analyzed for the four groups; Ctl (n = 3), Ctl+Rot (n = 14), NDI1 (n = 5) and NDI1+Rot (n = 20). n = number of animals. A: Speed of movement of rats was calculated as the number of full turns per minute. B: The number of rats exhibiting fully lateralized turning in either direction was counted. Histograms represent percentage of animals turning only in one direction. (*: p&lt;0.05; **: p&lt;0.01). All values are presented with standard deviation.
