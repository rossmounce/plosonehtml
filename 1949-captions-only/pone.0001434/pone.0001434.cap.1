Rasl11b has no obvious orthologues in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> or <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, but is highly conserved among vertebrates. Note that, in contrast to most of the Ras small GTPases, Rasl11b lacks a COOH-terminal CAAX motif and any known recognition signal for C-terminal lipidation found in Ras proteins such as farnesylation or palmitoylation allowing membrane anchorage. The amino acid positions mutated to create the activated forms Rasl11b<sup>S42V</sup> and Rasl11b<sup>Q82L</sup> are indicated with stars. (B) Phylogenic analysis of zebrafish small GTPase proteins. The degree of relatedness is indicated by the length of the vertical lines. Numbers indicate bootstrap support for nodes. Red box: Rasl11b, Rasl11a, Rasl12 and Rerg constitute an uncharacterized branch of Ras proteins devoid of lipid modification signals.
