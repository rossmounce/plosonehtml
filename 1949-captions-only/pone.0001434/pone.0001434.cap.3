The Oep coreceptor is necessary for the binding of the Nodal ligand Cyc and Sqt to the TGFβ receptors (containing the type I receptor Taram-A, the zebrafish Alk4 orthologue) that in turn phosphorylate Smad2. Smad2-P is translocated to the nucleus and triggers the transcription of a first set of genes encoding the transcription factors, Mixer, Gata5 and Mezzo. This set is required for the expression of the Sox factor Casanova that in turn initiates the transcription of the endodermal markers <em>sox17</em> and <em>axial</em>/<em>foxa2</em>. (B–M, Dorsal view of gastrulae save C, I, sagittal sections and G, lateral view) (B, C) In wild-type (WT) embryos <em>rasl11b</em> is expressed at the animal pole (arrows) and at the dorsal margin (black arrowheads). (D) This marginal expression is lost in MZ<em>oep</em> mutants (star), devoid of maternal and zygotic <em>oep</em>, consequently devoid of Nodal signaling, and so, unable to form most of the mesendoderm. (E, F) <em>rasl11b</em> dorso-marginal expression is normal in the <em>cyclops</em> Nodal mutant and largely reduced in the MZ<em>squint</em> Nodal mutant. (G) Activation of the Nodal signal by injection of a constitutively activated form of the Nodal type I receptor Taram-A (tar*) leads to a duplication of the <em>rasl11b</em> marginal expression domain (likely by inducing a second organizer, white arrowheads) (H, I) In Z<em>oep</em> mutants, devoid of zygotic <em>oep</em>, this mesendodermal expression domain is extended (white arrowheads). (J–M) A large series of embryos expressing different levels of Nodal signal was generated by injecting between blastula cells increasing doses of the recombinant Lefty protein, a Nodal pathway extracellular inhibitor. Here, only four representative doses are displayed. A progressive decrease of <em>rasl11b</em> marginal expression but no expansion was observed, even with concentrations of Lefty able to mimic a Z<em>oep</em>-like phenotype.</p>
