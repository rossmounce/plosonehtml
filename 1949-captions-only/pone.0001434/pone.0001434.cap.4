The Morpholino targeted sequences are represented by thin red lines. The red boxes correspond to the G1 to G5 domains described in <a href="#pone-0001434-g001">Fig. 1</a>. (Bâ€“D) Lateral view of 1 dpf embryos. Both <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG and <em>rasl11b</em> MO-GT induce a curly tail down phenotype when injected in WT. This phenotype can be rescued by the coinjection of <em>rasl11b</em> mRNA resistant to MO knock down, <em>rasl11b<sup>MOr</sup></em> (D). (E) In vitro translational assay showing the efficient knock down effect of the <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG on wild-type <em>rasl11b</em> mRNA compared to the MO resistant <em>rasl11b<sup>MOr</sup></em> mRNA. (F,G) <em>rasl11b</em> splice-blocking morpholino (<em>rasl11b</em> MO-GT) knocks down endogenous <em>rasl11b</em> mRNA. RT-PCR analysis detected two splice variants that were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison revealed that the splice variant (1) resulted from aberrant splicing to an upstream cryptic slice donor site that is present in intron 2, resulting in an early frame shift. The splice variant (2) only missed exon 2 but is not functional (data not shown).</p>
