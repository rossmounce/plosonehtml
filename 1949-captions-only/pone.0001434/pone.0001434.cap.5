Depending on the quantity of <em>oep</em> mRNA accumulated during oogenesis, Z<em>oep</em> embryos display different levels of anterior structure development: from absence of lens and forebrain (red class, B), via a cyclopia phenotype (green class, C) to two separate retinae (blue class, D, very rare). In each clutch, these categories can have slightly different proportions depending on the female, but a large majority of Z<em>oep</em> embryos do not even develop one retina. Whatever females (n&gt;10) were used for the <em>rasl11b</em> knock down experiments, a drastic rescue (&gt;70%) of the forebrain formation was always observed, and a large category of embryos with two retinae appeared. (E) Cumulated numbers for each class from 5 independent <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG knock down experiments. (F–H) <em>forkhead7</em> (<em>fkd7</em>) expression pattern in 1 dpf embryos. Gut defects (white arrowheads) are also rescued (black arrowheads) in Z<em>oep</em> embryos injected by <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG. (I–L) 1 dpf embryos lateral views. Rasl11b constitutively activated forms (Rasl11b*) prevent head formation and disturb the antero-posterior axis formation in Z<em>oep</em> and <em>oep</em><sup>+/−</sup> but not in wild-type embryos (not shown). <em>zrx2</em> is expressed in the retina, <em>krox20</em> in rhombomeres 3 and 5, <em>myod</em> is expressed in the somitic mesoderm. (M–V) dorsal view of late gastrulae. <em>rasl11b</em> knock down rescues expression of the prechordal plate marker <em>goosecoid</em> (<em>gsc</em>) and the endodermal marker <em>sox17</em> in Z<em>oep</em> whereas Rasl11b* reduces their expression in Z<em>oep</em> and <em>oep</em><sup>+/−</sup> embryos.</p>
