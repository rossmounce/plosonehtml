The Z<em>oep</em> mutant was the only one rescued by the <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG injection. This rescue was abolished by co-injection of <em>rasl11b</em> MO-resistant mRNA (<em>rasl11b<sup>MOr</sup></em>). Error bars indicate standard deviation. (B, C) It is impossible to generate clutches of 100% Z<em>oep</em> embryos, and because one embryo cannot give enough material for both immunoblot and genotyping experiments, 100% Z<em>oep-</em>like mutant clutches were produced by injecting clutches of 100% MZ<em>oep</em> eggs with low doses of wild-type <em>oep</em> mRNA. Half of them were then co-injected with <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG. Each batch was split in two, one used for phosphorylated Smad2 (Smad2-P) level analysis, the second for endodermal cell number count (assayed by sox17 in situ hybridization). Proteins were detected by western blotting using a Smad2-P antibody. Note that increasing doses of wild-type <em>oep</em> mRNA were correlated with an increase of Smad2-P and <em>sox17</em> endodermal cell number, whereas co-injection with <em>rasl11b</em> MO-ATG increased endodermal cell number without generating more Smad2-P (Error bars indicate standard deviation). The same experiment was done at three pregastrula stages: dome (B), sphere and 40% epiboly (C).</p>
