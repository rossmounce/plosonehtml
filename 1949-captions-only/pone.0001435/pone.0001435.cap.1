                Figure 1.  Genomic location of eQTLs.Bone marrow derived macrophage eQTLs with LOD≥3.0 were mapped to partially overlapping 20 Mb bins in female (A) and male (B) F2 mice. The horizontal dotted line denotes the arbitrary cutoff for eQTL hotspots. eQTLs for sex biased transcripts with LOD≥3.0 were mapped to partially overlapping 20 Mb bins in female (C) and male (D) F2 mice.
