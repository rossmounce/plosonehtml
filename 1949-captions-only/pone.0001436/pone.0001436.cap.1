Binding is expressed as the percent of the wildtype derepressed value (set to 100%) after normalization to the <em>TEL</em> negative control locus. Error bars represent the standard deviation of biological replicates (two or more). Data is shown at 4 hours of derepression. H: ChIP analysis for Taf1 in repressing (grey bars) and derepressing (four hours, black bars) conditions. Error bars represent technical replicates. Inset: ChIP analysis by PCR at for Taf1 at <em>ACT1</em>. The protein(s) assayed for in each case is listed in <a href="#pone-0001436-t002">Table 2</a>.</p>
