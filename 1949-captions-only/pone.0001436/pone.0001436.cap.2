The position of each amplicon (referenced to the middle of each amplicon) within the promoter is shown on the x-axis, with approximate location of nucleosomes shown. (A) and (C) are the results at <em>ADH2,</em> (B) and (D) are at <em>FBP1</em>. (A) and (B) compare NuSA results of <em>Δadr1 (</em>pink) and <em>Δcat8</em> (green) in derepressed conditions to a wildtype strain either in repressed (dark blue) or derepressed (light blue) conditions. (C) and (D) compare NuSA results between over-expression of Adr1 with (red) or without Cat8 (blue) in derepressed conditions.</p>
