                Figure 2.  Differential roles for Adr1 and Cat8 in chromatin remodeling at ADH2 and FBP1.NuSA results are displayed as the amount of relative protection, after normalization to the well-positioned nucleosome at CEN3. The position of each amplicon (referenced to the middle of each amplicon) within the promoter is shown on the x-axis, with approximate location of nucleosomes shown. (A) and (C) are the results at ADH2, (B) and (D) are at FBP1. (A) and (B) compare NuSA results of Δadr1 (pink) and Δcat8 (green) in derepressed conditions to a wildtype strain either in repressed (dark blue) or derepressed (light blue) conditions. (C) and (D) compare NuSA results between over-expression of Adr1 with (red) or without Cat8 (blue) in derepressed conditions.
