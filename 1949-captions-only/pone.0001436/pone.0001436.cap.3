                Figure 3.  Adr1 and Cat8 play different roles at ADH2 and FBP1.Comparison between the ADH2 (A and C, orange) and FBP1 (B and D, blue) promoters in either adr1Δ (A and B) or a cat8Δ (C and D). Combined expression, recruitment and chromatin remodeling data at 4 hours of derepression are shown. Values in parenthesis indicate the percent binding of the wild-type derepressed value, after normalization (an asterisk represents previously published data [9]). Gene activation is reported as the percent of the wild-type derepressed level. Binding sites are shown at their approximate locations along the promoter (Cat8 in green, Adr1 in pink, and TATA box in blue). Nucleosome positions under derepressed conditions are depicted as shaded ovals on the promoter, and the degree of chromatin remodeling estimated as a percent of the remodeling observed in a wild-type strain. Locations of coactivators are not intended to reflect interactions.
