                Figure 1.  Experimental design.All Experiments tested unimodal (auditory only, first column, or visual only, second column), multisensory (congruent auditory-visual, third column) and incongruent or intersensory auditory-visual conditions (auditory intersensory, fourth column and visual intersensory fifth column). In the control conditions, the target (4th stimulus in a stream of five stimuli) differed from the standards (stimulus 1, 2, 3 and 5; all 500 ms) in duration only. In the test conditions, the target differed from the standards in both feature and duration. In Experiment 1 (‘Loom’, first row) and Experiment 2 (‘Recede’, second row), the same control conditions were used, where standards were 500 ms discs or pure tones in visual and auditory displays, respectively. In the Loom tests, auditory standards were 500 ms pure tones, and auditory targets were upward going FM sweeps of varying duration; visual standards were 500 ms discs and visual targets were looming discs of different duration; auditory and visual conditions were combined in the multisensory condition. In the Recede tests, the target was a downward going FM sweep or a receding disc in the auditory and visual sensory modalities, respectively. In the control of Experiment 3 (‘Reverse’, third row), the auditory standards were upward FM sweeps and the visual standards were 500 ms looming discs. In the Reverse tests, the oddballs were a steady disc and a pure tone of variable duration in visual and auditory displays, respectively. The Loom, Recede and Reverse intersensory conditions consisted in presenting congruent auditory-visual standards but incongruent auditory-visual targets. An oddball was introduced in the sensory modality which was to be ignored. In the auditory intersensory conditions, participants evaluated the auditory target while neglecting visual inputs; conversely, in the visual intersensory conditions, participants evaluated the visual target while ignoring the auditory inputs. In the Loom auditory (first row, fourth column) and visual intersensory (first row, fifth column) conditions, the oddball was a looming disc and an upward FM sweep, respectively. In the Recede auditory (second row, fourth column) and visual intersensory (second row, fifth column) conditions, the oddball was a receding or a downward FM sweep, respectively. In the Reverse auditory (third row, fourth column) and visual intersensory (third row, fifth column) conditions, the oddball was a steady disc or a tone, respectively.
