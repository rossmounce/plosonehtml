                Figure 2.  Subjective duration distortions in auditory, visual and congruent auditory-visual presentations.The points of subjective equality (PSE) were computed from the individuals' psychometric curves obtained in the control and test conditions. On the left hand-side, we report the obtained PSE for each experiment and auditory (blue), visual (green) and auditory-visual (red) conditions. On the right-hand side, we report the difference between the PSE obtained in a given test condition (e.g. visual test) and the PSE obtained in the associated control condition (e.g. visual control). In the relative PSE graphs, a positive shift of PSE indicates ‘subjective time compression’, thereby a given stimulus in the test condition is perceived as shorter than would actually be perceived by the participant in the control condition; conversely, a negative shift in PSE indicates ‘subjective time dilation’. Error bars are standard-errors of the mean. In the Loom experiment (first row), subjective time expansion is systematically observed in auditory (blue bar), visual (green bar) and congruent auditory-visual (red bar) presentations. In the Recede experiment (second row), no significant shift of PSE was observed. In the Reverse experiment (third row), both visual (green) and congruent auditory-visual (red) presentations led to a significant compression of subjective duration. No such effect was observed in the auditory (blue bar) condition. These results highlight both similarities and asymmetries in the distortion of subjective durations across sensory modalities.
