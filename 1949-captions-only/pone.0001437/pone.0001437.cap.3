                Figure 3.  Subjective duration distortions in intersensory conditions (incongruent auditory-visual presentations).The PSE for the auditory (blue) intersensory conditions and the visual (green) intersensory conditions and their relevant control conditions (gray) are reported in the left panel as ‘absolute PSE’. The PSE differences between the intersensory conditions and their possible controls are reported in the right panels as ‘Relative PSE’. The corrected t-tests values are reported in the adjacent table for auditory and visual intersensory conditions in all three Experiments. The PSE obtained in a given intersensory (e.g. auditory intersensory) condition could be compared with (i) the auditory control (Ac), (ii) the visual test (V), (iii) the auditory-visual test (AV) or (iii) the auditory-visual control (AVc). A positive shift of PSE indicates ‘subjective time compression’ and a negative shift in PSE indicates ‘subjective time expansion’. Error bars are standard-errors of the mean. In Loom (first row), subjective time expansion is observed in the auditory intersensory condition when compared to the unisensory presentations (Ac, blue and V, green) and the congruent AV test (red); in the visual intersensory condition, no effect was observed suggesting that vision captures auditory duration but not the opposite. In Recede (second row), no significant intersensory effects were observed in either auditory or visual intersensory conditions. In Reverse (third row), the visual oddball captures auditory duration towards compression (blue bar) whereas the auditory oddball captures visual duration towards expansion (green bar). The auditory intersensory condition significantly differed from Ac, AV and AVc; the visual intersensory condition significantly differed from Vc and AV. These results provide evidence that visual information influences auditory temporal perception, but that the converse is surprisingly seldom observed.
