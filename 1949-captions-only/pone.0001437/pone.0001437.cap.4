                Figure 4.  Forced-fusion model: comparison between predicted and observed PSE in congruent and incongruent auditory-visual presentations.In each graph, the black bars indicate the “estimated”, and the red bar, the “observed” PSE. The adjacent table reports the results of paired t-tests between predicted and observed PSE. In the congruent AV presentations (left column) and for all three experiments, the predictions of the forced-fusion Bayesian model did not significantly differ from the observed PSE. In the incongruent conditions (right column), the model fails to predict the perceptual outcomes observed in the auditory intersensory conditions of the Loom and the Reverse experiments. Additional comparisons between predicted and observed variances in these conditions are provided as Supplementary Material in Figure S3.
