                Figure 5.  Variance in uni- and multi-sensory observed data.We report the variance for the tests (gray) and controls (black) of the auditory, visual and auditory-visual conditions in the Loom (top row), Recede (middle row) and Reverse (bottom row) experiments. No significant differences of variance were observed between tests and controls within each modality of presentation. Bars indicate standard-errors of the mean.
