                Figure 6.  Variance in intersensory observed data.Variance for the auditory intersensory (blue, left column) and visual intersensory (green, right column) conditions are reported along with their respective control conditions (gray) in each experiment. The tables indicate the significant variance effects between the test and possible control conditions. A significant increase of variance was observed in the auditory intersensory conditions with respect to variance in auditory control, visual test, multisensory control and test conditions in all Experiments to the exception of the visual test in the Reverse condition. A significant increase of variance was observed in the visual intersensory conditions of the Loom and Recede experiments with respect to the auditory, multisensory test and control. In all experiments, no difference was observed between the visual intersensory and the visual control conditions and all possible control conditions in the Reverse experiment. Bars indicate standard-errors of the mean.
