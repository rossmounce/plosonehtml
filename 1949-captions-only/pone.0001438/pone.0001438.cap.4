                Figure 4.  a. Results of the sensitivity analysis of the mean worm burden per individual at (a) 20°C.Each parameter was varied up to 10 times the value in the baseline model and the impact on the parasite population was assessed as the Log10 of the mean worm burden or prevalence following the adjustment divided by the value obtained using the baseline parameter values. b. Results of the sensitivity analysis of the mean worm burden per individual at 20°C and 35°C.
