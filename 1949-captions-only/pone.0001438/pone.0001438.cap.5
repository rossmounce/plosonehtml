                Figure 5.  Impact of temperature on the efficacy of different control programmes:(1) targeting only the adult parasites by mass chemotherapy (achieved by doubling δP from the baseline value); (2) targeting only the snail intermediate vectors through molluscicide application (by doubling δJ and δS); (3) improved sanitation (by halving λM); (4) combining intermediate vector control with mass chemotherapy and (5) combining intermediate vector control, mass chemotherapy and improved sanitation. The efficacy of control was measured as the Log10 of the mean parasite abundance during the control phase divided by the mean abundance in the absence of control.
