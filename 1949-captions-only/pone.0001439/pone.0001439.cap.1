                Figure 1.  Simulated present and potential future ranges of Locustella                                 naevia.(a) Simulated distribution of Locustella naevia                             (Grasshopper Warbler) in Europe for the ‘present’                             (1961–90) climate. Blue symbols represent grid squares                             simulated as suitable, yellow symbols grid squares simulated as                             unsuitable, and white areas of the map regions with climatic conditions                             unlike those anywhere where data for the species are available in the                             EBCC dataset [6]. The red star indicates the position                             of the centroid of the species' simulated range. The response                             surface model has a ‘high’ performance                             (AUC = 0·952) as assessed by                             its ability to describe the observed distribution as recorded in the                             EBCC atlas [6]. (b) Simulated potential distribution                             of Locustella naevia in Europe for the HadCM3 B2 future                             climate scenario (2070–99). Blue and yellow symbols, and white                             areas of the map, as in (a). For this climate scenario the                             species' potential future range extent, in terms of potentially                             suitable grid squares, is 66% of the extent of its simulated                             present range. The area of overlap of the simulated future potential and                             present ranges is 37% of the extent of the latter. The red                             star indicates the position of the centroid of the species'                             simulated potential future range; the red star outline indicates the                             position of the centroid of the species' simulated range for                             the ‘present’ climate. The line joining these two                             stars, length D (808 km), represents the geodesic path                             between the two centroids. Also plotted is a line indicating the                             direction of north (N) from the centroid of the species'                             simulated range for the ‘present’ climate; the angle                                 θ (10·6°) between north                             and the geodesic path between the two centroids is the initial azimuth                             of the geodesic path.
