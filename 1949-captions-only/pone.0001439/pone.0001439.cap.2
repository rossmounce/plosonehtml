                Figure 2.  Polar plots of potential range centroid displacement.The distance and direction of each species' potential range                             centroid displacement (see Figure 1) is illustrated for the six potential future                             climate scenarios, each point in each plot representing an individual                             species. The radial distance from the centre of the plot at which a                             point is located indicates the geodesic distance (D)                             between the centroids of its simulated present and potential future                             ranges; the angular position of a point indicates the initial azimuth                                 (θ) of the geodesic path between the                             present and potential future range centroids as a bearing relative to                             North (0°). The same logarithmic scale is used to plot radial                             distances in all six plots; the centre point of each plot represents a                             geodesic distance of 20 km, whilst their circumferences correspond to a                             distance of 3750 km.
