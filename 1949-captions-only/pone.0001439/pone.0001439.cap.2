The radial distance from the centre of the plot at which a                             point is located indicates the geodesic distance (<em>D</em>)                             between the centroids of its simulated present and potential future                             ranges; the angular position of a point indicates the initial azimuth                                 (<em>θ</em>) of the geodesic path between the                             present and potential future range centroids as a bearing relative to                             North (0°). The same logarithmic scale is used to plot radial                             distances in all six plots; the centre point of each plot represents a                             geodesic distance of 20 km, whilst their circumferences correspond to a                             distance of 3750 km.</p>
