                Figure 3.  Overlap vs relative extent of potential future range.The percentage of the present simulated range that is projected to remain                             climatically suitable is plotted against the extent of the future                             potential range expressed as a percentage of the simulated present                             range. Each point represents one of the ten bird species endemic to                             Europe (red diamonds) or one of the 30 species that are nearly so (blue                             squares) for which models could be fitted. Numbers identify species (see                             Table below). Results shown are for the HadCM3 B2 scenario. The size of                             the symbols is proportional to the log of the simulated present range                             extent. Dashed lines indicate the ‘no-change’ value                             of 100% for overlap and relative extent. Zones with overlap                             and/or relative extent &lt;50% are shaded and bounded by                             dotted lines. The dot-dashed line bounds the zone with overlap                             &lt;10%.
