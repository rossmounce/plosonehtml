                Figure 2.  Genome-wide GCI Score Distribution.Histogram displaying the frequency of scores observed in the analysis of genes at 3 different time points after the release of the first draft of the human genome sequence. Genes based only on predictions and/or EST sequences have been removed (~3000 genes in 2007 data).
