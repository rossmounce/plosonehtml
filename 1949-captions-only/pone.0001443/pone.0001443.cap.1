Then, they were treated with or without 0.5 mM of 8Br-cAMP for 15 minutes. Progesterone (P4) was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described <a href="#pone.0001443-Castillo1">[41]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001443-CornejoMaciel1">[60]</a> (a, p&lt;0.05 vs. control; b, p&lt;0.05 vs. 8Br-cAMP alone). MA-10 cells were also transfected by electroporation using two plasmids, bearing the sequence of wild-type or a mutated form of ERK2 (H230R). Data are expressed as means±SD of three independent experiments. c, p&lt;0.05 vs. control transfection pRc/CMVi-GFP; d, p&lt;0.05 vs. transfected cells+8Br-cAMP; e, p&lt;0.05 vs. wild-type ERK2). After the incubation with or without 10 µM of U0126, MA-10 cells were stimulated with 0.5 mM of 8Br-cAMP (B) or 10 ng/ml of EGF (C) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described <a href="#pone.0001443-Castillo1">[41]</a>, with specific antibodies against pERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 sequentially. The immunoblots show a representative result of three independent experiments. The intensity of the bands was quantitated using total ERK1/2 as loading control. Bars denote relative levels of pERK1/2 presence in arbitrary units. Data are expressed as means±SD of three independent experiments. **, p&lt;0.01 vs. 0 min.</p>
