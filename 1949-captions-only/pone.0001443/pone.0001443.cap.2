Next, subcellular fractions were obtained and 40 Âµg of the total protein of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot to detect pERK1/2 (indicated with pERK1/2 in A, B, and C). After stripping, total ERK1/2 (indicated with ERK1/2 in A, B, and C) was detected in the same membrane. The Western blots show the results of a representative experiment performed three times. D shows the quantification, performed as described in <a href="#pone-0001443-g001">Figure 1</a>. **, p&lt;0.01, *, p&lt;0.05 vs. time 0.
