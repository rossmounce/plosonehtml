Cytosolic and mitochondrial pMEK1/2 contents were analyzed by Western blot. A mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase (Acot2), the 39 kDa subunit of the NADH-cytochrome c reductase (complex I) and cytosolic β-tubulin detection were used as loading control. The immunoblots show a representative result of three independent experiments. Bars denote levels of pMEK1/2 (black bars) and total MEK1/2 (grey bars) relative to β-tubulin (cytosolic fractions), Acot2 (mitochondrial fractions- 8Br-cAMP treatments) or complex I (mitochondrial fractions – EGF treatments) in arbitrary units. Data are expressed as means±SD of three independent experiments. * p&lt;0.05 vs. 0 min; **, p&lt;0.01 vs. 0 min. (B) Mitochondrial pERK1/2 and pMEK1/2 contents were analyzed in mitochondria obtained from MA-10 cells stimulated with or without 0.5 mM 8Br-cAMP for varying times, in the presence or absence of 20 µM of H-89, an inhibitor of PKA activity. Acot2 detection was used as loading control in pMEK1/2 and total MEK1/2 western blots. The panel shows a representative immunoblot from three independent experiments. (C) MA-10 cells were transiently transfected with 100 nM siRNA against the α isoform of the PKA catalytic subunit, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After transfection, the cells were incubated with or without 0.5 mM of 8Br-cAMP for varying times and the contents of mitochondrial pMEK1/2, total MEK1/2, α isoform of the PKA catalytic subunit and the 39 kDa subunit of the NADH-cytochrome c reductase (complex I) were analyzed by western blot. This is a representative experiment from three separate experiments. (D) MA-10 cells were transiently transfected as described in (C) and stimulated with 8Br-cAMP for 15 and 30 minutes. pERK1/2 activity was measured using a pERK1/2 (pThr185/pTyr187) ELISA kit (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Bars represent the pERK1/2 activity as means±SD (n = 3). a, p&lt;0.05, mock-transfected and 8Br-cAMP-treated cells (15 min) vs. mock-transfected and non-8Br-cAMP-treated cells (0 min); b, p&lt;0.05, PKA catalytic subunit siRNA–transfected and 8Br-cAMP-treated (15 min) cells vs. mock-transfected and 8Br-cAMP-treated cells (15 min). (E) PKA activity in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions isolated from MA-10 cells incubated with 0.5 mM 8Br-cAMP for varying times. Bars represent radioactivity incorporated into the kemptide-specific PKA synthetic substrate. The PKA assay was performed as previously described <a href="#pone.0001443-Paz1">[61]</a>. Data are expressed as means±SD (n = 3). **, p&lt;0.01, * p&lt;0.05 vs. 0 min.</p>
