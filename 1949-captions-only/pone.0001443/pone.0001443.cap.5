After the phosphorylation assays, phosphorylated protein levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. (C) StAR was phosphorylated by His-tagged wild type ERK1 in the presence of cholesterol as mentioned above. The phosphorylated product was subjected to limited digestion with endoprotease V8 as previously described <a href="#pone.0001443-Krueger1">[8]</a>. Peptides were analyzed by gels as described by Shagger and Von Jagow <a href="#pone.0001443-Schagger1">[62]</a> and by autoradiography. The box indicates the amino acid sequence of the 6 kDa peptide, where the Ser<sup>232</sup> is underlined. (D) The wild type and a mutated form (S232A) of StAR were used in the <em>in vitro</em> phosphorylation assay described in (A). The phosphorylated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results in panels A, B, C, and D are representative of three independently performed experiments. (E) MA-10 cells were transfected by electroporation with an empty vector (pRc/CMVi) or with the vector containing the full length cDNAs of 37 kDa wild type StAR (wt), S232A StAR (S232A) or S232E StAR (S232E). The cells were stimulated with 0.5 mM of 8Br-cAMP for 30 minutes. P4 production was evaluated by determination of P4 concentrations in the incubation media by RIA. Data are expressed as means±SD (n = 3). *, p&lt;0.05 S232A StAR vs. wt StAR.</p>
