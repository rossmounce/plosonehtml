                Figure 1.  Relationships between prevalence of pathogens (% of individuals with pathogens) and the presence or absence of antibiotics in plasma of nestlings of three vulture species from central Spain.Differences were statistically significant in the griffon (Fisher exact tests, P = 0.001), cinereous (G-tests, G = 18.198, d.f. = 1, P&lt;0.0001) and Egyptian (G-tests, G = 11.778, d.f. = 1, P = 0.001) vultures. Sample size is shown above bars.
