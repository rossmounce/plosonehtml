(B) Telomerase activity in the same sets of cells treated with tranylcypromine (Trans) at 100 µM (for A549, HeLa and SW756) or 50 µM (for SiHa) as in (A). Telomerase activity was assessed using a telomerase PCR ELISA kit and arbitrarily expressed as absorbance (OD450–OD690). Columns: Relative telomerase activity; Bars: SD. (C) The western blot analysis of global histone H3 acetylation, H3-K4, and H3-K9 mono-, di- and tri-methylation in HeLa and SiHa cells treated with tranylcypromine (Trans). Pansus staining was shown for equal histone protein loads. (D) The increased histone H3-K4(M2) and H3 acetylation at the hTERT proximal promoter in tranylcypromine-treated HeLa and SiHa cells. Representative ChIP results were shown.</p>
