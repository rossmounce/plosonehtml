RT-PCR for LSD1 mRNA was shown to verify efficient depletion of LSD1 expression in those cells. The lower panel further demonstrated an inhibition of LSD1 expression at protein levels in HeLa and SiHa cells treated with LSD1 siRNA. WB: Western blot. (B) The enhanced telomerase activity in HeLa and SiHa cells with LSD1 depletion. (C) The western blot analysis of global histone H3 acetylation, H3-K4, and H3-K9 mono-, di- and tri-methylation in HeLa and SiHa cells transfected with LSD1 specific siRNA. Pansus staining was shown for equal histone protein loads. (D) The abolishment of LSD1 concomitant with the increased H3-K4(M2) and H3 acetylation at the hTERT proximal promoter in LSD1-depleted HeLa and SiHa cells. Representative ChIP results were shown. C and L: Control and LSD1 siRNA, respectively.</p>
