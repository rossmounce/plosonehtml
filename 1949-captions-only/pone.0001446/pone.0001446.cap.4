                Figure 4.  The recruitment of LSD1 to the hTERT proximal promoter concomitant with repression of hTERT transcription in the differentiated HL60 cells.(A) The down-regulation of hTERT mRNA expression in HL60 cells undergoing terminal differentiation induced by DMSO treatment. (B) The presence of LSD1 concomitant with a loss of H3-K4(M2) at the hTERT proximal promoter region in differentiated but not undifferentiated HL60 cells. Control: Undifferentiated HL60 cells and DMSO: DMSO-induced differentiated HL60 cells.
