                Figure 1.  Identification and characterization of D-cbl mutants.(A) Wild-type (WT) fly showing normal eye phenotype. (B) GMR-hid ey-FLP (GheF) small eye phenotype. (C,D) GheF;D-cblK26 and GheF;D-cbl7 mosaics significantly suppress the GMR-hid small eye phenotype. Genotype: GheF; D-cbl FRT80/P[w+] FRT80 (E,G) Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of wild-type adult eye (E) and head (G). (F,H) ey-FLP/Minute-induced mosaics of D-cblK26 display rough eyes (F) and enlarged heads (H). Genotype: ey-FLP; D-cblK26 FRT80/M(3)i55 FRT80. (I,J) Eye-antennal discs of 3rd instar larvae of D-cblK26 mosaics (I) are larger compared to wild-type (J). Scale bar 20um. (K) Domain structure of long (L) and short (S) isoforms of D-cbl. The relative locations of three non-sense mutations and two missense mutations in D-Cbl are indicated. D-cblL31 and D-cbl7 affect the same residue in the RING domain. TKB-Tyrosine Kinase binding domain; Lâ€“Linker; RF-RING finger; UBA-ubiquitin-associated domain.
