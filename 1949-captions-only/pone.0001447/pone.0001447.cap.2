                Figure 2.  Genetic interaction between D-cbl and the EGFR pathway.(A,D) The rough eye caused by over-expression of dominant negative rasN17 under the sevenless promoter (sev-rasN17) (A) is considerably suppressed when heterozygous for D-cblK26 (D). Genotype in (D): sev-rasN17; D-cblK26/+. (B,E) The small eye phenotype caused by sevenless-induced expression of activated yan (sev-yanact) (B) is dominantly suppressed by heterozygosity for D-cblK26 (E). Genotype in (E): sev-yanact ; D-cblK26/+. (C,F) Overexpression of EGFRDN under the control of the GMR enhancer (GMR- EGFRDN) causes a small eye (C). Genotype: GMR-Gal4 UAS-EGFRDN. GMR-EGFRDN is recessively suppressed in D-cblK26 mosaics (F). Genotype: ey-Flp; GMR-Gal4 UAS-EGFRDN; D-cblK26 FRT80/P[ubi-GFP] FRT80.
