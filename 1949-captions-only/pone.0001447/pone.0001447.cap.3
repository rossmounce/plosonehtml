                Figure 3.  D-cbl regulates EGFR pathway activity.In panels (Aâ€“E), posterior is to the right. The morphogenetic furrow is marked by a white arrowhead. D-cbl clones in (A,C,F) and D-cbl overexpressing clones in (B,D) are marked by the absence of GFP. Genotype in (A,C,F): ey-Flp; D-cblK26 FRT80/P[ubi-GFP] FRT80; genotype in (B,D): hs-Flp; tub&gt;GFP&gt;Gal4/UAS-D-cblLA18 (&gt; = FRT); genotype in (E): wild-type. (A,A') p-Tyr labeling is increased in D-cbl clones. (B,B') Overexpression of D-cbl suppresses p-Tyr labeling. (C,C') dp-ERK labeling persists in D-cbl mutant clones beyond the normal labeling immediately posterior to the MF (see arrows, compare to (E)). (D,D') Overexpression of D-cbl suppresses dp-ERK labeling in third instar larval eye discs. (E) dpERK labeling in third instar wild-type eye imaginal discs is restricted to one ommatidial column posterior to the MF. (F,F') Yan protein is reduced in D-cbl mutant clones in 35 hours APF eye discs.
