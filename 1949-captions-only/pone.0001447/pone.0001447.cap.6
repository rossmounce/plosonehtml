                Figure 6.  Loss of D-cbl compensates for loss of sevenless.The entire disc is mutant for sevd2. Homozygous D-cbl clones are marked by the absence of GFP. Anti-Pros (red) labels R7 cells, and anti-Elav (blue) labels all R cells. The R7 cells are absent in sevd2 ommatidia, while 4.12Â±0.74 (n = 35) R7 cells are present in sevd2;D-cblK26 double mutant ommatidia. Genotype: sevd2/Y; ey-FLP/+ ; FRT80 D-cblK26/FRT80 P[ubi-GFP].
