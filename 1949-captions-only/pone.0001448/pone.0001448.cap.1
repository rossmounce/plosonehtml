BRCA1 suppressor strains were initially identified by sequencing rapid growing strains arising on GAL-URA plates following transformation of the diploid deletion strain pool with the <em>GAL::</em>BRCA1 expression plasmid. Putative BRCA1 suppressor strains identified from the pool were selected from the arrayed deletion strain library and transformed with the BRCA1 expression plasmid, grown to stationary phase in GLU and 2 ul aliquots were replica spotted onto GLU and GAL plates from serial 5-fold dilutions in water (arrows indicate direction of decreasing cell concentration). Typical results are depicted for seven strains. Five deletion strains (<em>apt1Δ, nst1Δ, oca1Δ, ygr039WΔ</em> and <em>ylr412WΔ</em>) failed to suppress BRCA1 lethality and were omitted from further study. Two deletion strains, <em>bbc1Δ</em> and <em>ygr064WΔ</em> (which deletes the N terminus of <em>SPT4</em>) were confirmed to suppress BRCA1-induced lethality. (B) Deletion strains defective in mRNA export suppress BRCA1-induced lethality. Deletions of the nuclear pore associated genes <em>NUP2, POM34</em> and <em>MLP2</em> (from deletion pool) and deletions of the IR resistance genes <em>NUP120, NUP170, NUP188</em> as well as <em>NUP133</em> (not shown, <a href="#pone.0001448.s001">Table S1</a>) suppress BRCA1 lethality. Relative plating efficiencies for colony formation on GAL <em>vs</em> GLU (GAL/GLU) are from <a href="#pone.0001448.s001">Table S1</a>. With the exception of <em>nup84Δ</em>, all IR sensitive nuclear pore defective strains significantly suppressed BRCA1-induced lethality. (C) Deletion of the transcriptional elongation genes <em>SPT4</em> or <em>CTK1</em> completely suppress BRCA1-induced lethality. Reduced colony forming ability on GAL (Galactose) <em>vs</em> GLU (Glucose) plates is completely suppressed by deletion of <em>SPT4</em> or <em>CTK1</em> when compared to WT strains containing the BRCA1 plasmid. Plates depicted are following 3 (WT and <em>spt4Δ</em> strains) and 4 days (<em>ctk1Δ</em>) incubation at 30°C. (D) Suppressor strains defective in transcription elongation express BRCA1. WT, <em>spt4Δ, def1Δ</em> and <em>ctk1Δ</em> strains containing the BRCA1 expression plasmid were induced in liquid GAL for the indicated times (hrs). Western blot has been probed with anti-BRCA1 antibody MS110. Full-length BRCA1 has an apparent MW of 220–250 kDa or larger (arrow). (E) Nuclear exclusion of BRCA1 is not responsible for suppression of BRCA1-induced lethality. <em>In situ</em> immunofluorescence of BRCA1 was determined in uninduced yeast cells (GLU) or induced for BRCA1 expression for 6 hours (GAL). Hoechst staining was used to position the nucleus. No partitioning defects were observed for BRCA1 in other nuclear pore mutants (<em>nup2Δ, nup120Δ, nup133Δ, nup188Δ, pom34Δ</em> or <em>mlp2Δ</em>; data not shown) that suppressed BRCA1 lethality. In all cells examined, BRCA1 was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Bar is 10 um. (F) Suppression of BRCA1-induced lethality is not due to second site suppressors. Diploid deletion strains (<em>spt4Δ, ctk1Δ</em> and <em>def1Δ</em>) containing the <em>GAL::</em>BRCA1 expression plasmid were “covered” with the corresponding gene expressed from a second selectable plasmid and assayed for the reinstatement of BRCA1 lethality by determining the relative plating efficiencies of colony forming ability on GAL <em>vs</em> GLU with selection for both plasmids. WT+BRCA1 (-HIS) is the relative survival of colony forming ability for the WT strain containing the <em>GAL::</em>BRCA1-<em>HIS3</em> expression plasmid on GAL-HIS <em>vs</em> GLU-HIS medium. Error bars are +/− 1 SD about the mean and each bar represents 3-6 experiments.</p>
