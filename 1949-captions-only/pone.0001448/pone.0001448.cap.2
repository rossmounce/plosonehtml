Deletion of the <em>ygr064WΔ</em> ORF deletes the N terminus of <em>SPT4</em>. Full-length deletion of <em>SPT4</em> also completely suppressed BRCA1 lethality. Spt4p physically interacts with Spt5p in the DSIF complex to confer transcription elongation functions. <em>SPT5</em> is an essential gene, however the relative survival of two strains (<em>yml009W-bΔ</em> and <em>yml009c-aΔ</em>) containing non-lethal C terminal truncations of <em>SPT5</em> was enhanced when compared to WT following BRCA1 expression. Relative colony forming ability for these strains on GAL <em>vs</em> GLU (GAL/GLU) has been indicated. (B) Deletion of <em>SPT4</em> suppresses prolonged G1 arrest following BRCA1 expression in yeast. Individual unbudded (G1) cells were positioned using a micromanipulator into 4×5 cell grid patterns on GLU-URA and GAL-URA plates. None of the WT cells expressing BRCA1 (on GAL) were able to progress beyond the single cell (G1) stage of the cell cycle by 24 hours. However, deletion of <em>SPT4</em> allowed most of the cells (13/20) to progress into microcolonies following BRCA1 expression. When BRCA1 was repressed (on GLU), most of the WT and the <em>spt4Δ</em> cells progressed beyond the G1 stage of the cell cycle to form microcolonies. (C) DSIF defective yeast strains are sensitive to γ-irradiation. WT, <em>spt4Δ</em> and <em>spt5</em> mutant (<em>yml009w-bΔ</em>) strains were grown to stationary phase and exposed to γ-irradiation as previously described <a href="#pone.0001448-Westmoreland2">[12]</a>. WT survival data was pooled with previous data (n = 10 experiments) to generate the γ-ray WT survival curve depicted above. Survival fractions for the <em>spt4Δ</em> and <em>spt5</em> strains are averaged from 3-4 experiments. Previously published survival data for the <em>ccr4Δ</em> strain <a href="#pone.0001448-Westmoreland2">[12]</a> has been included for comparison. Error bars are +/− 1 SE about the mean. (D) Diploid <em>spt4Δ</em> strains are sensitive to the S phase specific DNA damaging agents HU and MMS. WT, <em>spt4Δ, spt5</em> truncated (<em>yml009w-bΔ; yml009c-aΔ</em>) and <em>ccr4Δ</em> strains were exposed as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. Arrows indicate the direction of decreasing cell concentrations. The <em>ccr4Δ</em> strain has been included as a positive control. (E) <em>SPT4</em> maintains chromosome stability following DNA damage. The WT (YPH656) and isogenic <em>spt4Δ</em> YPH656 derived strain contain a stable YAC that carries the <em>SUP11</em> gene that allows read through of the ochre mutation within <em>ade2-101</em>. Strains that retain the YAC remain white while loss of the YAC results in a red colony. Strains were grown and diluted as described in Panel D. Two independent <em>spt4Δ</em> isolates demonstrate MMS hypersensitivity and enhanced MMS-induced chromosome loss as indicated by numerous (n = 10) red Ade- colonies (arrows) when compared to the WT parental YPH656 strain (no red colonies). Spontaneous YAC loss was observed in untreated <em>spt4Δ</em> strains. (F) BRCA1 suppressor strains are sensitive to γ-irradiation and hypersensitive to zymocin. Strains were grown and diluted as described in Panel D. Diluted cells were replica spotted onto YPD and either left unirradiated (0 Dose), exposed to 80 krads of γ-irradiation or plated to YPD containing zymocin toxin secreted from <em>K. lactis</em> as previously described <a href="#pone.0001448-Westmoreland2">[12]</a>.</p>
