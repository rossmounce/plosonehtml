                Figure 2.  BRCA1 suppressor strains are sensitive to DNA damaging agents.(A) DSIF defective strains suppress BRCA1-induced lethality. Deletion of the ygr064WΔ ORF deletes the N terminus of SPT4. Full-length deletion of SPT4 also completely suppressed BRCA1 lethality. Spt4p physically interacts with Spt5p in the DSIF complex to confer transcription elongation functions. SPT5 is an essential gene, however the relative survival of two strains (yml009W-bΔ and yml009c-aΔ) containing non-lethal C terminal truncations of SPT5 was enhanced when compared to WT following BRCA1 expression. Relative colony forming ability for these strains on GAL vs GLU (GAL/GLU) has been indicated. (B) Deletion of SPT4 suppresses prolonged G1 arrest following BRCA1 expression in yeast. Individual unbudded (G1) cells were positioned using a micromanipulator into 4×5 cell grid patterns on GLU-URA and GAL-URA plates. None of the WT cells expressing BRCA1 (on GAL) were able to progress beyond the single cell (G1) stage of the cell cycle by 24 hours. However, deletion of SPT4 allowed most of the cells (13/20) to progress into microcolonies following BRCA1 expression. When BRCA1 was repressed (on GLU), most of the WT and the spt4Δ cells progressed beyond the G1 stage of the cell cycle to form microcolonies. (C) DSIF defective yeast strains are sensitive to γ-irradiation. WT, spt4Δ and spt5 mutant (yml009w-bΔ) strains were grown to stationary phase and exposed to γ-irradiation as previously described [12]. WT survival data was pooled with previous data (n = 10 experiments) to generate the γ-ray WT survival curve depicted above. Survival fractions for the spt4Δ and spt5 strains are averaged from 3-4 experiments. Previously published survival data for the ccr4Δ strain [12] has been included for comparison. Error bars are +/− 1 SE about the mean. (D) Diploid spt4Δ strains are sensitive to the S phase specific DNA damaging agents HU and MMS. WT, spt4Δ, spt5 truncated (yml009w-bΔ; yml009c-aΔ) and ccr4Δ strains were exposed as described in Methods. Arrows indicate the direction of decreasing cell concentrations. The ccr4Δ strain has been included as a positive control. (E) SPT4 maintains chromosome stability following DNA damage. The WT (YPH656) and isogenic spt4Δ YPH656 derived strain contain a stable YAC that carries the SUP11 gene that allows read through of the ochre mutation within ade2-101. Strains that retain the YAC remain white while loss of the YAC results in a red colony. Strains were grown and diluted as described in Panel D. Two independent spt4Δ isolates demonstrate MMS hypersensitivity and enhanced MMS-induced chromosome loss as indicated by numerous (n = 10) red Ade- colonies (arrows) when compared to the WT parental YPH656 strain (no red colonies). Spontaneous YAC loss was observed in untreated spt4Δ strains. (F) BRCA1 suppressor strains are sensitive to γ-irradiation and hypersensitive to zymocin. Strains were grown and diluted as described in Panel D. Diluted cells were replica spotted onto YPD and either left unirradiated (0 Dose), exposed to 80 krads of γ-irradiation or plated to YPD containing zymocin toxin secreted from K. lactis as previously described [12].
