WT yeast cells were transformed with plasmids that express the RNAPII CTD in the nucleus (nuc-polII CTD) or cytoplasm (cyto-polII CTD) due to the presence or absence of a NLS signal sequence. A second selectable (<em>HIS3</em>) <em>GAL::</em>BRCA1 expression vector was subsequently established in these strains by transformation. Relative plating efficiencies on GAL <em>vs</em> GLU was determined as described in <a href="#pone-0001448-g001">Fig. 1B</a> with plasmid selection. Co-expression of the BRCA1 and the cyto-CTD construct significantly (*) suppressed BRCA1-induced lethality, whereas co-expression of BRCA1 and the nuc-CTD construct significantly (*) augmented lethality. The relative survival fraction for cells containing both the BRCA1 and nuc-CTD plasmids was less than (&lt;) 0.08 since no colonies appeared on the GAL-HIS-URA plates. This augmented lethality could be partially “relieved” by plating cells to non-selective medium where retention of the nuc-CTD construct was not required for viability (in medium containing uracil; +URA). This indicated that nuc-CTD plasmid loss occurred <em>in trans</em> following BRCA1 expression. Error bars are the average of 4-6 experiments (+/− 1 SD). (B) BRCA1 expression in WT yeast induces cleavage of the RNAPII CTD. Following BRCA1 expression in WT cells, Western blots were probed with anti-2,5P CTD antibody (anti-2,5P, upper panel), stripped and re-probed with anti-BRCA1 antibody (lower panel). The positions of the intact phosphorylated RNAPII (IIo) and a novel BRCA1-induced 50 kDa phospho-CTD (P-CTD) fragment have been indicated. (C) WT yeast that express BRCA1 with a BRCT domain defect fail to induce P-CTD cleavage. WT cells containing BRCA1, BRCT mutated (I1766S) or empty plasmid expression vectors were induced for BRCA1 expression in GAL and extracted at the times indicated. Western blots utilized anti-2,5P CTD (upper panel) and anti-BRCA1 (middle panel) antibodies as probes. Anti-Act1p antibody (bottom panel) served as a loading control. P-CTD cleavage in cells containing the empty vector was identical to that seen for the BRCT mutant expression plasmid (data not shown). (D) Deletion of <em>DEF1</em> inhibits BRCA1-induced P-CTD cleavage. WT and <em>def1Δ</em> strains containing the BRCA1 plasmid were induced for BRCA1 expression and extracted at the indicated times. Anti-2,5P CTD (upper panel) and anti-BRCA1 (middle panel) antibodies were utilized as Western blot probes. Pgk1p served as a loading control unaffected by the switch from GLU to GAL (bottom panel). The P-CTD fragment is greatly diminished in the <em>def1Δ</em> strain when compared to an equivalently loaded WT induced for BRCA1 expression. (E) Deletion of <em>CTK1</em> inhibits BRCA1-induced P-CTD cleavage. WT and <em>ctk1Δ</em> strains containing the BRCA1 plasmid were induced for BRCA1 expression and extracted at the indicated times. Cells were extracted, proteins separated and Western blotted as described in C above. The P-CTD fragment is undetectable in the <em>ctk1Δ</em> strain using either anti-2,5P or H14 anti-5 P antibody (data not shown). (F) MG132 inhibits degradation of the BRCA1-induced P-CTD fragment in yeast. Deletion of <em>ERG6</em> facilitates uptake of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in yeast. We therefore established the BRCA1 expression plasmid within the <em>erg6Δ</em> strain and induced BRCA1 expression in the absence (left panels) and presence of MG132 (right panels). Persistence of the P-CTD fragment is enhanced by MG132 treatment indicating that the P-CTD fragment is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation.</p>
