WT cells bearing the <em>GAL::</em>BRCA1 and <em>GAL::</em>Spt4-V5-<em>LEU2</em> expression plasmids were induced for co-expression of BRCA1 and Spt4-V5 (16 hrs). Whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared in various concentrations of NP40 and either loaded directly (200 ug/lane) or subjected to co-IP reactions overnight using anti-BRCA1 antibody or normal mouse IgG. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-V5 antibody as a probe. Spt4p is detected as a double band in WCL of WT cells migrating between 14 and 20 kDa. This doublet Spt4p band was also detected endogenously using anti-Spt4p antibody (sc-26353, Santa Cruz) as a probe (data not shown). The upper Spt4-V5 band was observed to interact maximally with BRCA1 at an NP40 concentration of 0.8%. BRCA1 similarly interacted with endogenous Spt4p when anti-Spt4p antibody (sc-26353, Santa Cruz) was used as the IP antibody (data not shown). (B) Interaction of BRCA1 with SPT5 is dependent on the BRCA1-BRCT domain in human cells. MCF7 and HCC1937 cells were either left untreated or exposed to UV (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) for 6hr in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 uM). WCL were prepared and subjected to co-IP analysis using normal mouse IgG (NLM), anti-BRCA1 or anti-SPT5 mouse monoclonal antibody as the IP reagent. Western immunoblot (IB) analysis utilized anti-BRCA1 as a probe. The interaction of SPT5 with BRCA1 is observed in both unirradiated and UV-irradiated MCF7 cells. Interaction between BRCA1, and SPT5 is abolished in HCC1937 cells. At the time of irradiation, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 uM) to inhibit rapid damage-induced degradation of the BRCA1-SPT5 complex. In the absence of proteasome inhibition, no BRCA1-SPT5 interaction was seen following UV irradiation (data not shown). (C) BRCA1 interacts with SPT5 and RNA polymerase II in human cells. Co-IP reactions using the indicated monoclonal antibodies and normal (non-immune) mouse IgG (NLM) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblot (IB) analysis utilized, anti-BRCA1, anti-2,5P and anti-SPT5 as probes. Both BRCA1 and SPT5 interacted with the full-length hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (IIo). SPT5 interaction with BRCA1 could be detected using either anti-BRCA1 or anti-SPT5 monoclonal antibodies as the immunoprecipitation reagent. Interaction between SPT5 and BRCA1 was abolished in HCC1937 cells that express a BRCT defective form of BRCA1. (D) Rapid MMS-induced degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RNAPII is BRCT domain dependent. MCF and HCC1937 cells were either left unexposed or exposed to the radiomimetic methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) for 2 hours at 37°C. Separated proteins were Western immunoblotted using anti-BRCA1, anti-SPT5, anti-RNAPII antibody N20 and anti-actin as probes. Whereas MMS treatment of MCF7 cells (BRCA1+/+) led to a dramatic degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RNAPII (Rpb1 subunit). MMS treatment of HCC1937 cells (BRCA1−/−) resulted in reduced and/or delayed degradation of the three proteins. These results suggest that the co-degradation may be a BRCT domain dependent process.</p>
