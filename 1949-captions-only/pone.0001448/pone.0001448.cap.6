                Figure 6.  DNA damage induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in yeast and human cells.(A) UV damage in yeast induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage. Stationary phase WT diploid yeast cells were irradiated with 120 J/m2 of UV-irradiation. UV induced a transient 50 kDa RNAPII P-CTD cleavage fragment at 4–5 hours following irradiation and outgrowth in fresh YPD medium. This fragment was similar in size to that observed following BRCA1 expression. The survival fraction for colony forming ability following UV irradiation was 0.70. P-CTD cleavage was not observed in unirradiated control cells (data not shown). (B) Antibodies specific for the RNAPII CTD immunoprecipitate a RNAPII P-CTD fragment following UV irradiation. WCL were prepared from unirradiated and UV-irradiated (20 J/m2) MCF7 and T47D cells 4 hours after irradiation in the presence of MG132 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with either 2,5P or 8WG16 anti-CTD antibodies. 8WG16 is specific for unphosphorylated and partially phosphorylated forms of Rpb1. Immunoprecipitates were separated on polyacrylamide gels and the P-CTD detected by Western blot using the 2,5P anti-CTD antibody as described above. UV damage enhanced the ability to detect the P-CTD fragment by immunoblotting following immunoprecipitation (IP) with either 2,5P or 8WG16 antibody. Although P-CTD fragment was detected in extracts from unirradiated cells, the ability to IP the P-CTD fragment was enhanced in extracts from UV-irradiated cells. Images depict proteins greater than 75 kDa. Cross-reacting heavy chain antibodies used in the IP reactions were detected at ~50 kDa (data not shown). (C) UV-irradiation induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in human cells. Human cell lines MCF7 and HCC1937 were grown to 70–80% confluence and either left unirradiated or irradiated with UV (20 J/m2). Unirradiated (−) and UV-irradiated (+) cells were subsequently incubated at 37°C in growth medium with (+) or without (−) the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 hours. Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into 95% ethanol at 4°C. Proteins extracted in the ethanol soluble fraction were separated on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-2,5P antibody. Following initial immunoblotting, the membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin antibody to serve as a loading control. Since the CTD of human RNAPII contains 52 heptapeptide repeat units, UV-induced the cleavage of Rpb1 releasing a P-CTD fragment that was approximately twice the size (~110 kDa) of the yeast P-CTD fragment which contains 25 heptapeptide repeats (~50 kDa, see panel A). In repeated experiments, the P-CTD fragment was frequently observed in extracts from unirradiated MG132 treated cells (data not shown) however, detection of the P-CTD fragment was enhanced in extracts from similarly treated cells exposed to UV. Greatly reduced levels of P-CTD cleavage was also observed in the BRCA1 defective cell line MDA-MD-436 [57] following UV-irradiation and proteasome inhibition (data not shown). (D) UV-induced RNAPII P-CTD cleavage is BRCA1-dependent. Cells with a BRCA1-BRCT domain defect (HCC1937) were separately transfected with empty vector (PC) or vectors expressing truncated BRCA1 (BRCA1-ΔM) and full-length wild type BRCA1. At 48 hours post transfection cells were UV-irradiated, treated with MG132 and homogenized in ethanol as described above (panel C) and methods. Aliquots (10 ul) from the insoluble fraction resuspended in loading buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies as described above (panel C). The P-CTD cleavage fragment was only observed following ectopic expression of full-length wild type BRCA1. The faster mobility of the BRCA1 protein expressed from the BRCA1-ΔM construct is due to an in frame internal deletion of 518 amino acids which retains the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1 [26]. BRCA1 expressed endogenously in the HCC1937 cells is detected as a lighter band with mobility similar to that of the ectopically overexpressed BRCA1. (E) A model for BRCA1 DNA damage surveillance during transcription. This model describes a BRCA1-dependent transcription-mediated checkpoint/surveillance system that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. The components of this pathway were identified as suppressors of BRCA1-induced lethality in yeast. Following DNA damage within actively transcribing genes, the elongating phosphorylated RNA pol II (form IIo) is stalled by DNA damage. In yeast, the Ctk1p kinase specifies the phosphorylation pattern of the CTD “recognized” by BRCA1. BRCA1 in the presence of specific co-factors including DSIF (Spt4p/Spt5p) and the yeast degradation factor Def1p is proposed to bind the P-CTD. This activates a protease activity that cleaves the CTD from the catalytic domain of Rpb1p (resulting in CTD-less form IIb). We propose this event is an upsteam signal that activates checkpoint arrest in G1. The checkpoint arrest signal remains “on” until prematurely terminated mRNA is exported from the nucleus utilizing Mlp1p, Mlp2p and numerous nuclear pore components to be degraded at the cytoplasmic processing body utilizing Ccr4p and Dhh1p. Following P-CTD cleavage, Rpb1p is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation at the proteasome.
