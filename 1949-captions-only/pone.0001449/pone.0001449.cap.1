                Figure 1.  Final Models Predicting ALS Outcomes.Figure 1A (left). Goodness-of-Fit of Final Model Using Axon Guidance Genes to Predict Susceptibility to ALS. Histogram of predicted probabilities of ALS in cases (a). Histogram of predicted probabilities of ALS in controls (b). A perfect fit would have all predicted probabilities for cases equal to one, and all predicted probabilities for controls equal to zero. A model with no explanatory value would have histograms that were indistinguishable from each other. Figure 1B (center). Kaplan-Meier Survival Plot for Age at Onset in ALS Patients, Grouped by Categorized Risk Score from Proportional Hazards Model. The model clearly differentiates between early age at onset cases and late age at onset cases. Cases generating the long-dashed line were predicted to be at highest risk for early onset of ALS, followed by the medium-dashed, short-dashed, and continuous lines respectively. Since only cases were included, all of the lines end at zero percent free of ALS. Figure 1C (right). Predicted vs. Reported Age at Onset in ALS Patients. Points indicate reported individual values, and the line represents perfect agreement. In this case, the pattern shows a fairly tight elliptical pattern, reflecting a good fit and high R2 of 0.86. The fit appears equally good from the minimum to maximum reported age at onset.
