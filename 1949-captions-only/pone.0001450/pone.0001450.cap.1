                Figure 1.  The characterizations of A. pleuropneumoniae JL03's genome and the oriC region.(A) Circular genome representation of JL03. Circles are numbered from 1 (outer circle) to 10 (inner circle). The circles 1/2 shows predicted CDSs on the plus and minus strand in JL03 color-coded by COG categories. All genes are colored according to biological functions: gold for translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; orange for RNA processing and modification; light orange for transcription; dark orange for DNA replication, recombination and repair; antique white for cell division and chromosome partitioning; pink for defense mechanisms; tomato for signal transduction mechanisms; peach for cell envelope biogenesis and outer membrane; deep pink for intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport; pale green for posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones; royal blue energy production and conversion; blue for carbohydrate transport and metabolism; dodger blue for amino acid transport and metabolism; sky blue for nucleotide transport and metabolism; light blue for coenzyme metabolism; cyan for lipid metabolism; medium purple for inorganic ion transport and metabolism; aquamarine for secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; gray for function unknown. Circle 3/4, the putative horizontal transferred genes in deep pink identified by SIGI-HMM on the forward and reverse strand. Circle 5, repetitive elements in yellow, above 200nt and cutoff value 1e-10. Circle 6, transposases in green and potential prophage genes in dark orange. Circle 7, mean centered GC content of JL03 genes (red: above mean, blue-below mean). Circle 8, tRNA genes in orange. Circle 9, rRNA genes in red. Circle 10, GC Skew plot (windowsize: 1000, windowoverlap: 500). (B) Genetic organization of the oriC regions in three representative organisms within the family of Pasteurellaceae: JL03, A. pleuropneumoniae; 35000HP, H. ducreyi; and Pm70, P. multocida.
