The boxes in green represent phage-associated CDSs of L20. Besides the strain L20-specific prophage region illustrated below the linear genomic diagram as an enlarged drawing, four special genomic regions highlighted (B, C, D, E) were magnified in the corresponding panels. The genetic organizations of the <em>cys</em> operons (B), the CPS biosynthesis and export gene clusters (D), and the LPS O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters (E) were compared among three isolates of <em>A. pleuropneumoniae</em>: JL03 (serotype 3), L20 (serotype 5b) and 4074 (serotype 1). Comparative genetic organization of the <em>flp</em> operons between JL03 and L20 is illustrated in panel C. Regions presented in gray represent highly homologous sequences. Blue arrows represent putative CDSs with either forward or reverse transcription directions.</p>
