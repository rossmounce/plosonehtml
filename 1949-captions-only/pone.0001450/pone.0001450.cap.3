Midpoint potentials (<em>E<sup>'</sup><sub>0</sub></em>) of some electron donors and acceptors of respiration chains are marked. Genes encoding crucial enzymes and functional proteins involved in the metabolic pathways are illustrated while the corresponding CDSs designated with APJL numbers are listed in <a href="#pone.0001450.s002">Table S2</a>.</p>
