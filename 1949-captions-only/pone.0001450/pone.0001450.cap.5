                Figure 5.  A schematic diagram of virulence factors located in virtual cell environment of A. pleuropneumoniae JL03.CDSs corresponding to the illustrated proteins with designated APJL numbers are listed in Table 5 (adherence and secretion relevant genes), Table 6 (capsule polysaccharide relevant genes), Table 7 (lipopolysaccharide relevant genes), Table S3 (iron relevant genes) and S4 (the rest portion relevant genes). Proteins involved in iron uptake, transport and regulation are colored in yellow.
