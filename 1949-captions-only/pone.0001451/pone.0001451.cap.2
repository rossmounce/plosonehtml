Immunofluorescent images were obtained by confocal microscopy and are representative of at least 6 samples for each antibody. In g and h, DAB was a substrate for the immunostaining of insulin. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Original magnification: ×40. In B-a, real-time RT-PCR detected the mRNA expressions of insulin and other pancreatic β-cell-related genes, such as <em>Pdx-1</em>, <em>Hlxb9</em>, <em>Nkx2.2</em>, <em>Nkx6.1</em>, and <em>Glut-2</em> in these islet-like cell clusters. In B-b, real-time RT-PCR detected the insulin mRNA expressions in stage 4 cell clusters comparing to human islets or rat β-cell line RIN-m5F. Data are presented as means±SEM from three independent experiments.</p>
