                Figure 3.  In vitro insulin and C-peptide secretion assay of islet-like cell clusters.In A, insulin release in response to physiological (5.5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose concentrations of stage 4 cell cluster was measured after 24 h incubation. In B, C-peptide secretion of stage 3 and stage 4 cell clusters was detected. All data are presented as meansÂ±SEM (n = 6 in A; n = 8 in B).
