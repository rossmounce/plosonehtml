                Figure 4.  Changes of blood glucose and serum human insulin levels in STZ-diabetic rats after clusters transplantation.Blood glucose (A) and serum human insulin (B) detection 1-week after sham or stage 4 islet-like cell cluster transplantation in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Random-fed blood glucose levels were measured in all groups. In C, time-course changes of serum human insulin levels after transplantation. All data are presented as meansÂ±SEM (n = 6 in each group). * P&lt;0.05 as compared with before STZ. # P&lt;0.05 as compared with after STZ.
