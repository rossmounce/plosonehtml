Random-fed blood glucose levels were measured in untreated control rats with sham, STZ-treated rats with sham, and STZ-treated rats with transplantation of islet-like cell clusters or undifferentiated HUMSCs (undiff-HUMSCs). The changes in blood glucose (A), body weight (B) and survival ratio (C) were observed. All data are presented as meansÂ±SEM (n = 6 in each group).</p>
