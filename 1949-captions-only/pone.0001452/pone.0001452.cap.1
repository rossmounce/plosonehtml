CD31 staining highlights capillaries in both scleroderma and normal controls. B.) Black arrows show <em>Ulex europaeus</em> lectin (Ulex) is lost from some vessels in scleroderma (compare with CD31 above). C.) VE Cadherin stain is lost from some vessels in scleroderma (arrows) whereas all vessels in normal skin are positive for VE cadherin. Both von Willebrand factor and alkaline phosphatase were similarly lost from scleroderma were similarly lost from scleroderma (data not shown) Markers of inflamed endothelium: D.) CD123, a marker for high endothelial venules, is increased in scleroderma as is E.) smooth muscle actin (SMA). In the capillaries (arrows) smooth muscle actin stain extends to the very top of the dermal papilla, unlike normal skin where smooth muscle actin stain ends at the superficial horizontal plexus (doubleheaded arrow). SMA staining is also increased in the media of vessels in the reticular dermis, (data not shown)</p>
