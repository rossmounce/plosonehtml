                Figure 2.  Non-Angiogenic Phenotype in Scleroderma Compared to Normal Controls.A) There was increased staining in CD123 in perivascular cells in the superficial horizontal plexus in skin biopsies from scleroderma patients compared with normal controls. B) Interferon a (IFNa) in situ hybridization exhibited a robust signal in scleroderma but was absent from controls. C.) Nuclear staining of phosphorylated STAT1 in scleroderma provided evidence of active interferon signaling, with STAT1 phosphorylation, dimerization and translocation to nucleus in response to interferon a. D.) RGS5, a marker of pericytes and arterial smooth muscle had increased mRNA expression in scleroderma in a perivascular distribution. E.) Ki67 a marker of cell cycle, showed no sign of Ki67 labeling of the endothelial cells in either normal controls or scleroderma. There was an increase in Ki67 positive perivascular cells in scleroderma.
