This data represents the total number of vessels per hpf in 15 normal and 21 scleroderma skin biopsies stained with CD31. The average vessels/hpf is significantly decreased in scleroderma compared with normal controls (p = 0.02). B.) Normal skin IHC for CD31 demonstrates microvasculature. “Profiles” or capillaries are defined as linear CD31 staining with no central lumen (single arrows) and represent a robust estimate of capillary density. ‘Lumens’ represent larger vessels, and are defined as structures positive for CD31 that have a central lumen (circle). C.) Data are average numbers of “lumens” versus “profiles”. Average “lumens”, representing larger vessels, in scleroderma skin biopsies are not significantly different from normal skin (p = 0.18). Average “profiles”, representing capillaries, are significantly decreased in scleroderma compared with controls P = 0.009. These results indicate that capillaries are decreased in scleroderma.</p>
