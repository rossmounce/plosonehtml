Immunohistochemistry for CD31 before and after HDIT and autologous HCT is positive in both biopsies, whereas B) when compared with CD31 stained biopsies above, VE cadherin is negative before but positive after HDIT and HCT. C.). Baseline biopsies of scleroderma patients prior to HDIT and autologous HCT all showed cells positive for interferon α (IFNa) <em>in situ</em> hybridization and were present both in the vasculature and scattered in the matrix. After HDIT and autologous HCT, interferon α mRNA was undetectable in 5 of 7 biopsies. Compared biopsies were run at the same time with the same conditions and probe concentration. D) <em>In situ</em> hybridization for <em>RGS5</em> demonstrates positive mononuclear cells around vessels and some cells scattered in the matrix in the scleroderma biopsies prior to treatment with HDIT/HCT. There was little or no detectable <em>RGS5</em> mRNA after HDIT/HCT.</p>
