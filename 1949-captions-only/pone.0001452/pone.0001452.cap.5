Baseline (biopsies for patients who grew back capillaries) had an average capillary number of 4.1/hpf. After HDIT/HCT, average capillary number (for patients who increased capillary number) rose to 5.8/hpf (p = 0.015). Patients with a disease duration of 5 or more years averaged 3.8 profiles/hpf and when compared with the patients who grew back capillaries(After HDIT/HCT) yielded a p value of 0.025.</p>
