                Figure 5.  Capillary Counts Increase After HDIT and HCT Compared to Baseline and to Scleroderma of Long Duration.Data are average “profiles”/hpf counted in scleroderma patients before (Baseline) and after (After HDIT/HCT) treatment with HDIT and HCT. “Late disease” are average “profiles”/hpf in a separate group of patients with disease duration similar to patients after HDIT/HCT, included to provide an additional disease control. Baseline (biopsies for patients who grew back capillaries) had an average capillary number of 4.1/hpf. After HDIT/HCT, average capillary number (for patients who increased capillary number) rose to 5.8/hpf (p = 0.015). Patients with a disease duration of 5 or more years averaged 3.8 profiles/hpf and when compared with the patients who grew back capillaries(After HDIT/HCT) yielded a p value of 0.025.
