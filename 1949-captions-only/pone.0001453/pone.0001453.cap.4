Notch 1 deletion has minimal effects on ADAS cell proliferation.Transduction efficiency in mouse ADAS cells with lentiviral-GFP (A,B); Proliferation of floxed Notch1 ADAS cells transduced with lentiviral-Cre recombinase (C), mutant Cre (D), or no virus (E); Quantification of the effect of Notch 1 deletion on clonogenic potential of ADAS spheres from the supernatant or stromal fraction (F). Scale bar in A and B = 55 um; scale bar in Câ€“E = 220 um.
