                Figure 5.  Deletion of Notch 1 does not influence neural marker expression in mouse ADAS cells.Nestin expression in floxed Notch 1 ADAS cells in mock-transduced (A, B), transduced with lentiviral-Cre (C, D), or lentiviral-mutant Cre (E, F) in MesenCult (A, C, E) was decreased by 70% after exposure to NeuroCult Differentiation Medium (B, D, F). as measured by optical density analyses (See Methods). Scale bar in Aâ€“F = 55 um.
