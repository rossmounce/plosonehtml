X-gal enzymatic activity revealed no detectable blue cells in ADAS cultures grown in NeuroCult (A); a few isolated cells harboring the lacZ transgene in ADAS cultures grown in Mesencult (B); lacZ-positive neural crest-derived cells in the bulb of a whisker hair follicle of a Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26RlacZ transgenic mouse prior to dissociation (C); lacZ-positive cells migrating out of the bulb sheath at the base of a whisker hair follicle in culture after dissociation (D); Phase image of ADAS cultures grown in Mesencult derived from Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26R-stop-lacZ compound transgenic mice (E); Immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for bacterial β-galactosidase revealed the presence of a minimal number of double-labeled EYFP (yellow)/β-galactosidase (red) cells in these cultures (F), n = 3; Quantitative FACS analyses of ADAS cells derived from three different (G, H, I) Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26R-stop-EYFP compound transgenic mice revealed that less than 2% of the cells were EYFP-positive (F), n = 3. Scale bar in A–E = 55 um.</p>
