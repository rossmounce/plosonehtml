                Figure 7.  Intracellular calcium imaging in mouse ADAS cells exposed to Neural Induction Medium (NIM).Fluo-4AM fluorescence intensity was monitored in mouse ADAS cells after a 4-hr (A, B) or 24-hr exposure to NIM (C, D), prior to (A, C) or following (B, D) addition of high KCl. Scale bar = 110 um.
