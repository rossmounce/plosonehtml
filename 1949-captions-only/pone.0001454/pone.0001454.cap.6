                Figure 6.  Induction of Reelin-positive cells in the quail pallium by Dbx1.(A–F) Expression patterns of Pax6/PAX6 and Dbx1/DBX1 in E12.5 mouse (A and B), E14.5 rat (C) and E4.5 quail (D–F) embryos. Immunostaining with anti-Pax6 (A) and PAX6 (D) antibodies reveal pallial regions in these species (arrows in A, B, D and E). In situ hybridization with rat Dbx1 (B and C) and quail DBX1 (E and F) probes demonstrate expression of Dbx1 in the mouse ventral pallium (B) but not in the quail ventral pallium (E). (G–I) Induction of Reelin-positive cells in the quail pallium by overexpression of Dbx1. Dbx1 expression vector is electroporated at E4 embryos (G). After 3 days of electroporation, a large number of Reelin-positive cells are generated in the quail pallium (H). All of Reelin-expressing cells are positive for co-electroporated GFP (I and I′). Scale bar: 200 µm.
