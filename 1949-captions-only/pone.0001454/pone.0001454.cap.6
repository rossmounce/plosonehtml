Immunostaining with anti-Pax6 (A) and PAX6 (D) antibodies reveal pallial regions in these species (arrows in A, B, D and E). <em>In situ</em> hybridization with rat <em>Dbx1</em> (B and C) and quail <em>DBX1</em> (E and F) probes demonstrate expression of <em>Dbx1</em> in the mouse ventral pallium (B) but not in the quail ventral pallium (E). (G–I) Induction of Reelin-positive cells in the quail pallium by overexpression of <em>Dbx1</em>. <em>Dbx1</em> expression vector is electroporated at E4 embryos (G). After 3 days of electroporation, a large number of Reelin-positive cells are generated in the quail pallium (H). All of Reelin-expressing cells are positive for co-electroporated GFP (I and I′). Scale bar: 200 µm.</p>
