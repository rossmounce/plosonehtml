Compared with control (A), straight projection of radial fibers is evident in the <em>Dbx1</em>-misexpressed pallium (arrows in B). (C–E) Morphological changes in migrating neurons by <em>Dbx1</em>-misexpression. In control, GFP-labeled migrating neurons extend many short processes (arrowheads in C). In contrast, In <em>Dbx1</em>-misexpressed pallium, migrating neurons display a bipolar shape (D), and attached to the radial fibers (arrowheads in E). Each radial fiber extends to the Reelin-positive cells localized at the pial surface (an arrow in F). Scale bars, 50 µm (B), 20 µm (D), 10 µm (F, G).</p>
