                Figure 7.  An increase of Reelin-positive cells changes morphology of migrating neurons.(A and B) Changes in radial fiber projection patterns in E10 telencephali by Dbx1 misexpression. Compared with control (A), straight projection of radial fibers is evident in the Dbx1-misexpressed pallium (arrows in B). (C–E) Morphological changes in migrating neurons by Dbx1-misexpression. In control, GFP-labeled migrating neurons extend many short processes (arrowheads in C). In contrast, In Dbx1-misexpressed pallium, migrating neurons display a bipolar shape (D), and attached to the radial fibers (arrowheads in E). Each radial fiber extends to the Reelin-positive cells localized at the pial surface (an arrow in F). Scale bars, 50 µm (B), 20 µm (D), 10 µm (F, G).
