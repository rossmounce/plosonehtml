                Figure 2.  Principal component analysis of a matrix of chord distance [67] among 29 samples of multilocus microsatellite haplotypes of Venturia inaequalis.The first, second and third principal components account for 23.2%, 20.9% and 18.7% of variance respectively. For each samples, the diameter of the disk is proportional to allelic richness. CN = China, IR = Iran, AZ = Azerbaijan, F = France, SE = Sweden, SP = Spain, MA = Morocco, US = USA, CA = Canada, BR = Brazil, SA = South Africa, NZ = New Zealand.
