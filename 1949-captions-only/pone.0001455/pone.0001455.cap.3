                Figure 3.  Population structure of Venturia inaequalis inferred from 1180 multilocus microsatellite haplotypes using the programs Baps [71] and Structure [69], [70].Each haplotype is represented by a line partitioned into K segments that represent the haplotype's estimated membership fractions in K clusters. K = 6 and K = 7 are the population structure models that best fitted the data using Baps and Structure. CN = China, IR = Iran, AZ = Azerbaijan, F = France, SE = Sweden, SP = Spain, MA = Morocco, US = USA, CA = Canada, BR = Brazil, SA = South Africa, NZ = New Zealand.
