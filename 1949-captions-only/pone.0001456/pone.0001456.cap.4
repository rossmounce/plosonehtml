Sampling locations and trophic status are displayed along the y-axis. Blue boxes indicate oligotrophic conditions, green boxes indicate mesotrophic conditions and red boxes indicate eutrophic conditions. Samples that are in close geographic proximity to each other share similarly colored histogram bars.</p>
