                Figure 5.  Recruitment of GOS sequences to the Prochlorococcus myophage P-SSM4 genome at 90% identity (B) and the distribution of these sequences across sampling locations (A).The x-axis of the recruitment plot shows the position of sequence reads along the complete genome in base pairs and the y-axis represents percent identity. The x-axis of the histogram represents the relative abundance of normalized sequences per site, displayed as a percentage. Sampling locations and trophic status are displayed along the y-axis. Blue boxes indicate oligotrophic conditions, green boxes indicate mesotrophic conditions and red boxes indicate eutrophic conditions. Samples that are in close geographic proximity to each other share similarly colored histogram bars.
