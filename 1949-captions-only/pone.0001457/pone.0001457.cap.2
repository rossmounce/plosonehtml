The calculated parameters include: Total track area (µm<sup>2</sup>), delineated in red; net track area after cell area is subtracted; minor and major axes (µm) of the best-fit ellipse; ratio of the axes; migration velocity [length of skeleton and branches (green+blue)/migration time], effective velocity [end-to-end distance (colored red)/migration time]; track perimeter; roughness [Perimeter<sup>2</sup>/(4π*Area)] and Solidity [track area (blue)/area of the convex hull (red+blue) enclosing the track]. The values indicated in the figure refer to the single track shown.</p>
