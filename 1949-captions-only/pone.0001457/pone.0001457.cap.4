Note the differences in track net area (A<sub>N</sub>) and axial ratio (X), depending on the cell line. (b) A montage of 2×3 image of H1299 control cells, which exhibit long migratory paths that are highly persistent. The montage images of the Latrunculin A (4 µM)- and Nocadazole (2.5 µM)-treated wells indicate inhibited cell motility; PMA (100 ng/ml)-treated well shows an increase in cell motility. Scale bars: 250 µm.</p>
