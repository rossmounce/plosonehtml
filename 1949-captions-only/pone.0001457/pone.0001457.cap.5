Magnification: 10×. Scale bars: 250 µm. (b) Calculated ratio between each of the migratory morphometric parameters of the different BC1000 library candidates, and those of control cells (GFP-MCF7). The primary statistical approach utilized was based on calculating, for each parameter, the “80<sup>th</sup> percentile.” The normalized effect of GFP-control is always defined as zero: a zero value indicates no difference between the “80<sup>th</sup> percentile” value of the candidate gene, and of the control cells. Numbers that are higher or lower than zero indicate an increase or decrease, respectively, in the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile value of the tested parameters.
