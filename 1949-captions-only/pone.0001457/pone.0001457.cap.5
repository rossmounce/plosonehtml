                Figure 5.  The pro-migratory effect of genes derived from the BC1000 library.(a) A montage of 4×4 images, comparing PKT produced by GFP-MCF7 control cells, to those produced by MCF7 cells expressing the BC1000-derived genes HOXB7, PKCζ, FGF7, and ERBB3. Magnification: 10×. Scale bars: 250 µm. (b) Calculated ratio between each of the migratory morphometric parameters of the different BC1000 library candidates, and those of control cells (GFP-MCF7). The primary statistical approach utilized was based on calculating, for each parameter, the “80th percentile.” The normalized effect of GFP-control is always defined as zero: a zero value indicates no difference between the “80th percentile” value of the candidate gene, and of the control cells. Numbers that are higher or lower than zero indicate an increase or decrease, respectively, in the 80th percentile value of the tested parameters. (For additional details, see Table S6).
