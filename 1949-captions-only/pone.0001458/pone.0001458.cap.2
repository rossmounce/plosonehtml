<h4>Dynamic model of donations</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>In order to sketch the time dependent evolution of donations after the disaster shown in <a href="#pone-0001458-g001">Fig. 1</a>, we adopt a very simple epidemic model <a href="#pone.0001458-Kermack1">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001458-Murray1">[12]</a> which was also applied to the adoption of new technologies <a href="#pone.0001458-Bass1">[13]</a> and now proves to be sufficient for describing the observed dynamics in donations. We assume that a fraction <em>y</em> of the total population <em>N</em> is willing to donate money after the catastrophe, where <em>y</em> is treated as an exogeneous parameter that may vary by country (for the tsunami donations, <em>y</em> was about 0.1 in Switzerland and about 0.08 in Germany). So gives the total number of <em>possible</em> donators in a country. The number of <em>actual</em> donators, , is a subset of both <em>N</em> and and changes over time. In order to model its dynamics, we assume that a potential donator, <em>P</em>, becomes an actual donator, <em>A</em>, by interacting with individuals which have already donated. This can be described as a non-local interaction via a mean field that represents the media. In fact, this assumption is quite appropriate as the mass media homogeneously and constantly informed about the disaster and its consequences as well as about the tremendous amount of donations received.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>The act of donation is described as a transition of a potential into an actual donator, . This transition may occur at a gross rate that depends on a constant <em>γ</em> describing the number of interactions per time interval between <em>P</em> and <em>A</em> and a factor 0<em>≤κ≤</em>1, which is the probability that such an interaction leads to a donation. The rate further depends on the fraction , i.e. the probability of a potential donator to interact with someone who already donated, relative to the size of the population. Eventually, the dynamics for the transition of a potential donator also depends on the “resource” , i.e. those potential donators, who did not donate so far. For the increase of the number of actual donators, it then follows the dynamics<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001458.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(2)</span></span><br>Using the abbreviations for the frequency of actual donators <em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) and for the time scale , we find eventually the dynamics in the form<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001458.e003&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(3)</span></span><br>which is known as the logistic equation <a href="#pone.0001458-Verhulst1">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001458-Tsoularis1">[20]</a>.

Eqs. 3, 4 have been tested against the empirical data obtained from the time series of donations. The data were also used to determine the two “free” parameters <em>μ</em>, <em>τ</em> of the dynamics (see <a href="#pone-0001458-t001">Table 1</a>). <a href="#pone-0001458-g003">Figure 3</a> shows, for the largest data set (DH), both the total fraction and the relative growth of donations over time. Despite the very simple dynamics assumed for the model, one realizes a good agreement between theoretical prediction and empirical findings, in particular for the steep rise in the beginning and the saturation phase. The deviations between the estimated fraction and the empirical curve during the end of January 2005 result from the few large donations mentioned as small peaks in the relative growth in <a href="#pone-0001458-g001">Fig. 1</a>.</p>
