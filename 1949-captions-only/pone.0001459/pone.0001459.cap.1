The higher the rating of suddenness, the more frequent it was. For restructuring ratings the relative frequency distribution was reverse. The higher the rating of restructuring, the less frequent it was. (B) As in (A), but for correct post-hint solutions. After hint presentation the distributions of relative frequencies changed. The higher the rating of restructuring, the higher were the relative frequencies. The four levels of suddenness rating were equally often chosen. (C) Interaction Plot of reaction time with ratings of suddenness and restructuring. Mean reaction times, expressed in Z-scores on the ordinate, are plotted as a function of subjective rating of restructuring for 4 different levels of suddenness. Dotted line: gradually approached correct solution (rating of suddenness = 0); dash-dotted line: rating = 1; dashed line: rating = 2; solid line: solution appeared abruptly without any conscious forewarning (rating = 3). The interaction plot displays, that the longer the required time for a correct solution was, (i) the higher was the subjective rating of restructuring and (ii) the lower was the suddenness feeling. Thus, the shortest reaction times were found for sudden solutions with no restructuring and the longest reaction times were found for non-sudden solutions with full restructuring. ’.’, ’<sub>*</sub>’, ’<sub>* *</sub>’ and ’<sub>* * *</sub>’ correspond to significance levels <em>p</em>&lt;0.1, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01 and <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 of a Wilcoxon signed rank test, respectively.</p>
