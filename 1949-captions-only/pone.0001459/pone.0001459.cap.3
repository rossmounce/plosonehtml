                Figure 3.  Significant cluster of the nonparametric cluster randomization test for correct solutions involving full restructuring versus those involving no restructuring of problem.Left: topographical map of the right prefrontal alpha (8â€“10 Hz) frequency band cluster displaying significant (P&lt;0.075) differences between the baseline-corrected spectral power of correct solutions with full restructuring versus those with no restructuring. Right: Grand averaged time-frequency representation of the difference between correct solutions with full restructuring and those with no restructuring over all electrodes that comprise the significant cluster. Red color indicates higher spectral power for correct solutions with full restructuring and blue color indicates higher spectral power for correct solutions with no restructuring. Time of solution response is at 0 s marked by dotted red line. The white dotted rectangle marks the time-frequency zone of significance (p&lt;0.05).
