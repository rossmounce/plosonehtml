                Figure 4.  As Figure 2A but comparing correct identifications of solutions versus incorrect (false positive) ones.(A) Grand averaged time-frequency representation of the difference between correct and false positive solutions over electrodes O2, PO4, P4 and P8. (B) Topographies of the three significant clusters at right parieto-occipital electrodes due to the gamma frequency band (40 âˆ’ 50 Hz) effect. Left: P&lt;0.002. Middle: P&lt;0.005. Right: P&lt;0.02. Red color indicates higher spectral power for correct solutions and blue color indicates higher spectral power for false positive solutions. Time of solution response is at 0 s marked by red dotted vertical line.
