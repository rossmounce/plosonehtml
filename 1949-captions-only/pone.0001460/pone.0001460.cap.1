                Figure 1.  Breakpoint map of the 263/96 patient.a. Map of the 18q breakpoint region. The position of the breakpoint at 74.8 Mb of chromosome 18 is indicated by a vertical arrow. Below is a schematic representation of the deletion map and of the short stature critical region [6], [7]. The position of the markers used is indicated; the critical region boundaries are indicated by dotted lines. Under the map are the genes in the region: horizontal arrows represent transcription orientation. b. Map of the Xq breakpoint region. The position of the breakpoint at 109.7 Mb of chromosome X is indicated by a vertical arrow. Under the map are the genes in the region: horizontal arrows represent transcription orientation. c. Southern Blot analysis of the 18q breakpoint: DNA from the patient and of two normal DNAs was digested with BamH1 and fractionated by PFGE as described previously [31]. The Blot was hybridized with the probe 263/5. d. Southern Blot analysis of the Xq breakpoint: DNA from the patient and of two normal DNAs was digested with KpnI and fractionated by PFGE as described previously [31]. The Blot was hybridized with the probe 263Ã—1. Probes are described in Materials and Methods. Map positions are from NCBI Release 36.1
