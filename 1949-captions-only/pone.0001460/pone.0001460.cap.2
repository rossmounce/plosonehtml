The HCNEs are numbered above the peaks. The position of the 263/96 breakpoint is indicated by a vertical arrow, that of the genes <em>SALL3</em> and <em>ATP9B</em> by a horizontal arrow. The homology between human and the species indicated is shown on the right (%). Map positions in human correspond to NCBI Release 35.</p>
