                Figure 2.  Comparative analysis of the HCNE rich region in 18q.The portion of the analysis from the VISTA Genome Browser (http://genome.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml) from 73,5 to 75 Mb of human chromosome 18 is reported to show conservation between human and mouse, chicken or fugu. The HCNEs are numbered above the peaks. The position of the 263/96 breakpoint is indicated by a vertical arrow, that of the genes SALL3 and ATP9B by a horizontal arrow. The homology between human and the species indicated is shown on the right (%). Map positions in human correspond to NCBI Release 35.
