                Figure 3.  Some of the HCNEs have enhancer or silencer function.Luciferase report assays of the cell lines indicated, transfected with constructs containing promoter only vector (P), a conserved elements from a different genomic region, showing enhancer activity (EN), an unrelated negative control (UR: human/mouse non-conserved element), HCNE1, 9 and E as in Fig. 2. All values are expressed as % of the luciferase activity of the promoter vector (P). *: p value&lt;0.001.
