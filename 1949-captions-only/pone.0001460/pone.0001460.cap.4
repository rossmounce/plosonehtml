                Figure 4.  ChIP of the HCNE on total E11.5 chromatin and adult mouse brain.Embryonal (a) and adult brain chromatin preparations (b) were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies to the histone modifications indicated on the X axis and the DNA was PCR amplified with primers specific for each HCNE. INP: PCR from total chromatin. AcH3 and acH4: ChIP with antibodies to acetylated histone H3 or H4. 2MK4H3: ChIP with antibodies to 2-methyl K4 of histone H3; 3MK27H3: ChIP with antibodies to 3-methyl K27 of histone H3. All values are fold increases, compared to an equal amount of INP. Myc, Xist (positive controls), Atp9b, Sall3 and Chrdl1 indicate primers in the 5â€²UTR region of each gene. Only HCNEs positive for at least one modification were reported in the figure.
