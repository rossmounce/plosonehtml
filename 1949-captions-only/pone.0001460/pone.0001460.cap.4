INP: PCR from total chromatin. AcH3 and acH4: ChIP with antibodies to acetylated histone H3 or H4. 2MK4H3: ChIP with antibodies to 2-methyl K4 of histone H3; 3MK27H3: ChIP with antibodies to 3-methyl K27 of histone H3. All values are fold increases, compared to an equal amount of INP. <em>Myc</em>, <em>Xist</em> (positive controls), <em>Atp9b</em>, <em>Sall3</em> and <em>Chrdl1</em> indicate primers in the 5â€²UTR region of each gene. Only HCNEs positive for at least one modification were reported in the figure.</p>
