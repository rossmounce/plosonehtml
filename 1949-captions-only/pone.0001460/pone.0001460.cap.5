                Figure 5.  Real time RT-PCR of the Chrdl1, Sall3 and Atp9b genes in mouse tissues.RNAs from the tissues and the developmental stages indicated on the X axis were reverse transcribed and PCR amplified as described in Materials and Methods. Each value was normalized as described in Materials and Methods and the ratio with the histone H3 gene expression was calculated.
