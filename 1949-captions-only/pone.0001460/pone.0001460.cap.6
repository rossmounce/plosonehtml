One or two sets of primers were utilized for each gene, as indicated. Modifications were calculated as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. In the figure, the ratio between acH3/acH4 (black) and acH4/2MK4 (gray) in chromatin from the LB263/96 patient and two normal controls (MA and LB696) is shown.</p>
