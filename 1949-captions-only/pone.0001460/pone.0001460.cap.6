                Figure 6.  Chromatin modifications of genes flanking the 18q breakpoint, in the LB263/96 patient.Chromatin of the patient 263/96 and two normal lymphoblastoid cell lines was IP with antibodies to acH3, acH4 or to 2MK4H3 and the DNA was amplified by real time PCR with primers in the promoter regions of each gene. One or two sets of primers were utilized for each gene, as indicated. Modifications were calculated as described in Materials and Methods. In the figure, the ratio between acH3/acH4 (black) and acH4/2MK4 (gray) in chromatin from the LB263/96 patient and two normal controls (MA and LB696) is shown.
