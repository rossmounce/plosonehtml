A regular song spectrogram using a 10msec sliding window, showing power up to several kHz. B. Rhythm spectrograms display longer time scales. These are computed by estimating the dynamic spectrum of an appropriate song feature (amplitude in the above example). Each column of the rhythm spectrogram represents the averaged spectrum of song features sung during an hour long interval. C. Rhythm spectrograms that were generated using a point process that marks the onsets of syllables.</p>
