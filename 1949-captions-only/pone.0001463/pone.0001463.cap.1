                Figure 1.  Characteristics of bacteriolytic activity in zebrafish egg cytosol.The egg cytosol filtered through 0.22 µm filter was mixed with E. coli suspension and incubated at 25°C for different periods (A) or at different temperature for 2 h (B). The bacteriolytic activities were determined by colony forming unit assay.
