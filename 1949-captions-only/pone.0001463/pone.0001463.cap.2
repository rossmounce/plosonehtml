                Figure 2.  Effects of anti-C3 antibody and heating on the bacteriolytic activity of zebrafish egg cytosol.The egg cytosol was pre-incubated with anti-C3 antibody at different concentrations (A), or inactivated by heating at 45°C (B), and then mixed with E. coli suspension. After incubation at 25°C for 2 h, the bacteriolytic activities were measured by colony forming unit assay. * means p&lt;0.05.
