                Figure 3.  Influences of antibodies and chemical inhibitors on the bateriolytic activity of zebrafish egg cytosol.The egg cytosol was pre-incubated with complement component antibodies and chemicals at optimum concentrations, and mixed with E. coli suspension. After incubation at 25Â°C for 2 h, the bacteriolytic activities were measured by colony forming unit assay.
