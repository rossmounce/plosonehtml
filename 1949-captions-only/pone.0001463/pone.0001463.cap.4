                Figure 4.  Effects of divalent cation chelators EGTA and EGTA on the bacteriolytic activity of zebrafish egg cytosol.The egg cytosol was pre-incubated with EGTA, EDTA, EDTA with Mg2+ or EDTA with Ca2+ at optimum concentrations, and then mixed with E. coli suspension. After incubation at 25Â°C for 2 h, the bacteriolytic activities were measured by colony forming unit assay.
