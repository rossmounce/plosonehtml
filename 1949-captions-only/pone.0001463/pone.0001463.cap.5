                Figure 5.  Western blot analysis of C3 and Bf in zebrafish egg cytosol (lane M: molecular marker; lane H: human serum; lane Z: zebrafish egg cytosol).The egg cytosol was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gel using the buffer system of Laemmli. The proteins separated were blotted on nitrocellulose membrane and immunostained with rabbit anti-human C3 antibody or goat anti-human Bf antibody, followed by staining with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-labeled anti-goat IgG, respectively.
