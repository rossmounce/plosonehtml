                Figure 1.  Conditions for the establishment of CD40-stimulated B cells.B cell cultures were established from 105 PBMC (left) or 2×106 PBMC (right). For each condition, four replicate cultures were set up from each of five donors. CD19+CD3– B cell and CD3+CD19– T cell content was assessed by flow cytometry. The increase in total B cell numbers (A), the proportions of B cells and T cells in the cultures on day 27 (B), and total increases in cell number on days 27 and 40 (C) were calculated.
