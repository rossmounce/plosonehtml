For each condition, four replicate cultures were set up from each of five donors. CD19+CD3– B cell and CD3+CD19– T cell content was assessed by flow cytometry. The increase in total B cell numbers (<em>A</em>), the proportions of B cells and T cells in the cultures on day 27 (<em>B</em>), and total increases in cell number on days 27 and 40 (<em>C</em>) were calculated.</p>
