A vertical bar indicates that proliferation was observed to terminate. A triangle indicates that the observation period ended at a time when B cells were still profilerating. An asterisk marks studies in which EBV infection of late-passage CD40/IL-4-stimulated B cell cultures was reported as a typical outcome of B cell cultivation, or was positively observed without information given about the frequency of such an event. Vertical dashed lines indicate proposed limits to the proliferation of non-immortalized human fibroblasts <a href="#pone.0001464-Hayflick1">[39]</a>, T cells <a href="#pone.0001464-Rufer1">[10]</a> or EBV-transformed B cells <a href="#pone.0001464-Sugimoto1">[16]</a>, using an estimation that these cells divide twice a week on average.</p>
