                Figure 10.  Culture periods of CD40/IL-4-stimulated B cells reported in different studies.For each study, the longest period during which B cell proliferation was observed is represented. A vertical bar indicates that proliferation was observed to terminate. A triangle indicates that the observation period ended at a time when B cells were still profilerating. An asterisk marks studies in which EBV infection of late-passage CD40/IL-4-stimulated B cell cultures was reported as a typical outcome of B cell cultivation, or was positively observed without information given about the frequency of such an event. Vertical dashed lines indicate proposed limits to the proliferation of non-immortalized human fibroblasts [39], T cells [10] or EBV-transformed B cells [16], using an estimation that these cells divide twice a week on average.
