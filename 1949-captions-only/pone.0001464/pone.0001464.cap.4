EBV DNA and EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cell lines GXLK and LXB2 were used as positive controls. (<em>B</em>) The PCR protocol allowed the detection of one EBV-infected cell equivalent per reaction. (<em>C</em>) In this example of a routine PCR analysis of early-passage CD40-stimulated B cell cultures, EBV was detected in one of 17 cultures from three different EBV-positive donors. B cell cultures had been set up with 100,000 PBMC each and were tested on day 80â€“90 of culture.</p>
