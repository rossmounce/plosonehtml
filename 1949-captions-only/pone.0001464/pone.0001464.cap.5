                Figure 5.  Phenotype of long-term CD40-stimulated B cells.(A) Five CD40-stimulated B cell lines from different donors after 364 to 818 days of culture were stained for CD19, HLA-ABC and HLA-DR, the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and the adhesion molecules CD54 and CD11a, and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Thick lines represent staining with specific antibody, thin lines with a matched isotype control. Peripheral blood lymphocytes gated on forward and sideward scatter (top left diagram) or additionally gated for CD19 expression (top row, marked with an asterisk) and an EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cell line, BXB4, were used for comparison. (B) One CD40-stimulated B cell line, HXL7, was stained for several of the above markers after various periods of culture, ranging from 55 to 735 days. (C) CD40-stimulated B cells, EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines, and PBL were analyzed for surface expression of a panel of B cell differentiation and activation markers. Specific stainings and controls are represented as in (A).
