                Figure 7.  Telomere length and telomerase activity in long-term CD40-stimulated B cells.(A) Telomeric terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length and telomerase activity in two long-term CD40 B lymphoblast lines, HXL7 and LXL5, over time. Telomere-containing terminal restriction fragments were obtained by restriction hydrolysis of genomic DNA. Telomerase activity was semiquantitatively determined according to a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)[50] in an ELISA format. An internal PCR standard template was co-amplified in each reaction and detected with an independent probe. As a positive control, a template containing 8 telomeric repeats was PCR-amplified and analyzed in the same manner. Relative telomerase activities of samples with respect to the positive control were calculated. (B) Telomerase activities of various CD40-stimulated B lymphoblast lines. Relative telomerase activities of CD40 B lymphoblasts were in a similar range as standard immortalized cell lines (K562 and HEK293) and the artificial telomere product used as positive control. The maximum number of CD40L-expressing feeder cells that might have been present in the CD40 B lymphoblast preparations, corresponding to a dilution of 1/30, had negligible telomerase activity.
