After 4 days, secretion of IL-6 and IL-12p40 was analyzed in an ELISA. TLR9 stimuli and controls included a phosporothioate oligonucleotide (ODN 2006) containing 4 CpG motifs (“CpG”), an oligonucleotide of the same sequence except that each CpG dinucleotide was replaced by a GpC dinucleotide (“GpC”), an oligonucleotide composed of twenty phosphorothioate deoxycytidines (“CCC”), and a medium-alone control. For each condition, two CD40 B cell cultures from different donors were tested. At the time of the experiment, CD40 B cells had been cultured for 570 days (BXL12, top left), 652 days (GXL5, top left), 1074 days (line LXL5, bottom left), or 702 days (line GXL5, bottom right).</p>
