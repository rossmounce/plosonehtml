Organization of the (CTG)<sub>n</sub> containing transgenes. Grey boxes: UASp plasmid sequences inserted in genomic DNA. White boxes: CTG repeat tracts (CTG) <sub>n = 16, 240 or 480</sub> or CAG repeat tracts (CAG) <sub>n = 240 or 480</sub>. Black boxes: non repeated flanking sequences. For the small repeat tract (n = 16) the <em>LacZ</em> ORF is shown as a hatched box. The two primers (1 and 2) used to amplify the transgene were complementary to vector sequences and are common to all constructs. PCR amplifications required specific conditions because of the difficulty to amplify the repeat tracts especially when n = 480 (see <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>). B. Gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR fragments of the transgenic flies genomic DNA amplified using primers 1 and 2. LacZ-CTG <sub>n = 16</sub> (lanes 1–3), CTG <sub>n = 240</sub> (lanes 4–8), CTG <sub>n = 480</sub> (lanes 10–11), CAG <sub>n = 240</sub> (lanes 12) or CAG <sub>n = 480</sub> (lanes 13–14), wild type control DNA (WT) (lane 15). The discrepancy in the size of (CTG)<sub>480 </sub>and (CAG)<sub>480 </sub>reflects a difference in the black boxed flanking sequences, see <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>. (*) partial loss of the CTG <sub>n = 480</sub> tract (line 9) during the cloning process in bacteria. In Drosophila they have been stable through hundreds generations.
