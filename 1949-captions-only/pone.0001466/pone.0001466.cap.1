                Figure 1.  Transgenic constructs and expansion size verification.A. Organization of the (CTG)n containing transgenes. Grey boxes: UASp plasmid sequences inserted in genomic DNA. White boxes: CTG repeat tracts (CTG) n = 16, 240 or 480 or CAG repeat tracts (CAG) n = 240 or 480. Black boxes: non repeated flanking sequences. For the small repeat tract (n = 16) the LacZ ORF is shown as a hatched box. The two primers (1 and 2) used to amplify the transgene were complementary to vector sequences and are common to all constructs. PCR amplifications required specific conditions because of the difficulty to amplify the repeat tracts especially when n = 480 (see Material and Methods). B. Gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR fragments of the transgenic flies genomic DNA amplified using primers 1 and 2. LacZ-CTG n = 16 (lanes 1–3), CTG n = 240 (lanes 4–8), CTG n = 480 (lanes 10–11), CAG n = 240 (lanes 12) or CAG n = 480 (lanes 13–14), wild type control DNA (WT) (lane 15). The discrepancy in the size of (CTG)480 and (CAG)480 reflects a difference in the black boxed flanking sequences, see Material and Methods.
