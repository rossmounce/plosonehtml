For transgene induction, the temperature was raised to 29°C for 12 h before dissection. A. Expression pattern of (CUG)<sub>n</sub> containing RNAs induced in salivary glands by the <em>MS1096-Gal4</em> driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Capdevila1">[24]</a>. Upon induction, (CUG)<sub>n</sub> containing RNAs formed a single nuclear focus in salivary glands of all the transgenic lines where n = 240 or 480. The nuclear signal was absent in lines with n = 16 repeats and in non induced flies. B. Expression pattern of (CUG)<sub>n</sub> containing RNAs induced in muscles of third instar larvae with the <em>24B-Gal4</em> driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Brand1">[22]</a>. (CUG)<sub>n</sub> RNAs formed several nuclear foci in muscles of all the transgenic lines examined where n = 240 or 480. No foci were detected when transgenes were not induced. C. Expression pattern of (CUG)<sub>n</sub> containing RNAs induced in ovaries with the <em>COG-Gal4</em> driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Rorth1">[25]</a>. (CUG)<sub>n</sub> containing RNA formed multiple foci in all the transgenic lines where n = 240 or 480. No foci were detected in non induced flies (data not shown). DNA was stained with DAPI.</p>
