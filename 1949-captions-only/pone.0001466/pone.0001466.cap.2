                Figure 2.  Whole mount RNA-FISH analysis using a CAG-FITC probe.UAS-(CTG)n flies were crossed with Gal4 driver flies and raised at 25°C. For transgene induction, the temperature was raised to 29°C for 12 h before dissection. A. Expression pattern of (CUG)n containing RNAs induced in salivary glands by the MS1096-Gal4 driver [24]. Upon induction, (CUG)n containing RNAs formed a single nuclear focus in salivary glands of all the transgenic lines where n = 240 or 480. The nuclear signal was absent in lines with n = 16 repeats and in non induced flies. B. Expression pattern of (CUG)n containing RNAs induced in muscles of third instar larvae with the 24B-Gal4 driver [22]. (CUG)n RNAs formed several nuclear foci in muscles of all the transgenic lines examined where n = 240 or 480. No foci were detected when transgenes were not induced. C. Expression pattern of (CUG)n containing RNAs induced in ovaries with the COG-Gal4 driver [25]. (CUG)n containing RNA formed multiple foci in all the transgenic lines where n = 240 or 480. No foci were detected in non induced flies (data not shown). DNA was stained with DAPI.
