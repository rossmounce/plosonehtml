                Figure 3.  Nuclear foci formed in induced transgenic lines are RNase sensitive.The induction was performed in salivary glands as in Figure 2A. Nuclear foci formed upon driver induction were not detectable when the salivary glands were submitted to ribonuclease treatment before the FISH procedure.
