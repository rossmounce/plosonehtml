                Figure 4.  CUG expansion toxicity in Drosophila upon induction with various drivers.Transgene expression was achieved by raising flies that bear both UAS-(CTG)n and Gal4 drivers at 25Â°C. A. Bar graph showing fly viability ratio in induced and non-induced conditions. Transgene expression was driven by the ubiquitous Actin-Gal4 driver P{Act5C-GAL4}25FO1. the BL#4414 pan-neuronal elav-Gal4 driver [26], the daughterless-Gal4 (da-Gal4) driver [27] and the motoneuronal BG380-Gal4 driver [28]. Viability was affected only in one of the (CUG)240 RNA expressing lines, the (CUG)240.4 (black boxes). No survival was observed upon ubiquitous and pan-neuronal expression and 21% viability was observed upon motoneuron induction for the (CUG)240.4 line. None of the other lines was affected (white boxes). B. Scanning Electron Microscopy of mutant and wild type eyes. Eye neurodegeneration upon GMRnina-Gal4 driver induction [30] was observed only in the (CUG)240.4 line whereas all the other expansion lines had wild type eyes.
