A. Bar graph showing fly viability ratio in induced and non-induced conditions. Transgene expression was driven by the ubiquitous <em>Actin-Gal4</em> driver P{Act5C-GAL4}25FO1. the BL#4414 pan-neuronal <em>elav-Gal4</em> driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Zhang1">[26]</a>, the <em>daughterless-Gal4</em> (<em>da-Gal4</em>) driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Vaessin1">[27]</a> and the motoneuronal <em>BG380-Gal4</em> driver <a href="#pone.0001466-Budnik1">[28]</a>. Viability was affected only in one of the (CUG)<sub>240</sub> RNA expressing lines, the (CUG)<sub>240.4</sub> (black boxes). No survival was observed upon ubiquitous and pan-neuronal expression and 21% viability was observed upon motoneuron induction for the (CUG)<sub>240.4</sub> line. None of the other lines was affected (white boxes). B. Scanning Electron Microscopy of mutant and wild type eyes. Eye neurodegeneration upon <em>GMRnina-Gal4</em> driver induction <a href="#pone.0001466-Freeman1">[30]</a> was observed only in the (CUG)<sub>240.4</sub> line whereas all the other expansion lines had wild type eyes.</p>
