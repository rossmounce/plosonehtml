                Figure 5.  Quantitative RT-PCR amplification of (CUG)n expanded RNAs.A. Organization of the (CTG)n containing cDNAs. CTG repeat tracts (CTG) n = 16, 240 or 480 are represented as a white box. Black boxes represent 3′ and 5′UTR sequences between which they were inserted (see Material and Methods). The two PCR primers (3 and 4) used in this experiment are common to all constructs and were designed so that DNA amplification does not cross the repeat tract. B. The bar graph represents the mean ratios of CUG expanded and G-6-PDH RNA levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) amplification. Total RNA was extracted from heads of adult transgenic flies. GMRnina-Gal4 driver was used for induction in the eye. Each of the transgenic lines used in this experiment is represented as a black bar. Abbreviations: i: induced; ni: non induced; wt: wild type.
