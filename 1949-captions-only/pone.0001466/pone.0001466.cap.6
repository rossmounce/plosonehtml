CG9650 gene organization and insertion mapping. Three CG9650 mRNAs have been reported, form A is an EST, B and C are computationally derived. Lines represent introns and exons are represented as grey boxes. The (CTG)<sub>240.4</sub> transgene (green) is inserted in the first intron of CG9650 at nucleotide 2051. The position of CG9650-rhodamin probes is shown on the diagram as red stars. B. RNA-FISH on salivary glands with CAG-FITC and CG9650-rhodamin probes (rho-CG96-1 and rho-CG96-2). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. CG9650 RNA forms nuclear foci that co-localize with (CUG)<sub>240.4</sub> RNA. <em>MS1096-Gal4</em> was used for induction. No FISH staining was detected when the transgene was not induced.</p>
