                Figure 6.  (CTG)240.4 expansion and CG9650 target gene expression.A. CG9650 gene organization and insertion mapping. Three CG9650 mRNAs have been reported, form A is an EST, B and C are computationally derived. Lines represent introns and exons are represented as grey boxes. The (CTG)240.4 transgene (green) is inserted in the first intron of CG9650 at nucleotide 2051. The position of CG9650-rhodamin probes is shown on the diagram as red stars. B. RNA-FISH on salivary glands with CAG-FITC and CG9650-rhodamin probes (rho-CG96-1 and rho-CG96-2). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. CG9650 RNA forms nuclear foci that co-localize with (CUG)240.4 RNA. MS1096-Gal4 was used for induction. No FISH staining was detected when the transgene was not induced.
