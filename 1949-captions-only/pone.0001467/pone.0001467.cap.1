Control task before and after the crossmodal spatial cueing task. Brief (100 ms) vibro-tactile S<sub>1</sub> stimuli were randomly delivered to the left or right index finger. II. Time course of a valid experimental trial in the crossmodal spatial cueing task. Each trial began with a 100 ms vibro-tactile S<sub>1</sub> stimulus delivered randomly to the left or right index finger. After an ISI of 617 ms a bright square was presented in one of the screen's quadrants for 200 ms. Subjects pressed the left or right foot pedal to indicate whether the square appeared in the upper or lower half of the screen. Three quarters of the S<sub>2</sub> stimuli appeared on the same side as the S<sub>1</sub> stimulus. During and in between trials-i.e. permanently-subjects fixated a cross in the center of the screen.</p>
