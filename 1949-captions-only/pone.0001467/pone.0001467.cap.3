Ellipses enclose the central regions of interest. Plots illustrate the laterality of the beta-rhythm rebound. b)+c) Grand averages of time-frequency matrices for the central region of interest for the cueing task and the control tasks separately for the three validity conditions. Zero on the x-axis corresponds to the onset of the S<sub>1</sub> stimulus. The black vertical line in the results of the cueing task marks the onset of the S<sub>2</sub> stimulus. The black squares designate the time-frequency windows in which the suppression of the mµ-rhythm as well as the suppression and rebound of the beta-rhythm were seen. d-f) 2-D topographies for mµ-rhythm suppression (550 ms, 10 Hz) (d) and the beta-rhythm suppression (350 ms, 19 Hz) (e) are plotted. The beta-rhythm rebound (550 ms, 19 ms) (f) is shown separately for vibration stimuli to the right or to the left index finger. Ellipses in each topography plot enclose the central regions of interest. The amount of stimulus-locked oscillations at various times and frequencies relative to the pre-stimulus baseline is color coded and is expressed in <em>db</em>. In a) positive values indicate a stronger beta-rhythm after right than after left finger stimulation, while negative values indicate a stronger beta-rhythm after left than right finger stimulation. In b)- f) positive values indicate an increased, while negative values indicate a decreased amount of stimulus-locked oscillations.</p>
