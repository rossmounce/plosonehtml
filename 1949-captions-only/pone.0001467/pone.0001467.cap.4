Ellipses enclose the prefrontal regions of interest. b)+d) Grand averages of time-frequency matrices for the prefrontal region of interest for the cueing task and the control tasks (b) separately for the three validity conditions (d). Zero on the x-axis corresponds to the onset of the S<sub>1</sub> stimulus. The black vertical line in the results of the cueing task marks the onset of the S<sub>2</sub> stimulus. Black squares designate the time-frequency windows in which the gamma-enhancement was observed in the cueing task. The amount of stimulus-locked oscillations at various times and frequencies relative to the pre-stimulus baseline is color-coded and is expressed in <em>db</em>. Positive values indicate an increased, while negative values indicate a decreased amount of stimulus-locked oscillations.</p>
