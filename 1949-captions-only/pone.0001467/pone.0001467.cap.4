                Figure 4.  Grand average of prefrontal time-frequency modulations in experiments I+II.a)+c) 2-D topographies of the gamma-rhythm enhancement in the ISI between cue and target are plotted. Ellipses enclose the prefrontal regions of interest. b)+d) Grand averages of time-frequency matrices for the prefrontal region of interest for the cueing task and the control tasks (b) separately for the three validity conditions (d). Zero on the x-axis corresponds to the onset of the S1 stimulus. The black vertical line in the results of the cueing task marks the onset of the S2 stimulus. Black squares designate the time-frequency windows in which the gamma-enhancement was observed in the cueing task. The amount of stimulus-locked oscillations at various times and frequencies relative to the pre-stimulus baseline is color-coded and is expressed in db. Positive values indicate an increased, while negative values indicate a decreased amount of stimulus-locked oscillations.
