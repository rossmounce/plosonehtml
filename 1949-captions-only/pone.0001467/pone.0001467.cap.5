                Figure 5.  Correlation between reaction times and alpha-rhythm suppression.The scatter plot illustrates the positive inter-subject correlation (r = .50, p&lt;.04, N = 14) between the mean alpha-rhythm suppression in the ISI and the mean reaction time to the upcoming visual targets. Black dots represent the individual subjects' means across the three validity conditions.
