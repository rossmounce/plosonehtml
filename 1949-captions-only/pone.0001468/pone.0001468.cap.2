                Figure 2.  Transient induction of the MET3 promoter; a) Phase contrast, and fluorescence images of MET3pr-Venus-deg cells that were shifted to media lacking Met (0x Met) for 15 minutes at T = 420 min.Blue contours indicate cells whose mean fluorescence is monitored in (b). Top images show the phase contrast overlaid with the MYO1-mCherry budneck marker. Bottom images show the Venus fluorescence in the yellow channel. b) Quantification of mean cellular fluorescence as a function of time after media switch (indicated as grey shade). Each color curve represents a single (mother) cell. Several representative fits of the bold curves to the model (inset, see text) are shown as dashed lines. Inset: protein expression model used to analyze the fluorescence signal (see suppl. model for details). c) Measurement of Venus maturation time in cells carrying stable MET3pr-Venus; Cycloheximide (2 µg/ml) is added to the 0xMet media 30 minutes after MET3pr induction (gray shade). An abrupt cessation of growth ensues 21 min later as defined by the intersection of the two exponential fits (dashed) to the colony growth size (red curve, in square pixel units) in the top panel. Bottom: Colored curves show the kinetics of single cell fluorescence. Solid black lines are representative exponential fits to determine the maturation rate b. d) Histogram of the maturation half-time &lt;Tβ&gt; = ln(2)/β measured by fitting individual cells as in (c) : &lt;Tβ&gt; = ln(2)/β = 18.5+/−0.4 min, COV = 0.16. e) Single cell histograms of Venus-deg protein degradation half-time &lt;Tα&gt; = ln(2)/α and expression rate γ; &lt;Tα&gt; = ln(2)/α = 39.2+/−1.4 min, COV = 0.23, &lt;γ&gt; = 7.3+/−0.3, COV = 0.25. f) Integrated mean fluorescence as function of pulse duration (red dots); black dots are predicted using the model, the mean model parameters, and the imposed pulse duration. g) Fraction of blocked cells in a strain that requires CLN2 expression from the MET3pr after division for cell cycle progression, as a function of the time between the switch to 10xMet media and division. This sets a stringent bound on the turnoff time of MET3pr; see text.
