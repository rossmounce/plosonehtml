                Figure 3.  Comparison of expression rates among different promoters; A log scale was used to display signals with different orders of magnitudes; (a-c) Mean fluorescence vs time for various Met induction levels following a media shift.The black curve in (a) is a prediction from the gene expression model fit to the data in Fig. 2, and it is repeated in (b-c) to show that it continues to match the initial increase. The lower black curves in (b-c) are the model with the expression rate γ adjusted to match the asymptotic value (and the other parameters unchanged). d) Induction of the GAL1 promoter following the switch from SCR to SCR+1.5% galactose; The black line is a fit using the same parameters determined in Fig. 2, except γ has been changed to 28; e) Constitutive expression of the ACT1 promoter; f) Expression from the CLN2 promoter. The curves have been shifted to overlay and the black curve is a fit of our model with γ = 10 and an effective pulse duration of 15 minutes. The maturation and degradation parameters are from Fig. 2. f) Comparison of expression rates and steady-state levels for the different promoters, with the MET3 promoter normalized to 100.
