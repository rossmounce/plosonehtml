The lower black curves in (b-c) are the model with the expression rate γ adjusted to match the asymptotic value (and the other parameters unchanged). d) Induction of the GAL1 promoter following the switch from SCR to SCR+1.5% galactose; The black line is a fit using the same parameters determined in <a href="#pone-0001468-g002">Fig. 2</a>, except γ has been changed to 28; e) Constitutive expression of the ACT1 promoter; f) Expression from the CLN2 promoter. The curves have been shifted to overlay and the black curve is a fit of our model with γ = 10 and an effective pulse duration of 15 minutes. The maturation and degradation parameters are from <a href="#pone-0001468-g002">Fig. 2</a>. f) Comparison of expression rates and steady-state levels for the different promoters, with the MET3 promoter normalized to 100.</p>
