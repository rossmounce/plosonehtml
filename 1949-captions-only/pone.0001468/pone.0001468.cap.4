                Figure 4.  G1/S and mitotic exit trigger; a,e) Sketches of the genetic networks involved in triggering of the G1/S transition and anaphase b,f) The fluorescent markers and design of the periodic pulses c,g) Overlay of phase and fluorescence images during a pulsing experiment.The colors correspond to the schematic in the panel above and the times are chosen to coincide with the events in the schematic. The rows correspond to three successive periods. d) Phase and fluorescence for the growth of WT cells, rows spaced by one doubling-time.
