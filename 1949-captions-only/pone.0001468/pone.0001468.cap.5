The grey band indicates the pulses of SCD+0xMet. b) For the mitotic trigger, bud state is blue, the onset of anaphase is indicated in red, and the SCG pulse is the grey band. c-e) Phylogenies showing the budded/unbudded periods for all descendents of a founder cell, with pulsing bands overlayed where appropriate : c) the G1/S trigger; d) the mitotic exit trigger; e) WT cells.</p>
