                Figure 5.  Quantitation of the periodic trigger experiments.a) Time traces of the fluorescent markers used in the G1/S trigger: bud state (blue, 1 is budded) and WHI5 location inferred from the its covariance (red points and dashed line fit), high values are nuclear. The grey band indicates the pulses of SCD+0xMet. b) For the mitotic trigger, bud state is blue, the onset of anaphase is indicated in red, and the SCG pulse is the grey band. c-e) Phylogenies showing the budded/unbudded periods for all descendents of a founder cell, with pulsing bands overlayed where appropriate : c) the G1/S trigger; d) the mitotic exit trigger; e) WT cells.
