                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the models of the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch.(A) The Direct Model. (B) The Indirect Model. (C) The Direct Model I, considering Activated Bax/Bak-anti-apoptotics interaction. (D) The Direct Model II, considering Bax/Bak auto-activation. Abbreviations used: Ena (Enabler), Act (Activator), Bcl2 (Anti-apoptotics), InBax (No-activated Bax/Bak), AcBax (Activated Bax/Bak), MAC (Bax oligomer, Mitochondrial Apoptosis Channel), BH-3 (BH-3 only proteins). Arrows represent material flow and catalyzed reaction. Black lines terminated by a bar denote interaction and inhibition.
