(B) The Direct Model II. For any given production rate of Activator (0.001~0.010), the percentage of parameter sets that exhibits bistability are plotted. No Fix: All of the parameters are varied +/−20% from its default value. Fix: The production rates of Bcl-2 family proteins (p1~p4) are fixed while all other parameters are varied +/−20% from its default value for each sample run.</p>
