The initial concentration of Act is adopted as [Act]<sub>0</sub> = 8 nM (estimated as 4800 Molecule per cell). The red line is the result from a deterministic simulation and the green line is the average of 10000 stochastic simulations. 10 of the stochastic simulation time-series are plotted as blue lines.</p>
