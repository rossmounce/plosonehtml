                Figure 5.  Time-series of the Activated Bax/Bak (AcBax) by deterministic and stochastic simulations.The production rate of Activator is set to be p2 = 0.0052 nM/s (estimated as 3.14 Molecule/s per cell). The initial concentration of Act is adopted as [Act]0 = 8 nM (estimated as 4800 Molecule per cell). The red line is the result from a deterministic simulation and the green line is the average of 10000 stochastic simulations. 10 of the stochastic simulation time-series are plotted as blue lines.
