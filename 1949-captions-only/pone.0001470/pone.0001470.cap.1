                Figure 1.  Activations for the Local ([Ldiff–Same]) (red) and Global ([Gdiff–Same]) (blue) contrasts superimposed on a tilted (pitch: −0.5) normalised average structural scan covering STS.Activations are thresholded at p&lt;0.005 (uncorrected), for display purposes. Plots show the BOLD signal at local maxima in left and right pSTS. See also Figure S1.
