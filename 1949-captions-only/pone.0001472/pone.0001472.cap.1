                Figure 1.  Multiple alignments of leptin amino acids sequences.Residues identical to Gorilla leptin are presented as dots (.). The predicted motifs are shaded by different colors [protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (PKC) are yellow; casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (CK2) are red; N-glycosylation sites are green). Underlined amino acid sequences indicate the motif of the ATP synthase α and β subunit signature site. The numbers at the right are the total numbers of amino acids. Two cysteine residues at 96 and 146 are indicated by asterisks.
