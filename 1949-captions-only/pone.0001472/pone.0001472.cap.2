                Figure 2.  Maximum likelihood tree of the ob gene and mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene.(A) shows the phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of ob gene. Node A indicates reconstructed ancestral sequences. Branch B indicates the pika branch. (B) shows the phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. The scale bar of “0.1” means 0.1 nucleotide substitution per site.
