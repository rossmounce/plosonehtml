                Figure 3.  Relationship between mean rates of synonymous substitution (Ks), non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and amino acid substitution (Aa) relative to outgroup and altitude (in m) and mean January actual temperature (Tjanu, °C).(A) shows the relationship between mean rates of Ks, Ka and Aa relative to outgroup and altitude (in m). (B) shows the relationship between mean rates of Ks, Ka and Aa relative to outgroup and mean January actual temperature ((Tjanu, °C).
