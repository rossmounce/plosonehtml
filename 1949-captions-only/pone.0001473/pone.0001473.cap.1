                Figure 1.  Phagocytosis of white and opaque C. albicans by D. melanogaster S2 and M. musculus RAW cells.White (A,C) or opaque (B,D) C. albicans cells were co-incubated with S2 cells for 3.5 hours (A,B) or RAW cells for 1 hour (C,D), lightly fixed with formaldehyde, stained with rabbit anti-Candida and Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies. Cells were then stained with a DAPI solution (blue) to localize S2 or RAW cells. C. albicans cells that were not phagocytosed appear orange in these figures.
