The number of S2 cells phagocytosing one or more <em>C. albicans</em> cells was determined. (B) For the same sets of S2 cells, the number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed by S2 cells was quantified and the total number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed divided by the number of S2 cells scored, referred to as the phagocytic index, was plotted. Values plotted are the averages from four data sets from a given day and error bars represent the standard deviation. 100 S2 cells were counted for each data set. For the 3.5 hour time point, statistical significance of differences from the white a/a strain was evaluated using a t-test assuming unequal variance, sets with p&lt;.001 are marked with an asterisk.</p>
