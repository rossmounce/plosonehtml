                Figure 3.  S2 cells preferentially phagocytose white C. albicans from a mixed white-opaque population.(A) D. melanogaster S2 cells were co-incubated with equal numbers of white and opaque C. albicans for 1, 2, and 3.5 hours. The number of S2 cells phagocytosing one or more C. albicans cells was determined. (B) For the same S2 cells, the number of C. albicans cells phagocytosed was quantified and the total number of C. albicans cells phagocytosed divided by the number of S2 cells scored, referred to as the phagocytic index, was plotted. 100 S2 cells were counted for each data set; values reflect the average of six data sets. For the 3.5 hour time point, statistical significance of differences from the a/a whites was determined using a t-test and differences with p&lt;.001 are marked with an asterisk.
