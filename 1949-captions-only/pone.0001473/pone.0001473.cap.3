The number of S2 cells phagocytosing one or more <em>C. albicans</em> cells was determined. (B) For the same S2 cells, the number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed was quantified and the total number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed divided by the number of S2 cells scored, referred to as the phagocytic index, was plotted. 100 S2 cells were counted for each data set; values reflect the average of six data sets. For the 3.5 hour time point, statistical significance of differences from the a/a whites was determined using a t-test and differences with p&lt;.001 are marked with an asterisk.</p>
