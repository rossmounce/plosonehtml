                Figure 4.  M. musculus RAW cells more efficiently phagocytose white than opaque C. albicans.(A) M. musculus RAW cells were co-incubated with white or opaque C. albicans for 1 hour then stained using the same methods as for S2 cells. The number of RAW cells phagocytosing one or more C. albicans cells was determined. (B) The number of C. albicans cells phagocytosed was quantified and used to calculate and plot the total number of C. albicans cells phagocytosed divided by the number of RAW cells scored, referred to as the phagocytic index. (C) M. musculus RAW cells were co-incubated with equal numbers of white and opaque C. albicans for 1 hour. The number of RAW cells phagocytosing one or more C. albicans cells was determined. (D) For the same RAW cells, the number of C. albicans cells phagocytosed was quantified and the phagocytic index plotted. 100 RAW cells were counted for each data set and values plotted are the average of four (A,B) or six (C,D) data sets with error bars representing standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences from the a/a whites was determined using a t-test and differences with p&lt;.001 are marked with an asterisk.
