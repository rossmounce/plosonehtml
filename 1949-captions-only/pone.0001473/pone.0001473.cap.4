The number of RAW cells phagocytosing one or more <em>C. albicans</em> cells was determined. (B) The number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed was quantified and used to calculate and plot the total number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed divided by the number of RAW cells scored, referred to as the phagocytic index. (C) <em>M. musculus</em> RAW cells were co-incubated with equal numbers of white and opaque <em>C. albicans</em> for 1 hour. The number of RAW cells phagocytosing one or more <em>C. albicans</em> cells was determined. (D) For the same RAW cells, the number of <em>C. albicans</em> cells phagocytosed was quantified and the phagocytic index plotted. 100 RAW cells were counted for each data set and values plotted are the average of four (A,B) or six (C,D) data sets with error bars representing standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences from the a/a whites was determined using a t-test and differences with p&lt;.001 are marked with an asterisk.</p>
