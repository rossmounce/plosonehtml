<h4>Numbers Analyzed</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>The ITT population comprised 2153 participants who were consented, enrolled and randomized to treatment (1076 in the SAVVY group and 1077 in the placebo group). Effectiveness analyses were conducted on the Effectiveness Population, a subset of the ITT Population with 2082 participants who had HIV testing after enrollment (1041 in both SAVVY and placebo groups; other women never returned for a follow-up visit or had missing data). Safety endpoints were assessed in the Safety Population, the subset of the ITT Population with 2088 participants who returned after enrollment and provided safety data (1043 SAVVY and 1045 placebo). The Evaluable Population included the same participants as the Effectiveness Population (N = 2082) but excluded person-time observed on a participant after her first documented interruption of product use.</p>


<h4>Baseline Data</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>Most ITT participants in both groups were young (mean age 23.6) and unmarried (<a href="#pone-0001474-t001">Table 1</a>). The most commonly used contraceptive method at baseline was the male condom (SAVVY 72.1%; placebo 68.9%), with oral contraceptives next most frequent (8.9% SAVVY; 8.3% placebo). Some participants also reported dual method use. Most participants had received more than 9 years of education, and were students, or worked in trade or commercial jobs. Other demographic characteristics and medical history were also similar in the two groups (<a href="#pone-0001474-t001">Table 1</a>). About 3.3% of ITT participants were excluded from the Effectiveness Population, and their sociodemographic features (not shown) were virtually the same as the ITT Population.</p>
