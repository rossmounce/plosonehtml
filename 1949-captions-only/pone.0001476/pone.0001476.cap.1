                Figure 1.  Taxol crystals resemble asters and bundles formed in the presence of Taxol-stabilized microtubules.(A) Two asters (top and middle) and one bundle (bottom) formed in the presence of Taxol and fluorescently labeled tubulin, as in text. Paired images with DIC (left) and fluorescent (right) optics. (B) DIC images of a Taxol crystal aster (top) and bundle (bottom), formed in the absence of tubulin. Bars, 10 Âµm.
