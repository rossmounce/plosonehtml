(B) An equilibrium solution of fluorescently labeled tubulin (green haze) and microtubules was released as in (A), and decorated a Taxol ‘bow-tie’ (i.e., nonspherical) crystal aster (half of aster is visible, in upper right). Again, the crystal was instantly labeled by subunits, which diffuse more rapidly than microtubules. Microtubules did not appear to contribute to the brightness of the tubulin-decorated crystal, as fluorescence intensity did not increase over time. Thus, microtubules did not appear to play a major role in decorating the Taxol crystal. The arrow tracks the path of a single microtubule that briefly made contact with the aster, but diffused away. The shallow aqueous puddle containing the crystal aster is outlined in the first panel. Time in seconds. Bars, 10 µm.</p>
