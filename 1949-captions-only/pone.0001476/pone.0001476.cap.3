Asters were not visible at or below 0.88 µM Taxol. These results are consistent with the low solubility of Taxol in aqueous solution <a href="#pone.0001476-Mathew1">[19]</a>. (B) Taxol crystals, formed in 20 µM Taxol in aqueous buffer. Asters were visualized by DIC microscopy 24 hours after preparation. Compare to the smaller, less-dense aster in <a href="#pone-0001476-g001">Fig. 1 B</a>, which was visualized within 10–60 minutes. Crystals were not a solvent-induced artifact, as no structures were visible in a control solution lacking Taxol. Bars, 10 µm.</p>
