                Figure 3.  Concentration- and time-dependence of aster formation.(A) Fluorescently labeled Taxol-induced asters (DIC and fluorescent optics) formed in polymerization solutions stabilized with a concentration gradient of Taxol (left to right): 0.92 µM, 1.0 µM, 10 µM, 20 µM. Asters were not visible at or below 0.88 µM Taxol. These results are consistent with the low solubility of Taxol in aqueous solution [19]. (B) Taxol crystals, formed in 20 µM Taxol in aqueous buffer. Asters were visualized by DIC microscopy 24 hours after preparation. Compare to the smaller, less-dense aster in Fig. 1 B, which was visualized within 10–60 minutes. Crystals were not a solvent-induced artifact, as no structures were visible in a control solution lacking Taxol. Bars, 10 µm.
