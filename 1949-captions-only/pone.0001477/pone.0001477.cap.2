                Figure 2.  Changes of cell volume during mitosis.(A) Population analysis (average +/âˆ’ standard deviation) of cell volume determined in 6 experiments for 10 single cells imaged during prophase, metaphase and last stages of cytokinesis. The most external pixels of the EGFP-CAAX signal were used to generate the mask (inset). The statistical significance of the volume difference between the cell cycle stages was calculated using the t-Student test (p&lt;0.001). (B) Same analysis than in (A), but with the most internal pixels of the EGFP-CAAX signal were used to generate the mask (inset). (C) Individual representation of the volume data presented in (A). To facilitate the comparisons, the volume of each cell during metaphase was normalized to a relative value of 1.
