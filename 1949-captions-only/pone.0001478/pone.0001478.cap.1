The remaining susceptibles could receive prophylaxis (S<sup>P</sup>) during a given time; if not infected at the end of prophylaxis duration they re-enter the susceptible compartment. Susceptibles receiving or not prophylaxis could use masks (S<sup>PM</sup> and S<sup>M</sup> respectively, with S<sup>PM</sup> becoming S<sup>M</sup> if not infected at the end of antiviral administration period). Once infected, individuals enter the non-infectious latent state (E or E<sup>P</sup> if under prophylaxis). Infectious symptomatic individuals (I) could be treated (I<sup>T</sup>) (assuming that treatment is administrated in the first day of symptoms, individuals under therapy pass directly from E to I<sup>T</sup> compartment), isolated (I<sup>Is</sup>) or both (I<sup>TIs</sup>). The R compartment contains all individuals who have been ill and those of latents under prophylaxis that did not develop symptoms.</p>
