                Figure 5.  Spatial and temporal spread of Profile A.The pandemic would start in Melbourne and reach all 52 cities of our network. The peak would be reached in all cities affected in less then two months (46 days after the first case). The mean time between peaks in two successively affected cities would be around 8 days. This extreme speed of spread would be associated with a relatively short total duration (89 days).
