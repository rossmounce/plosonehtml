                Figure 1.  Expression pattern of pancreas-specific genes at 96 hpf in mib mutants and their wild type (wt) siblings.The RNA probes used for in situ hybridization are (A and A′–D′) elastaseA, (E and E′–H′) trypsin, (I and I′–L′) somatostatin and (M and M′–P′) insulin. The genotypes are (A, A′, E, E′, I, I′, M and M′) wt, (B′, F′, J′ and N′) mibtfi91, (C′, G′, K′ and O′) mibm132 and (D′, H′, L′ and P′) mibta52b. A′, E′, I′ and M′ are cropped from A, E, I and M, respectively. All panels are lateral views and anterior to the right.
