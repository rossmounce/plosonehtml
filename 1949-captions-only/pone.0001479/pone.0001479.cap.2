                Figure 2.  elastaseA-GFP, insulin-GFP and pdx1-GFP expression in embryos of mib mutant alleles and their wt siblings.Expression of elastaseA-GFP in (A) wt, (B) mibtfi91, (C) mibm132 and (D) mibta52b embryos was analyzed at 96 hpf. Expression of insulin-GFP in (E and E′) wt, (F′) mibtfi91, (G′) mibm132 and (H′) mibta52b embryos was analyzed at 72 hpf. Expression of pdx1-GFP in (I and I′) wt, (J′) mibtfi91, (K′) mibm132 and (L′) mibta52b embryos was analyzed at 72 hpf. Panels A–D are lateral views and the rest are dorsolateral views, oriented anterior to the right.
