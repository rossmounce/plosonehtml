                Figure 3.  Venn diagrams show numbers of genes belonging to different groups.Differentially expressed genes specific to each mib mutant allele, common between two mutant alleles and common to all three mutant alleles are (A) up-regulated and (B) down-regulated at 72 hpf; and (C) up-regulated and (D) down-regulated at 48 hpf; and genes specific to each time point, common between two time points and common to all three time points are (E) up-regulated and (F) down-regulated in mibta52b mutants. Gene set for the analysis of 72-hpf data was selected based on the criteria, q = 0.0 and score(d)&gt;4.0; and for the analysis of 48-hpf data and the three time-point data for mibta52b mutants were both selected based on the criterion, q = 0.0.
