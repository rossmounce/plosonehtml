                Figure 5.  Pictorial representation of significantly up-regulated or down-regulated genes (q = 0.0, score(d)&gt;4.0) categorized based on known/related biological functions as assigned in the zebrafish gene ontology database (Unigene Build 85).Genes in each functional group were searched by using specific or related key words appropriate for that function in the lists of differentially regulated genes for each allele, common 91 genes in all three mib mutant alleles, and the genes specific to each mutant allele. Absolute number of genes in each category is shown next to the corresponding pie sector. (A–D) Pie charts show numbers of genes belonging to different functional categories. (E–H) Pie charts show numbers of genes (excluding the genes without any known function) in different categories.
