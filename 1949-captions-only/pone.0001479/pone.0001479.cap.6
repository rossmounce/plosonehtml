<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p>Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were shown to be affected in <em>mib</em> mutants <a href="#pone.0001479-Itoh1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001479-Riley1">[54]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001479-Amoyel1">[55]</a>. We mapped the genes that are involved in these two signaling pathways and differentially expressed in different <em>mib</em> alleles. The genes involved in Notch signaling, such as <em>dll1, notch1, notch2, hey1</em> and <em>herp</em>, were down-regulated in one, two or three <em>mib</em> alleles (<a href="#pone.0001479.s021">Figure S1A</a>). In Wnt/β-catenin signaling, some genes, such as <em>nlk, cx43</em>, <em>sox2, sox3, sox4, sox9, sox11, tcf7</em> and <em>hdac1</em>, were down-regulated in one or three <em>mib</em> alleles; while <em>sox8</em> and <em>tab1</em> were up-regulated (<a href="#pone.0001479.s021">Figure S1B</a>). Few of the genes differed in the direction of expression change in different mutant alleles. For example, <em>β-catenin</em> was up-regulated in <em>mib<sup>m132</sup></em> while it was down-regulated in <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> and <em>mib<sup>tfi91</sup></em> (<a href="#pone.0001479.s021">Figure S1B</a>).</p>


<h4>Putative Notch signaling related genes</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>As positive controls of our microarray data, we searched for the known Notch signaling related genes in our list of differentially expressed genes. As expected, <em>heyL</em> was up-regulated and <em>dla, her4</em>, <em>her8a</em>, <em>hes5</em>, <em>hey1</em>, <em>neurod</em>, <em>neurod4</em>, <em>notch1a</em>, <em>notch2</em> and <em>notch3</em> were down-regulated (<a href="#pone-0001479-t002">Table 2</a>). To identify novel genes related to Notch signaling, we searched for the differentially expressed genes occurring at least two times in the gene sets common to all three <em>mib</em> mutant alleles at 72 hpf and 48 hpf, and the gene set common for the <em>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></em> mutant allele at 72 hpf, 48 hpf and 24 hpf. We identified 31 such genes, the majority of which are novel genes or ESTs (<a href="#pone.0001479.s016">Table S16</a>). Of these 31 genes, only eight genes are characterized and five of them are known to be directly related to Notch signaling: <em>olig2</em> <a href="#pone.0001479-Park1">[56]</a>, <em>her4</em> <a href="#pone.0001479-Takke1">[57]</a>, <em>hes5</em> (also known as <em>her15.1</em>, <a href="#pone.0001479-Bae1">[58]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001479-Shankaran1">[59]</a>), <em>dla</em> <a href="#pone.0001479-Appel1">[60]</a> and <em>nort</em> (<a href="#pone.0001479-Tsutsumi1">[61]</a>, BI886648 is 98% identical to AB259590). Moreover, <em>fn1l</em> (also known as <em>fn1b</em> or <em>fn3</em>), in conjunction with its homolog, <em>fn1</em>, has been shown to function cooperatively with Notch signaling via integrinα5 in somitogenesis <a href="#pone.0001479-Jlich2">[62]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001479-Chong1">[63]</a>. <em>gfap</em> and <em>gefiltin</em> are glia- and neuron-specific structural proteins respectively and, therefore, indirectly linked to Notch-modulated gliogenesis and neurogenesis <a href="#pone.0001479-Irvin1">[64]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001479-Leake1">[66]</a>. These observations suggest that a certain proportion of the 23 novel genes/ESTs are very likely to be involved in or related to Notch signaling.</p>
