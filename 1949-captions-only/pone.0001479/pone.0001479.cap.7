                Figure 7.  Validation of expression profile of differentially expressed genes with fluorescent double in situ hybridization.Expression of down-regulated genes: (A and B) isl1, (C and D) cad and (E and F) wu:fb59c09 and up-regulated genes: (G and H) spon1b and (I and J) isl3 in (B, D, F, H and J) mibta52b mutants embryos and (A, C, E, G and I) wild-type embryos. Left panels show respective gene expression in green; middle panels show insulin (endocrine) or trypsin (exocrine) expression in red; right panels show merged pictures. Expression of wu:fb59c09 is shown in 4-dpf embryos, and the rest are in 3-dpf embryos. All embryos are anterior to the left and ventral views.
