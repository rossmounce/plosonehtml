Three variants of the EGFP gene inactivated with a premature termination codon introduced by site-directed mutagenesis were used 1) The G of the TAG termination codon at the position 182 is embedded within the RGYW hotspot motif and is thus a potential target of AID 2) The TAG stop codon at position 52 lies within two RGYW motifs 3) TAA codon at position 52 is used to monitor A:T mutations only. RGYW motifs are shown in bold letters. The mutated nucleotides are underlined.</p>
