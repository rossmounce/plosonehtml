                Figure 2.  AID is transcribed in the Jurkat-AID and not in the control Jurkat cell line.AID transcription was monitored with RT-PCR in a control cell line, Jurkat, and in a Jurkat-AID cell line stably transfected with AID. A Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos constitutively expressing AID was used as a positive control for AID expression. G3PDH was used as an internal control. The bands corresponding to AID (380 bp) and G3PDH (1000 bp) are shown with black arrows.
