Cells that have reverted the stop codon of one or more copies of the vector appear fluorescent. The percentage of fluorescent cells relative to transfection efficiency was monitored using a wild-type EGFP vector. The experiment was repeated 4 times. An average of 8.1% of transfected Jurkat-AID cells reverted the stop codon, compared to 0.29% of non-transfected Jurkat cells.</p>
