                Figure 4.  Mutations can be detected very rapidly using SHM vectors.Jurkat and Jurkat-AID cells were transfected with the pmutEGFP-TAG182 SHM vector. Fluorescent cells were detected 3 and 24 hours after transfection. Three hours after transfection, 0.23% of fluorescent Jurkat-AID cells are observed and 1.68% had reverted 24 hours after transfection.
