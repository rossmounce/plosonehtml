The experiment was repeated four times for TAG-182 and TAG-52 codons and three times for the TAA-52 codon. The average value of these independent experiments is represented. The percentage of fluorescent cells was calculated relative to transfection efficiency which was monitored using a wild-type EGFP vector. Twenty hours after transfection, 8.1% of Jurkat-AID cells reverted the TAG-182 codon, 27.08% the TAG-52 codon and 13.22% the TAA codon. Less than 1% of Jurkat cells reverted TAG-182 and TAA-52 codons and TAG-52 reverted in 3.97% of the transfected cells.</p>
