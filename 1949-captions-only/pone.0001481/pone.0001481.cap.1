                Figure 1.  Computational analyses and homology modelling of the H. pylori and E. coli ICD protein sequences, structures and properties.A. The two proteins were analyzed for different helices, coils and turns, hydrophilicity, antigenicity and surface probability etc. using Protean software in the DNAstar package. Antigenicity index (Jameson-Wolf) of H. pylori ICD was found to be higher (3.4) than the E. coli ICD. B. We built a homology model of the H. pylori ICD (Using Modeller 6) based on crystal structure of E. coli ICD (PDB code: 1AI2). Shown here is a comparison of backbone organization of H. Pylori (26695) ICD with that of E. coli; E. coli (red), H. pylori (green), NADP (blue), ICA (yellow). Structures of the two ICDs were found to be significantly different as regards to the surface exposed loops (RMS Deviation 0.45) corresponding to putative, immunogenic epitopes (arrows).
