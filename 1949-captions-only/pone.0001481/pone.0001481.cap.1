The two proteins were analyzed for different helices, coils and turns, hydrophilicity, antigenicity and surface probability etc. using Protean software in the DNAstar package. Antigenicity index (Jameson-Wolf) of <em>H. pylori</em> ICD was found to be higher (3.4) than the <em>E. coli</em> ICD. B. We built a homology model of the <em>H. pylori</em> ICD (Using Modeller 6) based on crystal structure of <em>E. coli</em> ICD (PDB code: 1AI2). Shown here is a comparison of backbone organization of <em>H. Pylori</em> (26695) ICD with that of <em>E. coli</em>; <em>E. coli</em> (red), <em>H. pylori</em> (green), NADP (blue), ICA (yellow). Structures of the two ICDs were found to be significantly different as regards to the surface exposed loops (RMS Deviation 0.45) corresponding to putative, immunogenic epitopes (arrows).</p>
