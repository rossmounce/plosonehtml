                Figure 3.  Specific antibody responses to ICD protein depicted as ELISA titers.Serum Antibodies were detected by the recombinant, H. pylori ICD in sera samples of patients with gastroduodenal pathology such as gastritis and ulcer and were compared to clinically healthy individuals, 18 of those were detected negative by UBA. Table in the inset reveals significance or otherwise of the student's t test for the antibody titers obtained for various disease conditions. Two tailed p values were obtained through student's t test with a 95% power (level of significance) and a minimally significant p value of 0.05.
