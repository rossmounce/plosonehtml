Table in the inset reveals significance or otherwise of the student's <em>t</em> test for the antibody titers obtained for various disease conditions. Two tailed <em>p</em> values were obtained through student's <em>t</em> test with a 95% power (level of significance) and a minimally significant <em>p</em> value of 0.05.</p>
