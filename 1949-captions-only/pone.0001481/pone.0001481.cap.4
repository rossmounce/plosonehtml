                Figure 4.  Results of the IL-8 ELISA performed using cultured human macrophages stimulated by the recombinant ICD of H. pylori.ELISA titers from unstimulated (US) macrophages were used as negative control and those from macrophages stimulated with a known proinflammatory protein JHP940 [30] were used as a positive control. ICD did not induce any significant IL-8 response as compared to control; the JHP940 protein on the other hand revealed significantly high levels of IL-8 as compared to ICD (p&lt;0.0218).
