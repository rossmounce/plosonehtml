(A) Wild type cells were treated for 4 h, then lysed and immunoprecipitated with VDR or HA (unrelated; UR) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates (top two panels) or total lysates (bottom four panels) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (B) Cells were transiently transfected with TOPFlash and FOPFlash. Values correspond to the ratio of TOP/FOP. (c–f) Cells were transiently transfected with 4×VDRE luciferase reporter (C–E) or K15 promoter (F) constructs. All values were corrected for the Renilla control and are represented as fold increase relative to wild type cells treated with vehicle alone. Data are means±S.D. of triplicate samples.</p>
