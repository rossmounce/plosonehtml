                Figure 1.  β-catenin is a ligand dependent co-activator of VDR.Primary mouse keratinocytes derived from wild type, VDR null (VDR-KO) or K14ΔNLef1 transgenic (ΔN-Lef1) mice were treated with vehicle (-), 10−7 M EB1089 or 100 ng/ml Wnt3A, alone or in combination. (A) Wild type cells were treated for 4 h, then lysed and immunoprecipitated with VDR or HA (unrelated; UR) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates (top two panels) or total lysates (bottom four panels) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (B) Cells were transiently transfected with TOPFlash and FOPFlash. Values correspond to the ratio of TOP/FOP. (c–f) Cells were transiently transfected with 4×VDRE luciferase reporter (C–E) or K15 promoter (F) constructs. All values were corrected for the Renilla control and are represented as fold increase relative to wild type cells treated with vehicle alone. Data are means±S.D. of triplicate samples.
