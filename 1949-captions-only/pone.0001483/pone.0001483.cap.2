                Figure 2.  Ligand activated VDR-β-catenin complexes regulate transcription of hair follicle genes.(A–D) Cells were treated for 4 h (B–D) or 8 h (a) with (+) or without (−) Wnt3A or EB1089. (A) mRNA levels of the genes indicated were measured by real-time PCR. All values are represented as fold increase relative to wild type cells treated with vehicle alone. Data are means±S.D. of triplicate samples. (B–D) Wild type cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with VDR, β-catenin, Lef1 or unrelated antibody (HA tag; UR). Immunoprecipitated genomic DNA fragments or input controls were amplified by real-time PCR using specific primers for three regions of the mouse promoters indicated or unrelated genomic primers (UR). Data are means±S.D. of triplicate samples. Scaled diagrams summarize location of VDREs and TCF/Lef binding sites and the proteins bound to each region in cells treated with Wnt3A and EB1089.
