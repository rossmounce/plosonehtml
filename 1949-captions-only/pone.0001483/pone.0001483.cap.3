                Figure 3.  EB1089 stimulates differentiation of ectopic hair follicles formation in the D4 line of K14ΔNβ-cateninER transgenic mice.Epidermal whole mounts (A–D) or sections (E–X) of wild type (WT) or transgenic (β-cat-D4) tail skin treated with 4OHT and/or EB1089. (A–D) Immunolabelling for keratin 17 (green) with Hoechst (blue) and phalloidin-TRITC (red) counterstaining. Arrows indicate ectopic hair follicles in the IFE (B, C) or SG (D). Inserts in (B, C) show higher magnification views of ectopic follicles. (E–X) Immunolabelling with the antibodies shown (green) in combination with Hoechst (blue; E–X), phalloidin-TRICT (red; E, F) or anti-keratin 14 (red; g-v). (C) Dashed square indicates an epidermal unit as previously described [5]. (F) Arrow indicates keratin 15 expression in ORS of ectopic HF. Insert shows base of an ectopic follicle. (K) Cells expressing K31 are indicated by an arrow and shown at higher magnification in insert. Asterisks indicate base of ectopic HFs encircling dermal papilla (F, S, N, X). Scale bars: 100 µm (A–D), 50 µm (E–X).
