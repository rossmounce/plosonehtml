(A–D) Macroscopic views of tail skin showing extent of hair growth. (E–L) Tail epidermal whole mounts immunolabelled with the antibodies indicated (green) and counterstained with Hoechst (blue) and phalloidin-TRICT (red). Arrows and dotted lines indicate ectopic HFs arising from SGs and arrowheads indicate residual HFs. Asterisks show nonspecific SG staining. (M-B') Immunostaining of tail skin sections with the antibodies indicated (green) and anti-keratin 14 (red) with Hoechst counterstain (blue). Scale bars: 100 µm.</p>
