                Figure 5.  VDR modulates β-catenin induced skin tumours.(A, B) K14ΔNβ-cateninER (D4) transgenic mice were treated with vehicle, 4OHT, EB1089 or 4OHT+EB1089 for 21 days. (A) Macroscopic appearance of tails. (B) H&amp;E stained tail skin sections. Arrows indicate parakeratosis and increased cornified layers. (C) H&amp;E stained tail skin sections of wild type and K14ΔNβ-cateninER (D4) transgenic mice that were heterozygous (+/−) or homozygous (−/−) null for VDR, following 4OHT treatment for 21 days. Arrows indicate ectopic HF formation. eHF: ectopic hair follicles; DP: dermal papilla; eDP: ectopic dermal papilla. (D, E) Human trichofolliculoma (D) and infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (E). Serial sections were stained with H&amp;E or immunolabelled for β-catenin (red) and VDR (green) with Hoescht counterstain (blue). Immunolabelling corresponds to boxed regions of H&amp;E stained sections. Arrowheads show nuclear β-catenin and VDR. Scale bars: 100 µm (B–E), 50 µm (inserts in d, e), 10 µm (Hoescht staining inserts d,e). (F) Diagram summarizing dual role of β-catenin as a coactivator of TCF/Lef and VDR in adult epidermis. Hair follicle differentiation requires both the canonical Wnt pathway and ligand activated VDR. In the absence of VDR differentiation is impaired, favoring tumor formation. CoR: co-repressor; β: β-catenin; red triangle: endogenous vitamin D3; red star: vitamin D analog EB1089. eHF: ectopic hair follicles.
