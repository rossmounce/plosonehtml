                Figure 1.   In silico analysis of the CDT2-INTS7 intergenic region.(A) Nucleotide sequence of the intergenic region of CDT2 and INTS7 genes. The sequences of seven mammalian genes are aligned and conserved nucleotides are marked with asterisks under the alignment. The bent arrows indicate the transcription start sites and direction of human genes (5′-CGATA— and 5′-AGCGC— for CDT2 and INTS7, respectively), canine genes, (5′-TCAGT— and 5′-AACAG— for CDT2 and INTS7, respectively), and mouse genes (5′-GGCGG— and 5′-CGCGG— for CDT2 and INTS7, respectively). The bent arrows positioned on the sequences are for CDT2. The bent arrows positioned under the sequences are for INTS7. Transfac software (threshold &gt;80) predicts four E2F consensus sites (E2F A~D, marked with dotted boxes), and Sp1 (5′-GAGGCGGGGA), NF-Y (5′-AAGCCAATCAG), CREB (5′-TGACGTCA), and Myb (5′-CCAAACTGAC) transcription factor-binding sites (marked by arrows with dotted lines). (B) Computer predicted threshold (Transfac software) of E2F A~D were summarized for seven mammalian genes.
