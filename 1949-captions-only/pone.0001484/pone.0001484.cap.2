                Figure 2.  Promoter analysis of the CDT2-INTS7 intergenic region.(A) The structure of human, mouse, and canine CDT2 and INTS7 genes in the head-to-head orientation. Translation start codons (represented by ATG) of the CDT2 and INTS7 genes are marked by bold arrows in white. Transcription start sites are indicated by the bent arrows. The transcription start site of CDT2 is designated as “+1”. Positive (negative) numbers are assigned to nucleotides downstream (upstream) of nucleotide +1. Arrowheads indicate the E2F consensus sites (threshold &gt;85). Arrows with numbers were the region and direction used for the luciferase (Luc) assay. (B) Luciferase expression of pGL3-human −363/+1, pGL3-mouse −335/+32, and pGL3-canine −312/+54 constructs in A549 cells are shown as fold induction with respect to the pGL3-Basic vector as 1. The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3). (C) Luciferase expression of pGL3-human −363/+1 (hereafter denoted as ABCD), pGL3-mouse −335/+32, and pGL3-canine −312/+54 constructs in A549 cells were up-regulated by co-expressing the E2F1, and are shown as fold induction with respect to the pcDNA3 vector as 1. The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3).
