                Figure 3.  The human CDT2-INTS7 intergenic region acts as a bidirectional promoter.(A) Structure of human CDT2 and INTS7 genes in the head-to-head orientation. Translation start codons (represented by ATG) of CDT2 and INTS7 genes are marked by bold arrows in white. Transcription start sites are indicated by the bent arrows. The transcription start site of CDT2 is designated as “+1”. Positive (negative) numbers are assigned to nucleotides downstream (upstream) of nucleotide +1. Arrowheads indicate E2F consensus sites (threshold &gt;85). Arrows with numbers represent the region and direction used for the luciferase (Luc) assay. (B) Luciferase expression of pGL3 constructs are summarized in (A) in A549 cells and are shown as fold induction with respect to the pGL3-Basic vector as 1. The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3).
