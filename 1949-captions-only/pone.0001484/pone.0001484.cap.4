Translation start codons (represented by ATG) of CDT2 and INTS7 genes are marked by bold arrows in white. Transcription start sites are indicated by the bent arrows. The transcription start site of CDT2 is designated as “+1”. Positive (negative) numbers are assigned to nucleotides downstream (upstream) of nucleotide +1. Arrowheads indicate E2F consensus sites (threshold &gt;85). Arrows with numbers represent the region and direction used for the luciferase (Luc) assay. (B) The levels of luciferase expression of human CDT2 deleted promoter constructs in A549 cells were tested with E2F1 coexpression, and are shown as fold induction with respect to the pcDNA3 vector as 1. The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3; asterisk, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 for pcDNA3 versus E2F1).</p>
