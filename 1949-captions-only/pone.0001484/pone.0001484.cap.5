The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3; asterisk, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 for ABCD versus ABCD Rev). (B) Luciferase expression of pGL3-ABCD co-transfected with indicated E2F members in cells are shown as fold induction with respect to the pGL3-Basic vector together with pcDNA3 as 1. The values reported for transfection experiments are the means±standard deviation (n = 3; asterisk, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 for pcDNA3 versus E2Fs). (C) Overexpression of E2F1 in A549 cells by adenovirus transfer resulted in the upregulation of CDT2 but not INTS7 mRNA. Western blot analysis of E2F1 and GAPDH in A549 cells infected with Ad-Control or Ad-E2F1. GAPDH was detected as a control. RT-PCR analysis of CDT2 and INTS7 mRNA expression levels are shown with or without E2F1 overexpression. GAPDH was detected as a control. RT-PCR products were derived from amplifications in the log range.</p>
