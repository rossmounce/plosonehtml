                Figure 2.  Clustal W alignment of amino acid sequences representing each P2 domain cluster.Deduced amino acid data for 27 of the 66 strains analysed were aligned to represent the 13 P2 domain clusters. Actual numbers of sequences found at each P2 domain cluster are shown in Table 1. * indicates a hotspot (â‰¥2aa changes at the site), and labelled arrows indicate sites putatively associated with antigenic change and cluster transition.
