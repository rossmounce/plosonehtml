                Figure 3.  Conformational P domain (strain VA387) showing positions of potentially significant variation hotspots.Hotspots identified as significant amino acid changes were mapped onto the crystal structure of strain VA387. Sites A and B are coloured magenta. RGD motif associated with the binding pocket described by Tan et al [25] is coloured yellow. The RGD motif associated with the epidemic in 2002 described in this paper is coloured gray. The sugar molecule indicates the position of the putative binding site proposed by Cao et al [24].
