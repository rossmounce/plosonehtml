Sites A and B are coloured magenta. RGD motif associated with the binding pocket described by Tan <em>et al</em> <a href="#pone.0001485-Tan2">[25]</a> is coloured yellow. The RGD motif associated with the epidemic in 2002 described in this paper is coloured gray. The sugar molecule indicates the position of the putative binding site proposed by Cao <em>et al</em> <a href="#pone.0001485-Cao1">[24]</a>.</p>
