                Figure 4.  Alignment comparing VA387 strain used in homology modelling with sequences representing epidemiologically significant clusters.Deduced amino acid sequences representing P2 domain clusters P2a, P2e and P2j were aligned with strain VA387 which was used in homology modelling. Key in the figure indicates domains of the VP1 protein. Shaded box indicates the conserved Î±-helix involved in dimerisation.
