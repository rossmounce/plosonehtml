                Figure 6.  Homology Model showing changes in electrostatic surface.Changes at site A and B were modelled onto the crystal structure of VA387 and the electrostatic surface calculated using default settings in Deep View Swiss PDB Viewer. Significant changes in the electrostatic surface were observed between clusters P2a and P2e, but not between P2a and P2j.
