(a) Two clusters (blue dots) were identified comprising sequences pre-2002 epidemic (<a href="#pone-0001485-t001">Table 1</a>), and share epitope shape at sites A and B, although differ in primary amino acid sequence. (b) Acquisition of point mutations at sites A and B around 2001–2002 that are sufficient to alter the conformational structure of VP1 occur concurrently, and thus this virus (orange dot) moves from one neutral network to occupy sequence space on a different neutral network. Change in conformational structure of putative epitope sites A and B following transition to a different neutral network gives these viruses a selective advantage as they are able to evade existing immunity in the population, thus resulting in the epidemic of gastroenteritis observed in 2002, as antibody-driven selection among the virus populations favours those on this, different, neutral network. (c) Following selection, the virus drifts through the sequence space of the neutral network, acquiring homologous substitutions in the primary amino acid sequence. (d) Acquisition of point mutations around 2005–2006 that connect the virus to a third neutral network then puts this virus at a selective advantage as it can evade existing immunity. Again, the result in epidemic gastroenteritis as observed in 2006 as selection drives transition from one neutral network to another. (e) The virus now drifts neutrally through the sequence space of this neutral network.</p>
