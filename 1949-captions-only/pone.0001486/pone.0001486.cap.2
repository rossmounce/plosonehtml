The RNA expression of <em>FMR1</em> and <em>FMR4</em> were normalized to whole embryo (set as 100%). Both transcripts are expressed in all the tissues tested with notably high expression of <em>FMR4</em> in the kidney and heart. (B) RNA was extracted from six postmortem human adult brains from three different regions, thereafter; cDNA synthesis followed by RT-PCR was performed on all samples to measure the relative quantities of <em>FMR1</em> and <em>FMR4</em>. Both <em>FMR1</em> and <em>FMR4</em> are highly expressed in all the human brain regions tested. (C) RT-PCR analysis of <em>FMR4</em> and <em>FMR1</em> in several regions of two monkeys brains. The RNA expression of <em>FMR4</em> and <em>FMR1</em> were normalized to the insula (set as 100%).</p>
