                Figure 2.  Expression analysis of FMR4.(A) RT-PCR analysis of FMR4 and FMR1 in seven different human fetal tissues (week 12), RNA from each tissue was pooled from at least three fetuses (GBiosciences). The RNA expression of FMR1 and FMR4 were normalized to whole embryo (set as 100%). Both transcripts are expressed in all the tissues tested with notably high expression of FMR4 in the kidney and heart. (B) RNA was extracted from six postmortem human adult brains from three different regions, thereafter; cDNA synthesis followed by RT-PCR was performed on all samples to measure the relative quantities of FMR1 and FMR4. Both FMR1 and FMR4 are highly expressed in all the human brain regions tested. (C) RT-PCR analysis of FMR4 and FMR1 in several regions of two monkeys brains. The RNA expression of FMR4 and FMR1 were normalized to the insula (set as 100%).
