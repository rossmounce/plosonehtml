Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that <em>FMR4</em>, similar to <em>FMR1</em>, is up-regulated in pre-mutation carriers and shut down in full mutation fragile X patients (P&lt;0.0001). (B) RNA from untransformed leucocytes were reversed transcribed and the cDNA was used for PCR analysis. <em>FMR4</em> is expressed in normal and premutation carriers but no bands were observed in the full mutation fragile X patients (35 cycles). <em>FMR1</em> bands were observed in normal, premutation, and one of the full mutation patients (35 cycles). To account for any possible DNA contamination, no reverse transcriptase control for all samples were used in the PCR (lanes next to bands are all negative indicating no DNA contamination was present). Error bars: s.d.</p>
