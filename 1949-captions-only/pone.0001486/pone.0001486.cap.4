                Figure 4.  FMR4 has a similar half-life to FMR1.HEK-293T cells were treated with Î±-amanitin (blocks RNA polymerase II) and the levels of FMR4 and FMR1 were measured by RT-PCR at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours post treatment. Both FMR4 and FMR1 have similar half-lives. These experiments also further confirm that FMR4 is a product of RNA polymerase II.
