                Figure 5.  No direct cross-regulation between FMR1 and FMR4.(A) We used three distinct siRNAs against FMR1 to transfect HEK-293T cells. Two out of the three siRNAs resulted in a significant knockdown of FMR1 (80%), but did not affect FMR4 RNA levels. (B) We used three distinct siRNAs against FMR4 to transfect HEK-293T cells. All three siRNAs resulted in a significant knockdown of FMR4 but did not affect FMR1 RNA levels. (C) Significant knockdown of FMR4 via siRNA C did not result in a change in FMR1 RNA levels at any of the time points tested (24, 48, 72, or 144 hours post transfection). (D) The entire sequence of FMR4 was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector with a CMV promoter. The pcDNA3.1 vector containing the FMR4 sequence and the original pcDNA3.1 (without the FMR4 insert) were transfected in HEK-293T cells. At 72 hours post transfection, RNA was isolated and reversed transcribed and used for RT-PCR analysis. There is a highly significant increase in the FMR4 RNA levels but no effect on FMR1 RNA.
