Two out of the three siRNAs resulted in a significant knockdown of <em>FMR1</em> (80%), but did not affect <em>FMR4</em> RNA levels. (B) We used three distinct siRNAs against <em>FMR4</em> to transfect HEK-293T cells. All three siRNAs resulted in a significant knockdown of <em>FMR4</em> but did not affect <em>FMR1</em> RNA levels. (C) Significant knockdown of <em>FMR4</em> via siRNA C did not result in a change in <em>FMR1</em> RNA levels at any of the time points tested (24, 48, 72, or 144 hours post transfection). (D) The entire sequence of <em>FMR4</em> was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector with a CMV promoter. The pcDNA3.1 vector containing the <em>FMR4</em> sequence and the original pcDNA3.1 (without the <em>FMR4</em> insert) were transfected in HEK-293T cells. At 72 hours post transfection, RNA was isolated and reversed transcribed and used for RT-PCR analysis. There is a highly significant increase in the <em>FMR4</em> RNA levels but no effect on <em>FMR1</em> RNA. Error bars: s.d.</p>
