                Figure 6.  FMR4 affects proliferation in human cells.(A) Cell proliferation assay showing that the knockdown of FMR4 via three distinct siRNAs in HEK-293T cells, but not knockdown of FMR1, resulted in decrease in cell proliferation in comparison to cells which are treated with a negative control siRNA. Cell proliferation was measured based on luciferase activity in these cells at 72 hours post siRNA transfection. (B) Cell proliferation assay showing that the knockdown of FMR4 via three distinct siRNAs in HeLa cells resulted in decrease in cell proliferation in comparison to cells which are treated with a negative control siRNA (P&lt;0.0001). (Câ€“D) In both HEK-293T and HeLa cells, overexpression of FMR4 resulted in an increase in cell proliferation in comparison to cells treated with a control vector. Error bars: s.d.
