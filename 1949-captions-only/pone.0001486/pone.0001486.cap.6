Cell proliferation was measured based on luciferase activity in these cells at 72 hours post siRNA transfection. (B) Cell proliferation assay showing that the knockdown of <em>FMR4</em> via three distinct siRNAs in HeLa cells resulted in decrease in cell proliferation in comparison to cells which are treated with a negative control siRNA (P&lt;0.0001). (Câ€“D) In both HEK-293T and HeLa cells, overexpression of <em>FMR4</em> resulted in an increase in cell proliferation in comparison to cells treated with a control vector. Error bars: s.d.</p>
