                Figure 7.  The effect of FMR4 on cell proliferation is not observed in non-primates.Since FMR4 is a primate-specific transcript we examined its effect on cell proliferation in non-primates using mouse N2A cells. We examined both the siRNA knockdown of FMR4 (as a negative control experiment) and the over-expression of FMR4 on cell proliferation in N2A cells. (A) Mouse N2A cells were transfected with FMR4 siRNA C and a control siRNA. Simultaneously, cells were transfected with pGL3 (luciferase) vector. At 72 hours post transfection luciferase activity was measured and data are graphed as a percentage of control siRNA. (B) Mouse N2A cells were transfected with FMR4 over-expression vector and a control vector (no FMR4 insert). Simultaneously, cells were transfected with pGL3 (luciferase) vector. At 72 hours post transfection luciferase activity was measured and data are graphed as a percentage of control vector. Unlike human cells which show an increase in cell proliferation when transfected with the FMR4 vector, mouse N2A cells did not show any change in proliferation.
