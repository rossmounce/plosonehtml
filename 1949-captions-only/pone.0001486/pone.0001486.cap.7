We examined both the siRNA knockdown of <em>FMR4</em> (as a negative control experiment) and the over-expression of <em>FMR4</em> on cell proliferation in N2A cells. (A) Mouse N2A cells were transfected with <em>FMR4</em> siRNA C and a control siRNA. Simultaneously, cells were transfected with pGL3 (luciferase) vector. At 72 hours post transfection luciferase activity was measured and data are graphed as a percentage of control siRNA. (B) Mouse N2A cells were transfected with <em>FMR4</em> over-expression vector and a control vector (no <em>FMR4</em> insert). Simultaneously, cells were transfected with pGL3 (luciferase) vector. At 72 hours post transfection luciferase activity was measured and data are graphed as a percentage of control vector. Unlike human cells which show an increase in cell proliferation when transfected with the <em>FMR4</em> vector, mouse N2A cells did not show any change in proliferation.</p>
