(B) Microscope images of cells (DAPI stained) treated with a control siRNA and cells treated with <em>FMR4</em> siRNA for 72 hours prior to a TUNEL assay. A significant number of cells are undergoing apoptosis (FITC) in the <em>FMR4</em> siRNA treated cells in comparison to the control siRNA treated cells. (C) Quantification of cells following a TUNEL assay indicated that there is at least a two-fold change in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the <em>FMR4</em> siRNA treated cells in comparison to the control siRNA treated cells.
