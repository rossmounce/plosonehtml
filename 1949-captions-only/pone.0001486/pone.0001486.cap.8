                Figure 8.  FMR4 has an antiapoptotic function in human cells.(A) Cell cycle analysis of control cells (red) and cells treated with two different siRNAs against FMR4 (green and blue) shows that knockdown of FMR4 resulted in a highly significant increase in the number of cells in Sub-G1 and a modest but significant decrease in the number of cells in the S phase suggesting a possible role in apoptosis. (B) Microscope images of cells (DAPI stained) treated with a control siRNA and cells treated with FMR4 siRNA for 72 hours prior to a TUNEL assay. A significant number of cells are undergoing apoptosis (FITC) in the FMR4 siRNA treated cells in comparison to the control siRNA treated cells. (C) Quantification of cells following a TUNEL assay indicated that there is at least a two-fold change in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the FMR4 siRNA treated cells in comparison to the control siRNA treated cells.
