                Figure 4.  Modulation of mitochondrial dynamics by MULAN requires its proper localization to the MOM.NIH3T3 cells were transfected with wild type or mitochondrial localization-defective MULAN mutants, together with MT-RFP. C339A is the RING finger-mutant control. Cells were fixed 24 h post-transfection and the percentage of RFP-positive cells with perinuclear-clustered mitochondria was determined.
