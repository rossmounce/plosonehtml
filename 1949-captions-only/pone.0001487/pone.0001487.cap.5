A single 2.4Kb band was detected for MULAN mRNA, in various tissues. B) RT-PCR of MULAN mRNA showed higher expression in mouse and rat adult primary cardiomyocytes (ACM) and in the mouse HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line, compared to mouse NIH-3T3 cells and to the rat skeletal muscle-like cell line H9c2. 18S rRNA and Cyclophilin B were used as controls.</p>
