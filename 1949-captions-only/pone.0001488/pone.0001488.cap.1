                Figure 1.  Predicted secondary structure of the Nephtys sp. group II intron.Potentially conserved secondary structure consisting of a central core from which radiate six domains (Iâ€“VI). The RT and partial maturase ORF are encoded within domain IV. EBS and IBS indicate sites where interaction between the intron and exon (respectively) occurs when splicing. Greek symbols designate sequence sites potentially involved in tertiary structure.
