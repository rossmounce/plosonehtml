                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic analysis of 71 group II intron ORFs. A maximum likelihood analysis of the amino acid sequence for 71 ORFs suggests the cox1 ORF718 of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana as sister to the Nephtys's ORF.Red stars indicate a bootstrap support â‰¥90. Names of taxa are indicated by the capital letter of the genus name, followed by species name and when applicable the intron location (specified in table 3).
