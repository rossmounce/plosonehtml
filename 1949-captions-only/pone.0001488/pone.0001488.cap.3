                Figure 3.  Maximum likelihood analysis of the protein coding genes.The maximum likelihood analysis of the mitochondrial protein coding genes of six annelids shows that branch lengths among them are similar, suggesting that Nephtys does not have an obviously slower rate that might create a propensity for harboring introns.
