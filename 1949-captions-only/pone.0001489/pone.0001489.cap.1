                Figure 1.  Amplification of autologous HIV sequences using multiplex PCR.Panel A. Sequence alignment of multiple HIV isolates, revealed a region of relative conservation with variable residues in positions 7847 and 7848. Primer REVF7830 is perfectly complimentary to consensus sequence B, whereas primers REVF7830.1 and REVF7830.2 encode compensatory mutations in the 3′ region of the primer, indicated in bold. ⃛denotes deletions, -sequence identity, letters indicate alternative bases in the corresponding positions relative to consensus sequence B. Consensus sequences for common HIV clades as well as less frequent isolates are denoted in bold. Panel B. Schematic overview of the Rev RNA amplification strategy. Open bar denotes regions outside of open reading frame of interest, hatched bar denotes RNA region exon 2 Rev, grey bar represent DNA intermediate products durig amplification process. For details on primer design and amplification refer to Method section.
