Analysis of products obtained after the secondary PCR reaction for Gag, Vpr, Rev, and Nef as marked on the top. Panel D. cDNA obtained in preparative secondary PCR reaction corresponding to Gag, Vpr, Rev, and Nef antigens. M: 100 bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen). The molecular weight of representative DNA bands is indicated on the left. Panel E. RNA corresponding to Gag, Vpr, Rev, and Nef antigens obtained by <em>in vitro</em> transcription using amplified PCR products from subjects plasma. M: molecular weight RNA ladder (Promega), representative marker sizes are indicated on the left. G, V, R, N: in vitro transcribed RNAs for Gag, Vpr, Nef and Nef respectively.</p>
