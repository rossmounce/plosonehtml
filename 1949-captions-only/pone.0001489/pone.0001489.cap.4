                Figure 4.  Panel A: CFSE-low cells expressed as a percentage of total PBMCs.Mature DCs (CD209: 96%; CD14: 0%; CD80: 100%; CD83: 91%; CD86: 100%; HLA-DR: 96%; and HLA-I: 100%) were electroporated with 4 HIV antigen-encoding RNAs (hatched bar) or eGFP (solid bar) were cultured with CFSE-labeled PBMCs for 6 days. Frequency of CD8+ CFSE-low were cells determined by flow cytometry. Panel B: CD28/CD45RA phenotype of CD8+ cells induced to proliferate (CFSE-low) by DC electroporated with 4 HIV antigen-encoding RNAs (left panel), as compared to the frequency of CD8+ CFSE-low cells induced by eGFP-RNA loaded control DC (right panel), as determined by flow cytometry. Panel C: Frequency of IFN-Î³ positive cells within the CD8+ CFSE-low subset induced by 4 hr re-stimulation with DC expressing individual HIV antigen-encoding RNAs, or eGFP control RNA, as determined by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. The background response for single HIV RNA stimulators (1ug HIV RNA/106 DC) was calculated at 0.38% from GFP RNA-electroporated DC (1ug GFP RNA/106 DC) and is indicated by the horizontal dashed line.
