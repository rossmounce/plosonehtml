                Figure 1.  Generation of T-REx-c-MIR.(A) Schematic representation of the structure of CD8 chimeras used in this experiment. Extracellular domain (EX), transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic tail (cyto) are indicated. (B) After being incubated with and without Dox for 24 hr, the expression level of indicated surface molecules on T-REx-c-MIR was examined by FACS. Data from the cells incubated with Dox (open histograms), and the cells incubated without Dox (shaded histograms) are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (C) Surface molecules of T-REx-c-MIR were biotinylated first. After biotinylated T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with or without Dox for the indicated periods of times, biotinylated proteins were purified with streptavidin-agarose and analyzed with anti-FLAG Ab. Upper and lower panels showed the results from the cells incubated with and without Dox, respectively. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (D) Whole cell lysate extracted from T-REx-c-MIR that was cultivated with or without Dox for 6 hr was incubated with anti-FLAG Ab. Precipitated samples were probed with anti-FLAG Ab (left) or anti-ubiquitin Ab (right). Bands corresponding to the ubiquitinated CD8-B7-2-A2 is are marked by an asterisk (*) as shown. (E) Surface molecules of T-REx-c-MIR were biotinylated as in C. After biotinylated T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with (+) or without (−) Dox for the indicated periods of time, biotinylated proteins were sequentially purified with anti-FLAG Ab and streptavidin-agarose. Each sample was probed with anti-ubiquitin Ab (upper) and anti-FLAG Ab (lower). Data are representative of two independent experiments. (F) T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with Dox for 6 hr and cultivated in the presence of FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 Ab for the last 10 min. Internalized CD8-B7-2-A2 was observed with a fluorescence microscope (left panel). For the quantitative analysis of internalization, surface CD8-B7-2-A2 of T-REx-c-MIR was labeled with anti-CD8 Ab after being incubated with (+) or without (−) Dox for 6 hr. After cultivation at 37°C for the indicated times, the expression of remaining surface CD8-B7-2-A2 was examined by staining with PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. At each point, the percentage of remaining CD8-B7-2-A2 was calculated relative to the value of labeled CD8-B7-2-A2 at 0 min (right panel).
