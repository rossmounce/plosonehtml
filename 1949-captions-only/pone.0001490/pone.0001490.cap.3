                Figure 3.  Lysine-less target molecules are neither ubiquitinated nor internalized in T-REx-c-MIR.(A) After being incubated with and without Dox for 8 hr, the expression of indicated surface molecules on T-REx-c-MIR was examined by FACS. Data from cells incubated with Dox (open histograms) and cells incubated without Dox (shaded histograms) are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (B) (C) Whole cell lysate extracted from indicated CD8-chimera-expressing T-REx-c-MIR that was cultivated with or without Dox for 6 hr was incubated with anti-FLAG Ab. Precipitated samples were probed with anti-FLAG Ab (left) or anti-ubiquitin Ab (right). Bands corresponding to newly and constitutively ubiquitinated CD8-B7-2-A2 are marked with an asterisk (*) and small triangles, respectively (shown in right panels). (D) Surface molecules of indicated CD8-chimera-expressing T-REx-c-MIR were biotinylated first as in Figure 1C. After each biotinylated T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with (+) or without (−) Dox for 4 hr, biotinylated proteins were sequentially purified with anti-FLAG Ab and streptavidin-agarose. Each sample was probed with anti-ubiquitin Ab or anti-FLAG Ab. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Bands corresponding to newly and constitutively ubiquitinated surface CD8-B7-2-A2 are marked with an asterisk (*) and small triangles, respectively. (E) Indicated CD8-chimera-expressing T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with Dox for 6 hr and cultivated in the presence of FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 Ab for the last 10 min. Internalized CD8 chimera was observed by fluorescence microscopy (left panel). For the quantitative analysis of internalization, each T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with (+) or without (−) Dox for 6 hr, and surface CD8 chimera of T-REx-c-MIR was labeled with anti-CD8 Ab. After each labeled T-REx-c-MIR was cultivated at 37°C for the indicated times, the percentage of remaining CD8-B7-2-A2 was calculated as in Figure 1F (right panel).
