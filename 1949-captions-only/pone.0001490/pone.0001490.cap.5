Protein complex including biotinylated CD8 chimera was sequentially purified with anti-FLAG Ab and streptavidin-agarose. Each sample was probed with anti-V5 Ab and anti-FLAG Ab (left panel). Whole cell lysate from each T-REx-c-MIR was analyzed with anti-V5 Ab (right panel). Data are representative of two independent experiments. (B) T-REx-c-MIR was incubated with Dox for 4 hr, and surface molecules of T-REx-c-MIR were biotinylated. c-MIR proteins were purified with anti-V5 Ab and analyzed with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Data are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
