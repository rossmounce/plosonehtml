                Figure 1.  ICP27 Is Required for the Formation of Hsc70 Nuclear Foci.Vero cells or 2-2 cells were either mock-infected, infected with WT HSV-1 KOS or ICP27 null mutant 27-LacZ, or were first transfected with plasmid pSG130B/S, which expresses ICP27 [48], and were then infected 24 h later with 27-LacZ, as indicated. All infections were performed at a moi of 10. Cells were fixed at 6 h after infection and stained with anti-Hsc70, anti-SC35, anti-ICP4 and anti-ICP27 antibodies as indicated. Antibody to the nuclear splicing SR protein SC35 was used in the mock-infected sample to define the nucleus. Arrows mark sites of Hsc70 nuclear foci (green) or ICP4-containing pre-replication sites (red). In this figure, and in all subsequent immunofluorescence images, representative cells are shown at higher magnification to better illustrate the pattern of protein localization and to observe intracellular structures. In all cases, cells shown in the figures represent the pattern observed in greater than 75% of the cells visualized in at least 10 fields.
