                Figure 10.  Dominant Negative Mutant Hsc70 K71M Prevents Proteasomal Degradation of Phospho-Serine 2 RNAP II CTD.A) RSF cells were transfected with vector alone (-), Myc-tagged Hsc70 or Myc-tagged Hsc70K71M and 24 h later were either mock-infected or were infected with WT HSV-1 or 27-LacZ. Nuclear extracts were prepared 8 h after infection. Western blots were probed with antibody H5 to detect the phospho-serine 2 form of RNAP II; anti-myc antibody to detect myc-tagged Hsc70; anti-ICP27 antibody to monitor ICP27 expression, and anti-YY1 antibody as a loading control. YY1 is a cellular transcription factor. B) HeLa cells were either mock-infected or infected with WT HSV-1. MG132 (50 ÂµM) was added at the times indicated and nuclear extracts were prepared at 8 after infection. Western blots were probed with H5 antibody to detect RNAP II phospho-serine 2; ARNA3 antibody, which recognizes all forms of RNAP II, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated; anti-ICP27 antibody, and anti-YY1 antibody. C) RSF cells were transfected with empty vector alone (control), myc-tagged Hsc70 or myc-tagged Hsc70K71M as indicated, and were infected 24 h later with WT HSV-1. Nuclear extracts were prepared 8 h after infection, and samples were fractionated directly by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis (left panel, NE) or were immunoprecipitated with anti-ubiquitin antibody (right panel, IP- anti-Ub). Immunoprecipitated complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the Western blot was probed with anti-RNAP II antibody ARNA3. Arrows point to slower migrating ubiquitinated forms of RNAP II. D) RSF cells were transfected with empty vector alone (control), myc-tagged Hsc70 or myc-tagged Hsc70K71M and were infected 24 h later with WT HSV-1. Cells were harvested 24 h after infection and viral titers were determined by plaque assays.
