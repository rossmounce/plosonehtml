                Figure 11.  Model of RNAP II Degradation during HSV-1 Transcription.ICP27 interacts with the CTD of RNAP II [11] and recruits RNAP II to a viral replication compartment [11], [34], which is represented in magenta. Elongating RNAP II complexes on opposite DNA strands may collide causing one or both complexes to stall. At least one of the stalled complexes may then be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. The other transcription complex is now free to continue. Hsc70 foci, which form at the same time as replication compartments, and which lie at their periphery, may aid this process by providing a ready source of chaperone proteins as well as other components of the 26S proteasome [6], [7].
