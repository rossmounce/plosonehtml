Asterisks mark the position of the ICP27 proteins that were seen to bind. Input <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins are shown in the middle panel. In the bottom panel, a schematic diagram of the 512 amino acid ICP27 coding region, including the leucine-rich amino terminus (LRR), nuclear localization signal (NLS), RGG box RNA binding motif (RGG), arginine-rich region (R2), three predicted KH domains and a zinc-finger-like motif (CCHC) in the C-terminus. The positions of the deletion mutations (dotted lines) are shown below. B) GST binding assays were performed with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled, in vitro-translated WT ICP27 and GST-tagged Hsc70 truncated proteins. The arrow shows the position of ICP27. Input GST-Hsc70 proteins are shown in the middle panel. A schematic of the Hsc70 coding region is shown illustrating the nucleotide binding domain (NBD-ATPase), the substrate binding domain (SBD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD).</p>
