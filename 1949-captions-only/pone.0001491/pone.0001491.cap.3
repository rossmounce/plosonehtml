                Figure 3.  The N- and C-termini of ICP27 Are Required for Interaction with Hsc70 during Infection.A) HeLa cells were either mock-infected or infected with WT HSV-1 or ICP27 mutants as indicated. At 6 h after infection, nuclear extracts were prepared. Expression of endogenous Hsc70 in mock-infected cells and HSV-1 WT- and mutant-infected cells is shown by Western blot analysis of samples from nuclear extracts in the top panel. Immunoprecipitations with anti-ICP27 antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Hsc70 antibody are shown in the middle panel. The bottom panel shows a Western blot of anti-ICP27 immunoprecipitated samples probed with anti-ICP27 antibody to show ICP27 expression. Asterisks (*) mark WT and mutant ICP27 protein bands. The + signs mark heavy chain IgG from the immunoprecipitations. B) Reverse immunoprecipitations were performed on samples from the nuclear extracts described above. The top panel shows the expression of WT and mutant ICP27 in the nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitation of each sample was performed with anti-Hsc70 antibody and Western blot analysis was performed by probing with anti-ICP27 antibody, as shown in the middle panel. The + sign marks heavy chain IgG from the immunoprecipitation. The bottom panel shows a Western blot of anti-Hsc70 immunoprecipitated samples probed with anti-Hsc70 antibody. C) A schematic diagram of the ICP27 coding region is shown in the left panel with the positions of the deletions illustrated by dotted lines. The table in the right panel describes the residues deleted or mutated in each mutant virus.
