At the times indicated, cells were fixed and stained with anti-Hsc70 and anti-ICP27 antibodies as indicated. Arrows mark Hsc70 nuclear foci. B) Vero cells were infected with WT HSV-1, 27-LacZ, dLeu, n406 or n504 for 6 h, at which time cells were fixed and stained with anti-Hsc70 and anti-ICP0 antibodies. The arrow marks an Hsc70 focus adjacent to an ICP0 speckle.</p>
