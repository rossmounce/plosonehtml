The arrows point to a fully formed replication compartment in WT-infected cells and to small pre-replication sites in dLeu and n406-infected cells. B) HeLa cells were infected with WT HSV-1, dLeu or n406 as indicated. At 8 h after infection total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed as described previously against an array of HSV-1 transcript-specific probes <a href="#pone.0001491-Sun1">[35]</a>. Hybridizations were performed in triplicate and the experiments were performed twice. Error bars represent the standard deviations. C) Vero cells were mock-infected or were infected with WT HSV-1, 27-LacZ, dLeu or n406 at a moi of 10. At 1 h and 12 h after infection, DNA was purified from cell lysates by phenol-chloroform extraction. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with a probe for the glycoprotein C (gC) gene to determine viral DNA copy number.</p>
