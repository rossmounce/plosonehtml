                Figure 7.  Hsc70 Nuclear Sequestration Correlates with the Loss of Phospho-serine 2 Form of RNAP II CTD in Fully Formed Replication Compartments.Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with WT HSV-1, dLeu or n406 for the times indicated. In the left hand panels, cells were stained with anti-RNAP II antibody, H14, which recognizes phospho-serine 5 RNAP II CTD, and anti-Hsc70 antibody. Arrows show a replication compartment with an Hsc70 focus site at the periphery in the 8 h WT-infected cell, and a pre-replication site (red) next to a small Hsc70 focus site (merge) in the 12 h dLeu-infected cell. In the right panels, cells were stained with anti-Hsc70 antibody and anti-RNAP II antibody H5, which recognizes phospho-serine-2 RNAP II CTD. This antibody also cross-reacts with a phospho-epitope in splicing SR proteins [11], [40]. The arrow points to an Hsc70 focus site (green) adjacent to a splicing speckle (red).
