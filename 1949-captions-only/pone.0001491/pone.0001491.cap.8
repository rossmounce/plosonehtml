                Figure 8.  Preventing Phospho-serine 2 RNAP II Degradation Also Prevents Hsc70 Focus Formation.Vero cells that were mock-infected or were infected with WT HSV-1 or 27-LacZ were untreated (left panels) or were treated with 50 ÂµM MG132 added 1 h after infection (right panels). Cells were fixed at 8 h after infection and stained with anti-Hsc70 antibody, antibody H5 and anti-ICP4 antibody as indicated.
