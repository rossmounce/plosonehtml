Cells were stained with H5, anti-ICP4 or anti-ICP8 antibodies. GFP fluorescence was viewed directly. Arrows point to Hsc70 foci. B) Vero cells were transfected with the dominant negative mutant GFP-Hsc70K71M and then infected with WT HSV-1 for 8 h. Cells were stained with H5, anti-ICP4 or anti-ICP8 antibodies. Arrows point to GFP Hsc70K71M expressing cells showing diffuse nuclear staining with H5, and to pre-replication sites in cells stained for ICP4 and ICP8. The yellow arrows in the ICP4 and ICP8 stained panels point to a fully formed replication compartment.</p>
