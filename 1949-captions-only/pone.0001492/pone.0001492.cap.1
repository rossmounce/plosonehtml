                Figure 1.  A csk1Δ strain is hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents.Survival was measured after irradiation with UV (A) or IR (B) of the following strains: wild type (JS78), csk1Δ (JS155). (C) 10-fold serial dilutions of the wild-type and csk1Δ strains [as in (A)] in mid-log phase were plated on fresh media containing no drug (top), 0.005% MMS (middle) or 6 mM hydroxyurea (bottom), and incubated 3–5 days before photographing.
