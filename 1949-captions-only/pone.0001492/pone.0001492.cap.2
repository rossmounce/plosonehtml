                Figure 2.  Csk1 is not required for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint or for NER.(A) WT (JS78), csk1Δ (JS155), rad3Δ (YP46) and csk1Δ rad3Δ (YP68) cells were synchronized in G2 by fractionation in lactose gradients and irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV light. Samples were taken every 30 min and the percent of cells passing through mitosis was measured by counting binucleated cells, septated cells and doublets. (B) Survival after UV irradiation of the following strains: wild type (JS78), csk1Δ (JS155), rad13Δ (YP1), csk1Δ rad13Δ (YP85).
