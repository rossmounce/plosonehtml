                Figure 3.  Anti-peptide responses.A. (Upper panel) Geometric mean anti-AMA49-C1 (PEV301) and anti UK-39 (PEV302) endpoint-titres (log10) with 95% confidence intervals for group 1 (PEV3A), group 2 (PEV3A+ME-TRAP) and unvaccinated controls. B. (Lower panel) Mean avidity increase (relative to avidity index after first immunisation) with 95% confidence intervals. Arrows along the x axis represent the timing of each vaccination, and the asterisk denotes the challenge.
