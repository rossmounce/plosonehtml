                Figure 4.  Antibody reactivity with P. falciparum.A. (Upper panel) IgG endpoint titres measured in IFA with P. falciparum (K1) blood stage parasites. B. (Lower panel) IgG endpoint titres measured in IFA with P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoites. Sera were tested before vaccination, after every vaccination and after sporozoite challenge. Individual titres and the geometric mean for every time point are shown on a log scale.
