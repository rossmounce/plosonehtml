                Figure 7.  PCR data.Number of parasites per mL, estimated using a calibration curve, plotted by day post sporozoite challenge. A. Three volunteers selected to demonstrate expected pattern of PCR results: an exponential increase in the numbers of parasites over time, with some cycling seen as parasites are sequestered and released. B. This figure shows data from all 4 volunteers who had unusual PCR results. Up to 150 parasites/mL are detected, and are subsequently undetectable for one or more time points, before they are measured again. This pattern occurs several times, up to a maximum of 5 times in volunteer N525.
