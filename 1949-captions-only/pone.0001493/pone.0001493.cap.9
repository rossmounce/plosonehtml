                Figure 9.  Normal parasites and crisis forms.Crisis forms differ from normal parasites in their slightly more ‘ragged’ morphology and altered staining of the nuclear material-live parasites have nuclei that stain red/blue, these abnormal parasites lose all red chromatin staining. Magnified high power images are shown in A&amp;B. Normal parasites are seen in Figure 9A, whilst 9B shows a film containing a crisis form. The remaining films are unmagnified and white blood cell nuclei are clearly visible in blue, with smaller headphone shaped parasites. Figure 9C &amp; D show single crisis forms, whilst 9E &amp; F show multiple normal parasites, with the characteristic red/blue nuclear staining.
