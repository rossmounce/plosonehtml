Magnified high power images are shown in A&amp;B. Normal parasites are seen in <a href="#pone-0001493-g009">Figure 9A</a>, whilst 9B shows a film containing a crisis form. The remaining films are unmagnified and white blood cell nuclei are clearly visible in blue, with smaller headphone shaped parasites. <a href="#pone-0001493-g009">Figure 9C &amp; D</a> show single crisis forms, whilst 9E &amp; F show multiple normal parasites, with the characteristic red/blue nuclear staining.</p>
