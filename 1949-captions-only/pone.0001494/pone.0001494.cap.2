                Figure 2.  Co-fractionation of SΔC with eIF3f in vitro in sucrose gradients.Ten micrograms each of the purified GST-SΔC (top panel), GST-3f+GST (second panel) and GST3f+GST-SΔC (third and bottom panels) were loaded onto the top of 15–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 hours. Fourteen fractions were collected from the top to the bottom and analyzed by Western blot with anti-S (top and bottom panels) and anti-eIF3f (second and third panels) antibodies.
