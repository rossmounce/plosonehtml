Dose dependent inhibition of luciferase mRNA translation by GST-SΔC in vitro (lanes 1–10) and rescue of the inhibition by addition of the purified GST-3f (lanes 11–14). In vitro transcribed luciferase mRNA (0.5 µg) was translated <em>in vitro</em> in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine. Glutathione buffer (lane 1), increasing amounts of GST-SΔC (lanes 2–8), GST (lanes 9–10), purified GST (lane 11), GST-SΔC (lane 12), GST+GST-SΔC (lane 13), or GST-SΔC+GST-3f (lane 14) were added to the translation system as indicated. Polypeptides were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography (upper panels). A duplicate of the in vitro translation reactions in the absence of [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine (replaced by cold-methionine) was used to measure the luciferase activity (lower graph). b. Inhibition of luciferase translation by the full-length SARS-CoV S protein in intact cells. HeLa cells on 6-well plates were infected in duplicate with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3, and transfected with 1.2 µg of empty vector pKT0 (V) (lanes 1 and 6), 1 µg pKT0/S+0.2 µg pLUC (lanes 2 and 5), and 1 µg pKT0+0.2 µg pLUC (lanes 3 and 4), respectively. Cells were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection, and protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with anti-luciferase and anti-S antibodies. The same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibodies as a loading control. The luciferase gene expression at the mRNA level in the transfected cells was also analyzed by Northern blot with a Dig-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the 5′-end 550 nucleotides of the luciferase gene (lanes 4–7).</p>
