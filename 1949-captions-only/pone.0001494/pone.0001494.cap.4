                Figure 4.  Interaction of the IBV S protein with eIF3f and inhibition of protein synthesis.a. Confirmation of the interaction between the Flag-tagged eIF3f and the full-length IBV S protein by co-immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f (lane 1), IBV S (lane 2) and eIF3f+IBV S (lane 3) by using the vaccinia/T7 expression system were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection and lysed. The total cell lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-Flag (top panel) and anti-IBV S (second panel) antibodies or immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV S antibodies. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-IBV S (third panel) and anti-Flag (bottom panel) antibodies. b. Interaction of the Flag-tagged eIF3f with the N-terminal region of the IBV S protein (IBV SΔC). HeLa cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f (lane 1), the Myc-tagged IBV SΔC (lane 2) and eIF3f+IBV SΔC (lane 3), were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection and lysed. The total cells lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-Flag (top panel) and anti-Myc (second panel) antibodies, or immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-Flag (third panel) or anti-Myc (bottom panel) antibodies. c. Inhibition of luciferase activity by IBV and SARS-CoV S protein. HeLa cells expressing luciferase, luciferase+IBV S and luciferase+SARS-CoV S by using the vaccinia/T7 system were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection, lysed, and the luciferase activities in the total cell lysates were measured. d. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the interaction between IBV S protein and the endogenous eIF3f in IBV-infected Vero cells. Mock- and IBV-infected Vero cells were harvested at 24 hours post-infection and lysed. The total cell lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-IBV S (top panel), anti-IBV N (third panel) and anti-actin (bottom panel) antibodies, respectively, or immunoprecipitated with anti-eIF3f antibody. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-IBV S (second panel) or N (fourth panel) antibodies.
