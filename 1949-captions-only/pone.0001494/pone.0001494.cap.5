                Figure 5.  The relationship between the fusogenicity of S protein and its expression level in cells expressing fusion-competent and fusion-incompetent S protein.a. Detection of cell-cell fusion by indirect immunofluorescence. Vero cells were infected with the vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus and transfected with S(EP3) and S(p65) constructs. At 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-transfecion, respectively, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with rabbit anti-IBV S polyclonal antibodies. b. Expression of fusion-competent and fusion-incompetent IBV S protein. Vero cells were infected with vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus and transfected with S(EP3) and S(p65) constructs. Cells were harvested at 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-transfection, respectively, and lysates prepared. The viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-IBV S antibodies. The same membrane was also probed with anti-Î²-tubulin monoclonal antibody as a loading control. c. Quantitative analysis of the expression of fusion-competent and fusion-incompetent IBV S protein. Vero cells were infected with vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus and transfected with S(EP3)-luciferase and S(p65)-luciferase constructs. Cells were harvested at 12 and 14 hours post-transfection, respectively, lysates prepared, and the luciferase activity was determined.
