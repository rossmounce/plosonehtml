D., a 25 year-old spare fisherman, was bitten at the right calf in September 1998 by the shark he just harpooned near Yoff island. It was a small shark (approximately 1.5 m).

<h4>Shark Occurrence and Behaviour</h4>
<h5>Prospective study.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>I counted 48 sharks belonging to four different species in 90 hours of snorkelling at the Almadies and Ngor in November-December 2005. They were 22 blacktip sharks <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> (45.8%), 24 nurse sharks <em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em> (50.0%) and two specimens belonging to two unidentified species (4.2%). All blacktip sharks were adults about 1.8–2.5 m long, and the nurse sharks measured between 1.3 and 1.8 m. The two unidentified specimens measured between 2 and 2.5 m. Out of 48 sharks encountered, 45 were indifferent to my presence (93.7%), two changed direction in order to approach me then stayed at short distance away (5–7 m) for approximately a minute before to moving off (unidentified shark) or until I felt sufficiently threatened to return to the accompanying boat (<em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em>) (4.2%), and another <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> immediately charged with sudden half-turn only two meters from me (2.1%).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>I counted 23 sharks belonging to three or more species in 79 hours of snorkeling at the Almadies, Ngor, Mbao, Madeleine Island and Gorée Island in July–August 2006. They were 13 blacktip sharks <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> (56.6%), 5 nurse sharks <em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em> (21.7%) and five specimens belonging to unidentified species (21.7%). All blacktip sharks were adults about 1.6–2.0 m long and the nurse sharks measured between 1.5 and 2.2 m. Four out of five unidentified specimens measured between 2.0 and 2.5 m and belonged probably to the genus <em>Carcharhinus</em>. Out of 23 sharks encountered, all seemed indifferent to my presence.</p>

<h5>Retrospective study.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Out of one thousand encounters with sharks on the coasts of the Cap Vert peninsula during 1290 hours of snorkelling or spearfishing between 1986 and 2005, 715 (71.5%) concerned the nurse shark <em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em> (0.8–2 m), 226 (22.6%) the blacktip shark <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> (1.7–2.5 m), 11 (1.1%) the barbeled houndshark <em>Leptocharias smithii</em> (&lt;1 m), 2 (0.2%) the milk shark <em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em> (&lt;1 m), one (0.1%) the tiger shark <em>Galeocerdo cuvieri</em> (4 m), and 45 (4.5%) unidentified sharks (0.8–3 m). None of these encounters were followed by an attack, but in nine cases (0.9%) a threatening behaviour from the shark was observed: three sharks immediately charged then suddenly turned back at only 2–4 m (one <em>Galeocerdo cuvieri</em>, one <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> and one <em>Carcharhinus sp</em>.), and six sharks approached progressively to shorter and shorter distances (2–5 m) before eventually moving off (five <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em> and one specimen not identified). These nine encounters occurred during spearfishing activities, but in only two cases had fish been previously harpooned (two cases of progressive approach by <em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em>). Almost all encounters with sharks (99%) took place on the northern coast of the Cap Vert peninsula (Almadies, Ngor, Yoff), although the duration of observations in this area were about 850 hours, i.e. only two-third of the whole duration of observations (average: 1.16 shark per hour). Only eleven encounters with sharks (eight <em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>, two <em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em> and a small unidentified shark) took place on the southern coast of the Cap Vert peninsula, although an estimated 440 hours of observations were made in Mbao, Bel Air, Gorée island, Cap Manuel, Madeleines island, Soumbedioune or Ouakam (average: 0.025 shark per hour).</p>

<div id="section4" class="section"><a id="s4" name="s4" toc="s4" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1"></a><p>Five shark attacks were documented during this study, raising to six the total number of shark attacks reported from the coast of the Cap Vert peninsula. Only one case of shark attack in the region of Dakar was previously reported <a href="#pone.0001495-Dejou1">[9]</a>. The victim, a Lebou fisherman who was diving in apnoea in front of the beach of Thiaroye, was bitten at the thigh in December 1947. He died the same day at Le Dantec hospital. Haemorragic shock was the cause of his death, as in most fatal attacks <a href="#pone.0001495-Caldicott1">[13]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2"></a><p>The methodology used for the epidemiological surveys was mainly based on the interview of a limited number of persons that was most likely informed of the occurrence of shark attacks. The few number of cases documented and the fact that most of them occurred more than 20 years ago suggest that the incidence of shark attacks in the region of Dakar is low. In most health establishment, all medical personnel in contact with victims of accidents were interviewed, including several nurses working for more than 30 years in the same hospital. Surveys among fishermen and traditional authorities showed that many years after they occurred, the cases reported in this study were still well known from many persons in the community, due to the high emotional impact of shark attacks. No case was known by the Dakar fire service, which has responsibilities for accidents on beaches and transports to hospital more than one hundred drowned persons each year, nor from the other administrative sources that were interviewed.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3"></a><p>According to ISAF classification criteria, three attacks, of which two were fatal, fall into the category of unprovoked attacks <a href="#pone.0001495-International1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001495-Baldridge1">[14]</a>. It was the two attacks directed against the divers fishing for <em>Cymbium</em>, and the attack reported by Dejou &amp; Almeida <a href="#pone.0001495-Dejou1">[9]</a>. These three attacks occurred on the southern coast of the Cap Vert peninsula, where sharks are currently less numerous than on the northern coast. According to the fishermen from Hann and Thiaroye, sharks were formerly very abundant in this area, which was selected in the 1940s for the settlement of the first shark fisheries in Senegal <a href="#pone.0001495-Chauveau1">[15]</a>. The present rarity of sharks on the southern coast of the Cap Vert peninsula is probably due to the considerable development of traditional fishing since the 1970s on this coast well sheltered from the dominant winds <a href="#pone.0001495-Chavance1">[16]</a>. Sharks are still numerous on the northern coast of the Cap Vert peninsula, but the frequency of encounters with sharks was higher during the period 1986–1997 (0.98 per hour for all areas, 1.42 per hour for the northern coast) than during the period 1998–2006 (0.53 per hour for all areas, 0.76 per hour for the northern coast) (p&lt;0.0001 by exact test).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4"></a><p>Seventeen out of 54 species of sharks recorded on the Senegalese coasts are known to have attacked humans (<a href="#pone-0001495-t001">Table 1</a>). The tiger shark <em>Galeocerdo cuvieri</em> is considered to be one of the most dangerous species in this region due to its presence all year round and the large size of most specimens encountered on the Senegalese coasts <a href="#pone.0001495-Cadenat3">[17]</a>. Next to the great white shark <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, which is rare in Senegalese waters <a href="#pone.0001495-Seret1">[5]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001495-Cadenat2">[10]</a>, <em>G. cuvieri</em> is the shark which is responsible of the highest number of attacks in the world <a href="#pone.0001495-International1">[7]</a>. The fatal attack of Thiaroye in 1947 was attributed to this species, and the stomach of a tiger shark captured in Joal, 90 km south of Dakar, contained an human foot which is still preserved at the Gorée island Sea Museum <a href="#pone.0001495-Cadenat4">[18]</a>. In the present study, the encounter with a tiger shark in front of the Almadies was immediately followed by a charge. The large size -more than 3 meters- of the sharks responsible of the two unprovoked attacks of Bel Air and Thiaroye suggests that tiger sharks could also be involved. Two other large species, the bull shark <em>Carcharhinus leucas</em> and to a lesser extent the dusky shark <em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em> are both abundant in Senegalese waters and well known for being occasionally responsible for attacks near the coastline in tropical waters <a href="#pone.0001495-Compagno1">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001495-International1">[7]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001495-Baldridge2">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001495-Stevens1">[20]</a>. However, all specimens from these two species which were measured on the Senegalese coasts were less than 2.9 meters long <a href="#pone.0001495-Cadenat1">[2]</a>. Furthermore, they seem to be rare along the coast of the Cap Vert peninsula, preferring the sandy coast of southern Senegal and the mouth of the Sine-Saloum, Gambia and Casamance rivers.</p>
