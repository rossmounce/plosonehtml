                Figure 1.  Schematic presentation of MHC-IIB Rod mutants used for in vitro experiments.Rod contains 640aa obtained from MHC-IIB C-terminus. Red and blue boxes indicate regions with net negative (844-1747aa) and positive charge (1748-1931aa), 1932–1976 is the non-helical tail piece. ACD, assembly-competence domain (1875–1903). Where indicated, skip residues were included as extra residues to maintain heptade register. See text for further details.
