                Figure 2.  In vitro self-assembly of Rod mutants.In vitro self-assembly assays were carried out using 0.5 mg/ml Rod and Rod mutants expressed and purified from E. coli as described in Materials and Methods. The proteins were dialyzed against different NaCl concentrations. The extent of self-assembly was calculated as the percentage of mutated Rod proteins remaining in the supernatant after high speed centrifugation. A) Rods with deletions in the region with a net positive charge. B) Rods with deletions from the N-terminus to the region with net positive charge. The results are averages +/âˆ’ S.D of three to five independent experiments.
