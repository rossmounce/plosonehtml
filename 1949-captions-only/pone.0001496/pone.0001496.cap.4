                Figure 4.  Distribution of the net charge along Rod mutants.The net charge along the coiled-coil region of Rod mutants was estimated using the “sliding window” technique (see Materials and Methods). The resulting data was plotted as the net charge of the window against the first residue of the window. A) Rod mutants with deletions in the positively-charged region. Black region represents the overlap of the charge distribution among all three constructs from residue 1337 to 1559. Note the overlap between Rod and ΔP85 between residues 1560–1679. B) Rod mutants with mutations in the negatively-charged region. Note the overlap of the charge distribution among all constructs between residues 1337–1367.
