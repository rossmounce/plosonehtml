X = staggering. B) Charge interactions between parallel rods. Staggering (X) is plotted horizontally and the net sum of attractions minus repulsions for each X is plotted vertically. Attraction is represented by âˆ’1 and repulsion by +1. Skip residues are included in the linear sequence. All <em>a</em> and <em>d</em> positions of the heptads repeat were changed to zeros. Arrows indicate strong net negative (attractive) interactions, at 98aa and 295aa staggering. The data for staggers higher than 300aa was omitted for clarity.</p>
