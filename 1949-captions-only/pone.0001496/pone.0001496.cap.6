Red and blue boxes indicate regions with net negative (844-1747aa) and net positive charge (1748-1931aa). 1932–1976 is the non-helical tail piece. Where indicated, skip residues were included as extra residues to maintain heptade register. See text for further details. B) B<sup>−</sup>/B<sup>−</sup> MEF cells were transiently transfected with MHC-IIB or MHC-IIB mutants fused to GFP (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Cells were subjected to a TX-100 solubility assay and the percentage of total MHC-IIB in the soluble fraction was determined (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Shown are representative experiments of TX-100 solubility of MHC-IIB mutants with progressive C-terminus deletions (upper panel) and deletions upstream to Δ116 (lower panel). Note that the amount of expressed protein is similar. C) Comparison of self-assembly at physiological salt concentration and cytoskeletal association between Rods and native MHC-IIB carrying the same mutations.</p>
