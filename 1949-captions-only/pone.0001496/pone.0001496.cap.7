                Figure 7.  The effect of deletion on intracellular localization of MHC-IIB.B−/B− MEF cells were transiently transfected with MHC-IIB or MHC-IIB mutants fused to GFP (see Materials and Materials and Methods and Figure 5A). After transfection cells were serum–starved, fixed and stained for filamentous actin with Rhodamine phalloidin. Representative cells demonstrating the localization properties of MHC-IIB mutants are shown. Red, F-actin; green, MHC-IIB fused to GFP. Note the localization of proteins to stress fibers and the cortical region. Bar = 10 µM.
