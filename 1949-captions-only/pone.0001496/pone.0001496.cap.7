After transfection cells were serum–starved, fixed and stained for filamentous actin with Rhodamine phalloidin. Representative cells demonstrating the localization properties of MHC-IIB mutants are shown. Red, F-actin; green, MHC-IIB fused to GFP. Note the localization of proteins to stress fibers and the cortical region. Bar = 10 µM.</p>
