                Figure 8.  Schematic representation of charge alignment during parallel association with 295aa staggering in Rod and Rod mutants with and without preserving 196aa periodicity.Different colors are used in each plot for the same constructs for clarity. Note that in Rod and Rod with ΔN197 deletion (196aa periodicity preserved), the positively charged zone exactly faces a zone with high net negative charge. However, in Rod with ΔN141 deletion (28aa periodicity preserved), only part of the positively charged zone faces the region with the high negative charge.
