Note that in Rod and Rod with ΔN197 deletion (196aa periodicity preserved), the positively charged zone exactly faces a zone with high net negative charge. However, in Rod with ΔN141 deletion (28aa periodicity preserved), only part of the positively charged zone faces the region with the high negative charge.</p>
