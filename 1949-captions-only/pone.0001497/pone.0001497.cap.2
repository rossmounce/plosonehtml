                Figure 2.  The effect of spontaneous perceptual switches on perceptual stabilization.a. Experimental design, Sequences of intermittent presentation (IP) were interleaved with periods of continuous presentation (CP). An intermittent presentation sequence ended when the same percept was reported on eight consecutive presentations. This percept was termed the sequence winner. In experiment one a continuous presentation period was terminated after a randomly varied delay (B) following the first perceptual switch. The duration (A) between the start of continuous presentation and this switch varied naturally. b. The probability that the current intermittent presentation sequence is won by the same percept as the previous intermittent presentation sequence rises with intervening duration A but falls with intervening duration B (both p&lt;0.01; Spearman on individual subjects' data; n = 6; ρ = 0.68 for A and −0.56 for B). It remains above chance level throughout. Duration A varied continuously; the three data points were obtained by dividing the durations into three quantiles (average durations: 1.7, 4.1 and 11.6 s). c. The same probability plotted separately for cases where percept 1 (red) and percept 2 (green) won the previous intermittent presentation sequence. For each subject (x-axis) both bars reach above chance level, so the high correlation between the current winner and the previous winner does not reflect a systematic bias toward one percept. d. When allowing multiple perceptual switches (x-axis) during continuous viewing, the probability that the current winner equals the previous winner decreases as the number of intervening switches increases (p&lt;0.01; Spearman on individual subjects' data; n = 7, ρ = −0.69). e. For one representative subject (others shown in Supporting Figure S2) the probability decreases gradually with increasing duration of the intervening continuous presentation period (x-axis), reaching chance after about a minute. This outcome is similar, whether one includes all data (blue curve and data points), or just cases where percept 1 (red curve) or percept 2 (green curve) won the previous intermittent presentation sequence. Error bars indicate standard errors.
