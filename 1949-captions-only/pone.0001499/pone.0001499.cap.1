Unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the SET domains of 47 human proteins (<em>red</em>) and 58 predicted zebrafish proteins (<em>blue</em>). Bootstrap percentages computed from 1000 replicates are shown along the internal braches. The major branches (bootstrap support ≥ 65%; labeled with black circles) define 10 subfamilies of the genes, which are denoted with light blue vertical bars. The single brackets followed by numbers denote zebrafish gene pairs that have been found corresponding to single human genes. Note that zebrafish likely lacks an ortholog of human <em>SUV39H2</em> gene (<em>single asterisk</em>) and that human <em>PRDM7</em> and <em>PRDM9</em> genes (<em>double asterisks</em>) are co-orthologous to a single zebrafish gene named <em>prdm9</em>. Abbreviations: Hs, <em>Homo sapiens</em>; Dr, <em>Denio rerio</em>. (B) One-to-one identities and similarities between the SET domains of zebrafish proteins and their human counterparts. The identities and similarities on SET domains were calculated with FASTA program (<a href="http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2">http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_ww​w2</a>) and represented with blue and purple bars, respectively.</p>
