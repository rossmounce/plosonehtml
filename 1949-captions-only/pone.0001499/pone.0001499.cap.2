The exons are drawn to scale and the numbers beneath them indicate the size in bases. The question marks indicate several exons whose size can not be determined precisely. (B and D) Comparison of the SET domain gene loci in zebrafish and human genome reveals conserved syntenies. See <a href="#pone.0001499.s003">Figure S3</a> for more analyses. The SET domain genes are indicated in <em>red</em> while the neighboring genes in <em>black</em>. Chromosome numbers of human (<em>Hs</em>) and zebrafish (<em>Dr</em>) are shown. The chromosomal locations of human genes are shown in parentheses after the gene names. Distances between genes on a single chromosome are shown to scale, and the compared chromosomes are scaled to equivalent lengths. Lines between the compared chromosomes connect positions of orthologous gene pairs in the two species. Several zebrafish genes were predicted according to GENSCAN analysis of zebrafish genome contigs and EST alignments.</p>
