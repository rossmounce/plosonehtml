Human EHMT1 and EHMT2 proteins were used as an outgroup to root the tree. Bootstrap percentages computed from 1000 replicates are shown along the internal braches. (B) Phylogenetic tree of human PRDM7, PRDM9 proteins and their closest homologs in mouse and zebrafish. Human PRDM11 and zebrafish Prdm11 proteins were used as an outgroup to root the tree. (C) Schematic representation of the possible evolutionary history of vertebrate <em>SUV39H1</em>, <em>SUV39H2</em>, <em>PRDM7</em> and <em>PRDM9</em> genes. Three gene duplication events through evolution, which give rise to gene pairs in certain lineages, are shown as short bars along the branches, and the common ancestor is depicted as a filled circle. Genes of certain species and the common ancestor are written in boxes.</p>
