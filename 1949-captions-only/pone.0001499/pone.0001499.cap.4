Note that, occasionally, two or more genes in one species are collectively orthologous to one gene in another species. These genes are defined as co-orthologs and incorporated into a same COG. Known histone methyltransferases (HMTases) are denoted with asterisks and their site specificities are indicated along the corresponding COGs.</p>
