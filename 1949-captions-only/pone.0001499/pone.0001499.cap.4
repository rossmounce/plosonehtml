                Figure 4.  Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of SET domain genes from yeast to human.The relationship was determined based on combined information of “reciprocal best hit” analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and synthenic analysis. Note that, occasionally, two or more genes in one species are collectively orthologous to one gene in another species. These genes are defined as co-orthologs and incorporated into a same COG. Known histone methyltransferases (HMTases) are denoted with asterisks and their site specificities are indicated along the corresponding COGs.
