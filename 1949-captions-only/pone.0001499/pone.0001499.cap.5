Lateral views (anterior to the left) of embryos at 16–18 hpf (a, d, g, j and m), 22–24 hpf (b, e, h, k and n) and 48 hpf (c, f, i, l and o) are presented. (a', d', g', j' and m') Dorsal views of the embryos in a, d, g, j and m. (A) Zebrafish <em>smyd1a</em>, <em>smyd1b</em>, <em>smyd2a</em> and <em>smyd2b</em> genes show somite/muscle-specific expression patterns and form a close paralog group with the <em>smyd3</em> gene (double asterisks), which shows a ubiquitous expression pattern (a–c). Note the relatively low expressions of <em>smyd1a</em> at early stage (18 hpf; g) and <em>smyd2a</em> and <em>smyd2b</em> at late stage (48 hpf; l and o). (B) Expression patterns of the second paralog group. <em>prdm1a</em> is specifically expressed in anterior somites and adaxial cells at 18 hpf (g and g') and 24 hpf (h). Besides, it is also expressed in hatching gland (g), branchial arch, fin fold (g, g' and h), fin buds, cloaca (h and i) and retina (i). <em>prdm1b</em> (asterisk) is highly expressed in somites at 24 hpf (e) and in retina at 48 hpf (f). <em>prdm1c</em> (double asterisks) is ubiquitously expressed (a–c). <em>prdm4</em> is highly expressed in somites and retina (k and l). <em>prdm1</em>5 is expressed in muscle pioneer cells (m, m' and n). ac, adaxial cells; ba, branchial arch; cl, cloaca; fb, fin buds; ff, fin fold; hg, hatching gland; mp, muscle pioneer; re, retina; s, somite.</p>
