(a–j) Lateral views (anterior to the left) of embryos at 12, 18, 24, 48 and 72 hpf. (b' and g') Ventral views of the embryos in b and g. (c'–e' and h'–j') Dorsal views of the embryos in c–e and h–j. Note the partially overlapping expression of <em>prdm3</em> and <em>prdm16</em>. (B) Expression patterns of <em>prdm13</em>, <em>prdm8a</em> and <em>prdm8b.</em> (a–f) Lateral views (anterior to the left) of embryos at 24 and 48 hpf. (a'–f') Dorsal views of the embryos in a–f. Note that the expression of <em>prdm8a</em> is mostly restricted in hindbrain and spinal chord (c, d and c', d'), whereas that of <em>prdm8b</em> is restricted in olfactory placode, tegmentum, cerebellum and retina (f and f'). (C) Expression pattern of <em>prdm12</em>. (a and b) Lateral views (anterior to the left) of embryos at 18, 24 hpf. (a' and b') Dorsal views of the embryos in a and b. At 48 hpf, prdm12 is expressed in olfactory placode, tegmentum, cerebellum and hindbrain. (D) Expression pattern of <em>prdm15</em>. (a and b) Lateral views (anterior to the left) of embryos at 18, 22 hpf. (a' and b') Dorsal views of the embryos in a and b. Note that <em>prdm15</em> is expressed in cranial ganglia neurons (a' and b') as well as in muscle pioneer cells and intermediate cell mass (a and b). ba, branchial arches; ce, cerebellum; cg, cranial ganglia; cnc, cranial neural crest; fb, fin buds; hb, hindbrain; icm, intermediate cell mass; mp, muscle pioneer; op, olfactory placode; pnd, pronephric duct; re, retina; sc, spinal chord; tel, telencephalon; tg, tegmentum; vd, ventral diencephalons.</p>
