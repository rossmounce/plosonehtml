In this example, protein A activates the sentinel interaction between proteins B and C, whereas protein D inhibits the interaction via a negative feedback loop. 2) Candidate genes are selected and plasmids encoding the PCA fusion proteins for each assay are transformed into the corresponding deletion strains. 3) Transformed deletion strains are screened in 96-well plates by fluorescence microscopy and images are collected and processed using image analysis software. 4) Strains are selected for which the PCA signal is significantly decreased or increased, as this type of analysis can be easily automated for yeast without the use of counter-stains that are required to identify changes in sub-cellular localization. In this example, deletion of protein A results in a decrease in the PCA signal, whereas deletion of protein D results in an increase in signal. (B) Regulation of SBF and MBF throughout the cell cycle. Activation of SBF involves phosphorylation of the SBF-associated repressor Whi5 by Cln/Cdc28 during G1. Phosphorylation of Whi5 leads to its dissociation from SBF followed by nuclear export. Inactivation of SBF in G2/M involves phosphorylation of Swi4 by Clb/Cdc28 activity. Regulation of MBF is less well understood but phosphorylation of Swi6 by Clb6/Cdc28 followed by Swi6 nuclear export may be a mechanism of inactivation of both SBF and MBF. The sentinel interaction between Cdc28 and Swi4 is indicated by dashed box.</p>
