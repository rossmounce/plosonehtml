                Figure 2.  Interactions between Cdc28 and the components of SBF and MBF.Representative images of wild-type yeast transformed with the Cdc28-Swi4, Cdc28-Swi6 and Cdc28-Mbp1 yeast enhanced monomeric Venus (yEmVenus) PCAs. Fluorescence is detected in the nucleus for all three interactions. No fluorescence is detected in cells transformed with the negative control PCA Swi4-Mbp1, mock cells transformed with empty plasmids, or untransformed MatA cells.
