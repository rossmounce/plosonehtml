                Figure 3.  The GePPI screen identifies Elm1 as involved in the regulation of SBF by Cdc28.(A) Changes in average mean pixel intensity for the three PCAs: Cdc28-Swi4, Cdc28-Swi6 and Cdc28-Mbp1, in the 30 deletion strains. Dark red indicates increase in PCA signal, dark blue indicates decrease in PCA signal, and black represents no change in PCA signal in a deletion strain relative to MatA. Light blue indicates significant decreases in signal (P&lt;0.0017). Genes are ordered according to time of peak expression during the cell cycle according to de Lichtenberg et al. [5] and the cell cycle phase of expression is indicated. (B) Representative histograms showing cell population distributions of fluorescent intensity for the three PCAs used in this study in Mat A, Δelm1 and Δclb2.
