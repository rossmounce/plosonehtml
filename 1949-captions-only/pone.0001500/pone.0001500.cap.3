Dark red indicates increase in PCA signal, dark blue indicates decrease in PCA signal, and black represents no change in PCA signal in a deletion strain relative to <em>MatA</em>. Light blue indicates significant decreases in signal (<em>P</em>&lt;0.0017). Genes are ordered according to time of peak expression during the cell cycle according to de Lichtenberg <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001500-deLichtenberg1">[5]</a> and the cell cycle phase of expression is indicated. (B) Representative histograms showing cell population distributions of fluorescent intensity for the three PCAs used in this study in <em>Mat A</em>, Δ<em>elm1</em> and Δ<em>clb2</em>.</p>
