                Figure 4.  SBF activity is increased in the Elm1 deletion strain.(A) A representative result of semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the SBF-specific gene, CLN1, the MBF-specific gene, CDC45 and control gene, ACT1 in MatA, Î”elm1 and elm1T551A. RT = reverse transcriptase. (B) Average expression of CLN1 and CDC45 normalized to ACT1 expression, over three different experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation.
