                Figure 5.  Phenotypic characterization of the Elm1 deletion strain and the elm1T551A mutant strain.(A) Morphology, doubling time and DNA replication of the three strains, MatA, Î”elm1, and elm1T551A. (B) Elm1-GFP and elm1T551A-GFP expressed from the endogenous ELM1 promoter localize to the bud neck of dividing yeast cells. (C) Interaction between Cdc28 and both Elm1 and elm1T551A was detected at the bud neck of dividing yeast using yEmVenus PCA.
