As a loading control, blots were probed with anti-3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) antibody. (B) Schematic diagram of the Elm1 protein indicating the location of the two PEST motifs in the N- and C-termini, the catalytic domain, and threonine-551 of the single full consensus site of Cdc28 phosphorylation. (C) A proposed model whereby Elm1 functions upstream of Swe1 to relieve its inhibition of Clb/Cdc28 activity. Elm1 may also be phosphorylated by Cdc28 in a negative feedback loop to induce its degradation upon completion of mitosis. Hypothetical interactions are indicated by dashed lines, solid lines represent interactions previously reported in the literature.</p>
