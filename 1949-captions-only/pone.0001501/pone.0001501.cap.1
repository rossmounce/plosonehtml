Indicated are the polyhedrin promoters (PolH), polyadenylation signals, Tn7 regions, gentamicin resistance gene (Gm), and influenza genes (HA, hemagglutinin, M1, matrix 1 protein, NA, neuraminidase); B). Scanning densitometry analysis of purified Indo/05 VLPs. A sample of purified VLPs (4 µg) was electrophoresed on 4–12% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie blue (right panel, lane 3). A scanned image (left panel, lane 3) was used to determine the relative optical density (OD) of HA, NA, and M1. Purity is = OD HA+NA+M1/OD Total in the lane. Purity of this lot of Indo/05 VLPs was 96%. The location of HA, NA, and M1 structural proteins are marked. C). Immunogold electron microsopy of purified Indo/05 VLPs. Left Panel. Primary antibody: Influenza A H5N1 Anti-HA antibody (Biodesign). Secondary antibody: Goat anti-rabbit conjugated to 10 nm gold beads. Right Panel. Control antibody and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10 nm gold beads. Bar represents 100 nm scale.</p>
