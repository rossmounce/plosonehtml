                Figure 2.  Amino acid sequence of hemagglutinin.Top line represents the sequence for A/Indonesia/05/2005, which is the isolate used to generate vaccines studied. Middle line represents the sequence for A/Thailand/2004, which is the isolate used to generate the peptides used for analysis. Bottom line represents the consensus amino acid sequence between the two sequences. Boxed, colored areas represent regions included in each of the 6 peptides pools (15-16 peptides per pool, 15mers overlapping by 11) used for stimulating splenocytes and lung cells in ELISPOTs. The location of the single H2-kd peptide (HA518; (IYSTVASSL) is underlined in peptide pool 6.
