                Figure 3.  Elicitation of HA interferon-γ producing splenocytes and lung cells.ELISpots were performed on isolated splenocytes or lung cells from vaccinated mice (n = 8) collected at week 8. Cells (1×106) were stimulated independently with pools of peptides representing different regions of HA. Splenocytes or lung cells were also stimulated independently with pools of peptides (15mers overlapping by 11 amino acids) or a single peptide HA518 (IYSTVASSL). Following stimulation, cells were assayed for mIFN-γ. HIV-1 Env peptides were used as a non-specific negative control. Splenocytes or lung cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin were used as a positive control. (A) VLP vaccinated intramuscularly against all peptide pools, (B) rHA vaccinated intramuscularly against all peptide pools, (C). Lung responses using HA peptide pool 2. (D). Spleen responses using HA peptide pool 2.
