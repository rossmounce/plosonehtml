Four pools (15mers, overlapping by 11) representing four regions of M1 were used to stimulate cells. HIV-1 Env peptides were used as a non-specific negative control. Splenocytes stimulated with PMA/ionomycin were used as a positive control. Number of IFN-γ ELISPOTs detected using each of the four M1 peptide pools from intramuscularly vaccinated mice with (A) VLP or (B) rHA vaccines.</p>
