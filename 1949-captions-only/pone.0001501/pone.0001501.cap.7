                Figure 7.  Kinetics of Indonesia VLP elicited antisera binding to H5N1 rHA antigens.Kinetics of antisera binding to homologous, Indonesia clade 2 rHA (black square) and heterologous, Viet Nam clade 1 rHA (white square). Values on x-axis represent the apparent association rate of antibody binding to HA and the values on the y-axis represent the apparent disassociation rate of antibody from the HA antigen.
