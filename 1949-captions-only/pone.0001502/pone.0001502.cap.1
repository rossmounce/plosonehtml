                Figure 1.  Survival of H37Rv and H37Rv:ΔdosR in hypoxia-induced bacteriostasis in vitro.Colony forming units per ml of parent strain H37Rv (white bar) and H37Rv:ΔdosR (black bar) were counted at each time point in the (A) standing culture and (B) Wayne models of hypoxia. Data are from one representative experiment of 3 (standing culture) or 5 (Wayne model). Each bar represents a minimum of 3 biological replicates.
