                Figure 2.  The phenotype of H37Rv:ΔdosR in mouse model is indistinguishable from wild type.Bacterial burdens of H37Rv (squares) and H37Rv:ΔdosR (triangles) in the (A) lungs and (B) spleens of C57BL/6 mice over the course of infection. Each point represents the average of three experiments with 3–5 animals per time point in each experiment. Error bars represent standard deviation. (C&amp;D) Disregulation of the DosR regulon in a dosR mutant during murine infection was verified by quantitative real-time PCR of sentinel genes Rv0081 (C) and Rv2031c (D) from H37Rv (white) and H37Rv:ΔdosR (black) mRNA isolated from mouse lungs at 4 and 6 weeks post infection. Values were normalized to housekeeping gene SigA and shown as the ratio of normalized in vivo expression to log phase in vitro levels of expression.
