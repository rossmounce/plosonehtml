Each point represents the average of three experiments with 3–5 animals per time point in each experiment. Error bars represent standard deviation. (C&amp;D) Disregulation of the DosR regulon in a <em>dosR</em> mutant during murine infection was verified by quantitative real-time PCR of sentinel genes Rv0081 (C) and Rv2031c (D) from H37Rv (white) and H37Rv:Δ<em>dosR</em> (black) mRNA isolated from mouse lungs at 4 and 6 weeks post infection. Values were normalized to housekeeping gene SigA and shown as the ratio of normalized <em>in vivo</em> expression to log phase <em>in vitro</em> levels of expression.</p>
