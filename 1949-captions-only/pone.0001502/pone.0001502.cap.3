                Figure 3.  Enduring hypoxic response (EHR) dominates the hypoxic time course.Numbers of genes significantly induced over log phase (&gt;two fold, FDR&lt;0.4%) were tabulated at each time point over a hypoxic time course. Each bar represents the total number of genes (gray) and genes from the EHR (black).
