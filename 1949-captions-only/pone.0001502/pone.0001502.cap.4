                Figure 4.  Downstream hypoxic response independent of DosR regulon.Each bar represents the number of genes induced in H37Rv at each point during a short hypoxic time course (&gt;two fold in all three arrays). The DosR regulon represents a dwindling fraction of the genes induced over time (gray). Very few genes were induced in H37Rv and not in the dosR mutant (diagonal lines). The overwhelming majority of genes induced in the parent strain at later hypoxic time points were also induced in the mutant (black).
