The DosR regulon represents a dwindling fraction of the genes induced over time (gray). Very few genes were induced in H37Rv and not in the <em>dosR</em> mutant (diagonal lines). The overwhelming majority of genes induced in the parent strain at later hypoxic time points were also induced in the mutant (black).</p>
