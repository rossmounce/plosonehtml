                Figure 1.  Nuclear ataxin-1 accumulations do not resemble aggregates formed by other disease-related polyglutamine-expanded proteins.(A). Live cell images of wild-type and polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 (Atx1[Q2]GFP and Atx1[Q85]GFP) and polyglutamine-expanded proteins androgen receptor (AR[Q112]GFP), huntingtin exon-1 (Htt[Q103]GFP), NLS[Q64]GFP and Q65-GPF in Cos7 cells. (B). Filtertrap assay of celllysates of Cos7 cells expressing Atx1[Q2]GFP, Atx1[Q85]GFP and NLS[Q64]GFP, 24, 48 and 72 hr after transfection (upper panel) and of Cos7 cells expressing AR[Q112]GFP, Q65-GFP and Htt[Q103]GFP 24 hours after transfection (lower panel). Sizebar = 1 Âµm.
