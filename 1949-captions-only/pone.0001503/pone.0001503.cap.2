                Figure 2.  Polyglutamine expansion accelerates ataxin-1 dynamics.(A). Atx1[Q2]GFP and Atx1[Q85]GFP form similarly sized nuclear accumulations including small nuclear accumulations (upper panel) and large nuclear accumulations (lower panel). (B). PolyQ expansion enhances ataxin-1 nuclear accumulation fusion speed. Pictures 1–5 show fusion of two Atx1[Q85]GFP nuclear accumulations within 150 seconds. The fusion speed of Atx1[85Q]GFP nuclear accumulations is faster than of similarly sized Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations (lower panel, n = 9 resp. 11). Data have been tested non-parametrically (**P&lt;0.005). (C). Increased mobility of Atx1[Q85]GFP over Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations 24 hours after transfection. The Y-axis depicts the average mean square displacement (MSD) of 93 Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations and 128 similarly sized Atx1[Q85]GFP nuclear accumulations. (D). Atx1[Q85]GFP nuclear accumulations have a higher on/off rate than Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations. FRAP live cell experiments were performed 24 hr after transfection. Small and large nuclear accumulations have been analyzed separately. Half-time recovery data have been tested non-parametrically (**P&lt;0.005, *P&lt;0.05). Sizebar = 1 µm.
