                Figure 3.  Nuclear ataxin-1 accumulations distribute symmetrically to daughter cells during cell division.Representative series of images showing cell division of a cell containing fluorescent aggregates or nuclear accumulations. (A). Asymmetric distribution of Q65-GFP aggregates in time. Arrows indicate the two daughter cells. (B). Symmetric distribution of Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations during cell division. Nuclear accumulations fuse prior to division. After division both daughter cells contain cytoplasmic accumulations and later nuclear accumulations. (C). Symmetric distribution of Atx1[Q85]GFP nuclear accumulations during cell division. Time is indicated in minutes. Sizebar = 1 Âµm.
