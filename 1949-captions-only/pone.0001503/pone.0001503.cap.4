                Figure 4.  Polyglutamine expansion does not affect ataxin-1 shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.(A). Cos-7 cells and N2A and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells contain cytoplasmic accumulations of both Atx1[Q2]GFP and Atx1[Q85]GFP. (B). Representative nucleocytoplasmic shuttling assay in a Cos-7 bikaryon with small and large Atx1[Q2]GFP nuclear accumulations. Shuttling to the bleached nucleus is only observed when small nuclear accumulations are present. (C). Atx1[Q85]GFP can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm when bikaryons of Cos-7 cell contain small nuclear accumulations. When large nuclear accumulations are present there is no nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of either Atx1[Q2]GFP or Atx1[Q85]GFP. The bleached region is indicated in white. Sizebar = 1 Âµm.
