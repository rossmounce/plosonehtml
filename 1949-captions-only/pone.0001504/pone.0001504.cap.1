The effects diet on gene expression in mice.The height of each column indicates the percentage of genes showing expression differences (at ANOVA p&lt;0.01) between mice fed two different diets, in liver (green) or brain (blue). The lighter coloured stem of each column shows the percentage of diet-related genes that would be expected by chance alone, calculated by means of 1,000 permutations.
