The lighter coloured stem of each column shows the percentage of diet-related genes that would be expected by chance alone, calculated by means of 1,000 permutations. The labels are: Chimp-chimpanzee diet; Cafe-human cafeteria diet; F.Food-human fast food diet; Cafe+F.Food-human cafeteria and fast food diets together.</p>
