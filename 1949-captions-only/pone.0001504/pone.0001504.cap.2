                Figure 2.  Overlap between liver gene expression differences in mice and primates.The numbers of human-mouse orthologous genes differentially expressed (at ANOVA p&lt;0.01) between mice fed human diets and a chimpanzee diet in liver (green circle), and genes differentially expressed (at t-test p&lt;0.01) between human and chimpanzee livers (orange circle). The number in the overlap between the two circles (red) indicates genes showing significant expression differences in both data sets. A total of 5,546 genes with detectable expression in both data sets show no significant expression differences in either data set.
