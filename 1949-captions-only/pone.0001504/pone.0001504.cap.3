                Figure 3.  Sequence divergence of genes potentially involved in human-chimpanzee dietary differences.Median sequence divergence estimates between humans and chimpanzees is shown for promoter regions (left) and for amino acid sequences (Ka/Ki) (right). The error bars represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the median, calculated by resampling from the divergence estimate distributions for each gene set 1,000 times.
