(B) Voxels correlated to the reference waveform were assigned one of 12 colors, according to the phase delay giving the maximal correlation. Because the number of jet positions was only four (D1) or six (D2/D4), the color values included interpolated phase lags. (C) The colors corresponded to locations on the digit surface, although the mapping from phase delay to location differed depending on stimulation direction.</p>
