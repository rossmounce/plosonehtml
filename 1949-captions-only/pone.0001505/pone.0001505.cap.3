In each panel, cortical areas 4. 3a. 3b. and 1 are shown in grayscale according to the legend at right. The phase delays of active voxels are shown according to the reference bars at top (see <a href="#pone-0001505-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Black circles and associated Talairach coordinates give the location of the fundus in these slices, estimated as the centroid of the area 3a cortex. Approximate directions L (left), R (right), S (superior) and I (inferior) are given in (A), top. A scale bar is shown in (B), bottom.</p>
