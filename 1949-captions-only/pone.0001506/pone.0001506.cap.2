Statistical parametric t maps were generated by SPM 2; thresholded for display (color bar: 2&lt;t&lt;5) on the single-subject MNI brain template (“Colin”) in MRICro. Coronal brain sections on the left in (a) and (b) are at y = −6 mm; images on the right in <strong>(A)</strong> and <strong>(B)</strong> are at y = 10 mm and y = 6 mm, respectively. The response to “unseen” cocaine cues in a large bilateral ventral pallidum/left amygdala cluster <strong>(C)</strong> strongly predicted (peak voxel, MNI x, y, z coordinates: −14, −6, −6; t = 7.11; p = 0.000 uncorrected; p = 0.015 cluster-corrected) future affective response to visible cocaine cues <strong>(D</strong>; r = 0.92<strong>)</strong>. Brain response to 33 msec “unseen” aversive cues (<em>not shown; see </em><strong><em><a href="#pone.0001506.s003"><span class="underline">Figure S1</span></a></em></strong><em> in Supporting Materials</em>) varied across individuals, with increased activity in the insula predicting the later affective response to visible aversive cues. Abbreviations: R: right, L: left, v: ventral, amyg: amygdala, si: substantia innominata, tp: temporal pole. [NOTE: The ventral boundary of the BOLD acquisition plane for the current studies is z = −40; temporal pole activations may extend ventrally below the acquisition plane.].</p>
