(B) Quantifications of p53 protein levels are shown. Data represent the mean ± standard error (SE), for <em>n = 3</em> independent experiments. (C,D) Maximum projections from fluorescence image stacks of live yeast cells expressing p53-ECFP were obtained with a DeltaVision workstation. Bar, 2 µm. <em>E,F,G,H.</em> Same as in <em>(A,B,C,D)</em> but for Mdm2.</p>
