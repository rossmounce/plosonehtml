                Figure 2.  Mdm2 ubiquitylates p53 in yeast leading to p53 degradation.(A) Total yeast cell extracts from exponentially growing cells were immunoblotted for the indicated proteins over time. 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) was used as loading control. (B) Quantifications of protein levels are shown. Data represent the mean Â± standard error (SE), for n = 3 independent experiments. (C,D) as in (A,B) but for p53W23S. (E,F) as in (A,B) but for p53Lys2Arg.
