                Figure 4.  p53-Mdm2 complexes localize to yeast nuclear bodies morphologically akin to human PML bodies.Immunogold labeling against p53 (A,D,E) or Mdm2 (C,F) of thin sections of yeast cells expressing the indicated proteins. Total number of cells analyzed for each case: 10. (B) Magnification of the p53-Mdm2 body (arrowhead) in the cell in panel A.
