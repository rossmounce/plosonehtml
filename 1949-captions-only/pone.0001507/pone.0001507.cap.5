                Figure 5.  The human PML protein can relocate to the p53-Mdm2 bodies in yeast.(A,B,C,D) Maximum projections from fluorescence image stacks of live yeast cells expressing the indicated fusion proteins were obtained with a DeltaVision workstation. Bar, 2 Âµm. (E) Table showing the percentage of cells in which the indicated proteins co-localize. Percentages were calculated from more than 100 cells each.
