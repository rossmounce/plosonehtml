(B,C) Sumoylated p53 (asterisks) as detected by immunoblotting on crude yeast lysates. An irrelevant lane was cut off as indicated by a space. PGK immunoblotting served as loading control. (D–G) Maximum projections from fluorescence image stacks of live yeast cells expressing the indicated fusion proteins were obtained with a DeltaVision workstation. Bar, 2 µm.</p>
