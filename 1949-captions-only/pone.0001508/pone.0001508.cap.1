<h4>Use of the <em>Membranome</em> phage-Ab collection</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The 10 k <em>Membranome</em> phage-Ab collection is a “specialized”, low-complexity library of clones which bind receptors expressed in their native form on the cell surface. This collection can be surveyed to rapidly identify antibodies binding epitopes of known cell-surface receptors. The most attractive use of the <em>Membranome</em> collection, however, is to select antibodies targeting epitopes of unknown receptors with specific expression features, which is the case of the tumor-associated receptors specifically over-expressed in tumor. Identifying such antibodies, however, is a goal barred by the lack of an efficient protocol for differential screening. Let us consider the case of a target and a reference biological sample. Panning the <em>Membranome</em> phage-Ab collection on each of these samples generated two phage populations. The goal is to identify clones preferentially or exclusively present in one of the two populations. Testing the binding specificity of individual clones from these populations would require large quantities of biological samples, which generally are available only in limited quantities, and would survey only a minor part of the population.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>We addressed the problem from a different perspective. Sequencing a number of clones from the test and the reference population of phage-Ab could reveal clones which are differentially represented in the two pools, but clearly, a statistically significant comparison of the two populations would require a very large number of sequences. To efficiently acquire this information we developed a novel DNA-based screening technology we called <em>tagArray</em>. First we designed a set of short oligonucleotides that could be used as tags and cloned each single tag into each phagemid coding for a phage-Ab (see <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a> for details). In this way we generated an association between a specific tag and a specific scFv sequence, which makes it possible to measure the frequency of each scFv clone in a population by measuring frequency of the associated tag. Moreover, standard phage-binding screening protocols can be replaced by well-established DNA amplification and hybridization methods and high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarray. The tagArray technology enables the entire populations to be compared in an efficient and sensitive way, using minimal amounts of selector samples. The screening protocol is organized in four steps: i) the tagged phage population is panned in parallel on a biological and a reference sample generating two distinct phage populations; ii) tag sequences are amplified from the target and reference phage populations, labeled with different fluorochromes and hybridized on a double channel DNA microarray containing the complete repertoire of tag sequences; iii) analysis of the hybridization data identifies the tags differentially represented in the two populations; iv) rescue of the scFv sequence associated to the relative tags are rescued from the phage population (see <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>).</p>


<h4>Identification of phage-Abs that bind tumor cells by <em>tagArray</em> screening</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>During the process of collecting the 10,000 phage-Ab of the 10 k-Membranome collection, we generated a preliminary version composed of the first 4,000 clones that were identified (4k-Membranome phage-Ab collection). A set of tag sequences was inserted in the phagemids of the 4k-<em>Membranome</em> collection, as detailed in <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>. Biopsy specimens from tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected from two colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pt#78 and pt#80), samples were disaggregated by enzymatic treatment and the epithelial cells affinity purified. The tagged 4 k <em>Membranome</em> collection was panned on these primary epithelial cells to generate two pairs of tumor (T) and normal (N) phage populations (T<sub>78</sub> and N<sub>78</sub>; T<sub>80</sub> and N<sub>80</sub>; <a href="#pone-0001508-g002">Figure 2</a>). Tag sequences from each T and N matched population were amplified, labeled with different fluorochromes, mixed and hybridized to a DNA microarray containing the complete repertoire of tag sequences. The intensity of the two fluorochromes was measured for each spot of the microarray and analyzed as average intensity and ratio from two independent fluor-reversal experiments. The former reflects the average abundance whereas the latter reveals the differential frequency of each tag in the matched populations. Candidate tags were selected on the basis of statistical criteria (see <a href="#s4">Materials and methods</a>) limiting our analysis to tags whose average intensity was higher than log<sub>2</sub>10. Since we aimed at identifying clones specifically enriched in the T as compared to the matched N phage population, we focused our attention on tags exhibiting the highest T/N ratio in both patients (average T/N ratio higher than 70% of the maximal ratio detected at the same intensity). This process identified a set of 174 tags among which we randomly chose a subset of 61 elements. By utilizing a nested PCR amplification protocol employing primers encompassing the tag sequence, we recovered 45 different phage-Abs associated with the selected tags from the T populations. This partial redundancy in the phage-Abs identified was expected since, under the experimental conditions adopted, a phage-Ab can be associated to more than one tag.</p>
