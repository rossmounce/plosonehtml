                Figure 3.  Binding specificity of selected clones.Binding of phage-Ab HL60-D3-232, HeLa-D2-20, HL60-C3-16 and a control phage-Ab (a) or of Mbr-4 and a control isotypic IgG (Mbr-ctrl; b) to human epithelial primary cells was measured by flow cytometry. Primary cells were obtained from matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue from CRC patients #78 (white and dark grey bars, respectively) and #80 (pale grey and black bars, respectively). Data are reported as percentage of gated cells. In panel a, numbers on top of tumor sample bars refer to the difference of percentage between that tumor and the matched normal sample (top line) and to the T/N ratio detected by tagArray analysis for the corresponding tags (bottom line).
