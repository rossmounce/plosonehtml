                Figure 4.  Schematic outline of the biochemical strategy adopted for the identification of the target antigens.Membrane proteins on living cells are selectively labeled with fluorescent dyes (i), then isolated in native conformation and in soluble form by extraction with appropriate buffers (ii). The target antigen is pulled down using the beads-immobilized IgG of interest (iii). Immuno-purified material is analyzed by 1D-PAGE and membrane proteins discriminated from non-specific binders by dual-wavelength scan of the gel (iv). Positive band is excised and processed for MS-based protein identification.
