The target antigen is pulled down using the beads-immobilized IgG of interest (iii). Immuno-purified material is analyzed by 1D-PAGE and membrane proteins discriminated from non-specific binders by dual-wavelength scan of the gel (iv). Positive band is excised and processed for MS-based protein identification.</p>
