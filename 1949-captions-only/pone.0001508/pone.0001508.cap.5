                Figure 5.  In vitro characterization of anti-TfRC Mbr-4.(a) The indicated cell lines were incubated for 72 hrs at 37°C with 100 µg/mL of Mbr-2, Mbr-4, Mbr-114 or an isotypic control. Cell viability is reported as percentage of the isotopic control treated cells. (b) HCT-116 cells were incubated for 48, 72 and 96 hrs with 0.8 (•), 4 (▪) and 20 (▴) µg/mL of Mbr-4 or with an isotypic control (○). Cell apoptosis is reported as percentage of Annexin V-, 7AAD-positive cells.
