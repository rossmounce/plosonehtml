A first group of mice (filled triangles; n = 12) was administered with 10 i.p. injections of 0.5 mg IgG-4 three times a week starting from day = 0. Mice from this group were followed up to day = 64. A second group of mice (empty circles, n = 12) was administered injections of control isotypic IgG according to the same protocol and followed up to day = 35, when mice were sacrificed for ethical reasons. Both groups were monitored for tumor growth expressed as percentage of free mice (panel a) and tumor volume (b). Error bars in panel b indicate standard error of the mean (S.E.M).</p>
