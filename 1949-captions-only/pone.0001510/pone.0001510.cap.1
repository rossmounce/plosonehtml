Arrows marked hypocotyl-root junction. (B) Root elongation rate was 6.4±1 and 1.8±0.1 mm/day for light- and dark-grown plants, respectively (n = 10; repeated three times, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (C) Root diameter was 148±12 and 90±5 µm for light- and dark-grown seedlings, respectively (n = 10; repeated three times, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). Normalized root basipetal auxin transport (D) and acropetal auxin transport (E) in dark-grown plants was 77% and 50% that of light-grown counterparts (n = 8; repeated three times, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05). (F-K) Shown were median optical sections of root tips of plants grown in light (F, H, I) and dark (G, I, K), expressing PIN2-eGFP (F, G), PIN1-eGFP (H, I) and PIN7-eGFP (J, K), and counter stained for cell walls with propidium iodide (red). Error bars represent standard deviations. Scale bars, 2 mm (A); 50 µm (F-K; left panels); 10 µm (F-K; right panels).</p>
