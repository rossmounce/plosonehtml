No vacuolar accumulation of PIN2-eGFP was observed by DIC imaging (middle and right; insets). (B) In dark-grown seedlings, PIN2-eGFP PM-localization was greatly reduced (left; inset) and a detectable level of PIN2-eGFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments (middle and right; insets). (C, D) Lysotracker red (red) labeling of vacuolar compartments in root epidermis cells of light-grown (C; middle) and dark-grown (D; middle) plants. PIN2-eGFP only accumulated in vacuoles of dark-grown plants (C, D). Insets were close-up images. (E, F) Immuno-fluorescence labeling of the endogenous PIN2 protein in light-grown and dark-grown wild type plants. The endogenous PIN2 protein was localized to the apical end of root epidermal cells of a 5-day-old light-grown plant (E; red). In 5-day-old dark-grown plants, PIN2 was greatly reduced from the PM, and localized in vacuolar compartments (F; red). Scale bar, 50 µm (A, B), 10 µm (C–F).</p>
