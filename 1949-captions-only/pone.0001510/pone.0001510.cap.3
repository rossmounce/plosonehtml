PIP2A-GFP was predominantly on the PM of all root cells, except that it was excluded from the quiescent center and surrounding initial cells, of light-grown plants (C). In dark-grown seedlings, a detectable level of PIP2A-GFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments (D). deltaTIP-GFP labeled both the PM and tonoplast membrane of root cells of light-grown (E) and dark-grown (F) plants. Shown in right and insets were close-up images. Scale bars, 50 µm (left), 25 µm (right).</p>
