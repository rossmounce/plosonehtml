                Figure 3.  Localization of AUX1-YFP, PIP2A-GFP and deltaTIP-GFP in light- and dark-grown plants.AUX1-YFP was mainly localized to the basal PM of lateral root cap and central pre-vascular cells, and to the PM of root columella cells in both light-grown (A) and dark-grown (B) seedling roots. PIP2A-GFP was predominantly on the PM of all root cells, except that it was excluded from the quiescent center and surrounding initial cells, of light-grown plants (C). In dark-grown seedlings, a detectable level of PIP2A-GFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments (D). deltaTIP-GFP labeled both the PM and tonoplast membrane of root cells of light-grown (E) and dark-grown (F) plants. Shown in right and insets were close-up images. Scale bars, 50 µm (left), 25 µm (right).
