In dark-grown <em>det3-1</em> mutant, a high level of PIN2-eGFP was detected both at the PM and in vacuolar compartments, compared to the dark-grown control plant, where PIN2-eGFP was greatly reduced from the PM and a greatly reduced level accumulated in vacuolar compartments (B, D). Shown were root epidermal cells imaged under identical confocal settings. Scale bars, 50 µm (left), 10 µm (right).</p>
