                Figure 4.  Enhanced PIN2-eGFP vacuolar accumulation in dark-grown det3-1 mutant.PIN2-eGFP was slightly enhanced in diffuse and punctate cytoplasmic structures in light-grown det3-1 mutant, compared to the eir1-1 control plant (A, C). In dark-grown det3-1 mutant, a high level of PIN2-eGFP was detected both at the PM and in vacuolar compartments, compared to the dark-grown control plant, where PIN2-eGFP was greatly reduced from the PM and a greatly reduced level accumulated in vacuolar compartments (B, D). Shown were root epidermal cells imaged under identical confocal settings. Scale bars, 50 µm (left), 10 µm (right).
