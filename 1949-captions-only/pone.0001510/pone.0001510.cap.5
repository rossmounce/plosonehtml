                Figure 5.  Vacuolar accumulation of PIN2-eGFP did not require de novo protein synthesis.Five-day-old light-grown PIN2-eGFP seedlings were pulse-labeled with an endocytosis marker, FM4-64, and pre-treated on growth media with or without cycloheximide (CHX; 50 µM) for 30 min. The plants were then shifted to dark and incubated for 4 hrs. In the absence of cycloheximide, PIN2-eGFP (green) accumulated in vacuolar compartments marked by FM4-64 (red) (A). Similarly, in the presence of cycloheximide, PIN2-eGFP also accumulated in vacuolar compartments in plants after shift to dark (B). Shown were root epidermis cells. Scale bar, 10 µm.
