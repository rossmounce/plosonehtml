The plants were then shifted to dark and incubated for 4 hrs. In the absence of cycloheximide, PIN2-eGFP (green) accumulated in vacuolar compartments marked by FM4-64 (red) (A). Similarly, in the presence of cycloheximide, PIN2-eGFP also accumulated in vacuolar compartments in plants after shift to dark (B). Shown were root epidermis cells. Scale bar, 10 µm.</p>
