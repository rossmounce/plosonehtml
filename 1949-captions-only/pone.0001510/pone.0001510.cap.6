Both PIN2-eGFP (green) and FM4-64 (red) were restricted to the plasma membrane (PM) at T = 0 (A, E). At T = 30 min after transfer to dark, FM4-64 internalized to early endosomes and marked PIN2-eGFP-labeled endosomes (B). At T = 4 hrs after transfer to dark, PIN2-eGFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments, whose membrane was now labeled with FM4-64 (C). At T = 8 hrs after transfer to dark, strong vacuolar accumulation of PIN2-eGFP and FM4-64 labeling of vacuolar membrane were visible (D). On the other hand, FM4-64 labeled endosomes at T = 30 min (F) and vacuolar compartments at T = 4 and 8 hrs in seedling kept in the light condition (E–H). But, PIN2-eGFP remained at the PM under light (E–H). (A–H) Shown were root epidermal cells. Left, PIN2-eGFP (green); middle, FM4-64 (red); right, merged images. Scale bars, 10 µm. (I) RT-PCR analysis of steady state <em>PIN2</em> transcript levels in seedlings grown in continuous light (left) or after light-to-dark transition (right) for up to 24 hrs. The steady state transcript levels of an <em>Actin</em> gene were used as internal loading controls. (J) Real-time qRT-PCR analysis of steady state <em>PIN2</em> levels, normalized against the level of the <em>Actin</em> gene. Shown were the average <em>PIN2/Actin</em> ratios of three independent experiments. (K) Fluorescence intensities of PIN2-eGFP at the PM of root epidermis cells of light-grown plants kept in light (blue line) or shifted to dark (red line) for 0, 4, 8 and 12 hrs. Significant differences were observed between light- and dark-shifted plants at T = 4, 8 and 12 hrs (n = 168–466; Student's <em>t</em>-test, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001).</p>
