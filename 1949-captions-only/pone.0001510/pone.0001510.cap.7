(B) PIN2-eGFP asymmetric location in root epidermis cells was maintained in light-grown plants shifted to continuous blue light (475 nm) for 24 hrs. When light-grown plants were shifted to continuous red light (660 nm) for 5 hrs (C) or 24 hrs (D), PIN2-eGFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments. When light-grown plants were shifted to continuous far red light (730 nm) for 5 hrs (E) or 24 hrs (F), PIN2-eGFP accumulated in vacuolar compartments. (G) PIN2-eGFP was greatly reduced from the PM of root epidermis cells of light-grown <em>hy5-1</em> mutant. PIN2-eGFP was moderately enhanced at the PM in light-grown homozygous <em>cop9-1</em> mutant (I), compared to that of the wild type plant (H). In dark-grown <em>cop9-1</em> mutant, PIN2-eGFP PM localization was enhanced and vacuolar accumulation was reduced (K), compared to that of the dark-grown wild type plant (J). In the presence of MG132 (50 µM), PIN2-eGFP PM localization was enhanced, while vacuolar accumulation was reduced in the light-grown plant after shift to dark for 20 hrs (M), compared to the reduced PM localization and increased vacuolar accumulation in the wild type plant after shift to dark for 20 hrs (L). Shown in right (A–G) were close-up images. Scale bars, 50 µm (A–G, left); 10 µm (A–G, right; H–M).</p>
