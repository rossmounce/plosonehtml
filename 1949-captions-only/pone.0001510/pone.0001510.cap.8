                Figure 8.  PIN2-eGFP intracellular distribution in excised roots.Four-day-old light grown PIN2-eGFP seedlings, after removal of cotyledons, were transferred to either light (A) or dark (B) for 10 hrs. PIN2-eGFP was localized to the PM in excised roots incubated in the presence of light (A). By contrast, PIN2-eGFP was accumulated in vacuolar compartments in excised roots incubated in the absence of light (B). Shown in right were close-up images. Scale bars, 50 µm (left); 10 µm (right).
