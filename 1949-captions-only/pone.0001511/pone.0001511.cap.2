                Figure 2.  KCR1 suppresses recombinant IHCN2 current density.(A) Representative HCN2 whole-cell currents in absence and presence of KCR1. (B) Mean current densities of heterologously expressed HCN2 alone or together with KCR1 demonstrate that KCR1 significantly (*, p&lt;0.001) reduced current density of recombinant IHCN2.
