                Figure 3.  Electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of IHCN/If on single-channel level from inside-out recordings.(A) Representative HCN2 single-channel currents (sampling frequency: 5 kHz, corner frequency: 1 kHz) of inside-out recordings from one- and multi-channel (n~50 channels) patches at different test-potentials (−90 to −130 mV). (B) Pharmacological characteristics of HCN2 single-channels (test potential: −90 mV, holding potential: −35 mV). Ivabradine (50 µM) blocks HCN2 single-channel current during repetitive activation/deactivation steps (−90 mV, 150 ms/+10 mV, 600 ms). The observations that ivabradine significantly reduced the open probability (25.8±7.07% vs.6.08±3.45%, n = 4, p&lt;0.05), the mean open time (1.03±0.12 ms vs. 0.61±0.16 ms, n = 4, p&lt;0.05) and the availability (75.9±10.1% vs. 25.3±6.98%, n = 4, p&lt;0.05) suggests an open-channel blockade by a fast and a slow gating mechanism. cAMP induced an increase of the channel activity (for data, see text). The data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. (C) Effect of ivabradine (Iva) and cAMP on single-channel activity. Open probability (Popen) decreased after ivabradine (50 µM) and increased after cAMP (1 mM) application, respectively. Data recorded as in Figure 3B.
