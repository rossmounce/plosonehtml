                Figure 4.  Effect of KCR1 on single recombinant HCN2 channel gating in one-channel patches.(A) Comparison of single recombinant HCN2 channels transfected in CHO cells alone (left) and with KCR1 (right). Middle, 20 consecutive single traces of each channel without and with KCR1. Single channels were hyperpolarized at continuous pulse mode for a total duration of 3 s (20×150 ms sweeps), with a holding potential of −35 mV and a test potential of −90 mV. Bottom, ensemble average current of one consecutive sweep of 3 s pulse duration. Scale bars, 50 ms, 6 pA (unitary current traces) for HCN2 alone (left) and 2 pA when co-transfected with KCR1 (right), or 1 s, 0.5 pA (ensemble average current) for HCN2 and HCN2+KCR1. (B) KCR1 significantly shifted IHCN2 activation to more negative potentials. Channel activation was measured by the parameter availability, plotted against the test potential and then determined by using the Boltzmann function. For data see text. (C) Open-time histograms: KCR1 reduced the number of HCN2 open states. Number of open events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned open time durations for HCN2 alone and HCN2+KCR1 (pooled one- and multi [n≤3]-channel experiments). (D) Closed-time histograms: KCR1 did not affect the number of HCN2 closed states. Number of closed events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned closed time durations for HCN2 alone and HCN2+KCR1 (pooled one-channel experiments only).
