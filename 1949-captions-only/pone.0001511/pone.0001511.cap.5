                Figure 5.  KCR1 reduces current size of native If in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.(Aâ€“C) Original whole-cell recordings of If in neonatal rat cardiocytes: (A) control, (B) KCR1-infected and (C) KCR1siRNA-infected. (D) Mean current densities of If in neonatal cells show that KCR1 overexpression reduced If, while suppression of endogenous KCR1 by KCR1siRNA significantly increased native If (*, p&lt;0.001).
