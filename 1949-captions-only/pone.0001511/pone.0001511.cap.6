                Figure 6.  Effect of KCR1 on single native If channel gating in one-channel patches.(A) Comparison between single native If channels of control adult ventriculocytes (left) and KCR1-infected cells (right). Recording technique as in Figure 3. Scale bars, 50 ms, 2.5 pA for unitary current traces, and 1 s, 60 fA for ensemble average current. (B) KCR1 significantly shifted If activation to more negative potentials. Channel activation was measured by the parameter availability, plotted against the test potential and then determined by using the Boltzmann function. For data see text. (C) Open-time histograms: KCR1 exhibited no effect on the number of native If open states. Number of open events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned open time durations for If alone and with exogenous KCR1 (pooled one- and multi [nâ‰¤3]-channel experiments). (D) Closed-time histograms: KCR1 did not affect the number of native If closed states. Number of closed events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned closed time durations for If alone and with exogenous KCR1 (pooled one-channel experiments only).
