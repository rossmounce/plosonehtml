Recording technique as in <a href="#pone-0001511-g003">Figure 3</a>. Scale bars, 50 ms, 3 pA for unitary current traces, and 1 s, 20 fA for ensemble average current. (B) Enhanced expression and knock-down of KCR1 significantly shifted the half-maximal activation of I<sub>f</sub> to more negative and more positive potentials, respectively. Channel activation was measured by the parameter availability, plotted against the test potential and then determined by using the Boltzmann function. For data see text. (C) Open-time histograms: KCR1 exhibited no effect on the number of native I<sub>f</sub> open states, whereas KCR1<sup>siRNA</sup> induced an increase of the number of open states. Number of open events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned open time durations for I<sub>f</sub> alone and with exogenous KCR1 or KCR1<sup>siRNA</sup> (pooled one- and multi [nâ‰¤3]-channel experiments). (D) Closed-time histograms: KCR1 did not affect the number of native I<sub>f</sub> closed states, while KCR1 knock-down resulted in a loss of one closed state. Number of closed events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned closed time durations for I<sub>f</sub> alone and with exogenous KCR1 or KCR1<sup>siRNA</sup> (pooled one-channel experiments only).</p>
