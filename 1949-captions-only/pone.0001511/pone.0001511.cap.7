                Figure 7.  Effect of KCR1 and KCR1siRNA on single native If channel gating in one-channel patches.(A) Comparison between single native If channels of control neonatal ventriculocytes (left), KCR1-infected (middle) and KCR1siRNA-infected cells (right). Recording technique as in Figure 3. Scale bars, 50 ms, 3 pA for unitary current traces, and 1 s, 20 fA for ensemble average current. (B) Enhanced expression and knock-down of KCR1 significantly shifted the half-maximal activation of If to more negative and more positive potentials, respectively. Channel activation was measured by the parameter availability, plotted against the test potential and then determined by using the Boltzmann function. For data see text. (C) Open-time histograms: KCR1 exhibited no effect on the number of native If open states, whereas KCR1siRNA induced an increase of the number of open states. Number of open events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned open time durations for If alone and with exogenous KCR1 or KCR1siRNA (pooled one- and multi [nâ‰¤3]-channel experiments). (D) Closed-time histograms: KCR1 did not affect the number of native If closed states, while KCR1 knock-down resulted in a loss of one closed state. Number of closed events (square root) were plotted against the logarithmically binned closed time durations for If alone and with exogenous KCR1 or KCR1siRNA (pooled one-channel experiments only).
