                Figure 8.  KCR1 suppresses spontaneous action potential activity.(A) Representative original recordings of spontaneous action potentials of control neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. (B) KCR1 infection suppressed spontaneous beating activity in neonatal cells. Action potential artificially induced by a depolarizing pulse in a quiescent neonatal cardiocyte. (C) KCR1siRNA infection accelerated spontaneous beating activity in neonatal cells. (D) Overexpression and knock-down of endogenous KCR1 resulted in a significant (*, p&lt;0.001) decrease and increase of the beating rate, respectively. For data see text.
