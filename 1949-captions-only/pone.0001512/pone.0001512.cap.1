                Figure 1.  Fate mapping of T cells from WT and HY-TCR transgenic mice expressing endogenous TCRα using RORγt-cre.CD4 and CD8α expression by gated HY (T3.70)− TCRβ+ lymph node cells (left column) is shown in the second column. EYFP expression by HY−CD4+ and HY−CD8α+ T cells is shown.
