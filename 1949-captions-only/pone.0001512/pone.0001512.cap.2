                Figure 2.  Fate mapping of IEL from WT and HY-TCR transgenic mice expressing endogenous TCRα using RORγt-cre.CD4 and CD8α expression by gated HY (T3.70)− TCRβ+ IEL (left column) is shown in the second column. CD8β expression by gated CD8α+ cells (second column) is shown in the third column. EYFP expression by HY−CD4+, HY−CD8αα+ and HY−CD8αβ+ T cells is shown.
