(B) <em>Sox13</em> expression in peripheral T lymphocytes from WT and male HY transgenic mice. As a reference, <em>Sox13</em> expression in TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>hi</sup> thymocytes, which was detected in the same real time PCR measurement, is shown together with <em>Sox13</em> expression in peripheral lymphocyte populations. Relative <em>Sox13</em> expression levels normalized against <em>Hprt</em> expression are shown. The data shown are representative from two experiments with similar results.</p>
