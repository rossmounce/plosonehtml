                Figure 5.  Sox13 expression in thymocyte subpopulations from HY transgenic mice.(A) Sox13 expression in male HY+ DN thymocyte subpopulations, WT DN thymocyte subpopulations and TCRγδ+ thymocyte subsets was determined by real time PCR. (B) Sox13 expression in peripheral T lymphocytes from WT and male HY transgenic mice. As a reference, Sox13 expression in TCRγδ+ CD24hi thymocytes, which was detected in the same real time PCR measurement, is shown together with Sox13 expression in peripheral lymphocyte populations. Relative Sox13 expression levels normalized against Hprt expression are shown. The data shown are representative from two experiments with similar results.
