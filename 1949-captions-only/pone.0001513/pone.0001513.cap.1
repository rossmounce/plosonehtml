                Figure 1.  Structure of the Gr39a locus and splicing pattern with species' phylogeny.A. Schematic presentation of the Gr39a structure (in order) in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis, D. grimshawi. Degraded exons or exons accumulated nonsense mutations are crossed. B. Schematic of the pattern of alternative splicing in the Gr39a. Large exons have the 5′-donor site (GT), while the first 3′-acceptor site (AG) appears in the beginning of the block of three conserved small exons.
