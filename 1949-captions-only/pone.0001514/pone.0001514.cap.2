The SOB Apr lineage-I sequence group (A) and the <em>Archaeglobus fulgidus</em> QmoABC sequences (Bâ€“D) were used as outgroup, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 10% estimated sequence divergence. Branching orders that were only supported by bootstrap resampling values below 50% are shown as multifurcations; percentages greater than 50% of bootstrap resampling supporting a topological element are indicated near the nodes.</p>
