                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic trees based on (A) AprBA, (B) QmoA, (C) QmoB, and (D) QmoC sequences.The trees were inferred using PhyML (maximum likelihood method). The SOB Apr lineage-I sequence group (A) and the Archaeglobus fulgidus QmoABC sequences (Bâ€“D) were used as outgroup, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 10% estimated sequence divergence. Branching orders that were only supported by bootstrap resampling values below 50% are shown as multifurcations; percentages greater than 50% of bootstrap resampling supporting a topological element are indicated near the nodes.
