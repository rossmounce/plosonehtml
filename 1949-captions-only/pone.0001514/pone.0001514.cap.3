Ribbon structure of <em>A. fulgidus</em> AprB (A) colored by secondary structure elements; ribbon structures of AprB models (Bâ€“H) colored by model confidence factor provided by SWISS-MODEL (green, respective region of model and reference structure superpose; red, respective region of model deviates from the reference structure). The missing flexible loop between Cys-B13 and Gly-B19 (enumeration based on <em>A. fulgidus</em> sequence) in models of SOB from Apr lineage-I and <em>Pyrobaculum</em> spp. is marked by red arrows.</p>
