Residues involved in the isoalloxazine binding (e.g. <em>A. fulgidus</em>: Leu-A70, Asn-A74, Trp-A234) are highlighted by green color (missing Asn-A63 in the <em>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</em> AprA model is marked by an arrow), the invariant, positively charged residues His-A398 and Arg-A265 of the active site are blue colored (other AA are colored in grey). Distances are given in Å (B, D). (E) The position of the electron-transferring [4Fe-4S] cluster I and Trp-B48 (highlighted by violet color) of AprB to the FAD cofactor in the AprA protein of <em>A. fulgidus</em> is shown (ribbon structure is colored in grey).</p>
