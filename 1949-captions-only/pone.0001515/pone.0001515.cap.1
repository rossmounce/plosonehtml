<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec1.p6"></a><p>Wilson et al. (2006) determined priorities for protecting endemic birds considering the annual rate of forest loss and diminishing returns as investments proceed. Other studies have found that including the availability of reserves, or ability to swap reserves for more favorable ones, in the future can increase the efficiency of conservation <a href="#pone.0001515-Drechsler1">[20]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001515-Strange1">[21]</a>. Our approach is similarly dynamic and extends these studies to consider current protection, amount of land converted, amount of habitat available, and data on endemism and the total richness of both plants and vertebrates. We also incorporate species complementarity into priority setting at the large scale, where partial rather than entire planning units can be acquired. The dynamic return on investment framework we present can be used to address resource allocation problems that conservation organizations face from scales ranging from sub-ecoregional units to global analysis.</p>

The return reflects the objectives of the funding organization and could include multiple factors, such as species richness, the value of ecosystems services or recreational opportunities. Given, the limited resources available for conservation combined with lack of current protection in the mediterranean biome, we seek the greatest return from each dollar invested for protecting biodiversity and utilize the number of species protected as our return.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2"></a><p>The spatial units of analysis consist of the 39 ecoregions within the mediterranean biome <a href="#pone.0001515-Olson2">[22]</a>. Within each ecoregion we articulate five factors. First, the number of plant and vertebrate species in each ecoregion that could benefit from protection were compiled from existing global datasets organized by ecoregion <a href="#pone.0001515-Kier1">[23]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001515-World1">[24]</a>. This permits us to compare the performance of different priority setting approaches using five simple measures of biodiversity value: total species richness, plant richness, vertebrate richness, endemic vertebrate richness and threatened species richness (IUCN Red List categories critical, endangered, and vulnerable). Second, the area currently protected was calculated based on the World Database on Protected Areas IUCN classes I–IV (2006). Since less than one third of the protected areas in the database have associated polygon data we used the geographic point data. If a protected area overlapped with more than one ecoregion the extent of that protected area was assigned to the ecoregion that the point fell within. Third, the cost of acquiring land for protection was calculated by applying an equation based on a study of 139 terrestrial conservation programs worldwide <a href="#pone.0001515-Balmford1">[25]</a> (see <a href="#pone.0001515.s001">Text S1</a>). Fourth, the amount of natural and semi-natural area available for protected area acquisition was calculated based on global land cover data <a href="#pone.0001515-GLC20001">[26]</a>. Fifth, the projected rate of habitat loss was calculated by combining areas of high human impact based on land use, population pressure, infrastructure and access <a href="#pone.0001515-Sanderson1">[27]</a> with the projected 2015 population data. Highly impacted areas were identified based on cross-referencing the Human Footprint data with country scale data across the mediterranean biome on the extent of urban and agricultural area and normalized by population data for the year 2000. To predict future impacts to habitat, the number of highly impacted gridcells per ecoregion were multiplied by the projected population growth rate between 2000 and 2015 to provide a per annum rate of future impact <a href="#pone.0001515-CIESIN1">[28]</a> (see <a href="#pone.0001515.s001">Text S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0001515.s002">Table S1</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.p3"></a><p>We utilize a return on investment ‘maximize gain heuristic’ similar to the one described in Wilson et al. (2006). The maximize gain heuristic directs investment at each timestep to the ecoregion where the most species can be protected given a fixed budget (see <a href="#pone.0001515.s001">Text S1</a>). We assume that the biodiversity benefit with increasing investment is represented by the species-area relationship <a href="#pone.0001515-Wilson1">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001515-Rosenzweig1">[29]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.p4"></a><p>To assess the relative effectiveness of our approach as a global priority setting technique, we compare the number of species protected using return on investment after 20 years with the number protected when the annual budget is allocated proportional to other characteristics of the ecoregions at the outset of funding. These alternate approaches are also conducted within a dynamic framework accounting for the change in habitat available each year (informed by the predicted rate of habitat loss and changes in the amount of protection with investment) but, with the exception of (c), do not explicitly consider cost efficiency (see <a href="#pone.0001515.s001">Text S1</a>):</p>


<ol class="alpha-lower">

<li>Areas with endemic species (hereafter Endemism): funding is allocated proportional to the number of endemic vertebrate species in each ecoregion paralleling the Endemic Areas approach <a href="#pone.0001515-Stattersfield1">[5]</a>;</li>

<li>Crisis Biomes: funding is allocated proportional to an index which reflects the percent habitat converted divided by the percent habitat protected in each ecoregion <a href="#pone.0001515-Hoekstra1">[6]</a>;</li>

<li>Areas with high threatened species per dollar (hereafter Threatened species/dollar): funding is allocated proportional on an index which reflects the number of threatened species divided by the cost of land in each ecoregion (to reflect key elements of Ando et al.<a href="#pone.0001515-Ando1">[12]</a>); and</li>

<li>Random - each year the annual budget is allocated to any number of the 39 ecoregions at random.</li>

</ol><a id="article1.body1.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.p5"></a><p>When incorporating the complementarity of species within the return on investment framework, our objective is to protect as many different, or ‘distinct’, species as possible. To account for complementarity within biogeographic realms which contain more than one ecoregion, we consider both the number of species endemic to each ecoregion and also those occurring across multiple ecoregions. Both of these are represented by a separate species area curves. As when prioritizing based on species richness or endemism alone, the objective when using complementarity is to maximize the biodiversity benefit per dollar invested. Investment thus favors ecoregions where the sum of the species protected across all of the species area curves is greatest (see <a href="#pone.0001515.s001">Text S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0001515.s003">Fig. S1</a>). Ideally, owing to the renown plant diversity of mediterranean regions <a href="#pone.0001515-Cowling1">[14]</a>, our application of complementarity would seek to maximize the number of distinct plant species across ecoregions. However, since lists of vascular plants by ecoregion are currently unavailable we demonstrate our approach using vertebrate data.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.p6"></a><p>In applying our return on investment approach we constrain conservation efforts by a budget of $100 million per year for a period of 20 years. We also assume that investment results in immediate and successful protection of species.</p>

<h4>Biodiversity Benefit</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>After 20 years, the biodiversity benefited by the return on investment approach is consistently greater than with the four alternate approaches. Return on investment protected 32% to 69% more plant and vertebrate species, 2 to 5 more endemic vertebrates, and 4 to 6 more threatened vertebrates (<a href="#pone-0001515-t001">Table 1</a>, <a href="#pone-0001515-g002">Fig. 2</a>). The second most effective method for protecting total species richness, vertebrate and plant species richness was the Crisis Biomes approach with funding allocated according to an index based on the amount of conversion and protection in each ecoregion, although return on investment still protects a third more total species and five more endemic vertebrates. Even in comparison to an approach specifically designed to capture endemic species (Endemism) performance is again suboptimal by comparison with return on investment protecting two more endemics. Although this is a small number after 20 years, the comparative benefits associated with return on investment will continue to increase over time. In comparison to the Threatened species/dollar approach, which prioritizes ecoregions where the cost of protecting threatened species is lowest, return on investment protected five more threatened species and four more endemic species.</p>
