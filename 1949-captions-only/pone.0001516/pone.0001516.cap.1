(a–b) Whole mount pictures of β-gal staining. (c) Vibratome section through E13.5 lung. (d) Paraffin section through E13.5 β-gal stained lung and counterstained with eosin. (e–h) (e) E12.5 WT and (f) CKO lungs which show decreased branching. (g) E14.5 WT lung and (h) CKO lung which shows partial right isomerization, astereotypic branching and a grape like structure, and absence of trachea. (i–j) H&amp;E staining of sections through the left lobe of (i) E14.5 WT and (j) CKO lungs. Left lobe of CKO lung features proximalized airways and partial lobular septation. (k–l) Immunostaining for β-catenin on sections of (k) E14.5 WT and (l) CKO lungs show a mosaic deletion of β-catenin throughout the lung mesenchyme.</p>
