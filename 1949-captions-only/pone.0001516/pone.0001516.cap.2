(a,b) PITX1 expression in wild type lung is detected throughout the distal epithelium. (b) Expression of PITX1 in the CKO lung is not changed compared to WT. (c) PITX2 expression in wild type lung is detected throughout the epithelium as well as in the mesenchyme at the exception of the mesenchyme directly surrounding the proximal epithelium (arrows). (d) In CKO lungs, PITX2 expression is drastically reduced in the epithelium and mesenchyme. (e) In wild type lungs, PITX3 expression is present in the differentiated PSMCs adjacent to the bronchi. (f) In CKO lungs, PITX3 expression is no longer found as a continuous layer around the bronchi likely reflecting a defect in the formation of the PSMC. (g, h) SMA expression on the same section as (e) and (f).</p>
