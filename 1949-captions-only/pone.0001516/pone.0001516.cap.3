(a–b) <em>Fgf10</em> expression is reduced in the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme of CKO lungs. Inset: vibratome section through the distal left lobes. (c–d) <em>Spry2</em> expression is reduced in the epithelium of CKO lungs. (e–f) No difference in <em>Shh</em> or (g–h) <em>Ptch</em> expression levels in CKO lungs compared to WT lungs. Inset : vibratome section through the distal right lobes. (i–j) <em>Spry4</em> expression is reduced in the distal mesenchyme of CKO lungs illustrating reduced mesenchymal FGF9 signaling. (k–l) β-gal staining of <em>TOPGAL</em> lungs shows similar levels of TOPGAL activity in WT and CKO lungs illustrating the specificity of the <em>β-catenin</em> deletion throughout the mesenchyme. (o–n) <em>Pitx2</em> is completely ablated in CKO lungs at E13.5. (o–p) <em>Pitx2</em> expression is still present in E11.5 CKO embryos even though the <em>Pitx2<sup>−/−</sup></em> phenotype is already apparent indicating that interaction of PITX2 with β-catenin is necessary for β-catenin signaling.</p>
