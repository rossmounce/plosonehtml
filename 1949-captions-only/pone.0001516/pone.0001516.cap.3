                Figure 3.  Reduced Fgf10, Spry2, Spry4 and Pitx2 expression in CKO lungs.Gene expression in E13.5 lungs by WMISH and LacZ staining in WT and CKO lungs (n = 3 for each probe). (a–b) Fgf10 expression is reduced in the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme of CKO lungs. Inset: vibratome section through the distal left lobes. (c–d) Spry2 expression is reduced in the epithelium of CKO lungs. (e–f) No difference in Shh or (g–h) Ptch expression levels in CKO lungs compared to WT lungs. Inset : vibratome section through the distal right lobes. (i–j) Spry4 expression is reduced in the distal mesenchyme of CKO lungs illustrating reduced mesenchymal FGF9 signaling. (k–l) β-gal staining of TOPGAL lungs shows similar levels of TOPGAL activity in WT and CKO lungs illustrating the specificity of the β-catenin deletion throughout the mesenchyme. (o–n) Pitx2 is completely ablated in CKO lungs at E13.5. (o–p) Pitx2 expression is still present in E11.5 CKO embryos even though the Pitx2−/− phenotype is already apparent indicating that interaction of PITX2 with β-catenin is necessary for β-catenin signaling.
