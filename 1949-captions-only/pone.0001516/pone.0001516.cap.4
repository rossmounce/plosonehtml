Reduced expression for FGFR2 in E13.5 CKO lung mesenchyme. Expression in the CKO epithelium is unaffected. (c–d) Immunofluorescence for phospho-ERK (P-ERK) in green (arrows) and β-catenin in red, DAPI (Blue). (e–f) Immunofluorescence for phospho-HistonH3 (PH3) in green and β-catenin in red, DAPI (Blue) (g–j) H&amp;E stained sections through E12.5 WT and CKO lungs cultured for 48h in vitro in the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml FGF9. (g,i) WT lungs grown in the presence of FGF9 (i) show decreased branching, dilation of the epithelium and overproliferation of the distal mesenchyme compared to untreated lungs (g). (h,j) CKO lungs grown in the presence of FGF9 (j) only show an epithelial effect and dilation of the epithelium while proliferation of the distal mesenchyme remains absent. (k) Upper part: western blot analysis on primary culture of WT and CKO lung mesenchyme treated or not with FGF9 with P-ERK, total-ERK, PITX2 and FGFR2 antibodies. Lower part: Co-Immunoprecipitation of PITX2 with β-catenin from primary culture of wild type lung mesenchyme cultured in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. Absence of co-immunoprecipitation of PITX3 with β-catenin from primary culture of wild type lung mesenchyme. (l) Relative <em>β-catenin</em>, <em>Fgfr2</em> and <em>Pitx2</em> expression levels in primary cultures of mesenchyme treated with siRNA to <em>β-catenin</em> (top) and <em>Pitx2</em> (bottom) analyzed by real time PCR.</p>
