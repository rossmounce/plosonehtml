Expression of <em>c-Myc</em> is lost in CKO lung mesenchyme were <em>β-catenin</em> is completely deleted but remains the same were β-catenin expression is unaltered. These sections are adjacent to the ones represented in <a href="#pone-0001516-g001">Fig. 1k,l</a> illustrating mosaic β-catenin deletion. (c-d) Immunofluorescence for β-catenin (green) and α-SMA (red) on sections through E13.5 WT and CKO lungs. Absence of β-catenin in CKO lung mesenchyme and patchy α-SMA expression around the bronchi (d) and high magnification inset in (d). (e–f) Untreated primary cultures of mesenchyme from both WT and CKO lungs spontaneously differentiate into smooth muscle cells in vitro. (g–h) Primary cultures from WT lungs treated with FGF9 fail to differentiate into smooth muscle cells (g) while primary cultures from CKO lungs (h) are not affected in their differentiation after FGF9 treatment. (i–l) Immunofluorescence for β-catenin (green) and P-ERK (red) on primary culture of WT and CKO lung mesenchyme treated or not with FGF9. Upon FGF9 treatment, Note the drastic increase in P-ERK expression in WT cells in comparison to CKO cells.</p>
