                Figure 6.  Lack of PSMC progenitor amplification and failure of endothelial progenitor cell differentiation.(a–b') β-gal staining on WT and CKO lungs crossed with the Fgf10LacZ reporter line. β-gal staining in the CKO lung (b) is severely reduced and the presence of single progenitor cells are apparent. (a'–b') Close up on the accessory lobe shows the presence of single Fgf10LacZ positive PSMC progenitor cells in the distal mesenchyme of the CKO lung. Lineage tracing of the Fgf10LacZ positive PSMC progenitor cells in CKO lungs (b') shows fewer cells are relocating around the bronchi compared to the WT lungs (a'). (c–d) IHC for β-catenin (brown staining) on paraffin sections of WT and CKO lungs crossed with the Fgf10LacZ reporter. (d) Presence of β-gal staining in the distal mesenchyme in the absence of β-catenin expression (arrow). (e–f) β-gal staining on WT and CKO lungs crossed with the Flk1LacZ reporter line. High magnification of E13.5 left lobes show an increase in Flk1LacZ expression in the CKO lung compared to WT lungs. Arrowheads illustrate the reduction in size of the sub-mesothelial mesenchymal domain containing the Fgf10 expressing PSCM progenitors and in which no Flk1-positive cells are present. (g–h) Immunofluorescence staining for PECAM on E14.5 WT and CKO lungs. Absence of PECAM in CKO lungs (f). (i–j) Immunofluorescence staining for endothelial-Claudin5 on E14.5 WT and CKO lungs. Absence of endothelial-Claudin5 in CKO lungs (f). (k–l) β-gal staining on E13.5 WT and CKO embryos crossed with the Flk1LacZ reporter line. CKO embryos (l) show and increased expansion of Flk1LacZ positive angioblasts throughout the embryonic mesenchyme compared to WT embryos (k). (m–n) Intracardiac India ink injection of E13.5 WT and CKO embryos. CKO embryos show defects in vasculogenesis and leakage of India ink from premature blood vessels is apparent (n) compared to WT embryos (m).
