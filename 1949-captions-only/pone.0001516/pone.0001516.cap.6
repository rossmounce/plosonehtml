(a'–b') Close up on the accessory lobe shows the presence of single <em>Fgf10<sup>LacZ</sup></em> positive PSMC progenitor cells in the distal mesenchyme of the CKO lung. Lineage tracing of the <em>Fgf10<sup>LacZ</sup></em> positive PSMC progenitor cells in CKO lungs (b') shows fewer cells are relocating around the bronchi compared to the WT lungs (a'). (c–d) IHC for β-catenin (brown staining) on paraffin sections of WT and CKO lungs crossed with the <em>Fgf10<sup>LacZ</sup></em> reporter. (d) Presence of β-gal staining in the distal mesenchyme in the absence of β-catenin expression (arrow). (e–f) β-gal staining on WT and CKO lungs crossed with the <em>Flk1<sup>LacZ</sup></em> reporter line. High magnification of E13.5 left lobes show an increase in <em>Flk1<sup>LacZ</sup></em> expression in the CKO lung compared to WT lungs. Arrowheads illustrate the reduction in size of the sub-mesothelial mesenchymal domain containing the <em>Fgf10</em> expressing PSCM progenitors and in which no Flk1-positive cells are present. (g–h) Immunofluorescence staining for PECAM on E14.5 WT and CKO lungs. Absence of PECAM in CKO lungs (f). (i–j) Immunofluorescence staining for endothelial-Claudin5 on E14.5 WT and CKO lungs. Absence of endothelial-Claudin5 in CKO lungs (f). (k–l) β-gal staining on E13.5 WT and CKO embryos crossed with the <em>Flk1<sup>LacZ</sup></em> reporter line. CKO embryos (l) show and increased expansion of <em>Flk1<sup>LacZ</sup></em> positive angioblasts throughout the embryonic mesenchyme compared to WT embryos (k). (m–n) Intracardiac India ink injection of E13.5 WT and CKO embryos. CKO embryos show defects in vasculogenesis and leakage of India ink from premature blood vessels is apparent (n) compared to WT embryos (m).</p>
