As the epithelium grows out, the PSMC progenitors come in contact with BMP4 secreted by the epithelium. These cells then stop expressing <em>Fgf10</em> and get committed to the PSCM lineage <a href="#pone.0001516-Mailleux1">[9]</a>. When these cells eventually spread out on the epithelial basement membrane containing Fibronectin <a href="#pone.0001516-DeLanghe1">[11]</a>, they differentiate into mature PSMC and start to express α-SMA and switch from PITX2 to PITX3 expression.</p>
