                Figure 7.  Model for lineage differentiation of the PSMCs.Fgf10 and Pitx2 expressing PSMC progenitors are located in the submesothelial mesenchyme and respond to FGF9 and β-catenin signaling to amplify and remain undifferentiated [8], [9], [28], [35]. As the epithelium grows out, the PSMC progenitors come in contact with BMP4 secreted by the epithelium. These cells then stop expressing Fgf10 and get committed to the PSCM lineage [9]. When these cells eventually spread out on the epithelial basement membrane containing Fibronectin [11], they differentiate into mature PSMC and start to express α-SMA and switch from PITX2 to PITX3 expression.
