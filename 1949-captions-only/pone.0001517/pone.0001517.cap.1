Animals immobilized by cooling are injected with plasmid using a dissecting microscope and picospritzer. The injection is made rostral to the olfactory bulb followed by a series of 5 voltage pulses delivered with tweezer-type electrodes. The pulses are given while sweeping the positive pole upwards from the eyes by 45 degrees. B. Sagittal view of a P1 mouse showing localized fluorescence after injection of diO into the lateral ventricles. Scale = 1 mm. C–E. Sagittal views of a P2 mouse 24 hours post-electroporation of the olfactory bulb and ventricle in a P2 mouse 24 hours post-electroporation. C. The preponderance of GFP is restricted to the ventricular wall; 60 µm sections, scale = 1 mm. D–E. Enlarged views of the boxed regions in c highlight the high levels of expression in along the SVZ relative to the olfactory bulb. Relatively few GFP positive cells can be found in the olfactory bulb (for example see inset in E). scale = 500 µm. F–G. Sagittal views of a P6 mouse 5 days post-electroporation. F. Whole-mount view of an unfixed brain reveals high levels of GFP expression through the RMS. Scale = 1 mm G. A higher magnification view of a different brain showing cells had begun to migrate throughout the olfactory bulb. Scale = 500 µm H. Labeled radial glia persisted in the SVZ; dashed line denotes ventricular wall; 60 µm sections, scale = 50 µm. I–N. Sagittal views of a P15 mouse 2 weeks post-electroporation; 60 µm sections I. In addition to the RMS, GFP-positive cells can be found throughout the olfactory bulb. scale = 1 mm. J–K. Enlarged views of the boxed regions in i showing the RMS (J), and olfactory bulb (K). Inset in K highlights a periglomerular cell. scale = 500 µm. L–N. Z-projections of 60 µm sections TOTO3 staining reveals nuclei (blue). L. Widespread distribution of GFP positive cells in all layers of the bulb. Scale = 200 µm M. Labeling of numerous granule cells. scale = 50 µm N. Resolution of a single morphologically mature granule cell. scale = 50 µm. O–Q. Sagittal views of a P430 mouse over 1 year post electroporation; 60 µm sections. O. labeled PG cell, TOTO 3 (blue) stains all nuclei and inset show a magnified view. Scale = 100 µm P–Q.Labeled granule cell, low magnification counterstained with TOTO3 (P; scale = 100 µm) and high magnification of the same cell (Q; scale = 25 µm)</p>
