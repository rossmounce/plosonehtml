                Figure 2.  Widespread labeling of specific cell populations by electroporation.14 µm sections from a P15 mouse electroporated 2 weeks previously with GFP (green) were stained with a panel of markers (red) labeling several specific cell populations in RMS (A–C) and olfactory bulb (D–G). 10-fold magnified views are presented for highlighted double-labeled cells. A summary of the locations for each section and the markers used are in the box on top. scale = 50 = µm
