                Figure 3.  Electrical and optical recordings from interneurons labeled by electroporation.Electrical excitability of neurons in current-clamp recordings in slices from 3–4 weeks-old mice electroporated with EGFP (A) and mRFP (B). A. Example of PG cell recorded in the glomerular layer (bright field, left) exhibited spontaneous synaptic activity and responded to a depolarizing current (16 pA) with a single action potential followed by an afterhyperpolarization. The cell input resistance is 1 GΩ as measured with a negative current stimulus (−4 pA). B. Example of a granule cell recorded in the internal plexiform layer (bright field, left). This cell responded to a depolarizing stimulus (15 pA) with a train of spikes. The cell input resistance is 1.8 GΩ as measured with a negative current stimulus (−5 pA). The calibration in A and B is 200 ms; 10 and 20 mV respectively. C–G. Calcium imaging of single cells in slice from 3–6 week old mice electroporated with pCAG-GCamp2. C. PG cell before, during, and after response to KCl (100 mM) presented during frames 10–25 (36–96 seconds; total of 1 min). Scale bar, 100 mm. (frames 5, 35, and 60 or 16, 136, 236 sec). Scale bar, 5%ΔF/F, 1 min. D. Granule cell (at the border of the IPL/Mitral cell layer) responds to KCl (100 mM) presented during frames 10–20 (36–76 seconds; total of 40 sec). Scale bar = 3%ΔF/F, 1 min. E. A different granule cell (at the border of the IPL/Mitral cell layer) responds to glutamate (100 µM) presented during frames 10–20 (36–76 seconds; total of 40 sec). Scale bar = 2%ΔF/F, 1 min. F. Granule cell (same as in e) does not respond to Ringer presented during frames 10–20 (36–76 seconds; total of 40 sec). Scale bar = 2% ΔF/F, 1 min. G. Migrating cell in RMS during and after response to KCl (100 mM) presented during frames 10–20 (36–76 seconds; total of 40 sec). Cell showed no response to application of Ringer alone (not shown). Scale bar = 5%ΔF/F, 1 min
