                Figure 4.  Electroporation is effective for the expression of multiple constructs, in transgenic animals, and in rats.A. 20 µm section of an olfactory bulb of a P6 mouse 5 days post-electroporation with pCAG-CRE-ires-EGFP; anti-CRE staining labels the nucleus (red) and GFP (green) labels the cytoplasm with a 10X magnified view of the cell body. Scale = 25 µm. B–C. Z projections of 60 µm sections from olfactory bulbs co-electroporated with GFP and either dsRED-Golgi (B; 5 days post-electroporation) or dsRED-ER (C; 14 days post electroporation) showing labeled organelles. 10X magnified views of highlighted regions show perinuclear golgi staining in the cell body and punctate ER staining at the base of dendritic spines. Scale = 25 µm. D–E. Electroporation of OMP-GFP mice with RFP plasmid. Z-projections of 60 µm sections showing the morphology of single periglomerular cells (red) and the glomeruli they innervate (green). 2 types of PG cells are shown, one that innervates 3 glomeruli (E; scale = 25 µm) and another other with its processes are confined to a single glomerulus (F; scale = 50 µm). F. Highly efficient electroporation of rats. Z-projection of 60 µm section from a P27 rat olfactory bulb electroporated at P1 showing widespread ectopic expression in all layers of the olfactory bulb. TOTO3 (blue) labels all nuclei. Scale = 50 µm.
