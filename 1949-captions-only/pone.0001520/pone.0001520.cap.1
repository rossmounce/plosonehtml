                Figure 1.  Late-EPCs can be cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with cKS.A representative phase-contrast photograph of a late-EPC colony, identified as a well-circumscribed monolayer of cobblestone-appearing cells, is shown. Similar colonies were obtained from 15 different patients. A) ×100 magnification, B) ×200 magnification. Late-EPCs were photographed using a Leitz Diavert microscope system.
