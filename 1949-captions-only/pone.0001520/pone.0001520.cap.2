                Figure 2.  Immunophenotypic characterization of late-EPCs obtained from 15 patients with cKS.Late-EPCs express high levels of endothelial antigens but lack leukocyte markers. A) Percentage of positive cells for the indicated antigens, data expressed as meanÂ±standard error. B) Representative flow cytometry analysis. Note that binding of UEA-1, uptake of ac-LDL and staining of e-NOS, vWF and Cav-1 were examined by conventional fluorescence-microscopy. UEA-1 = Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-1; ac-LDL = acetylated-low-density lipoprotein; e-NOS = endothelial nitric oxide synthase; vWF = von Willebrand Factor; Cav-1 = caveolin-1.
