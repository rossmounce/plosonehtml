                Figure 3.  Late-EPCs obtained from patients with cKS form capillary-like structures in vitro.Late-EPCs cultured in Matrigel gave rise within 12 hours of incubation to vascular structures that were quite similar to those formed by control endothelial cell lines. A) A representative phase-contrast photograph of the capillary-like structures formed by late-EPCs from a patient with cKS (×40 magnification) is shown. B) For comparison, a photograph of the structures formed by ECV 304 cell line (×40 magnification) is shown. Capillary-like structures were photographed using a Leitz Diavert microscope system.
