                Figure 4.  Flow cytometry analysis showing CD146 expression on different late-EPC populations.To confirm that late-EPCs with proven endothelial phenotype could support KSHV infection, late-EPCs from one cKS patient underwent cell sorting of CD146+ cells and were cultured for further 2 weeks. Analysis of unsorted late-EPCs stained with isotype control (A) or anti-human CD146 mAb (B); analysis of highly purified CD146+ late-EPCs stained with anti-human CD146 mAb immediately after sorting (C) or after 2 weeks of culture (D).
