Multiple colonies from each patient were pooled before treatment. B) To confirm that late-EPCs with proven endothelial phenotype could support KSHV lytic replication, late-EPCs from one cKS patient underwent cell sorting of CD146+ cells. Unsorted late-EPCs (solid line) or highly purified CD146+ late-EPCs from the same cKS patient were cultured for further 2 weeks after sorting (hatched line) and underwent treatment with <em>n</em>-butyrate for 48 hours. In any case, KSHV genomes were analyzed by real-time PCR in DNA extracted from late-EPC supernatants. <em>P</em> value was determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.KSHV genomes were analyzed by real-time PCR in DNA extracted from culture supernatants. KSHV = Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; TPA = phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.</p>
