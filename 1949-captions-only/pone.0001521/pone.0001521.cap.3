ROZA was immunoprecpitated with anti-GFP antibody. Upper panel: anti-phosphoTyr (4G10) western blot. Lower panel: anti-GFP western blot. (B) PV induces an increase in ZAP-70 activity in Jurkat T-cells expressing ROZA. No change in FRET ratio was observed in ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T-cells (P116) cells expressing ROZA or in normal Jurkat T-cells transfected with the mutated probe (YF).</p>
