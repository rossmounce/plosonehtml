                Figure 2.  Comparison of relative levels of cytokine mRNA from unstimulated leukocytes from TB patients (n = 37) before and after treatment.Results are presented as medians and ranges of either (A) cytokine message, assessed by RT-PCR, and normalized against β-actin as a housekeeping gene or (B) the ratio of the normalized values of IL-4δ2 and IFN-γ divided by the normalized IL-4 value, as a proxy for the Th1/Th2 balance. Levels of gene expression which were significantly different between groups are indicated, as are the associated p values. Analysis of differences within the groups (over time) was performed by paired t-test.
