                Figure 4.  Comparison of relative levels of cytokine mRNA from unstimulated leukocytes of initially healthy household contacts who developed TB-like symptoms during the study period (n = 10).Results are presented as (A) medians and ranges of cytokine message, assessed by RT-PCR, and normalized against β-actin as a housekeeping gene or (B) the ratio of the normalized values of IL-4δ2 and IFN-γ divided by the normalized IL-4 value, as a proxy for the Th1/Th2 balance. Levels of gene expression which were significantly different between groups are indicated, as are the associated p values. Analysis of differences between the groups was performed by Kruskal-Wallis, analysis of differences within the groups was performed by paired t-test.
