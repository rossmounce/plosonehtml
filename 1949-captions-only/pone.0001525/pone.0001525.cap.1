The horizontal line in the interior of the box denotes the median; and the height of the box is equal to the interquartile distance (IQD). The whiskers (the dotted lines extending from the top and bottom of the box) extend to the extreme values of the data or a distance 1.5Ã—IQD from the center, whichever is less. The horizontal lines falling outside the whiskers represent outliers. B) Relationship between the mean of log10 HIV RNA at second and third seropositive visits and calendar year of seroconversion. Three solid lines are the fitted regression line and its 95% confidence bands from univariate linear regression (note that slope estimates reported in manuscript text are from multivariate analysis).</p>
