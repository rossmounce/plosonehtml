Boxes are defined as in the legend to <a href="#pone-0001525-g001">Figure 1</a>. B) Relationship between the mean of square-root transformed CD4+ T-cell count at second and third seropositive visits and calendar year of seroconversion. Three solid lines are the fitted regression line and its 95% confidence bands from univariate linear regression (note that slope estimates reported in manuscript text are from multivariate analysis).</p>
