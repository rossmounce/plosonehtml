                Figure 2.  CD4+ T cell levels through time.A) Boxplot for the mean of square-root transformed CD4+ T-cell count at second and third seropositive visits (~9 and ~15 months after estimated date of seroconversion) by calendar period of seroconversion. Boxes are defined as in the legend to Figure 1. B) Relationship between the mean of square-root transformed CD4+ T-cell count at second and third seropositive visits and calendar year of seroconversion. Three solid lines are the fitted regression line and its 95% confidence bands from univariate linear regression (note that slope estimates reported in manuscript text are from multivariate analysis).
