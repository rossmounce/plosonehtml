                Figure 1.  The U5, but not U3, region of the ZAM LTR is required for repression.The genomic structure of the ZAM retrotransposon is depicted at the top. Structures of the lacZ reporter trangenes used in this study are shown below on the left, and their expression in follicle cells from the S or U background are indicated at right. Transcripts initiated from the endogenous transcription initiation site of ZAM (black arrow) in transgenes pZ499 and pZ475 are homologous to ZAM over 173 and 149 bp, respectively. These transgenes are sensitive to the S or U status of the line as illustrated by the histochemical detection of Î²-galactosidase activity in the ovarioles. pZ310 contains the U3 sequence of the element and is expressed from a minimal heat shock promoter (white arrow) so that no sequence homologous to ZAM is present within the p310 transcript. Its expression is not under the control of the S or U status of the lines and is thus observed in the ovarioles from both the S and U backgrounds, as illustrated on the right.
