Structures of the <em>lacZ</em> reporter trangenes used in this study are shown below on the left, and their expression in follicle cells from the S or U background are indicated at right. Transcripts initiated from the endogenous transcription initiation site of <em>ZAM</em> (black arrow) in transgenes pZ499 and pZ475 are homologous to <em>ZAM</em> over 173 and 149 bp, respectively. These transgenes are sensitive to the S or U status of the line as illustrated by the histochemical detection of Î²-galactosidase activity in the ovarioles. pZ310 contains the U3 sequence of the element and is expressed from a minimal heat shock promoter (white arrow) so that no sequence homologous to <em>ZAM</em> is present within the p310 transcript. Its expression is not under the control of the S or U status of the lines and is thus observed in the ovarioles from both the S and U backgrounds, as illustrated on the right.</p>
