                Figure 2.  Transgenes with a GFP reporter gene fused to a ZAM sequence act as sensors of the repression.The genomic structures of the transgenes pGFP-Zenv and pGFP-Idgag used in this study are presented at the tops of both panels: The grey boxes correspond to the UASt promoter, the dotted boxes to the GFP gene, and the white box to the env fragment of ZAM or the gag fragment of Idefix. Triangles indicate the FRT sites. Focal plane of the follicles dissected from a line in which the pGFP-Zenv transgene is driven by the ubiquitous Actin-Gal4 driver. Expression of the pGFP-Zenv transgene in an S genetic background before (A) or after (B) flp-recombinase action, or in a U genetic background before the flp treatment (C). GFP expression in the ovarioles of a transgenic line bearing the pGFP-Idgag transgene driven by the ubiquitous Actin-Gal4 driver. Expression of the pGFP-Idgag transgene in an S genetic background before (D) or after (E) flp-recombinase action, or in a U genetic background before the flp treatment (F). No GFP is detected in ovaries of the S lines. Its expression is recovered after the flp treatment or when the COM locus is mutated, as in the U genetic background.
