                Figure 3.  Transgenes bearing ZAM or Idefix sequences placed in an antisense orientation are not targeted by the repression.Expression of sensor transgenes carrying ZAM or Idefix fragments inserted in a sense and an antisense orientation. The genomic structure of the so-called pGFP-Zenv, pGFP-ZenvAS, pGFP-IdU, pGFP-IdUAS transgenes are depicted on the left. The orientation of the fragment is indicated by an arrow. The repression mechanism is able to discriminate between sense and antisense targeted sequences. In an S/S genetic background, only transgenes with ZAM and Idefix in an antisense orientation are correctly expressed. Clear fluorescence due to GFP expression is detected in the ovarian follicles of pGFP-ZenvAS and pGFP-IdUAS transgenes, as illustrated on the right.
