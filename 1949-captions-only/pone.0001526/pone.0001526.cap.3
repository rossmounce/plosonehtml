The genomic structure of the so-called pGFP-Zenv, pGFP-ZenvAS, pGFP-IdU, pGFP-IdUAS transgenes are depicted on the left. The orientation of the fragment is indicated by an arrow. The repression mechanism is able to discriminate between sense and antisense targeted sequences. In an S/S genetic background, only transgenes with ZAM and Idefix in an antisense orientation are correctly expressed. Clear fluorescence due to GFP expression is detected in the ovarian follicles of pGFP-ZenvAS and pGFP-IdUAS transgenes, as illustrated on the right.</p>
