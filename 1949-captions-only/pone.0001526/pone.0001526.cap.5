                Figure 5.   ZAM and Idefix are regulated by a PIWI-dependent pathway in the reproductive apparatus.In situ hybridization experiments reveal ZAM and Idefix expression in female gonads from third instar larvae. ZAM and Idefix transcripts are not detected in S flies with a wild-type piwi gene (left). As shown by the black staining, ZAM and Idefix mRNAs are detected in U flies with a wild-type piwi gene (middle). In S lines homozygous for the piwi3 allele, ZAM or Idefix transcripts are no longer repressed, and their transcription is visualised in gonads (right). Probes used in these experiments are indicated on the left.
