As shown by the black staining, <em>ZAM</em> and <em>Idefix</em> mRNAs are detected in U flies with a wild-type <em>piwi</em> gene (middle). In S lines homozygous for the <em>piwi</em><sup>3</sup> allele, <em>ZAM</em> or <em>Idefix</em> transcripts are no longer repressed, and their transcription is visualised in gonads (right). Probes used in these experiments are indicated on the left.</p>
