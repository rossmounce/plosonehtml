Only a very faint level of fluorescence, corresponding to the background, is detected. A clear GFP expression is observed in these stages of development in a [U/U; piwi+/+] line (middle panel). In <em>piwi</em> mutant backgrounds, in homozygous [S/S; piwi3/3] lines, the silencing of the sensor transgene is not released. A very faint fluorescence level similar to that observed in homozygous [S/S; piwi+/+] lines is observed (left panel).</p>
