                Figure 2.  Administration of anti-hTF mAb ameliorated intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR)-induced acute lung injury in hTF-KI mice.IIR challenged hTF-KI mice were treated with CNTO859 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline. The representative histology (H&amp;E, x400) from the intestine (A, B) and lung (C, D) was shown. The lung injury was scored by a pathologist in a blind fashion (E) (▪ inflammatory cells infiltration; ▪ alveolar wall edema; ▪ hemorrhage; atelectasis). □ Lung injury scores of 4 categories were analyzed with Kruskall-Wallis test, n = 4 animals/group, *: p&lt;0.05. The pulmonary permeability was determined by Evans Blue dye assay (F, G, H). Administration of CNTO859 also reduced the wet/dry lung weight ratio (I), albumin concentration (J), and total cell counts (K) in the BAL fluid. Panels I-K: n = 4 animals/group,*: p&lt;0.05, un-paired t-test.
