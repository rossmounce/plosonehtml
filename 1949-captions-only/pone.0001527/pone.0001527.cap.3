Administration of CNTO859 significantly inhibited both TF (A) and PAI-1 (B) activities in comparison with the saline treated control (*: <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, n = 4 animals/group, un-paired t-test). The fibrin staining showed that CNTO859 ameliorated IIR-induced fibrin deposition (pink) in the alveoli (C, D). The lung tissues were stained for vWF, a specific marker for endothelial integrity. Weaker staining of vWF (pink) of endothelium in the pulmonary vessels was noted in the saline control group (E). In CNTO859 treated animals stronger vWF staining was observed in the endothelium of pulmonary vessels (F). The pulmonary endothelial injury was further examined with electron microscopy. IIR challenge led to significant endothelial cell swelling (G), which was protected by CNTO859 treatment (H).</p>
