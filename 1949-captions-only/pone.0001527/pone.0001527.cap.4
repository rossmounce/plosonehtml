                Figure 4.  Anti-hTF mAb treatment reduced inflammatory response.Inflammatory cytokines were measured in the lung tissues and BAL fluid with a cytometric bead array. The expression levels of IL-6 (A), TNFÎ± (B), and MCP-1 (C) in the lung tissues were significantly reduced by CNTO859 in comparison to saline group. In the BAL fluid CNTO859 also reduced the IL-6 levels (D), but the IL-10 level remained unchanged between the two groups (E). Un-paired t-test was used, *: p&lt;0.05, n = 4 animals/group.
