CNTO859 effect on the cell death was shown in representative slides (400x) (A, B), and quantified by counting the TUNEL positive cells from 10 randomly chosen fields (C). Caspase 3 activity in the lung tissue was also reduced by the anti-hTF antibody treatment (D). Un-paired t-test was used, 4 animals per group, *: <em>p</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
