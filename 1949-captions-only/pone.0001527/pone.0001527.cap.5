                Figure 5.  Anti-hTF mAb treatment reduced cell death.IIR-induced cell death in the lungs was determined by TUNEL staining. CNTO859 effect on the cell death was shown in representative slides (400x) (A, B), and quantified by counting the TUNEL positive cells from 10 randomly chosen fields (C). Caspase 3 activity in the lung tissue was also reduced by the anti-hTF antibody treatment (D). Un-paired t-test was used, 4 animals per group, *: p&lt;0.05.
