                Figure 1.  Genes associated with Disease Classes (MeSH) in Publications.The clone target list (HFLEX7000) was compared with all human genes (EntrezGene, 2004) and all genes represented by MGC (2004) with respect to published relationships of the genes to human diseases. The targeted genes reveal similar proportionality to the other gene lists but a general enrichment of genes related to diseases (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).
