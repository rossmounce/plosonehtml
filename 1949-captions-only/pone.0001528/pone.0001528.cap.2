                Figure 2.  Genes associated with Biological MeSH Terms in Publications.The clone target list (HFLEX7000) was compared with all human genes (EntrezGene, 2004) and all genes represented by MGC (2004) with respect to published relationships of the genes to all biological MeSH terms and MeSH nodes (34). The targeted genes reveal similar proportionality to the other gene lists but a general enrichment of genes related to MeSH terms (Table 2; Supplementary Table S3).
