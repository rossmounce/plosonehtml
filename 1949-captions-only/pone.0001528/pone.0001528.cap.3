The process started by identifying MGC clones in the available plates and then creating array files along with matching PCR primer order files that included two primers anchored at the 3â€² end, one for each format. The primers were used to amplify the ORFs from the matching MGC clones. PCR products were monitored in agarose gels, and products were purified prior to capture via In-Fusion reaction. Competent bacterial strains were transformed with the reaction followed by the robotic isolation of 4 resulting colonies per format, which were used to prepare 15% glycerol stocks. Prior to sequencing a single isolate plate of 96 targets were created. As indicated, step specific results were stored in our LIMS.</p>
