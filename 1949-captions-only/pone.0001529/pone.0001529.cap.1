Comparing the amount of <sup>14</sup>C in eye-lens crystallines (red circles, plotted as a function of the year of birth) with the atmospheric concentration in units of pmC (percent modern Carbon) has made it possible to investigate the timing of the formation process. The red curve shows the output from our resulting lens-formation model, which provides the basis for predicting the year of birth accurately (<a href="#pone-0001529-g002">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
