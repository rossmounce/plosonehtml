                Figure 2.  Predicting the year of birth by the 14C of eye lens crystallines.The year of birth of a person may be predicted from the 14C content of the eye-lens crystallines. In an over-simplistic picture the eye lens crystallines are formed at the birth year of the individual. The year of birth predicted in that way (red circles, showing only the centre value of the 95% confidence interval) is close to the actual yeat but evidently different, in particular for the oldest individuals. More accurate results are obtained by using our model, because it takes into account that the crystallines grow later in life too: The resulting predictions (black vertical bars, showing the 95% confidence interval) are in agreement with the actual values in all cases. The two ways of predicting the year of birth correspond to using the black (atmospheric) or the red (eye-lens model) curve in Fig. 1, respectively. The red line shows the ideal 1:1 ratio between the predicted and actual year of birth.
