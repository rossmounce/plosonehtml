                Figure 1.  Two mtDNA haplotypes associated with MS. (A) Evaluation of the association between four mtDNA haplotypes and MS.The four haplotypes were constructed with nt13708 G/A and nt4216 T/C polymorphisms. The association was evaluated using the wildtype haplotype (nt13708G-nt4216T) as the control genotype, and Odds ratios and P values of the other three haplotypes were determined. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the two disease-associated mtDNA hyplotypes. The phylogenetic tree were constructed base on the mtDNA sequence of 24 sample with nt13708A-nt4216C (sample A1–A24) and 23 samples with nt13708A-nt4216T (sample B1–B23) using ClusterW softeware.
