The association was evaluated using the wildtype haplotype (nt13708G-nt4216T) as the control genotype, and Odds ratios and <em>P</em> values of the other three haplotypes were determined. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the two disease-associated mtDNA hyplotypes. The phylogenetic tree were constructed base on the mtDNA sequence of 24 sample with nt13708A-nt4216C (sample A1–A24) and 23 samples with nt13708A-nt4216T (sample B1–B23) using ClusterW softeware.</p>
