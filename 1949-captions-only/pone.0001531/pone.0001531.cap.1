Death Rates and non-HIV-related causes of death.A–Death rates per 100 000 inhabitants of individuals that had HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate, 1999–2004 (p-value for trend = 0.67, solid circles) and AIDS mortality as an underlying disease from 1996 to 2004 (open circles). B–Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of non-HIV-related causes of death listed on the death certificate in individuals who had and who did not have HIV listed on the death certificate. Slopes of trends are significantly different between the two groups (p-value&lt;0.001)
