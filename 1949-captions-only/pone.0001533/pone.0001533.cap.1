                Figure 1.  Asymmetric expression of SPIG1 mRNA in the mouse retina.A–H, Section (A–C) and whole-mount (D–H) in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes at P5. (B) and (C) are enlargements of the dorsal and ventral regions boxed in (A), respectively. In the dorsal area (B), SPIG1 is expressed in a large population of cells in the GCL. In the ventral area (C), SPIG1 is expressed in a small subset of cells in the GCL (arrows). In section in situ hybridization, dorsal is upwards, and ventral is downwards. D, A schematic drawing of a flat-mount retina for in situ hybridization. D, dorsal; N, nasal; T, temporal; V, ventral. (E–H) are enlargements of the GCL of the dorsotemporal (dt), dorsonasal (dn), ventrotemporal (vt), and ventronasal (vn) areas boxed in (D), respectively. In the dt area (E), SPIG1-expressing cells are densely distributed. In the dn, vt, and vn areas (F–H), SPIG1-expressing cells form a regular mosaic, indicating that they represent a single type of neuron. I–K, Section in situ hybridization of the retinas using a tyramide signal amplification system with diaminobenzidine. At E12.5 (I), the expression is first detected in the outer layer of the dorsocentral retina (black arrowheads) and the entire layer of the dorsoperipheral retina (white arrowheads). At E15.5 (J), the expression peak in the outer layer is shifted to the peripheral region in the dorsal retina (black arrowheads). The expression in the GCL of the ventral retina is first detected in a small subset of cells at this stage (white arrowheads). The expression pattern at P0 (K) is similar to that at P5 (A–C). In the ventral area (K), SPIG1 is expressed in a small subset of cells in the GCL (arrow in inset). Scale bars: 500 µm (A); 50 µm (B, C, and E–H); 1 mm (D); 100 µm (I); 200 µm (J, K).
