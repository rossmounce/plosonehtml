                Figure 3.  GFP mRNA expression in the SPIG1gfp/+ brain faithfully reproduces the expression of SPIG1 mRNA.In situ hybridization for parasagittal sections of P10 brain. The signals were detected by a tyramide signal amplification system. Positive cells were stained brown with diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with toluidine blue. Left and right panels in (A–D) show SPIG1 and GFP expression, respectively. A, Olfactory bulb. SPIG1 and GFP are expressed in the glomerular layer and mitral cell layer. Lower panels are enlargements of the boxed area. B, Cerebellum. SPIG1 and GFP are expressed in the purkinje cells. Lower panels are enlargements of the boxed area. C, Hippocampus. SPIG1 and GFP are expressed in the CA region and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. D, Entorhinal cortex. SPIG1 and GFP are expressed in layer II. Layer I is shown to the right side. Scale bars: 200 µm (upper panels in A/B; C, D); 100 µm (lower panels in A/B).
