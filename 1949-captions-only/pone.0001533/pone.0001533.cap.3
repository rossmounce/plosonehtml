The signals were detected by a tyramide signal amplification system. Positive cells were stained brown with diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with toluidine blue. Left and right panels in (A–D) show <em>SPIG1</em> and <em>GFP</em> expression, respectively. A, Olfactory bulb. <em>SPIG1</em> and <em>GFP</em> are expressed in the glomerular layer and mitral cell layer. Lower panels are enlargements of the boxed area. B, Cerebellum. <em>SPIG1</em> and <em>GFP</em> are expressed in the purkinje cells. Lower panels are enlargements of the boxed area. C, Hippocampus. <em>SPIG1</em> and <em>GFP</em> are expressed in the CA region and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. D, Entorhinal cortex. <em>SPIG1</em> and <em>GFP</em> are expressed in layer II. Layer I is shown to the right side. Scale bars: 200 µm (upper panels in A<em>/</em>B; C, D); 100 µm (lower panels in A<em>/</em>B).</p>
