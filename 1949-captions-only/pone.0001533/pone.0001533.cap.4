                Figure 4.  Developmental changes in the morphology and dendritic stratification of GFP-positive RGCs in the SPIG1gfp/+ mouse.A, Z-stack confocal images of GFP-positive RGCs in the flat-mount ventronasal retina at E17.5, P1, P6, and P12. The GFP signals were intensified using an antibody against GFP, and are shown as the inverted gray-scale images. An axon coursing toward the optic fiber layer is visible (arrow). B, Somatic diameter for each GFP-positive ganglion cell plotted against age. The mean values at each age are shown as red squares. The number of samples: 33 at P1; 35 at P3; 40 at P6; and 23 at P12. C, Developmental changes in the mosaic of the GFP-positive cells in the GCL in the flat-mount ventronasal retina. D, Relationships between the distribution of GFP-labeled dendrites (green) and the ON and OFF cholinergic amacrine strata (red) visualized by immunolabeling with anti-VAChT in the pan-ventronasal domain in cross sections. IPL boundaries were determined by using the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (blue) with the GCL (below) and the INL (above). At E17.5, processes extending from the GFP-positive cells are observed within the IPL (arrowheads). At P1, dendrites are broadly distributed within the IPL. After P3, the dendrites of the GFP-positive cells predominantly costratify with the ON cholinergic strata. E, The thickness of the IPL plotted against age (left panel). Width at half maximum height (WHM) for each of the GFP-positive RGCs was plotted against age (middle panel). WHM plotted as a percentage of the vertical thickness of the IPL (right panel). The number of samples for all panels: 22 at P1; 17 at P3; 33 at P6; and 21 at P8. F, Dendrite stratification depth of GFP-positive RGCs within the IPL plotted against age. The stratification depth was defined as 0–100% from the INL side to the GCL side of the IPL (left panel). Stratification depth of ON and OFF cholinergic amacrine processes within the IPL (middle panel). The degree of overlap of WHMs of the RGC dendrites and VAChT-labeled cholinergic amacrine processes shown as a percentage of the WHM of the RGC dendrites (right panel). The number of samples for all panels: 22 at P1; 17 at P3; 33 at P6; and 21 at P8. Scale bars: 20 µm (E17.5-P6 in A; D); 50 µm (P12 in A; C).
