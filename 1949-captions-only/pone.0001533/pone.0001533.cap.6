A, Schematic drawing of the injection of CTB into the MTN of neonatal mouse brain (parasagittal view). The glass capillary was inserted at an oblique angle from the vertical. OT, optic tract; PRT, pretectum. B, The injection site in a coronal slice (200 µm thick) at P6, showing that the GFP-positive fibers (green) innervating the MTN are labeled with injected CTB (red). C, Developmental analysis of MTN-projecting RGCs in the neonatal period. Paired cells are a common feature of the MTN-projecting cells (black and white arrowheads in the third column). In the pan-ventronasal domain (left three columns), approximately half of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by GFP at all ages. Strikingly, one of the paired cells is always GFP-positive at P6 and P12 (black arrowheads). However, occasionally at P1 and P3, both of the paired cells were found to be GFP-positive (white arrowheads): Here, the incidence of both paired-cells being GFP-negative was low. In contrast, in the dorsotemporal domain, all of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by GFP at all ages (rightmost column). D, GFP expression in RGCs projecting to the SC. In the pan-ventronasal domain, the SC-projecting cells are devoid of GFP expression. In the dorsotemporal domain, approximately half of the SC-projecting cells are marked by GFP. Scale bars; 500 µm (B); 50 µm (C, D).</p>
