                Figure 7.  SPIG1 mRNA expression in the MTN-projecting cells at P6.CTB-Alexa 488 was injected into the MTN of wild-type mice at P5. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed with the retinal sections labeled retrogradely. Fluorescence of HNPP and CTB-Alexa 488 were pseudocolored as green and red, respectively. A–D, The ventronasal (vn) retina. Approximately half of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by SPIG1 mRNA expression. E–H, The dorsotemporal (dt) retina. All of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by SPIG1 mRNA expression. Scale bars; 20 µm (D, H).
