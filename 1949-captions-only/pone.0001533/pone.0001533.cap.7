Fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization was performed with the retinal sections labeled retrogradely. Fluorescence of HNPP and CTB-Alexa 488 were pseudocolored as green and red, respectively. A–D, The ventronasal (vn) retina. Approximately half of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by <em>SPIG1</em> mRNA expression. E–H, The dorsotemporal (dt) retina. All of the MTN-projecting cells are marked by <em>SPIG1</em> mRNA expression. Scale bars; 20 µm (D, H).</p>
