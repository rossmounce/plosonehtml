CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (MTN-projecting cells; black dots) are subdivided into two populations; GFP<sup>+</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (green dots) and GFP<sup>−</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (red dots). Note that all CTB<sup>+ </sup>cells are marked by GFP in the dorsotemporal domain. Positions quantified for DRPs were exemplified by the squares in the leftmost reconstruction. B, DRPs for retrogradely labeled cells in the pan-ventronasal domain at P1, P3, P6, and P12 (P1-P6, 9 fields from 3 retinas; P12, 6 fields from 2 retinas). The white bars represent the real data, whereas the red lines represent estimated DRP values calculated from the DRP of the respective former developmental ages based on the data of isotropic retinal growth and random cell death. DRPs for CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (MTN-projecting cells) show that they do not have clear exclusion zones (leftmost column). DRPs for GFP<sup>+</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells show that they develop a regular mosaic with an exclusion zone (second column). DRPs for GFP<sup>−</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells show that they too develop a regular mosaic with an exclusion zone (third column). Spatial correlations between GFP<sup>+</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells and GFP<sup>−</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells show that the two different populations tend to exist as pairs with respect to each other at all ages (rightmost column). C, The ER calculated from real (white bars) and estimated (red bars) DRP data for GFP<sup>+</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (left panel) and GFP<sup>−</sup>·CTB<sup>+</sup> cells (right panel). The significant increases in the ER between the real P3 data and real P6 data are not reproduced with the estimated P6 values. *p&lt;0.05. Values are the mean±SE.</p>
