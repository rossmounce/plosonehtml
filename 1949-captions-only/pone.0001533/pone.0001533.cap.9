                Figure 9.  Schematic drawings of SPIG1 expression profiles in the RGCs and their projection targets.In the DT domain, a large number of RGCs express SPIG1 (green cells), and most of them project to the SC, dLGN, and AOS nuclei. In this domain, all MTN-projecting cells are marked by SPIG1 expression (blue and red cells in the DT domain). In the pan-VN domain, GFP (SPIG1) is expressed exclusively in the MTN-projecting cells during the neonatal period (blue cells in the pan-VN domain). The MTN-projecting cells in this domain are divided into two distinct but interdependent regular mosaics, depending on the presence (blue cells) or absence (orange cells) of SPIG1 expression. The cells of different populations (blue and orange cells) tend to exist as a pair. We suggest that the blue cells correspond to a functional subtype of the ON DSGC that prefers upward movement, whereas the orange and red cells correspond to a subtype that prefers downward movement.
