In this domain, all MTN-projecting cells are marked by <em>SPIG1</em> expression (blue and red cells in the DT domain). In the pan-VN domain, GFP (SPIG1) is expressed exclusively in the MTN-projecting cells during the neonatal period (blue cells in the pan-VN domain). The MTN-projecting cells in this domain are divided into two distinct but interdependent regular mosaics, depending on the presence (blue cells) or absence (orange cells) of <em>SPIG1</em> expression. The cells of different populations (blue and orange cells) tend to exist as a pair. We suggest that the blue cells correspond to a functional subtype of the ON DSGC that prefers upward movement, whereas the orange and red cells correspond to a subtype that prefers downward movement.</p>
