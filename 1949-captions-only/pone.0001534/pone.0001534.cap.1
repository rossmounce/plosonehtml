Experimentally observed distributions (blue) are modulated by the distance of the launch site (the panels show distances between â€“7 and 5). Positive launch sites indicate refixations of the same word, which often lead to bimodal distributions (e.g., launch site = 3, 4). Estimated distributions (red) show a reduced standard deviation due to subtraction of mislocated fixations.</p>
