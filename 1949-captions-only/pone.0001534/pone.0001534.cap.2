                Figure 2.  Iterative procedure for the estimation of mislocated fixations. Each iteration consists of three steps.(A) Oculomotor simulations are based on the parameters of the landing position distributions for a given launch site. Undershoot and overshoot of the target word generate mislocated fixations. (B) Landing position distributions are corrected by the amount of mislocated fixations as suggested by the simulations. (C) Mislocated fixations induce deviations from experimentally observed probabilities for word skippings (left) and refixations (right), which are adjusted after each iteration.
