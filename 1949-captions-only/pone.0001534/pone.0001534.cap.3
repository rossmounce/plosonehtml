                Figure 3.  Saccade targeting under the influence of oculomotor errors.Mislocated fixations generate deviations between intended (light blue) and simulated (dark blue) fixation probabilities for word skippings (A,C) and refixations (B,D). After 20 iterations, probabilities for both types of saccades converged to the experimentally observed values (black). (A,B) Iteration 0. (C,D) Iteration 20.
