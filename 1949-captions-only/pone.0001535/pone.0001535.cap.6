<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7"></a><p>In summary, our findings reveal the critical role played by PRLR signaling in brown adipocyte growth and differentiation, thermogenesis, and the response to cold stress. The mediation of lactogen action by induction of IGF-2 expression provides a novel mechanism subserving perinatal adaptation and energy homeostasis. Given the importance of intrauterine programming and BAT in energy balance, our findings implicate new roles for the lactogens in the interface between fetal and perinatal development and metabolic disease.</p>

<h4>PRLR KO mice</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>All experimental designs and procedures are in agreement with the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Ministère de l'Agriculture (France). WT, and PRLR KO mice on a pure 129 genetic background were generated by heterozygous crossbreeding <a href="#pone.0001535-Ormandy1">[19]</a>. PCR analysis of tail DNA determined the genotypes of the offspring as described previously <a href="#pone.0001535-Binart1">[44]</a>.</p>


<h4>Histological analyses</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1"></a><p>BAT was isolated from the interscapular space of newborn WT and PRLR KO mice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin eosin. The adipocyte surfaces were analyzed using a Lucia software on 200 sections per genotype. Data are mean±SE, for 4 mice per genotype.</p>


<h4>Cell extracts, biochemical determinations, and enzyme assays</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec3.p1"></a><p>BAT was homogenized in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. A fraction of the homogenate was stored at −80°C. The remaining fraction was centrifuged at 10,000×<em>g</em> for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was kept at −80°C until use. Aliquots of homogenates and supernatants were used to determine protein content. Triglyceride content was determined on homogenates with PAP150 triglyceride kit (Biomérieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France).</p>


<h4>Electron-microscopic analyses</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p1"></a><p>BAT were washed with PBS and fixed for 4 h with 2% glutaraldehyde (Merck)-2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (Merck) at room temperature. Tissues were rinsed in PBS, postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxyde (Uptima, Montlucon, France) for 30 min, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Durcupan (Fluka, St Quentin, France). Ultrathin sections were realized and examined with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope.</p>


<h4>RT-PCR</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec5.p1"></a><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIZOL reagent (InVitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and RNA were thereafter processed for RT-PCR, as previously described <a href="#pone.0001535-Teixeira1">[45]</a>. <a href="#pone-0001535-t001">Table 1</a> indicates primer sequences of genes analyzed by RT-PCR or by quantitative real time PCR.</p>
