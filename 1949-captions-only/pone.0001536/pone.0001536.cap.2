                Figure 2.  Forest plot of sensitivity estimates and 95% CI.Point estimates of sensitivity from each study are shown as solid circles. The solid lines represent the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Circles are proportional to study size. The pooled estimate is denoted by the diamond at the bottom.
