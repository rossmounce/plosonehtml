                Figure 4.  SROC plot with best-fitting asymmetric curve.Each solid circle represents each study in the meta-analysis. The curve is the regression line that summarizes the overall diagnostic accuracy. SROC = summary receiver operating characteristic; AUC = area under the curve; SE(AUC) = standard error of AUC; Q* = an index defined by the point on the SROC curve where the sensitivity and specificity are equal, which is the point closest to the top-left corner of the ROC space; SE(Q*) = standard error of Q* index.
