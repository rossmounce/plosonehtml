This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 163nsSNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the MTC. (C) Phylogenetic network based on the sSNPs. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 89 sSNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the MTC. Deletions were excluded from the analysis. Clinical isolates are classified with a color code, according to their spoligotype-based family. Node sizes indicate the number of strains belonging to the same haplotype.</p>
