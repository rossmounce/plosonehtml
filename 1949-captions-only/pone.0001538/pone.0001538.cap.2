                Figure 2.  (A) Phylogenetic network based on the total set of SNPs. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 252 SNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC).(B) Phylogenetic network based on the nsSNPs. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 163nsSNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the MTC. (C) Phylogenetic network based on the sSNPs. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 89 sSNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the MTC. Deletions were excluded from the analysis. Clinical isolates are classified with a color code, according to their spoligotype-based family. Node sizes indicate the number of strains belonging to the same haplotype.
