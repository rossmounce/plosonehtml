                Figure 3.  Geographic origin of the haplotypes identified.This phylogenetic network constructed using the median-joining algorithm with a final set of 252 SNPs characterized in 92 clinical strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). Deletions were excluded from the analysis. Geographical origin is classified with a color code. Node sizes indicate the number of strains belonging to the same haplotype.
