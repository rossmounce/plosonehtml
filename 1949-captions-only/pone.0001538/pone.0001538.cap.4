                Figure 4.  Spoligotype based unrooted tree of the strains analyzed.This unrooted neighbor-joining tree was built with the Mega software on the same dataset as in Figure 1. The upper part of the tree describes Principal Genetic Group (PGG) 2 &amp; 3 strains and the lower part relates to PGG1. The spoligotypes are indicated next to the tree to show the excellent congruence. Clades are named according to SpolDB4 and to the recent SNP-cluster group(SCG) nomenclature.
