The upper part of the tree describes Principal Genetic Group (PGG) 2 &amp; 3 strains and the lower part relates to PGG1. The spoligotypes are indicated next to the tree to show the excellent congruence. Clades are named according to SpolDB4 and to the recent SNP-cluster group(SCG) nomenclature.</p>
