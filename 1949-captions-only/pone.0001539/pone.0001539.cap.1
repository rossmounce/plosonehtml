                Figure 1.  ESEM-EDX and TEM-EDX observations.Microscopic observations and representative energy-dispersive X-ray spectra of electron-dense particles of S. maltophilia Sm777 cells grown in ten fold-diluted TSB medium solidified with 15 g.l−1 agar, and supplemented with metals. (A &amp; B) Colony shape, TEM-EDX micrographs and spectra of S. maltophilia Sm777 grown in the presence of selenite (10 mM) and tellurite (1 mM). (C) Colony shape, ESEM-EDX observation and analysis of cells grown in the presence of CdCl2 (500 µM). Arrows on micrographs indicate the presence of intracellularly localized electron-dense particles of Se and Te, and arrows on spectra indicate metal-specific peak detected.
