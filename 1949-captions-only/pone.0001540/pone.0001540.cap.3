Cell treatments were the same as <a href="#pone-0001540-g001">Fig. 1</a>. (A) Leptin concentrations in the conditioned medium of the last 2 days were measured by ELISA and normalized by cell numbers. The figure shows representative data from two independent experiments with three replicates for each condition; data are presented as the meanSD values, and significance was determined by Student's t-test. (**&lt;0.01 versus A; <sup>#</sup>&lt;0.05 versus S) (B) RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for leptin and β-actin. (C) Exogenous leptin inhibits forskolin-induced effects on gene expression of PPARγ2 and Runx2 and the RANKL/OPG gene expression ratio. Cells were cultured in complete growth medium [C] or treated in AIM with 100 µM forskolin [F] in the absence or presence of leptin (0.6, 1.5, 3 µg/ml) for 7 days. RT-PCR analysis for β-actin, PPARγ2, Runx2, RANKL and OPG. Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of the gene expression ratio of PPARγ2/GADPH (D), Runx2/GADPH (E), and RANKL/OPG. (F). Exogenous leptin inhibits the effects of AIM with IBMX (I: AIM with 0.45 mM IBMX) on gene expression of PPARγ2, Runx2 and the RANKL/OPG gene expression ratio.</p>
