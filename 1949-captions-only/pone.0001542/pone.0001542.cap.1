                Figure 1.  The relationship between the number of bacteria and the percent of observed proteins from predicted orthologs.The number of predicted orthologs represents the sum of orthologs identified in-silico from any combination of bacteria within the set. As the number of organisms increased from 5 to 17, proteomes among the individual bacteria converged to a set of conserved proteins, or core proteome.
