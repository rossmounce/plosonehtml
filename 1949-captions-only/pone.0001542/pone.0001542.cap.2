Clustered results reveal a core genome of 144 genes and more exclusive orthologs between bacteria of the same species. B) Observed protein orthologs measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were included and given greater weight than predicted orthologs only. Clustering resulted in improved agreement with phylogenetic predictions. 105 of the 144 core genes were verified by protein observations, which represent the core proteome for the set of bacteria.</p>
