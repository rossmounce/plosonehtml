                Figure 4.  Functional categories (http://www.tigr.org/) assigned to the core genome and core proteome.The largest portion of the core proteome is involved in protein synthesis, which suggests the essentiality of these protein synthesis functions to freeliving bacteria. However, several proteins that were not well characterized according to functional category were also observed as part of the core proteome, which highlights the need for better characterization of these proteins.
