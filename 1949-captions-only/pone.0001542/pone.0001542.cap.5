As expected, <em>S. typhi</em> had the greatest degree of predicted and observed orthology to <em>S. typhimurium</em>.. Certain regions of orthology are unique to the two serovars and include A) orthologs predicted only, B) orthologs predicted in both serovars, but observed in only one, and C) orthologs predicted and observed in both serovars. Categories A and B highlight proteins for future investigation as potential therapeutic targets.</p>
