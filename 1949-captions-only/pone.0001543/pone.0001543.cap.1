                Figure 1.  A, B: Differences of seed capsules and stalk heights.Box-plots of differences (Î”) in (A) lifetime seed capsules (number) and (B) height (cm), among pairs of initially size-matched plants competing in a 2-L pot (control: untreated; induced: MJ-treated). Every isogenic plant of a genotype noted on the x-axis was paired with an isogenic WT plant. N = 20; for statistical evaluation see text. Whiskers designate the 95 % confidence interval of data.
