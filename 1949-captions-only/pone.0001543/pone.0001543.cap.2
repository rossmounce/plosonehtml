                Figure 2.  Power analysis for Δseed capsules.Calculated statistical power (dotted line: power = 0.8) as a function of sample size for detection of significant differences for Δseed capsules (two sample t-test) between irPI-WT and WT-WT (closed squares), and EVC-WT and WT-WT (closed circles), and for significant differences between two means (paired t-test) of irPI-WT (open squares) and EVC-WT (open circles), based on seed capsule data from the first experiment (N = 20). Note that the scale of the x-axis is diverted in a linear (left) and a logarithmic (right) segment.
