                Figure 3.  A, B: Differences of nicotine and TPI activity. Box-plots of differences (Î”) in (A) nicotine content (mg/g fresh mass) and (B) PI activity (nmol/mg protein) among pairs of initially size-matched plants competing in a 2-L pot (control: untreated; induced: MJ-treated).Every isogenic plant of a genotype noted on the x-axis was paired with an isogenic WT plant. N = 10; for statistical evaluation see text. Whiskers designate the 95 % confidence interval of data.
