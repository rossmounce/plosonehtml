                Figure 4.  Gene expression ratios.Graph of expression ratios (log2 transformed) of significantly different expressed genes in source leaves of each genotype 24 h after elicitation with MJ. Microarrays were hybridized with three different biological replicates for each genotype (the MJ-treated sample was labeled with cy3, controls with cy5). ANOVA, 2000 permutations, Î±: 0.01. For a list of different and non-different genes, see Supplemental Information.
