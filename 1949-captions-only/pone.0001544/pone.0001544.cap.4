Day 5 and Day 26, five and twenty-six days after cell transplantation. RBC, red blood cell. White bars (n = 10) and black bars (n = 14), the data obtained from the mice transplanted with control cells and MEDEP-E14 cells, respectively. Values are mean±S.D. * p&lt;0.01 (by the Student's <em>t</em>-test) (B) Increased survival of mice transplanted with MEDEP cells following induction of severe acute anemia. MEDEP-E14 cells (2×10<sup>7</sup> cells/mouse) were transplanted into an NOD-SCID mouse 24 hours following the first induction of hemolysis by phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg body weight) injection. Five days following the cell transplantation, the second induction of hemolysis by phenylhydrazine (80 mg/kg body weight) injection was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. (A, B) Control cell, mast cell line derived from mouse ES cells (MEDMC-NT2) (<a href="#pone.0001544.s001">Figures S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0001544.s002">S2</a>). MEDMC-NT2 cells (2×10<sup>7</sup> cells/mouse) were transplanted similarly as a control experiment.</p>
