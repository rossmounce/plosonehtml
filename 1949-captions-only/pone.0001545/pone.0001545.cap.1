<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7"></a><p>A major influence was bird genotype. Broilers worldwide are predominantly of two types, from either one of two major international breeder companies, labelled here A and B. Birds from both genotypes are sometimes reared together within one flock. For every percentage increase in Breed A birds in a flock, from between 0 to 100 per cent, there was a 0.0024 improvement in flock gait score.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p8" name="article1.body1.sec3.p8"></a><p>Whole wheat is sometimes fed to broilers as part of their diet, predominantly to improve digestive function. For every percentage increase in dietary wheat fed, from 0 to 30 per cent, as measured during their third week of life, there was a 0.017 per cent improvement in flock gait score.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p9" name="article1.body1.sec3.p9"></a><p>Broilers are reared under a wide variety of artificial lighting regimes. For every 1 hour increase in the daily period of darkness, across the range of 0 to 8.5 hours, there was a 0.079 improvement in flock gait score.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p10" name="article1.body1.sec3.p10"></a><p>There has been debate about the importance of stocking density as an influence on bird welfare and locomotion <a href="#pone.0001545-Dawkins1">[18]</a>. Within limits, putting as many birds in a house as possible for each rearing cycle will improve profitability. For every 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in stocking density as measured at the time of the flock assessment, across a range from 15.9 to 44.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, there was a 0.013 deterioration in flock gait score.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p11" name="article1.body1.sec3.p11"></a><p>Antibiotics are routinely used during different stages of broiler rearing and their use can be quite difficult to quantify accurately. In our study farmers were simply asked if a flock had received antibiotic. A reply of ‘yes’ in this context meant that a flock had received an extra antibiotic treatment in addition to that which would be part of normal rearing practice. For the flocks for which the farmer had answered ‘yes’ flock gait score was reduced by 0.17.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p12" name="article1.body1.sec3.p12"></a><p>Broiler feed is pelleted to minimise wastage and to increase the amount of feed that a bird can consume within a given time. In our study, veterinary assessors made a subjective judgement of whether the quality of the pelleting was good or poor (dusty/broken). For flocks with poor pelleting, gait score was on average 0.15 improved.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p13" name="article1.body1.sec3.p13"></a><p>The magnitude of a parameter estimate given in <a href="#pone-0001545-t003">Table 3</a> is not an indicator of the importance of the association of a variable with an increase or a reduction in gait score. This is because the magnitude of the parameter estimate is dependent upon the measurement scale used (e.g. kg or g, hour or day). Further, it is not possible to rank objectively the variables in terms of importance as subjective considerations such as practicality and the perceived cost of altering the husbandry practice have to be considered. For example, the results show that using 100% Breed A birds compared with 100% Breed B birds would reduce average flock gait score by 0.24. To achieve a similar reduction in average gait score by manipulating stocking density alone would require a <em>reduction</em> in stocking density of 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Despite these considerations there is value in using our model in a predictive capacity to show the improvement in average flock gait score that might be achieved on a hypothetical farm if each relevant variable attained the ‘best’ value actually recorded within the survey. <a href="#pone-0001545-g002">Figure 2</a> shows the potential improvement from a baseline flock average gait score of 2.5, the middle of the range of possible scores. The Figure shows that no, one variable was associated with a large shift in average flock gait towards the score of 0, a perfect gait, but that the age at which birds are slaughtered appears to be of primary importance, followed by the hours of darkness that the birds are allowed.</p>
