Fluorescent images of hybridized pilot barcode arrays fabricated on Superaldehyde® (top; substrate permissive to covalent linkage of probes) and GAPS™II (bottom; substrate non-permissive to covalent linkage of probes) slides. 184 barcode oligonucleotides were printed as two sets of quadruplet features in each of two identical arrays (or “super-grids”; only the top super-grid is shown for each substrate). Pairs of amino-modified (white circles) and unmodified control probes (white squares) are shown linked by dotted lines. A defective modified barcode, excluded from further analysis, is noted (white asters). Negative controls are shown (white dashed box). All other unmarked features hybridized with barcodes from sub-populations of non-essential deletion strains of chromosome 2, labeled with either Cy5 (Chr2_1) or Cy3 (Chr2_2). B. Effect of 5′-amino-modification on oligonucleotide performance. Performance of each of seven different barcode oligonucleotide pairs (sequences are provided in a Supplemental GeneList file; List <a href="#pone.0001546.s015">Data S1</a>; the probe pairs correspond to YBL090W-DN, YBL091C-DN, YBL091C-UP, YBL093C-DN, YBL093C-UP, YBL094C-DN, YBL094C-UP, from left to right) is measured by log2 ratio of SNR(unmodified)/SNR(modified) on Superaldehyde® substrate, corrected by subtracting the log2 ratio of that on GAPS™II substrate; where SNR denotes signal to noise ratio of the probe [(median intensity Cy5 [or Cy3] - median background Cy5 [or Cy3])/standard deviation background Cy5 (or Cy3)]. Performance was determined based on hybridization to the cognate barcode sequences (barcode, from <a href="#pone-0001546-g001">Figure 1A</a>) or to a Cy3-labeled randomized 9mer probe. C. Specificity and signal intensity of hybridized barcodes in the absence of covalent linkage to substrate. The log2 ratio of the background subtracted Cy5/Cy3 channels (M) is plotted versus the average log2 value of the signal intensity in each channel (A) for 8 replicates of each barcode. Barcodes from sub-populations of non-essential deletion strains from chromosome 2 are labeled with Cy5 (Chr2_1; black [amino-modified] and gold [unmodified]) and Cy3 (Chr2_2; magenta). Negative control sequences are shown (red). Spots with background-subtracted intensities below zero for one channel fall along straight lines. Negative values were assigned an arbitrary floor value of 1 (log2 = 0) in calculations of A and M. (The fluorescent image of 4 replicates for each probe is shown in the bottom panel of <a href="#pone-0001546-g001">Figure 1A</a>.)</p>
