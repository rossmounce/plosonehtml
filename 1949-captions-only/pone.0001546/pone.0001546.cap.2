                Figure 2.  Features of the 13K unique feature SUBarray.A. A representative microarray from an experiment with the haploid yeast deletion set. Arrays are constructed of 48 blocks. B. Enlargement of a region overlapping two of the blocks. In white boxes are the four oligonucleotide controls that are present within every block. C. Logarithmic scale scatter plot of background subtracted intensity for Cy5 versus Cy3-dye for a representative barcode elutriation cell size experiment. Barcodes of strains not present within the experimental pool (black) and the four sets of positive controls (magenta) are overlayed on the barcodes of strains represented in the pool (blue). D. Overlap of strains represented by at least one significant barcode signal between Agilent covalently linked 20mer arrays and SUBarrays. Significant barcode signals are as defined in the text.
