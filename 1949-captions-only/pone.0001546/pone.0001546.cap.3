Schematic of the experiment. Elutriation of the haploid pool enriches for small cells. Genomic DNA is isolated from cell populations immediately before and immediately after elutriation, differentially labeled with either Cy5 or Cy3, and applied to a barcode microarray. B. Cell size distributions of a characteristic elutriation as determined by use of a Coulter Z2 particle analyzer (Beckman). Increasing the rate of flow through the elutriation rotor increases the median cell size of the elutriated fraction. C. Scatter plot of the average barcode Z score. Agilent (Y axis). SUBarray (X axis). Left. Overlay of barcodes of strains confirmed as either <em>lge</em> (black), <em>whi</em> (magenta), or wild-type (WT; red) by systematic experiments <a href="#pone.0001546-Jorgensen1">[28]</a> on all other barcodes (blue). Right. Overlay of barcodes of structural components of the cytosolic or mitochondrial ribosome (magenta) or respiration defective strains <a href="#pone.0001546-Steinmetz1">[32]</a> (black) on all other barcodes (blue). D. Venn diagrams of overlap between systematic and barcode data using SUBarrays or Agilent arrays. Cell size mutants are as defined in the text. E. Overlap between systematic and barcode data. Clustered cell size distributions are represented by horizontal bars color coded by intensity to reflect the shape of the distributions, with deletion strains on the vertical, and cell size on the horizontal axis. Barcodes, divided into UP (U) and DN (D) tags, with Z scores greater than 1 are represented as Lge (green bars) or Whi (red bars) adjacent to their cognate deletion strain for all experiments (E1, E2, E3) and all elutriation cuts (16, 21, 24 mL/min). SUBarrays and Agilent arrays are shown. The density of <em>lge</em> or <em>whi</em> barcodes (Z score&gt;1) over a 3 gene window is represented by horizontal bars color coded by intensity (&gt;10% brown; &gt;30% yellow; &gt;70% orange). Only barcodes with significant intensity/SNR were used in density calculations. Gene deletion strains with systematic mean cell sizes &gt;1 SD larger (green) or smaller (red) than average are shown. Systematic <em>lge</em> strains with broad distributions and unexpected cell size by barcode are indicated (dotted red box and asterisk).</p>
