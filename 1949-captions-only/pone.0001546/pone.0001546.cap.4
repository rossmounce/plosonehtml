                Figure 4.  Barcode elutriation and systematic cell size enrichment of gene ontology (GO) annotations.Statistical enrichment from the haploid deletion set was calculated using cumulative hypergeometric probability functions (CDFs) with Bonferroni correction for either the high confidence systematic cell size data; SUBarray or Agilent array data; or the combined set of all whi or lge deletion strains identified. Significant enrichment for whi (red bars) or lge (green bars) strains is defined by [p*N&lt;0.01, where N is the number of categories per subset)]. GO component (N = 330); GO process (N = 1380); Morphology (N = 11) [27]. GO categories are arranged by related function.
