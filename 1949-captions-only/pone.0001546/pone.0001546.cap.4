Significant enrichment for <em>whi</em> (red bars) or <em>lge</em> (green bars) strains is defined by [p*N&lt;0.01, where N is the number of categories per subset)]. GO component (N = 330); GO process (N = 1380); Morphology (N = 11) <a href="#pone.0001546-Giaever1">[27]</a>. GO categories are arranged by related function.</p>
