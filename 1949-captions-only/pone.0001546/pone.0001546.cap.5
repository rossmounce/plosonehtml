Fluorescent imaging of hybridized and mock hybridized slides. Each slide contained two spots of oligonucleotides complementary or non-complementary to the labeled target sequence. The location of the AFM scans is indicated by a red arrow. B. Mock hybridized barcode oligonucleotide. 1 µm×1 µm scan of the surface arrangement. Pixels are ~2 nm on the x and y axis, and &lt;100 pm on the z axis. C. High density non-complementary barcode oligonucleotide hybridized in the presence of its non-cognate target sequence. The location of a region of aberrant signal omitted from the analysis is indicated by a red arrow. D. Complementary barcode oligonucleotide hybridized in the presence of its cognate target sequence. E. Cumulative frequency of peak number with increasing height cut-off for high (solid blue) and low density (dashed blue) non-complementary and complementary barcode oligonucleotides minus (green) or plus (red) hybridized target. F. Cumulative frequency of peak number with increasing diameter cut-off for high density (solid blue) and low density (dashed blue) non-complementary and complementary barcode oligonucleotides minus (green) or plus (red) hybridized target. The method of estimation of peak dimensions is described in the Supplementary material (Supplemental <a href="#pone.0001546.s001">text S1</a>). The height and diameter at which 99% of mock hybridized peaks are excluded is indicated by a red dotted line.</p>
