                Figure 1.  Effect of antiretroviral drugs on LINE-1 retrotransposition frequency.A. The LINE-1 retrotransposition reporter plasmid 99gfpLRE3 encodes the full-length, retrotransposition competent LRE3 LINE-1 element under the control of its natural promoter. An eGFP retrotransposition reporter cassette was inserted into the LRE3 3′ UTR. The cassette encodes eGFP under the control of a CMV promoter, in inverse orientation relative to the LRE3 sequence. The eGFP coding sequence is interrupted by an intron inserted in the same transcriptional orientation as LRE3. Transcription from the CMV promoter does can not yield a spliced eGFP sequence. Transcription from the LINE-1 promoter does not lead to eGFP expression, as the eGFP coding sequence is inverted in the resulting mRNA. However, retrotransposition of this RNA, and integration into the genome, allows a sense eGFP mRNA to be transcribed from the CMV promoter. Thus in cells transfected with 99gfpLRE3, eGFP expression acts as a reporter for the completion of a successful retrotransposition event. The 99gfpJM111 plasmid is analogous to 99gfpLRE3, but incorporates point mutations in ORF1 which render its LINE-1 element retrotransposition incompetent. 99gfpJM111 was therefore employed as a negative control in all assays. Both the 99gfpLRE3 and 99gfpJM111 plasmids also encode puromycin resistance markers allowing for selection of transfected cells. B–D. HeLa cells were incubated in triplicate with five-fold serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs, and transfected with the LINE-1 retrotransposition reporter plasmid 99gfpLRE3. Transfectants were selected with puromycin. Five days post-transfection, cells were stained with the viability dye 7-AAD, and analyzed by FACS. Retrotransposition frequency was determined by excluding 7-AAD-positive events, and then gating on the eGFP-positive population. Shown is representative data from one of three independent experiments. B. In the absence of drugs, a distinct eGFP-positive population of viable cells, representing cells that have undergone LINE-1-LRE3 retrotransposition events, is clearly distinguishable. Shown is one of six replicates of no drug control. C. In the presence of elevated concentrations of nRTIs, the eGFP-positive population is greatly diminished in frequency, indicating suppression of retrotransposition. Shown is one of three replicates of 25 µM stavudine treatment. D. LINE-1 retrotransposition, as reported by eGFP expression, is inhibited by nRTIs in a dose dependent manner, while nevirapine has no effect. Shown are the mean frequencies of eGFP-positive cells amongst the viable 7-AAD-negative subsets, as determined in triplicate, with standard errors represented by error bars. Dashed horizontal lines indicate 50% and 90% inhibition levels.
