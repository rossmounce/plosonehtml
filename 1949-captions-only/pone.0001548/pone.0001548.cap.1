                Figure 1.  Location of study sites at Kingman, Palmyra, Tabuaeran and Kiritimati atolls in the Line Islands.Sites were located at semi-exposed fore reef habitats between 10 and 12 m in depth, and approximately one km apart from each other. Reef fishes were surveyed at all sites (n = 25 sites per atoll), and benthic communities at a subset of sites (n = 10â€“12 sites per atoll).
