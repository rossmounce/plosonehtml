Lactate measurements were performed using HPLC (Reezex organic acid column) at various time intervals. Viable cell counts were performed using the Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay. • Corresponds to viable cell number of the astrocytic cells grown in serum free α-MEM+2.5 mM lactate. ○ Corresponds to viable cell number of astrocytic cells grown in serum free α-MEM. ▪ Corresponds to relative amount of lactate levels in the spent fluid (lactate cultures). n = 3, mean±SD</p>
