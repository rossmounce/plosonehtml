                Figure 1.  Lactate utilization by an astrocytic cell line.CCF-STTG1 cultures were supplemented with 2.5 mM lactate in serum free media. Lactate measurements were performed using HPLC (Reezex organic acid column) at various time intervals. Viable cell counts were performed using the Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay. • Corresponds to viable cell number of the astrocytic cells grown in serum free α-MEM+2.5 mM lactate. ○ Corresponds to viable cell number of astrocytic cells grown in serum free α-MEM. ▪ Corresponds to relative amount of lactate levels in the spent fluid (lactate cultures). n = 3, mean±SD
