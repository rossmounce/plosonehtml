The time dependent consumption of lactate by the mitochondria was measured using HPLC. II) The purity of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were confirmed using VDAC and F-actin respectively. III) Mitochondrial lactate consumption was confirmed using NMR spectroscopy. Data were acquired after 15min and 60min respectively. n = 3, meanÂ±SD</p>
