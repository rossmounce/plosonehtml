Nucleotide levels were measured by HPLC using a C<sub>18</sub> reverse phase column. I) ATP/ADP ratio in mitochondria. Open bar □ = ADP, and closed bar ▪ = ATP II) NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in mitochondria incubated with lactate. Open bar □ = NADH, and closed bar ▪ = NAD<sup>+</sup>. Peaks were confirmed by utilizing known standards and by spiking the samples. n = 3, mean±SD</p>
