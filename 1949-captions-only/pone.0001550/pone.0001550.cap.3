                Figure 3.  Lactate as a source of mitochondrial energy in an astrocytic cell line.Mitochondria were incubated with 5 mM lactate or 5 mM citrate, 0.1 mM NAD+, and 0.1 mM ADP for varying time intervals. Nucleotide levels were measured by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column. I) ATP/ADP ratio in mitochondria. Open bar □ = ADP, and closed bar ▪ = ATP II) NAD+/NADH ratio in mitochondria incubated with lactate. Open bar □ = NADH, and closed bar ▪ = NAD+. Peaks were confirmed by utilizing known standards and by spiking the samples. n = 3, mean±SD
