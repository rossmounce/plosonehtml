                Figure 4.  Oxidative metabolism of lactate in astrocytic mitochondria.Mitochondria isolated from CCF-STTG1 cells were incubated in 10 mM 13C3–lactate, 0.1 mM NAD+ and 1 µM NaN3 for varying time intervals. Accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates were measured via I) HPLC and II) NMR spectroscopy. HPLC fractions were also confirmed by enzymatic assays (citrate, succinate, and fumarate).
