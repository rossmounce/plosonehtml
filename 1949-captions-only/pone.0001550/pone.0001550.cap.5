                Figure 5.  Lactate promotes aerobic respiration in astrocytic mitochondria.I) Mitochondria from an astrocytic cell line were isolated and oxygen consumption was measured over a 5 min period, utilizing an oxygen electrode (OrionÂ®). Mitochondria were incubated with 5 mM substrate, 0.5 mM NAD+, and 0.5 mM ADP. A reaction buffer blank was also analyzed to ensure proper instrument calibration. II) In gel activity of cytochrome C oxidase. A) CCF-STTG1 cells incubated with 2.5 mM lactate. B) CCF-STTG1 cells incubated with 2.5mM glucose. C) CCF-STTG1 cells; incubated with 2.5 mM citrate.
