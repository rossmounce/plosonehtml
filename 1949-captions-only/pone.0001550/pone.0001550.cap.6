                Figure 6.  Mitochondrial lactate metabolism.Mitochondria from CCF-STTG1 cells were isolated and incubated with 5 mM lactate, and 0.1 mM NAD+ for varying time intervals within the presence or in absence of 10 mM oxamate. Relative lactate levels were measured by HPLC. • = mitochondria in the absence of 10mM oxamate. ▴ = mitochondria in the presence of 10mM oxamate. n = 3; SD
