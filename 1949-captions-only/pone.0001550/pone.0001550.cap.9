                Figure 9.  Localization of LDH in the mitochondria.Mitochondria were isolated and separated into A) Mitoplast and B) Outer membrane and inner membrane space fractions. I) Immunoblot for LDH1 in the mitochondrial fractions. II) Immunoblot for Cyt C and SDH to determine purity of mitochondrial fractions. Std corresponds to LDH from porcine heart (Sigma).
