Specific primers including the sense (<span class="gene">5′- ATGACTTTGACCACGAAACTGAGCG-3′</span>) and anti-sense primers (<span class="gene">5′-TCAGGCAGGGCTCCGGCCCCAGATGC-3′</span>) were designed to clone sialidase from <em>P. acnes</em> (ATCC 6919). The vector, which contains T7/LacO promoter, is derived from the pET system developed by William Studier and colleagues to achieve exceptionally high levels of protein expression in <em>E. coli</em>. Sialidase (arrow) was expressed in <em>E. coli</em> in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of (1 mM) IPTG. After IPTG induction, sialidase was successfully expressed in <em>E. coli</em> and shown at about 53.1 kDa on a 10 % SDS-PAGE (arrowhead). (B) Purified sialidase (arrow) was obtained via In-Fusion Ready TALON Express Bacterial Expression and Purification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). (C) The expression and purity of sialidase were confirmed by Nano-LTQ MS/MS mass spectrometry (Thermo Electron Corp. Waltham, MA). A sequenced internal peptide (VVELSDTLMLNSR) of sialidase was presented.</p>
