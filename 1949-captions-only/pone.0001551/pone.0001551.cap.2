FITC-fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytomtery (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), reflecting the quantity of sialic acid. The sebocytes were pre-treated with 10 µg/ml of purified recombinant sialidase (green, a), GFP (green, b) or an equal volume of PBS (vehicle) (purple) at pH 6 for 2 h. The decrease in FITC-fluorescence intensity in sialidase-treated sebocytes validated the enzymatic activity of the purified sialidase. (B) After pre-treatment with sialidase, sebocytes were co-cultured with <em>P. acnes</em> (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/5×10<sup>6</sup> cells) for 18 h. <em>P. acnes</em>-induced cell death in PBS (vehicle)-, sialidase- or GFP-pretreated sebocytes was assessed by trypan blue. Cell death is presented as the % of dead cells compared to all cultured cells. (C) After washing out unbound <em>P. acnes</em>, the number of <em>P. acnes</em> adhered to sebocytes was calculated by spreading Triton-X (0.01%) lysed sebocytes on agar plates to quantify CFU/cell. (D) The CFU/cell in vehicle-pretreated sebocytes was defined as 100%. Adherence of <em>P. acnes</em> (arrows) to vehicle (a)-, sialidase (b)- or GFP (c)-treated sebocytes was visualized by staining with the Accustain Gram stain kit. Pre-treatment with sialidase significantly increased the adhesion of <em>P. acnes</em> to sebocytes. Shown are representative results of three independent experiments. Error bars are mean±SE (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01*, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001**, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0005*** by Student's t-test). Bar: 10 µm.</p>
