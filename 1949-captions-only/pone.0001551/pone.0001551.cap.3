                Figure 3.  Mice Immunized with Recombinant Sialidase and Freund (in)complete Adjuvants Produce Sialidase Specific Antibodies.(A) ICR mice were vaccinated with heat-killed P. acnes for nine weeks (three boosts at a three-week interval). Serum (1: 500 dilution), harvested one week after the third boost, was reacted to recombinant sialidase (1 µg; lane 1), GFP (1 µg, lane 2), and P. acnes lysates (7 µg, lane 3) that had been run on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The 6x HN tag of recombinant sialidase was removed by enterokinase before loading into a SDS-PAGE. Although heat-killed P. acnes-vaccinated mice produced anti-sera against several P. acnes proteins (&gt;50 kDa) (lane 3), sialidase specific antibodies were not detected (lane 3). (B) ICR mice were then vaccinated with a recombinant sialidase (lane 1) or GFP (lane 2) using Freund/(in)complete adjuvants. For the first vaccination, mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 50 µg of sialidase or GFP, which were emulsified with a complete Freund adjuvant. Two weeks later, the second vaccination was delivered via intramuscular injection with the same amount of antigen mixed well with incomplete Freund adjuvant. Anti-sialidase antibodies were detected by western blot one week after the second vaccination. 1 µg of recombinant sialidase or GFP were separated via 10 % SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane and reacted with mouse sera (10,000-fold dilution). Sialidase antibodies were provoked when mice were immunized with recombinant sialidase, but not with GFP. Data is representative of three separate experiments with similar results.
