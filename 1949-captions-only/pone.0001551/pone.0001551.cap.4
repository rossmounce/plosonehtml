For assaying <em>in vivo</em> immune protection, ICR mice were immunized with recombinant sialidase or GFP using Freund (In)complete adjuvants (<a href="#pone-0001551-g003">Figure 3</a>). After confirming antibody production by western blot, live <em>P. acnes</em> (10<sup>7</sup> CFU, 25 µl) were injected subcutaneously into the ears of sialidase- and GFP-immunized mice, with PBS (25 µl) as a control. Ear thickness was periodically measured for 71 days after injection and changes reported as % of ear thickness in PBS-injected ears. <em>P. acnes</em>-induced ear swelling was significantly suppressed in sialidase-immunized mice in comparison with GFP-immunized mice (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05*), except for day 0, 4, 5 and 71. (B) Erythema was assessed in sialidase- (a) or GFP- (b) immunized mice 24 h after live <em>P. acnes</em> (left ears) or PBS (right ears) injection.</p>
