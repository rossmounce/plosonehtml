                Figure 4.  Immune Protection Conferred by A Sialidase-based Acne Vaccine.(A) The cytotoxicity of P. acnes was calculated as described in Methods and presented as mean±SE (P&lt;0.0005** by Student's t-test). For assaying in vivo immune protection, ICR mice were immunized with recombinant sialidase or GFP using Freund (In)complete adjuvants (Figure 3). After confirming antibody production by western blot, live P. acnes (107 CFU, 25 µl) were injected subcutaneously into the ears of sialidase- and GFP-immunized mice, with PBS (25 µl) as a control. Ear thickness was periodically measured for 71 days after injection and changes reported as % of ear thickness in PBS-injected ears. P. acnes-induced ear swelling was significantly suppressed in sialidase-immunized mice in comparison with GFP-immunized mice (P&lt;0.05*), except for day 0, 4, 5 and 71. (B) Erythema was assessed in sialidase- (a) or GFP- (b) immunized mice 24 h after live P. acnes (left ears) or PBS (right ears) injection.
