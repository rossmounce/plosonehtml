The tissue chamber consisted of closed ploytetrafluoroethylene Teflon cylinders with 12 regularly spaced 0.1 mm holes. Bar: 1 cm. H&amp;E staining of the cross-section of an implanted tissue chamber showed that the chamber was completely encapsulated by fibrotic tissue 7-days after implantation (b). Bar: 1.0 mm. <em>P. acnes</em> (10<sup>7</sup> CFU, 20 µl) was injected and trapped in this encapsulated tissue chamber. (B) Tissue chamber fluid containing MIP-2 was drawn by pecutaneous aspiration before (open bar) and three days after (solid bar) <em>P. acnes</em> injection. Measurement of MIP-2 was carried out by sandwich ELISA that used the Quantikine M mouse MIP-2 set (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN). Vaccination with sialidase markedly suppressed the <em>P. acnes</em>-induced increase in MIP-2. Error bars represented mean±SE of five separate experiments (*<em>P</em>&lt;0.005 by Student's <em>t</em>-test).</p>
