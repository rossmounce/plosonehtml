Serum-pretreated <em>P. acnes</em> (2×10<sup>6</sup> CFU) was then co-cultured with sebocytes (2×10<sup>5</sup> cells) for 18 h. Sebocyte death induced by serum-pretreated <em>P. acnes</em> was detected by <em>p</em>NPP. The cytotoxicity of <em>P. acnes</em> was calculated as described in <a href="#s2">Methods</a> and presented as mean±SE (n = 4, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0005** by Student's <em>t</em>-test). (B) Serum-pretreated <em>P. acnes</em> (1.5×10<sup>8</sup> CFU) was co-cultured with sebocytes (3×10<sup>6</sup> cells) for 8 h. Measurement of IL-8 in the culture medium was carried out by ELISA assays using a Quantikine human IL-8 set (R&amp;D System). The data is presented as mean±SE (n = 4, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01* by Student's <em>t</em>-test).</p>
