                Figure 6.  Neutralization with Anti-sialidase Serum Decreases P. acnes-induced Cell Death and IL-8 Production in Human Sebocytes.(A) For in vitro neutralization assays, P. acnes was pre-treated with 2.5% (v/v) anti-sialidase or GFP sera at 37°C for 2 h. Serum-pretreated P. acnes (2×106 CFU) was then co-cultured with sebocytes (2×105 cells) for 18 h. Sebocyte death induced by serum-pretreated P. acnes was detected by pNPP. The cytotoxicity of P. acnes was calculated as described in Methods and presented as mean±SE (n = 4, P&lt;0.0005** by Student's t-test). (B) Serum-pretreated P. acnes (1.5×108 CFU) was co-cultured with sebocytes (3×106 cells) for 8 h. Measurement of IL-8 in the culture medium was carried out by ELISA assays using a Quantikine human IL-8 set (R&amp;D System). The data is presented as mean±SE (n = 4, P&lt;0.01* by Student's t-test).
