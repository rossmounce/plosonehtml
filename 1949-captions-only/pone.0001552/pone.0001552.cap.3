                Figure 3.  Annual evolution of WR relative improvement: κ decreases from 0.024 in the first 30 years to 0.010 in the last 10 years (Linear model: y = −1.46·10−4x+0.301, F(1,102) = 27.14, P&lt;0.001).This decrease is representative of the growing difficulty to improve previously established WR values.
