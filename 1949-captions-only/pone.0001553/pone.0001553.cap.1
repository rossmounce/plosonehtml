Digestion mixtures were desalted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in positive, linear mode. A) A typical spectrum has signals corresponding to all the expected peptides. * labels the signals corresponding to [M+2H]<sup>2+</sup>. B and C) Zooms of the spectrum shown in A encompassing the two regions where signals corresponding to modified peptides are found. B) Peaks of the N-terminus of the protein (5003.5 and 5132.8) and its phosphorylated forms (5083.8, 5213.1, 5294.8). C) C-terminus of the protein (6743.7) and its presumptive methylated form (6756.6). Red: MALDI-TOF, linear positive mode; black: MALDI-TOF, reflector positive mode. D) Assignment of the peaks in A-C. <em>m/z</em>: experimental <em>m/z</em> values, [M+H]<sup>+</sup>: expected <em>m/z</em> values (accession number P02255), Amino acids: amino acids contained in the peptide, Sequence: aminoacid sequence of the corresponding peptide and indication of the presence of PTMs. Note that the aminoacids position are referred to the mature protein, without the first methionine.</p>
