                Figure 1.  MALDI-TOF analysis of H1 from 0–12 h embryos after Asp-N digestion.H1 from 0–12 h embryos was purified and digested with Asp-N. Digestion mixtures were desalted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in positive, linear mode. A) A typical spectrum has signals corresponding to all the expected peptides. * labels the signals corresponding to [M+2H]2+. B and C) Zooms of the spectrum shown in A encompassing the two regions where signals corresponding to modified peptides are found. B) Peaks of the N-terminus of the protein (5003.5 and 5132.8) and its phosphorylated forms (5083.8, 5213.1, 5294.8). C) C-terminus of the protein (6743.7) and its presumptive methylated form (6756.6). Red: MALDI-TOF, linear positive mode; black: MALDI-TOF, reflector positive mode. D) Assignment of the peaks in A-C. m/z: experimental m/z values, [M+H]+: expected m/z values (accession number P02255), Amino acids: amino acids contained in the peptide, Sequence: aminoacid sequence of the corresponding peptide and indication of the presence of PTMs. Note that the aminoacids position are referred to the mature protein, without the first methionine.
