Continous line: absorbance at 214 nm; dashed line: eluent composition expressed as percentage of eluent B. B and C) The purified peptides 189–255 and its methylated form were partially digested with carboxypeptidase Y. The digestion mixtures were desalted and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the linear, reflector mode. Zooms are shown. In both panels, the upper spectrum corresponds to the unmodified form and the lower, to the modified one. The results indicate that the methylated residue is in the stretch 215–224. B) Region displaying the largest peptides where identical mass in both samples is detected. C) Region displaying the smallest peptides where a mass difference between both samples is detected. For the region 215–224 no signals are present in the spectra. D) H1 was isolated from different sources, digested with Asp-N, desalted and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the linear, positive mode. Zoom of the region containing 189–255 is shown. Magenta: 2–3 h embryos, green: 12–15 h embryos, grey: 0–12 h embryos, black SL2 cells. The proportion unmethylated (6744.4)/methylated (6758.3) is identical in all the embryonic samples, whereas no methylated species can be detected in the SL2 cells. The peak with a m/z value of 6767.3 corresponds to a sodium adduct of the unmethylated form. E) The existence of the polymorphism V217I could explain our observations. Upper panel: a stretch of the DNA sequence of a H1 gene coding for the Val allele is shown (accession number: NM_165380). The numbers indicate the base position with respect to the transcription start. A SfcI restriction site is underlined. The corresponding translated sequence is shown underneath. The numbers indicate the aminoacid position respect to the mature protein. The long lines represent the fragment of DNA sequence amplified by PCR, the arrows, the SfcI restriction sites and the short lines at the bottom, the expected fragments after SfcI digestion. The lower panel represents the same but for a H1 gene coding for the Ile allele (for instance, accession number: NM_1032208). The shift 688 G-&gt;A results in the lost of a SfcI restriction site. F) The polymorphism Val217Ile is present in the fly population. A stretch of the coding sequence of H1 (606–806) was amplified from fly and SL2 cells genomic DNA. The products were digested with SfcI and the resulting fragments were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As control, parallel incubations with no enzyme were performed. In the sample from SL2 cells, only the expected bands for the allele Val are observed (60 and 123 bp, the 18 bp bands ran out of the gel), whereas in the sample from the flies, the pattern fits with the existence of both the Val (60 and 123 bp) and the Ile (60 and 141 bp) alleles.</p>
