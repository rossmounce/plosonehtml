                Figure 3.  Phosphorylation in 0–12 h embryos is located in the N-terminal 20 aminoacids.H1 from 0–12 h embryos was isolated and digested with AspN (A), trypsin (B) or Glu-C (C, D). Digests were desalted and MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired in the linear (A, C, D) or reflector (B) modes. For each sample, spectra in the positive (upper spectrum on each panel) and negative (lower spectrum on each panel) were recorded. Zooms of the interesting regions are shown. A) In the negative mode, no more phosphorylation states for 1–52 mode are detected, respect to the positive mode. B) After digestion with trypsin, mono- and diphosphorylation are detected in 1–21 and no modification (apart from oxidation) is present in 38–57. C, D) After digestion with Glu-C, no PTM is detected for 21–61 (only oxidation, C), however 1–20 appears clearly un-, mono and diphosphorylated (D).
