The resulting crude was desalted and the different forms of the peptide 1–21 were sequenced by ESI-MS/MS. A) Scheme showing the peptide 1–21 and the numbering of the b and y ions. The residues susceptible of phosphorylation are highlighted in red. B) TOF-MS spectrum of the sample. The double charged ions corresponding to 1–21, its modified forms and sodium adducts are indicated. Note that, due to the chemical treatment of the sample, the mass difference between the unmodified and the monomodified form is 60 instead of 80. C, D) Zooms of the product ion spectra for the unmodified (lower), monomodified (middle) and dimodified (upper) forms. * labels the ions with one modification; ** labels the ions with two modifications. C) For y11 only no modified ions are detected in both the mono- and dimodified peptide 1–21, which indicates that there is no detectable phosphorylation at T18. Therefore, the presence of monomodified y12 can only be due to phosphorylation at S10. The pattern of the b13 and b14 ions in the spectra of the mono- and dimodified species corroborate this assumption. In the spectrum of the diphosphorylated population, the presence of only monomodified y12 and y13 indicates that one of the two phosphate groups on each molecule is at S10. Additionally, the signal of dimodified y14 reveals the existence of a subpopulation of the peptide 1–21 containing phosphate groups at S10 and S8 simultaneously. Moreover, the higher relative intensity of dimodified vs. monomodified ions y15 and y16 respect to the same ratio for y14 suggests the presence of a species with simultaneous S10 and T7 phosphorylation. D) There is a small proportion of H1monophosphorylated at S1 and/or S3, as revealed by the intensities of b6, b6*, b7 andb7*. In the diphosphorylated population there is also modification at S1 and/or S3, however, simultaneous phosphorylation at S1 and S3 in the same molecule cannot be detected.</p>
