                Figure 5.  The monophosphorylation at S10 decreases as the embryos maturate.Histone H1 from 2–3 h, 3–6 h, 6–9 h, 9–12 h and 12–15 h was isolated and digested with trypsin. A) Zoom of two MALDI-TOF spectra acquired in the reflector positive mode are shown as examples. The upper spectrum corresponds to the 12–15 h old embryos, the lower to the 3–6 h ones. Note the different intensity of the signal at 2078. B) To compare the proportion of monophosphorylated H1 between the different stages, the area of the clusters corresponding to unmodified 1–21 (both proton and sodium adducts) and the monophosphorylated form (only proton adduct, sodium adduct not detected) was calculated for H1 from staged embryos. For each sample, the relative area of the monophosphorylated species (Arel) was calculated by division of the area of the monophosphorylated species through the total area (unmodified+monophosphorylated). The results of two independent biological replicates are shown. The error bars indicate the maximum and the minimum obtained values. C) Scheme showing the peptide 1–21 and the numbering of the b and y ions. The residues susceptible of phosphorylation are highlighted in red. D and E) H1 from 3–6 h and 12–15 h old embryos was purified, digested with trypsin, submitted to chemical modification (β-elimination and Michael addition) and finally, the forms of 1–21 were sequenced by ESI-MS/MS. Zooms of the product ions of the monomodified species are shown. * labels the modified species. D) The relative intensities of y12 and y12* indicate that the 12–15 h old embryos have less proportion of S10 phosphorylation than the younger embryos. E) The relative intensities of the b and b* ions suggest that monophosphorylated H1 from 12–15 h old embryos contains more proportion of S1 and/or S3 phosphorylation than the sample from the younger embryos.
