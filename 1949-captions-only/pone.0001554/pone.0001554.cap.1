                Figure 1.  FLNA associates with Go-coupled MORs and not Gs-coupled MORs.Neuronal membranes were prepared from striata of rats chronically treated with vehicle, morphine, or ultra-low-dose NLX alone or combined with morphine. After stimulation by in vitro morphine or not, membranes were solubilized and immunoprecipitated first with immobilized anti-Gα. Anti-Gα immunoprecipitates were then immunoprecipitated with immobilized anti-MOR before final Western blot detection with anti-FLNA. Densitometric quantitation (B) of Western blots of both MOR in the second immunoprecipitate and FLNA in the final (A) demonstrates that FLNA is associated with MORs coupling to Go but not MORs coupling to Gs. These blots and their quantitation also show that NLX co-treatment prevented the chronic morphine-induced Go-to-Gs coupling switch. Solid bars indicate basal coupling, and hatched bars indicate coupling after receptor stimulation by in vitro morphine. n = 4. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 compared to respective basal coupling level. # p&lt;0.01 compared to respective value in vehicle or morphine+NLX groups. Blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to yaotio, MAP2, H-neurofilament and MAP1B (C).
