                Figure 2.  NLX target is distinct from MOR but also bound by naltrexone.A, Naltrexone but not morphine markedly reduced [3H]NLX binding in FLNA-expressing A7 membranes. n = 6. B, The absence of [3H]DAMGO binding using twice the amount of A7 membranes shows these lines do not express MOR. n = 4. C, Parent M2 melanoma cells do not express NLX targets. n = 4. * p&lt;0.05 compared to control.
