                Figure 3.  NLX binds A7 membranes with picomolar affinity.A competition (displacement) curve for the inhibition of [3H]NLX binding by naltrexone to membranes from FLNA-expressing A7 cells shows two affinity states with IC50-H of 3.94 picomolar and IC50-L of 834 picomolar. A nonlinear curve-fit analysis was performed using a competition equation that assumed two saturable sites for the naltrexone curve comprising of 16 concentrations ranging from 0.1 pM to 1 ÂµM. Data are derived from 6 experiments each using a different set of A7 cells.
