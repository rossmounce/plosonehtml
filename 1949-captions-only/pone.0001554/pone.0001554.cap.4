Peptides containing FLNA<sub>2561–2565</sub> markedly reduced [<sup>3</sup>H]NLX binding to A7 membranes (<em>A</em>) and to purified FLNA (<em>B, C</em>). The reduction of [<sup>3</sup>H]NLX binding to purified FLNA was not affected by the presence of the irreversible MOR antagonist β-FNA (<em>C</em>). <em>n</em> = 6. * p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle.</p>
