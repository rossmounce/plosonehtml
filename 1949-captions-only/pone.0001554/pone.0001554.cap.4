                Figure 4.  FLNA2561–2565 is the binding site for [3H]NLX.A7 cell membranes or purified FLNA was incubated with [3H]NLX in the presence of various overlapping FLNA c-terminal peptide fragments. Peptides containing FLNA2561–2565 markedly reduced [3H]NLX binding to A7 membranes (A) and to purified FLNA (B, C). The reduction of [3H]NLX binding to purified FLNA was not affected by the presence of the irreversible MOR antagonist β-FNA (C). n = 6. * p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle.
