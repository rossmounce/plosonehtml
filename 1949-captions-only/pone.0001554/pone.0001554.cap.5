                Figure 5.  Mid-point lysine of FLNA2561–2565 is critical for NLX binding.An alanine scan of the FLNA2561–2565 pentapeptide (VAKGL) shows that residue of FLNA2561–2565 is critical for NLX binding. All other individual alanine substitutions only mildly attenuated [3H]NLX binding to FLNA in A7 membranes. n = 6. * p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle.
