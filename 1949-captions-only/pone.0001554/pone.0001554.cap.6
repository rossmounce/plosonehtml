                Figure 6.  [3H]- and FITC-NLX binding to intact A7 cells is blocked by FLNA2561-2565.Intact A7 and M2 cells were incubated with 0.5 nM [3H]NLX or 10 nM FITC-NLX in the presence or absence of 10 nM VAKGL or VAAGL. [3H]NLX bound to A7 but not to M2 cells and VAKGL markedly reduced this binding to A7 cells (A). Likewise, FITC-NLX labelled A7 (B.I) but not M2 cells (B.II), and co-treatment with VAKGL (B.III) but not VAAGL (B.IV) abolished this FITC-NLX labelling in A7 cells (B). n = 4. * p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle.
