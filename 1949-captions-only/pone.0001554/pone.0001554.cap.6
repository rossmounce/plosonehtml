[<sup>3</sup>H]NLX bound to A7 but not to M2 cells and VAKGL markedly reduced this binding to A7 cells (<em>A</em>). Likewise, FITC-NLX labelled A7 (<em>B.I</em>) but not M2 cells (<em>B.II</em>), and co-treatment with VAKGL (<em>B.III</em>) but not VAAGL (<em>B.IV</em>) abolished this FITC-NLX labelling in A7 cells (<em>B</em>). <em>n</em> = 4. * p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle.</p>
