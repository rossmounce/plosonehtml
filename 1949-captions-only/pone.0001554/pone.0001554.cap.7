Coupling between MOR and Gs/Go proteins was assessed by Western blot (<em>A</em>) and analyzed by densitometric scanning (<em>B</em>). Chronic morphine exposure caused a Go-to-Gs coupling switch that was blocked by NLX co-treatment. NLX's suppression of this coupling switch was blocked by FLNA<sub>2561-2570</sub> but not by FLNA<sub>2566–2575</sub> or FLNA<sub>2550–2560</sub>, illustrating that NLX's protective effect occurs via its binding to FLNA within FLNA<sub>2561–2570</sub>. Solid bars indicate basal coupling; hatched bars indicate coupling after <em>in vitro</em> morphine stimulation. <em>n</em> = 6. *p&lt;0.01 compared to Kreb's Ringer; +p&lt;0.01 compared to morphine; #p&lt;0.01 compared to morphine+NLX.</p>
