                Figure 8.  FLNA2561–2565 blocks 10 pM NLX's prevention of chronic morphine-induced cAMP accumulation.After chronic treatments, slices were stimulated with DAMGO, forskolin or DAMGO+forskolin before solubilizing tissues and measuring cAMP levels. In accordance with the Go-to-Gs coupling switch, chronic morphine increased basal cAMP production by 24%, caused DAMGO to stimulate basal cAMP production, and reduced the DAMGO-mediated inhibition of the forskolin effect from 35% in vehicle/NLX groups to 7%. NLX co-treatment blocked these morphine-induced effects, and the protective effect of NLX was blocked by FLNA2561–2570 but not by FLNA2566–2575 or FLNA2550–2560, again demonstrating that NLX's protection occurs through binding to FLNA within FLNA2561–2570. n = 4. *p&lt;0.01 compared to forskolin alone. +p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle. ##p&lt;0.05, #p&lt;0.01 compared to basal level.
