In accordance with the Go-to-Gs coupling switch, chronic morphine increased basal cAMP production by 24%, caused DAMGO to stimulate basal cAMP production, and reduced the DAMGO-mediated inhibition of the forskolin effect from 35% in vehicle/NLX groups to 7%. NLX co-treatment blocked these morphine-induced effects, and the protective effect of NLX was blocked by FLNA<sub>2561–2570</sub> but not by FLNA<sub>2566–2575</sub> or FLNA<sub>2550–2560</sub>, again demonstrating that NLX's protection occurs through binding to FLNA within FLNA<sub>2561–2570</sub>. <em>n</em> = 4. *p&lt;0.01 compared to forskolin alone. +p&lt;0.01 compared to vehicle. ##p&lt;0.05, #p&lt;0.01 compared to basal level.</p>
