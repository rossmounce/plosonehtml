Red lines represent the Dissociation variant, green lines represents the Convey variant, while the black arrows are common to both. The switching parameter u models the effect of the attachment. We set u = 1 for the unattached case and u =  0 for the attached case. We set u′ = 1 for the uncontrolled scenario and u′ = 1−u for the controlled scenario (<a href="#pone-0001555-t001">Table 1</a>). The model incorporates three central control mechanisms, namely Mad1/Mad2 induced Cdc20 sequestering based on the Template Model, MCC formation, and APC inhibition. These sub-systems can be red from left to right. Nine biochemical reaction equations describe the interactions of 11 species: Mad1:C-Mad2, O-Mad2, Mad1:C-Mad2:O-Mad2*, Cdc20, Cdc20:C-Mad2, Bub3:BubR1, MCC, Bub3:BubR1:Cdc20, APC, MCC:APC, and APC:Cdc20. Below the network, the subunits of MCC as well as APC are depicted.</p>
