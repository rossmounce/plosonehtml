The APC:Cdc20 concentration should be close to zero before attachment and should rise quickly after attachment. Spindle attachment occurs at t = 2000s (switching parameter u from 1 to 0). For the uncontrolled case (A, B), both variants cannot explain the checkpoint behavior; and the Convey variant is even less satisfying compared to the Dissociation variant. In the controlled case (C, D), both variants fully inhibit APC:Cdc20 before attachment and both show fast switching recovery for high k<sub>−7</sub> values. The controlled Convey variant (D) is slightly faster (by about 5 mins) in switching compared to the controlled Dissociation (C) variant. Parameters setting according to <a href="#pone-0001555-t001">Table 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0001555-t002">Table 2</a>.</p>
