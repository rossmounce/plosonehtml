                Figure 3.  Species concentration over time for the controlled Dissociation variant (A) and the controlled Convey variant (B).Spindle attachment occurs at t = 2000s (switching parameter u from 1 to 0 and u' from 0 to 1). Both variants show similar qualitative dynamics. However, quantitative differences can be observed for species like Cdc20:C-Mad2 and MCC. Parameters setting according to Table 2 (“wild type”).
