For proper functioning, APC:Cdc20 concentration should be very low(zero) before the attachment, and should increase quickly after attachment. Deletion of Mad2 (A) or Cdc20 (C) destroys the switching behavior, that is, the concentrations of all model species are rather constant. Mad2 deletion (A) causes high APC:Cdc20 concentration right from the beginning, while for Cdc20 deletion (C) APC:Cdc20 concentration is zero, by definition. For Mad2 over-expression (B) or Cdc20 over-expression (D), many species concentrations are affected. Particularly, for Mad2 over-expression (B) the APC:Cdc20 concentration remains low before attachment and, after attachment, stays significantly lower than in the wild type (meaning mitotic arrest). In contrast, for Cdc20 over-expression (D), the APC:Cdc20 concentration is high before attachment and also after attachment (meaning checkpoint failure). Spindle attachment occurs at t = 2000s (switching parameter u from 1 to 0 and u' from 0 to 1). Further setting as in <a href="#pone-0001555-g002">Figure 2</a>.</p>
