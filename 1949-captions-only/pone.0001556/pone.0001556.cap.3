                Figure 3.  Comparison of Antibody Titer and Sporozoite Neutralizing Activity for Select Volunteers.As measured by IFA against whole sporozoite (gradient bars), (T1B)4 ELISA (hatched bars) and transgenic sporozoite neutralization assay (TSNA) (percentages above bars). For the TSNA, 94.5% inhibition was obtained using a positive control monoclonal antibody specific for P. falciparum CS repeats and âˆ’5% for negative control MAB specific for P. berghei CS repeats. Volunteers with positive CSP assays, volunteers 1 and 10, are indicated with a plus sign (+) in the x-axis.
