For the TSNA, 94.5% inhibition was obtained using a positive control monoclonal antibody specific for <em>P. falciparum</em> CS repeats and âˆ’5% for negative control MAB specific for <em>P. berghei</em> CS repeats. Volunteers with positive CSP assays, volunteers 1 and 10, are indicated with a plus sign (+) in the <em>x</em>-axis.</p>
