(B) DENV-2 infected monocytes. Monocytes were infected by DENV-2 New Guinea C strain at an MOI of 0.1 and then cultured for three days. Evans blue was added as a counter-stain to differentiate non-infected cells (shown by red color) from the dengue virus-positive infected cells (shown by green color).</p>
