<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Severe DENV infections have commonly observed in patients with secondary dengue viral infection in many South East Asian countries <a href="#pone.0001557-Gubler1">[1]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001557-Gubler3">[3]</a>. Plasma samples from all G6PD-deficient patients and healthy controls were tested in the presence of four DENV serotype-specific antibodies using PRNT to clarify whether the higher infection capability of DENV-2 in the monocytes of G6PD-deficient patients was caused by the secondary dengue viral infection. None of the four serotype specific DENV antibodies was detected in any of the 12 G6PD-deficient patients or 24 healthy controls. The results revealed that the higher infection percentage of DENV-2 in the monocytes of G6PD deficient-patients than in healthy people was not associated with prior DENV infections.</p>

<div id="section3" class="section"><a id="s3" name="s3" toc="s3" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.p1"></a><p>One of the important virological characteristics of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients is elevated viral load <a href="#pone.0001557-Wang1">[22]</a>. The association of G6PD deficiency and microbial infections, such as acute viral hepatitis A, has been described <a href="#pone.0001557-Gotsman1">[16]</a>. This is the first work to demonstrate clearly that the PBMC monocytes obtained from G6PD-deficient patients, using an <em>ex vivo</em> culture system, were more easily infected with the two DENV-2 strains-(1) the New Guinea C strain from the DF patient or (2) the 16681 strain from the DHF patient than with those from healthy controls. This finding suggests that the high capability for DENV infection in human monocytes <em>in vivo</em> may increase viral yield, which may create more problems in the efficient clearance of the virus and thus increase the likelihood of a severe clinical outcome of dengue in G6PD-deficient patients. This suggestion is consistent with our earlier finding that DHF patients had higher viral loads even during the defervescence stage <a href="#pone.0001557-Wang1">[22]</a>. In Taiwan, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in general population is about 2.1% <a href="#pone.0001557-Chiang1">[13]</a>. When G6PD-deficient patients are infected with DENV, their higher viral load may increase the probability of transmission of the infection to others via infected mosquitoes, if mosquito breeding sites are not properly environmentally controlled <a href="#pone.0001557-Hayes1">[23]</a>. In Thailand, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the general population is approximately 11% <a href="#pone.0001557-Tanphaichitr1">[20]</a>, explaining the higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency in DHF patients (19.1%) even though the study that supported this conclusion did not use a control group <a href="#pone.0001557-Tanphaichitr1">[20]</a>. This conclusion also supports the public health implication that more efficient prevention and control of dengue is required in areas in which many G6PD-deficient patients live.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>The mechanism of increased infection with DENV-2 in monocytes from G6PD-deficient patients remains unclear. The mutation in G6PD probably leads to granulocyte dysfunction, preventing the clearing of the infection at the first line of defense and thereby increasing susceptibility to DENV <a href="#pone.0001557-vanBruggen1">[24]</a>. In fact, severe G6PD deficiency impairs respiratory burst activity and results in the generation of the less reactive oxygen species (ROS, including super-oxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical), causing abnormal function of the neutrophils and monocytes, as in HIV infection <em>in vitro</em> <a href="#pone.0001557-Chen2">[25]</a> and in ROS-deficient mice, which are extremely susceptible to infection <a href="#pone.0001557-Lindgren1">[26]</a>. Interestingly, ROS inhibited the RNA replication of hepatitis C virus, a member of the same family (<em>Flaviviridae</em>) as DENV, in human hepatoma cells <a href="#pone.0001557-Choi1">[27]</a>. Therefore, the greater infection of DENV in human monocytes from G6PD-deficient patients may be associated with the low activity of ROS in monocytes, which exhibit reduced activity for eliminating the invaded DENV-2 in infected cells.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>The importance of host factors, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) genes, in the pathogenesis of DENV infections has been documented <a href="#pone.0001557-Kwan1">[28]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001557-LaFleur1">[29]</a>. This study demonstrates that more attention should be paid to another host genetic factor (G6PD) and to co-morbidity on both individual and community levels when DENV infection has occurred. Effort must be made to conduct an international comparative case-control study in DHF endemic or hyper-endemic countries/areas with a range of prevalence of G6PD deficiency, by measuring the viral load and immunity in G6PD-deficient patients versus controls during the infecting process at various times following infection, as well as associated clinical outcomes. The results provide a new direction for elucidating the roles of host genetic factors in the pathogenesis of DENV-related diseases.</p>

<h4>Study subjects</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>Twelve male patients with G6PD deficiency and 24 (18 male and eight female) age-matched healthy controls (with mean ages of 32.1±7.3 and 29.3±5.1<strong> </strong>years respectively, <em>P = </em>0.2), as that shown in <a href="#pone-0001557-t001">Table 1</a>, participated in the study. G6PD deficiency was defined as enzyme activity of less than the reference value (4 IU/gHb), as measured using the ELISA method <a href="#pone.0001557-Huang1">[30]</a>. The mean G6PD activity of the G6PD-deficient patients (0.5±0.9 IU/gHb) was significantly less than that of the healthy controls (12.4±2.6 IU/gHb, <em>P&lt;</em>0.01) (<a href="#pone-0001557-t001">Table 1</a>). All the 12 G6PD deficient male patients were confirmed to be G6PD deficient using the molecular-biology method as that has been described previously <a href="#pone.0001557-Huang1">[30]</a>: seven subjects carrying single-point mutation at nucleotide 1376 (G to T, Arg459Leu), four at nucleotide 1388 (G to A, Arg463His), and one at nucleotide 493 (A to G, Asn165Asp), respectively. All participants had written informed consent before their blood samples were withdrawn for further study. The protocol was also passed by the Ethical Committee of the College of Public Health at National Taiwan University. All 12 G6PD-deficient patients and the 21 healthy controls lived in northern Taiwan, with only sporadic dengue cases, but the three volunteers lived in southern Taiwan, where dengue epidemics occur more often.</p>
