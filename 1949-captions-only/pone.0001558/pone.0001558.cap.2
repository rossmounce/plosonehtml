The middle and bottom panel show simulations in case of a control program with an antiviral drug that provides complete (<em>AVE<sub>S</sub></em> = 1) and imperfect (<em>AVE<sub>S</sub></em> = 0.3, <em>AVE<sub>I</sub></em> = 0.8) protection, respectively. Black bars refer to deaths caused by type 1 infection, grey bars to deaths caused by type 2 infections, and light bars to deaths caused by antiviral prophylaxis. The grey line in the bottom panel shows the number of infected individuals who were taking antiviral prophylaxis.</p>
