                Figure 3.  The critical force of infection at which the risk of infection equals the risk of antiviral prophylaxis as a function of the horizon.The antiviral death rate is varied from γ = 0.00001 (yr−1) to γ = 0.001 (yr−1). The dotted lines show the approximation based on equation (A7) of the Supporting Information.
