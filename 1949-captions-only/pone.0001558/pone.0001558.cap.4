                Figure 4.  Simulations of an epidemic in a population of 106 individuals when the decision whether or not to take antiviral drugs is determined by the critical force of infection (Figure 3).The top and bottom panel show representative simulation runs in case of low (ρ = 1 (yr−1)) and high (ρ = 6 (yr−1)) rates of non-compliance, respectively. Other parameters are as in Table 1.
