                Figure 5.  The optimal amount of antiviral prophylaxis at equilibrium as a function of the basic reproduction number (top panel) and the antiviral death rate (bottom panel) in case of a perfect antiviral drug (AVES = 1).The top panel shows the optimal antiviral control rate from the population and individual perspective (: black dashed line; : black solid line). The grey lines give the associated excess mortality. The bottom panel shows the same quantities as a function of the antiviral death rate (Î³).
