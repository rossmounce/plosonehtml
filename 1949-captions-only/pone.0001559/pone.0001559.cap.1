<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p9"></a><p>The average length for a coding fRNA considered for functional analysis (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>) is 22.5±10.3 bps. Coding fRNAs tend to be evenly distributed within coding regions (the average relative position for a coding fRNA is 0.51±0.29 of the length of the coding region).</p>


<h4>Under-representation of coding fRNAs in yeast compared to vertebrates and <em>Drosophila</em></h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>We found that EvoFold had a greater propensity to predict coding fRNAs in vertebrates than in yeast. A previous study for conserved fRNAs in the human genome using the EvoFold program found that 23% of the predicted fRNAs were found within coding regions <a href="#pone.0001559-Pedersen1">[3]</a>. For comparison, only 18% of the comparative data set used in this study was coding regions (as measured by the proportion of phastCons elements found within coding regions) <a href="#pone.0001559-Siepel1">[13]</a>. In contrast, we found only 33% of fRNAs in coding regions of yeast, which contain 86.1% of the phastCons elements <a href="#pone.0001559-Siepel1">[13]</a>. Another way to understand this comparison is to note that 303 coding fRNAs were found in 65,348 phastCons CDS blocks in yeast while 12736 coding fRNAs were found in 23,580 phastCons CDS blocks in vertebrates <a href="#pone.0001559-Pedersen1">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001559-Siepel1">[13]</a>. Thus, in terms of the proportion of coding fRNAs to phastCons CDS blocks, coding fRNAs are about 10 times more likely to be found in vertebrates than yeast.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>It should be noted that Pedersen et al. <a href="#pone.0001559-Pedersen1">[3]</a> use a slightly different method of defining the fold location for a given fRNA secondary structure, and the phastCons elements was defined across a slightly more diverged multi-species alignment for yeast (longest unconserved divergence = 1.290, 7 species compared) than for vertebrates (longest unconserved divergence = 1.198, 5 species compared) <a href="#pone.0001559-Siepel1">[13]</a>. Still, the large difference in the abundance of coding fRNAs in vertebrates and yeast warrants future investigations of the role of coding fRNA in higher eukaryotes.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>A recent study also revealed that a significant number of coding fRNAs reside in <em>Drosophila</em> genomes, using the EvoFold program <a href="#pone.0001559-Stark1">[5]</a>. The distribution of phastCons elements in Drosophila is roughly similar to the phastCons distribution for vertebrates <a href="#pone.0001559-Siepel1">[13]</a>. Thus, it appears that coding fRNAs are less abundant in yeast compared to humans and <em>Drosophila</em>. It would be informative to conduct functional genomic analysis similar to that described in this paper on recently discovered coding fRNA predictions in higher eukaryotes to determine the role of fRNAs on coding sequence evolution.</p>


<h4>Genes with coding fRNAs enriched with specific ontology annotations</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>We analyzed the distribution of GO annotations for genes containing at least one coding fRNA, to test for possible sources of bias in the dataset and to determine whether genes containing coding fRNAs otherwise tend to be enriched with any particular biological functions. We compared the distribution of GO annotations in our dataset with that in the whole yeast genome and tested for significant deviations (<a href="#s4">Methods</a>). We found that genes containing coding fRNAs tend to be enriched with the following GO categories: various metabolic processes (amino acid (GO ID: 6519), carbohydrate (GO ID: 5975), and vitamin (GO ID: 6766)), transcription (GO ID: 6350), translation (GO ID: 6412), and transport (GO ID: 6810) (<a href="#pone-0001559-g002">Figure 2</a>). Enrichment with ribosomal genes can be problematic because of some of the unique characteristics associated with these generally well-conserved proteins <a href="#pone.0001559-Guan1">[14]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001559-Kim2">[17]</a>.</p>
