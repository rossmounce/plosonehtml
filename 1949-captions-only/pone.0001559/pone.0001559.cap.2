                Figure 2.  Distribution of GO Annotations in Strictly Defined Dataset.This figure shows the distribution of GO annotations for the set of genes containing at least one predicted fRNA fold (‘strict’) compared to the background set of genes in the yeast genome as annotated in the SGD database (‘SGD’). Some GO annotations have been abbreviated for the interest of space limitation. p-values: * = 0.05, ** = 0.01, *** = 0.001.
