Locations of RIFIN (green), STEVOR (red), and PfEMP1 (yellow) proteins are highlighted. The location of hypothetical proteins is shown in magenta. Blue color indicates “other” PEXEL-containing fragments. A neuron is assigned one particular class if more than 50% of its clustered proteins belong to one family. White neurons do not contain any proteins (“empty sequence space”). Map generated with the software SOMMER <a href="#pone.0001560-Schmuker1">[27]</a>.</p>
