                Figure 1.  SOM projection of the PEXEL containing sequence fragments from P.falciparum proteins.The SOM contains 10×15 topologically ordered data clusters (“neurons”). Locations of RIFIN (green), STEVOR (red), and PfEMP1 (yellow) proteins are highlighted. The location of hypothetical proteins is shown in magenta. Blue color indicates “other” PEXEL-containing fragments. A neuron is assigned one particular class if more than 50% of its clustered proteins belong to one family. White neurons do not contain any proteins (“empty sequence space”). Map generated with the software SOMMER [27].
