                Figure 2.  Occurrence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues up and downstream the PEXEL motif.Information plot of the PEXEL motif and surrounding residue positions in the protein families STEVOR (N = 30) (a), RIFIN (N = 125) (b) and PfEMP1 (N = 58) (c). Large values indicate sequence positions with conserved hydrophobic (H) or hydrophilic (O) residues (see text for residue classification). The position of the PEXEL motif is highlighted.
