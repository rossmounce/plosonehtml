                Figure 3.  Average position-specific hydrophobicity in 25-residue fragments containing the central PEXEL motif (at positions 11-15).Color indicates the protein family (black: PfEMP1, gray: RIFIN, light gray: STEVOR). Error bars give standard deviations. Asterisks indicate positions characteristic for one of the families. Note that the Hopp &amp; Woods scale [20] is a “hydrophilicity” scale with negative values for hydrophobic residues.
