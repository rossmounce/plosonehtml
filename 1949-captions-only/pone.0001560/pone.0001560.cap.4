In B) the blue bars show the positions of the PEXEL motif after cleaving off the predicted signal peptide. Only sequences with a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site (<em>score</em> &gt;0.5 according to SignalP <a href="#pone.0001560-Bendtsen1">[38]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001560-Nielsen1">[39]</a>) are included. Gray bars in B) represent the unchanged distribution of PEXEL in proteins lacking a predicted signal sequence. Note that all bars are displayed on top of each other.</p>
