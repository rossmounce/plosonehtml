                Figure 4.  Distribution of the first position of the PEXEL motif.A) position of the PEXEL motif in sequences of the PfEMP1 protein family (red), exported proteins with a predicted signal peptide (blue), and exported proteins lacking a predicted signal peptide (gray). In B) the blue bars show the positions of the PEXEL motif after cleaving off the predicted signal peptide. Only sequences with a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site (score &gt;0.5 according to SignalP [38], [39]) are included. Gray bars in B) represent the unchanged distribution of PEXEL in proteins lacking a predicted signal sequence. Note that all bars are displayed on top of each other.
