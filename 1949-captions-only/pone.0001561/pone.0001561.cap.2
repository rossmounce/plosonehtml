The time at which the cell leaves the TB and <em>k</em> starts decreasing is <em>t</em> = 0. The horizontal grey lines represent the <em>k</em>â€² bifurcation value below which the oscillations are arrested. All other parameters were set to the values estimated in the section on parameter estimation.</p>
