                Figure 2.  A and B, plots of N vs. t and W vs. t resulting from the numerical solution, with k = 1, of the equations corresponding to the networks in Figures 1A and 1B, respectively.C and D, plots of N vs. t and k vs. t as k decays, for the models corresponding to the networks in Figures 1A and 1B. The time at which the cell leaves the TB and k starts decreasing is t = 0. The horizontal grey lines represent the kâ€² bifurcation value below which the oscillations are arrested. All other parameters were set to the values estimated in the section on parameter estimation.
