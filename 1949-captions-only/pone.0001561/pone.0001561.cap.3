                Figure 3.  Bifurcation diagrams predicting the stationary behaviour of the models corresponding to the networks in Figures 1A (A) and 1B (B).The solid blue line denotes the N* values in a stable steady state, as a function of k; the dashed red line represents a saddle node; the dashed blue line indicates an unstable steady state inside a limit cycle; and the green dotted lines correspond to the upper and lower limits of the N* oscillations in a stable limit cycle. All other parameters were set to the values estimated in the section on parameter estimation.
