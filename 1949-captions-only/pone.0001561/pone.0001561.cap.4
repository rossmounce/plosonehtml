The simulations plotted in A were carried using the model given by Equations (1) and (3). For the simulations plotted in B we employed the model given by Equations (4) and (5), which include additional delays associated to the interactions between the Notch and FGF/Wnt pathways. In both cases, the curves corresponding to cells closer to the TB stop oscillating latter. For more clarity, the curves corresponding to the first, second and third sets of six cells are plotted in red, green, and blue, respectively. All the parameters were set to the values estimated in the section on parameter estimation.</p>
