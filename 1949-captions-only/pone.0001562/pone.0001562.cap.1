One or more domains in a protein may form modular domains and interact with other modular domains in other proteins. Dashed rectangles represent modules. In each module, one or more domains may exist and form a unit during interaction. The dashed lines represent interactions between proteins. Since the protein-protein interaction pairs A–B and C–D share common domain interaction patterns, and proteins A and C and B and D share the same interacting modular domains, we may deduce that the proteins are associated with similar functional annotations.</p>
