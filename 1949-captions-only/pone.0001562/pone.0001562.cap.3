                Figure 3.  ROC curve. Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) Function terms with probability above certain threshold are considered to be positive predictions and terms below the specified threshold are treated as negative predictions.The observed positive set of g-t association is obtained from the GO. The negative association set is defined as follows: if the association is not found in the positive set and term t is neither ancestor nor descendant of the known function terms in GO hierarchy for gene g. Therefore, true positives (TP) in this case refer to the overlaps between our positive predictions and observed positive set. True negatives (TN) are the overlaps between our negative predictions and the observed negative set. False positives describe g-t associations exist in our positive prediction list, but should be in the negative set. False negatives are g-t associations in our negative prediction list, but should be in the positive list.
