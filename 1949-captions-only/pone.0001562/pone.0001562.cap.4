                Figure 4.  Domain distribution of organisms: S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens.In our interaction data, the four organisms share 493 domains in common as shown in the figure. There are total 1603, 1489 and 1988 common domains between D. melanogaster and the other three organisms, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and Human, respectively.
