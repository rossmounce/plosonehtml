                Figure 5.  Flowchart of the CSIDOP method.The model begins with a collection of protein interaction pairs across various species and their domain and function information. For each PPI pair in the training dataset, we try to find its functional similar neighbors and form a group. Then from this group of PPIs with similar functions, we derive significant interacting domain patterns. This process is performed over all PPIs in the training dataset and in turn builds up a lookup table of patterns and associated functional assignments.
