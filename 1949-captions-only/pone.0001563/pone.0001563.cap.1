A total of 9 adverse events that were considered definitely, probably or possibly related to the vaccination occurred in 7 subjects who received the AMA1-C1 vaccine. Most (5/9) were local injection site reactions. All were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 4 days except one case of elevated ALT that persisted through the end of the follow up period. This subject was enrolled with ALT of 47.3 U/L (near the upper limit of normal range 49.6 U/L). His ALT increased to 72.8 U/L at Day 3, decreased to 59.4 U/L on Day 14 but remained slightly above the normal range throughout the follow up period. Tests for hepatitis A, B and C in this individual were repeatedly negative. As no apparent etiology was found it was classified as possibly related to the vaccination. There was no significant relationship between AMA1-C1 dose and either severity of AE overall or in any specific category of AEs. There were no severe or serious adverse event deemed related to the vaccination in any group. Three serious adverse events (one in each group) were reported. All were related to acute viral Hepatitis A (two hospitalizations and one Grade 4 elevation of ALT protocol defined as an SAE) and were considered unrelated to the vaccination.</p>
