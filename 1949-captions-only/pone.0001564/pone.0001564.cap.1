                Figure 1. (A) Eight-day survival curves of mice challenged with intra-tracheal injection of one of 5 solutions, each dosed to produce the observed mortality. Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed between the 80â€“90% mortality (Pseudomonas bacteria, Streptococcus bacteria, and Pseudomonas LPS) versus 50% mortality (Pseudomonas bacteria) versus 0% mortality groups. Blood samples were obtained at 24 hours (red arrow), a time prior to appreciable mortality. (B) Clustering of the 219 probe sets that differentiated the five treatment groups separated the probe sets into six clusters. (C) Co-expression network analysis of these six mouse gene clusters were used to explore the gene expression cartography of the leukocyte response to pneumonia. Genes in common with the human coexpression network (Figure 3B) are circled. (D) Principal components (PC) analysis of an algorithm-selected subset of the 219 probe sets whose microarray-measured RNA abundance in leukocytes isolated 24 h after the onset of pneumonia. PC2 appeared to explain in part expression signal variance due to mortality rates, while PC3 explained in part the variance due to type of insult.
