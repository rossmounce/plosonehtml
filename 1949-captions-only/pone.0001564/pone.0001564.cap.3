                Figure 3.  Analysis of 85 genes identified as significantly changing over time during the onset of VAP.(A) The time-dependent behavior of these genes was classified into four clusters. Shown is the normalized abundance of the average cluster member for each of the five microarrays that bracket the attending physician's diagnosis of VAP for each patient. (B) Co-expression network analysis of these four clusters was used to generate the gene expression cartography of the human blood response to acute infection superimposed on critical illness. Clusters 1 and 2 are tightly associated with one another, as are clusters 3 and 4. The red circles identify the 5 genes in common with the mouse coexpression network (Figure 1C). (C) Principal components analysis of the abundance of these 85 genes in the training data set (11 patients with VAP). PC1 (not shown) represents a constant bias term, PC2 and PC3 are shown. The arrow indicates where the attending physician's diagnosed VAP. The green and red circles indicate the points where the patients entered and exited the study, respectively. (D) Principal components analysis of microarray data generated by 100 iterations of randomly chosen sets of 85 genes, all plotted on the same two axes. The randomly chosen sets are not informational for healing from critical illness complicated by VAP. The only set that describes a discernable path is the list of 85 genes derived from EDGE analysis (inset magnified view, same riboleukogram data as in panel C).
