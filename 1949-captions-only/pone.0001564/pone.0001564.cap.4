                Figure 4.  Genes informational in distinguishing clinical phenotypes of interest, including host gender, age, and ethnic background, with the caveats that all African-Americans and all middle-aged individuals were female (Table 1).Note that the largest number of probe sets were associated with differences in ethnic background (African-American compared to Caucasian). Of note, as opposed to the mouse response, there we no genes that differentiated between the human response to bacterial cell wall products (Gram negative versus Gram-positive bacteria), suggesting that signal variance due to ethnic background, gender, and age is greater than that due to infecting organism.
