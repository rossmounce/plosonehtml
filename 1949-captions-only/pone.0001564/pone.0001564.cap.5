The green and red circles indicate where the patients entered and exited the study, respectively. (B) Decreases in variance (standard deviation, STD) over time for the phase space trajectory in panel A, consistent with the existence of an attractor. The diagnosis of VAP was made by the attending physician on Day 0.</p>
