                Figure 6.  Principal components analysis of 85 leukocyte genes in the training and validation patient cohorts.(A) The solid black curve depicts the aggregate riboleukogram of the first 11 VAP patients (training cohort, same data as in Figure 3C). The other 7 curves are the individual riboleukograms of the patients in the validation cohort. The inset magnifies the trajectories of patients 13–17 (see Table 1) and demonstrates abrupt changes in riboleukogram course typically coincident with an increase in CPIS score (first occurrence of maximal CPIS value is indicated by the arrows). The paths of patients 13, 18 and 19, are atypical (see text for additional details). (B) The aggregate 11 patient VAP riboleukogram (black curve, same as panel A) is compared to the aggregate riboleukogram of all patients aligned by study day (that is, training and validation cohorts, irrespective of VAP day of diagnosis, dotted blue curve). Note that the VAP riboleukogram deviates from the “critical illness” riboleukogram (black arrows) prior to VAP diagnosis (lighting bolt), but after treatment, the VAP riboleukogram converges with the critical illness riboleukogram at the point of recovery. The green and red circles indicate where the patients entered and exited the study, respectively.
