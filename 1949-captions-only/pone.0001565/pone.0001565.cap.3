                Figure 3.  SISO-aggregation allows for the generation of size-controlled aggregates.(A) hEB were generated by scraping, and SISO-aggregates were generated from input populations of 400, 2,000 and 10,000 cells in 384-well plates, and recovered by centrifugation. After imaging in phase-contrast mode, images were thresholded and cross-sectional areas were calculated using the ImageJ software package. Values obtained were extremely consistent, with coefficients of variation of 0.09, 0.06 and 0.08 respectively, vs 0.72 for the scraped hEB. (B) The base-10 logarithm of cross sectional area is plotted on a histogram, demonstrating the clear separation between aggregate sizes and dramatic increase in size control over scraping techniques.
