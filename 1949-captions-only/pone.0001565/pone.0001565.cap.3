After imaging in phase-contrast mode, images were thresholded and cross-sectional areas were calculated using the ImageJ software package. Values obtained were extremely consistent, with coefficients of variation of 0.09, 0.06 and 0.08 respectively, <em>vs</em> 0.72 for the scraped hEB. (B) The base-10 logarithm of cross sectional area is plotted on a histogram, demonstrating the clear separation between aggregate sizes and dramatic increase in size control over scraping techniques.</p>
