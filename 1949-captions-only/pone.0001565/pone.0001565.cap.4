Imaging of the silicon master, the PDMS negative cast, and the PDMS positive cast show conservation of form across these steps with wells 100, 200, 400 and 800 microns square (B). Note that the 800 micron wells were generated in the form of a truncated pyramid. Dashed yellow square represents one square millimeter. Sections of PDMS textured with 400 micron wells (C) were inserted into individual wells in a 24-well plate. A single-cell suspension of hESC grown on MEF, predifferentiated with serum for 48 hours was dispensed into the well such that each microwell was predicted to capture the desired number of cells. After 24 hours, the well contents were imaged, extracted, and re-imaged. Scale bar represents 400 microns. D. Centrifugation is not required in the presence of ROCK inhibition. Cells grown on Matrigel in defined conditions were dispensed over the microwells in the presence or absence of 10 µM of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Aggregates formed only in the presence of 10 µM of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, in the presence or absence of centrifugation. Scale bar represents 400 microns.</p>
