Aggregates formed from 2,000 hESC, imaged immediately after recovery (“day 0”)(Ai), or after 1, 2, 3 or 4 days respectively (Aii-Av). Note self organization into an ordered domain (white arrow) and a disordered domain (black arrow), and progressive encirclement of the ordered domain by the disordered domain over time (red arrows). Scale bar represents 500 microns. B. An aggregate fixed on day 3 of differentiation exhibits Oct4 positive nuclei (red) located basally within the cell over a laminin-containing basement membrane (green) in the ordered domain, with morphologically distinct Oct4 negative cells located outside the membrane in the disordered domain (counterstained with Hoechst, blue). Scale bar represents 50 microns. C. A day 5 aggregate exhibits staining for the endodermal marker GATA-6 (green) in the encircling disordered domain, and the pluripotency marker Oct4 (red) within the ordered domain. Note the tendancy of the Oct4 positive nuclei to align along the interface between the two tissue types, and a tendancy towards columnar morphology (white arrow), both characteristics of epiblast tissue, and the absence of mixing between the two cell types. The actin cytoskeleton, probed with phalloidin, is shown in blue. Scale bar represents 50 microns. D–F. Day 3 aggregates, showing staining for the endodermal markers GATA4, GATA6, AFP and FoxA2, the primitive-endoderm marker Sox7, and FGF5, a marker characteristic of epiblast and overlying VE. Scale bars represent 50 microns.</p>
