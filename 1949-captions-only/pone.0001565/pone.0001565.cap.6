A) two frames from a video recording of a contractile aggregate, shown before (Ai) and during (Aii) a contraction. Panel Aiii is derived by subtracting panel Ai from panel Aii. The contraction trace (B) was generated by integrating the subtraction image derived from successive frames in the video over the area of contraction, and plotting a 5-point moving average. Neural rosettes (C) were observed after 11 days in culture (4 days in suspension followed by 7 days adherent), staining positive for Pax6 (shown in green) and Sox2 (shown in red). Hematopoetic differentiation was observed after 28 days using Cytospin (D), CFC (E) and flow cytometric (F) assays. G. Quantitative RT-PCR results from aggregates formed from 10,000 pre-differentiated cells in the absence of ROCK inhibition, differentiated for 4 days in suspension followed by an additional 3 days in adherent culture shows down-regulation of pluripotency genes, and up-regulation of markers for endodermal, ectodermal and mesodermal lineages. H. Quantitative RT-PCR results from aggregates formed from 4,000 untreated cells in the presence of ROCK inhibition, differentiated for 4 days in suspension, showed upregulation of mesodermal and endodermal markers, including markers for mesendodermal precursors, but only limited upregulation of the primitive endoderm marker Sox7.</p>
