                Figure 1.  Alternative editing of ND7 mRNAs.A) Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of ND7 and the alternatively edited ND7 cDNAs ND7-G10 and ND7-N12. Amino acids changed by alternative editing are in blue. B) Bar depicts the alternatively edited mRNA sequences ND7-G10 and ND7-N12. Alignment of the RNA sequences for ND7, ND7-N12 and ND7-G10 from the alternatively edited regions I, II and III are shown below the bar. In black are the pre-edited residues, in grey the bona fide edited residues and in red are the alternatively edited residues from regions Iâ€“III. Above the RNA sequences are the corresponding amino acid sequences. A predicted gRNA for N12 shows perfect complementarity (allowing for G:U) to ND7-N12 over 30 base pairs while having mismatches to the ND7 sequence at nucleotide positions 10 and 14 of the gRNA. Vertical bars indicate A:U or G:C base pairing; crosses indicates G:U base pairing. Underlined sequence shows UAG termination codon. Star depicts amber codon in the amino acid sequence. Red Us indicate alternatively inserted/not inserted Us when compared with the ND7 sequence.
