B) Bar depicts the mRNA sequence ND8-F04. Alignment of the RNA sequences for ND8, and ND8-F04 from the alternatively edited regions I, and II are shown below the bar. In black are the pre-edited residues, in grey the <em>bona fide</em> edited residues and in red are the alternatively edited residues from regions Iâ€“II. In black is the pre-edited, in grey the <em>bona fide</em> edited region and in red are the alternatively edited regions I and II. Alternative start codons UUG and GUG are shown in black and purple, respectively. Alignment of the RNA sequence of ND8 and cDNA ND8-F04 from the alternatively edited region I and II (red). Depicted above the RNA sequences are the corresponding amino acid sequences. Predicted gRNA for region I showing perfect complementarity (allowing for G:U) to ND8-F04 over 41 base pairs while having three mismatches to the ND8 sequence at positions 38 to 40 of the gRNA. Vertical bars indicate A:U or G:C base pairing; crosses indicates G:U base pairing. Red Us indicate alternatively inserted Us when compared with the <em>bona fide</em> ND8 sequence. Star depicts termination codon in the amino acid sequence. Underlined sequence depicts stop codon in the nucleotide sequence.</p>
