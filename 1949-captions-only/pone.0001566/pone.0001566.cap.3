                Figure 3.  Alternative editing of ND9 mRNA.A) Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of ND9 and the alternatively edited cDNA ND9-F12. Amino acids changed by alternative editing are in blue. B) Bar depicts the ND9-F12 mRNA. Alignment of the RNA sequences for ND9, and ND9-F12 from the alternatively edited region are shown below the bar. In black are the pre-edited residues, in grey the bona fide edited residues and in red are the alternatively edited residues. The initiation codon GUG is shown in black on the bar. Above the RNA sequences are the corresponding amino acid sequences. Predicted gRNA for ND9-F12 shows perfect complementarity (allowing for G:U) to F12 over 44 base pairs while having 14 mismatches to the ND9 sequence in the best possible alignment (not shown). Vertical bars indicate A:U or G:C base pairing; crosses indicates G:U base pairing. Star indicates a termination codon. Red Us indicate alternatively inserted Us when compared with the ND9 sequence.
