B) Bar represents the mRNA sequence of COXIII-K12. 5′ and 3′ region are connected by a thin line. Alignment of the RNA sequences for COIII, and COIII-K12 from the alternatively edited regions I, II, III and IV are shown below the bar. In black are the pre-edited residues, in grey the <em>bona fide</em> edited residues and in red are the alternatively edited residues from regions I–IV. The UUG initiation codon is shown in black. Alignment of the RNA sequence of COXIII and cDNA K12 from the alternatively edited region I–IV (red). Above the RNA sequences are the corresponding amino acid sequences of K12 and COXIII. Predicted gRNA sequence shows perfect complementarity (allowing for G:U) to K12 over 51 base pairs while having one mismatch to the COXIII sequence at position 38 of the gRNA. Vertical bars indicate A:U or G:C base pairing; crosses indicates G:U base pairing. Red Us indicate alternatively inserted Us when compared with the COXIII sequence. Star depicts termination codon in the amino acid sequence. Underlined sequence depicts stop codon in the nucleotide sequence.</p>
