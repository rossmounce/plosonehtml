B) Alignment of the RNA sequences for A6, and A6-D08 from the alternatively edited regions I, and II are shown below the bar. In black are the pre-edited residues, in grey the <em>bona fide</em> edited residues and in red are the alternatively edited residues from regions Iâ€“III.Bar represents the mRNA sequence of A6-D08. The UUG initiation codon is shown in black. Alignment of the RNA sequence of A6 and A6-D08 from the alternatively edited regions I, II and III (red). Depicted above the RNA sequences are the corresponding amino acid sequences of D08 and A6. The predicted gRNA shows perfect complementarity (allowing for G:U) to A6-D08 over 40 base pairs while having two mismatches to the A6 sequence at position 26-27 of the gRNA. Vertical bars indicate A:U or G:C base pairing; crosses indicates G:U base pairing. Red Us indicate alternatively inserted Us when compared with the A6 sequence. Star shows termination codon in the amino acid sequence.</p>
