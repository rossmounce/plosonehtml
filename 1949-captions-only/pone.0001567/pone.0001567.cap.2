This, in contrast to the direct depiction of MyoD phylogenetic relationships (<a href="#pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1</a>), suggests that a <em>myod-</em>containing chromosome duplicated in a common teleost ancestor. Genes are not scaled by size and are represented by arrows (identifying the direction of transcription) coloured by their orthology to human genes. Black arrowheads represent genes not conserved between humans and other species on the chromosomal region investigated. Double diagonal lines represent a gap of more than three genes. Teleost genes found on the two paralogous chromosomal regions are marked with a black star. The black arrow on zebrafish chromosome 7 marks the putative position where <em>myod2</em> was non-functionalised. Teleost genes orthologous to those on zebrafish chromosomes 25 and 7 are respectively designated as Gene-1 and Gene-2, to identify their common paralogy. Multiple tandem <em>tropI</em> genes present on duplicated teleost chromosomes are labelled as <em>a, b, c</em> based on their left to right position and not by their inferred paralogy/orthology from phylogenetic reconstruction (<a href="#pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3d</a>).</p>
