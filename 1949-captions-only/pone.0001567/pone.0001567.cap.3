                Figure 3.  Unrooted phylogenetic cladograms for amino acid translations of genes in proximity to tetrapod myod that are conserved as two copies on two paralagous chromosomal regions in teleosts.Branch confidence values from different phylogenetic reconstruction methods are shown in the order they are bracketed. (a) Kcnc1 (Bayesian/ML topology). (b) Nucb2 (Bayesian/ML topology). (c) Plekha7 (Bayesian/ML topology). (d) TropI (Bayesian/ML topology). (e) Tph1 (Bayesian/ML topology). (f) Tph1 (topology corrected for mutational saturation). * represents a chromosomal duplication event arising in a common teleost ancestor. *(T1) represents the presumed first tandem duplication of tropI. Branch confidence values &gt;50% from the different reconstruction methods are shown.
