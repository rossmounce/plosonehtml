The imposed ‘correct’ starting tree topology supported the teleost WGD event (Acanthopterygii MyoD2 branching internally to tetrapod MyoD sequences, but externally to teleost MyoD1 sequences) and PhyML was used to refine branch lengths only. The ‘correct’ topology for other MyoD duplication events (in <em>X. Laevis</em> and Atlantic salmon) was as observed in trees in <a href="#pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1a–d</a>. Branch lengths (substitutions per site) are shown above each branch.</p>
