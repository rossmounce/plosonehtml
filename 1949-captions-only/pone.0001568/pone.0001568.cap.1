The dashed markers identify age contrasts that are limited by severe ceiling effects, that is, where performance of at least one of the groups is over 0.90, and the size of age declines is severely underestimated. <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1d</a> indicates that the summary effect sizes in <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1a</a>, as well as individual effect sizes in the forest plots of <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1b and 1c</a>, substantially underestimate the true effect size simply due to an artificial limit on the effect size due to severe ceiling effects. The dashed markers in <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1e</a> identify studies that confounded age with experimental design (i.e., ongoing task was easier for older versus younger adults), and therefore, artificially reduced the size of observed age declines. <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1f</a> shows that when ceiling limited and age-confounded age contrasts are removed from the Henry et al. <a href="#pone.0001568-Henry1">[14]</a> meta-analysis, we are left with only two low- and two high-demand age contrasts (see <a href="#pone-0001568-g001">Figure 1f</a>) arising from two experiments from a single article by Einstein, Smith, McDaniel, and Shaw <a href="#pone.0001568-Einstein3">[20]</a>. Unfortunately, careful reading of the <a href="#s2">method</a> section reveals that Einstein et al. <a href="#pone.0001568-Einstein3">[20]</a> did not include any delay between ProM instructions and task performance, and thus, performance reflects vigilance rather than ProM proper.</p>
