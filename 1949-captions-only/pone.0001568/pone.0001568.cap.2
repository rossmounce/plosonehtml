Ignoring the obvious ceiling effects, Henry et al. reported an effect size of <em>r</em> = 0 for the low demand condition and an effect size of <em>r</em> = −0.47 for the high demand condition (see Appendix A, Henry et al. <a href="#pone.0001568-Henry1">[14]</a>). Similarly, the right panel reveals a similar ceiling effect problem with the study by Park et al. <a href="#pone.0001568-Park1">[19]</a> included in this same meta-analysis.</p>
