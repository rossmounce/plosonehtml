                Figure 2.  The left panel shows raw non-standardized performance by younger and older adults in low and high demand conditions in Kidder et al. [18], one of the studies included in Henry et al. [14] meta-analysis.The figure makes it obvious that performance in “low” demand conditions was so high as to be nearly perfect whereas performance in “high” demand conditions was generally lower. Ignoring the obvious ceiling effects, Henry et al. reported an effect size of r = 0 for the low demand condition and an effect size of r = −0.47 for the high demand condition (see Appendix A, Henry et al. [14]). Similarly, the right panel reveals a similar ceiling effect problem with the study by Park et al. [19] included in this same meta-analysis.
