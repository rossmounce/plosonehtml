                Figure 3.  A typical situation requiring ProM proper (prospective memory proper) is to buy groceries en route home from work.We make a plan to buy groceries but then we go about our daily activities and do not maintain the plan in consciousness. The function of prospective memory proper is to bring the plan back to consciousness at the right time and place, when we are approaching the ProM cue, a supermarket.
