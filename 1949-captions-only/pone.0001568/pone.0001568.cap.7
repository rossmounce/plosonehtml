Panel A highlights that the size of age declines measured by effect size index <em>d<sub>p</sub></em> decreases as performance of older adults increases, as the test becomes easier and data are more afflicted by ceiling effects. Panel B demonstrates this deleterious effect of ceiling effects on <em>d<sub>p</sub></em> using much larger data set identified for the current study. Panel C highlights that even age declines measured by <em>d<sub>probit</sub></em> are dependent on the test difficulty but, consistent with previous simulations <a href="#pone.0001568-SanchezMeca1">[43]</a>, less so. Finally, Panel D highlights that <em>d<sub>p</sub></em> underestimates the size of age decline relative to <em>d<sub>probit</sub></em>; age declines measured by <em>d<sub>p</sub></em> are smaller then age declines measured by <em>d<sub>probit</sub></em>.</p>
