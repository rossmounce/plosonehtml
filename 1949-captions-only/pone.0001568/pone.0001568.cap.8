                Figure 8.  The pattern of age declines and improvements across the adult lifespan.Panel A shows performance on event cued prospective memory proper assessed using dichotomous measures in laboratory settings for three studies free of age-related confounds (in green: D'87 = Dobbs &amp; Rule [38]; in dark green: S'04 = Salthouse et al. [50]; in blue: U'01 = Uttl et al. [11], N = name task, L = letter task, C = envelope task) and two population-based studies where age was confounded with increased occurrence of dementia (in orange: M'97 = Mantyla &amp; Nilsson [61]; in purple: H'00 = Huppert, Johnson, &amp; Nickson [52]). The D'87 and S'04 data are not interpretable for younger adults due to severe ceiling effects but the data from all studies show clear age-related declines for adults older than 60â€“70 years. Panel B shows performance on event-cued prospective memory proper assessed using two continuous measures (visual in red and auditory in blue) in laboratory settings. The data are not limited by ceiling or floor effects and suggest that there are no or only minimal changes in EC prospective memory proper from approximately 20 to 60 years of age followed by age-related declines. Panel C shows performance on event-cued vigilance assessed using dichotomous measures in laboratory settings from a single study by Salthouse et al. [50]. Similarly to the EC prospective memory proper dichotomous data, the vigilance data for younger age groups (i.e., 20 to 70 years of age) are not interpretable because of the ceiling effects but the data for older adults (over 70 years of age) show age-related declines. Panel D shows performance on time cued prospective memory proper (red) and on event cued prospective memory proper assessed in natural settings (blue). The L'90 (TC; Levy &amp; Clark [69]) data show performance increases with aging whereas the D'87 (EC; Dobbs &amp; Rule [38]) data show performance decreases with aging.
