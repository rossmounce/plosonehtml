                Figure 9.  The graphical analysis of the data reported in McDaniel and Einstein's Table 7.4 (p. 143â€“156) [6]; it shows performance of older adults plotted against performance of younger adults, for focal and non-focal ProM cues.The figure includes ds derived by graphical modeling methods including 95% confidence intervals derived by bootstrapping methods. The blue circles indicate contrasts free of age confounds (i.e., ongoing task and intelligence confound) and red squares indicate contrasts with ongoing task, intelligence, or both confounds favoring older adults. The figure highlights substantial age-related declines in ProM with both focal and non-focal cues even for this very selective and biased sample (see text for the explanation) of previously published data reported by McDaniel and Einstein [6], lending no support to their claims that aging does not affect prospective memory.
