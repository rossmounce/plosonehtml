                Figure 1.  K-RTA inhibits EBV lytic gene expression.A. K-RTA inhibits the EBV lytic gene expression in Akata cells. Akata (EBV+/KSHV-) cells were transfected with K-RTA or vector plasmid (5 µg DNA). EBV lytic replication was induced by anti-human-IgGs a day later (0, 1, 5, 10 µg/ml). Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred, and used for western blot analysis. The identity of proteins is as shown. B. K-RTA inhibits the EBV lytic gene expression in AGS-BX11g cells. AGS-BX11g (EBV+/KSHV−) cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing K-RTA or GFP (10 pfu/cell). EBV lytic replication was induced by TPA a day later. Lysates were used for western blot analysis. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with other antibodies. One representative from three experiments is shown. The identity of proteins is as shown.
