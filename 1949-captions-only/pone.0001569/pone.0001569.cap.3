Co-localization of K-RTA and EBV-Z in dually infected cells. BC1 (KSHV+/EBV+) cells were treated with TPA (10 ng/ml) first for one day and then butyrate (0.5 mM) for another day. Cells were fixed and stained with K-RTA (rabbit) and EBV-Z (mouse) antibodies. Cy5- and Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies were used to distinguish the signals from K-RTA and EBV-Z, respectively. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei. The colors were artificially mounted to facilitate viewing. Red, K-RTA; green, EBV-Z; blue, nuclei; (a)K-RTA signal only; (b) EBV-Z signal only; (c) nuclei only; (d) K-RTA, EBV-Z, and nucleus signals are mixed. The pictures of higher power are shown on the bottom. In Panels B and C, cell extracts from treated BC1 cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-EBV-Z or normal mouse serum (Panel B). Cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-K-RTA or normal rabbit serum (Panel C). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. The whole cell lysates of induced BC1 cells were used as positive controls in Panels B and C. In Panel D, whole cell lysates was used for western blot analyses. The identity of the respective proteins is denoted. n.s., non-specific. Molecular weight (MW) makers are shown on the left in kilo-Dalton (kDa).</p>
