Schematic diagram of K-RTA domains and mutants. The DNA binding domain, leucine heptapeptide repeat region (LR), activation domain, and nuclear localization signal (NLS) are shown. The drawing is not on scale. In Panels B, C, and D, 293T cells were transfected with of the designated expression plasmids as shown on the top of the Figure. Cell extracts from these transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-EBV-Z (Panel B) or anti-K-RTA (Panel C). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot (WB) using the indicated antibodies. In Panel D, whole cell lysate was used for western blot analyses. The identity of the respective proteins is denoted. E. Interaction between K-RTA and EBV-Z is required for K-RTA-mediated inhibition. 80 ng of K-RTA or K-RTA-DLR expression plasmids were transfected with various amounts of EBV-Z expression plasmid into BZLF1-KO (EBV+/KSHVâˆ’) cells as shown on the top. Lysates were used for western blot analysis 24 hours later. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with other antibodies. The identity of proteins is as shown.</p>
