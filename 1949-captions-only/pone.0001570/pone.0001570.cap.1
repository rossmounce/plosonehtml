                Figure 1.  Temporal expression patterns were constructed from 54 P. falciparum and P. yoelii life cycle samples.A total of 156 statistically enriched gene clusters identified by OPI analysis illustrates the transcription regulation characteristics of all key biological processes in Plasmodium species. Their yeast and human orthologs contents are represented by the white-blue heatmap, indicating parasite-specific processes generally found fewer orthologs in model organisms. The percentage of proteins that form statistically significant within-cluster networks are also white-blue color coded; most networks occur in blood stage processes. Altogether 33 manuscripts were identified with significant overlap to the clusters, nine of which [13], [27], [28], [36], [42], [60], [68], [69], [70] are referenced in the figure. Two clusters were enriched for proteins predicted to have a parasite export signal [68] and were labeled as “Exported proteins (sporozoite)” and “Exported proteins (trophozoite)”—one of which peaks in the trophozoite stage and a second which peaks in sporozoite stages (see GO:PM15591202_Trp and GO:PM15591202_Spo in Table S1-S2). S &amp; T indicate that the P. falciparum parasites were synchronized within the asexual cycle by the thermocycling or sorbitol method [9]. The figure does not comprehensively describe all gene expression patterns contained within the data as there are ~1,026 genes which are not found in any of the groups depicted here because they do not share expression patterns with a sufficient number of previously characterized genes.
