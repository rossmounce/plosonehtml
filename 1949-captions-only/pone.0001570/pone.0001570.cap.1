Their yeast and human orthologs contents are represented by the white-blue heatmap, indicating parasite-specific processes generally found fewer orthologs in model organisms. The percentage of proteins that form statistically significant within-cluster networks are also white-blue color coded; most networks occur in blood stage processes. Altogether 33 manuscripts were identified with significant overlap to the clusters, nine of which <a href="#pone.0001570-Matuschewski1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Khan1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Cowman1">[28]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Surolia1">[36]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Raibaud1">[42]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Young1">[60]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Marti1">[68]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Ling1">[69]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001570-Doolan1">[70]</a> are referenced in the figure. Two clusters were enriched for proteins predicted to have a parasite export signal <a href="#pone.0001570-Marti1">[68]</a> and were labeled as “Exported proteins (sporozoite)” and “Exported proteins (trophozoite)”—one of which peaks in the trophozoite stage and a second which peaks in sporozoite stages (see GO:PM15591202_Trp and GO:PM15591202_Spo in <a href="#pone.0001570.s001">Table S1</a>-<a href="#pone.0001570.s002">S2</a>). S &amp; T indicate that the <em>P. falciparum</em> parasites were synchronized within the asexual cycle by the thermocycling or sorbitol method <a href="#pone.0001570-LeRoch1">[9]</a>. The figure does not comprehensively describe all gene expression patterns contained within the data as there are ~1,026 genes which are not found in any of the groups depicted here because they do not share expression patterns with a sufficient number of previously characterized genes.</p>
