Approach B, NCBI database mining: B1) Mapping between GenBank sequence entries and PubMed entries were systematically retrieved from NCBI for four <em>Plasmodium</em> species; B2) Sequences were mapped to malaria locus names by BLAST alignment. The pipeline resulted in 6,428 functional associations between 3,262 malaria proteins and 1,278 PubMed papers.</p>
