                Figure 1.  Sirt1 deficiency effects spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis.A. Cross section of ovaries from sibling female Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice following superovulation. Mature oocytes are indicated by arrowheads. B. Average number of oocytes for female Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice (n = 10; P&gt;0.1). C. Cross section of testis and epididymis from sibling male Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice. D. Average number of sperm from the cauda epididymis for male Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice (n = 3 sibling pairs). P values for comparison of average counts (student's t Test) are shown. E. Analysis of sperm morphology. Total epididymal sperm were fixed to slides and stained with Diff-Quik staining media. Sperm with misshapen heads are indicated by arrowheads. F. Frequency of abnormal sperm from epididymis of Sirt1−/− mice. The number of abnormal sperm for Sirt1+/− mice was &lt;&lt;1%. In all analyses, mice were 8 weeks of age.
