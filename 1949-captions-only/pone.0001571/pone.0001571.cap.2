                Figure 2.  Spermatogenic stem cell numbers are reduced in Sirt1 deficient embryos.A. Sirt1+/− mice were back-crossed with Oct4-GFP transgenic mice to generate Sirt1+/− mice that were homozygous for the Oct4-GFP transgene. These mice were then bred, and gonads were isolated from d15.5 male embryos. Single cell suspensions were prepared for each gonad sample, and the frequency of GFP+ cells was assessed using FACS (see Materials and Methods and reference 23 for further details). The genotype of each sample was confirmed retrospectively using PCR. Sample FACS plots for a Sirt1−/− and sibling Sirt1+/− male embryo are shown. B. Average frequency of GFP+ cells per embryo for Sirt1+/− or Sirt1+/− or Sirt1+/+ embryos (Sirt1−/−, n = 4; Sirt1+/− and Sirt1+/+, n = 8). Note, no significant difference in GFP+ frequency was observed for Sirt1+/− and Sirt1+/+ mice (data not shown).
