                Figure 3.  DNA damage is elevated in sperm from Sirt1 deficient mice.A. Image of sperm nuclei from Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice stained with Sybr-Green following single cell alkaline electrophoresis (Comet assay). The Comet assay was performed using the Trevigen comet assay kit. Sperm with extended comet tails are indicated with arrowheads. B. Frequency of sperm with extended Comet tails for pairs of sibling Sirt1+/− and Sirt1−/− mice (n = 2).
