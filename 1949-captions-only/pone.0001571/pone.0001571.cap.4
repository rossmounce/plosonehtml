                Figure 4.  Heat map representation of differentially expressed genes in the testis of Sirt1 deficient mice.Rows represent genes and columns represent array comparisons of Sirt1−/− and Sirt1+/− RNA samples as indicated. Green indicates genes that are up-regulated in the Sirt1−/− testis samples. Columns labeled in blue are analyses done using dye reversal. Only differentially expressed genes showing an average of 1.7 or greater fold change in expression across at least 5 of the 6 arrays analyzed are included in this analysis.
