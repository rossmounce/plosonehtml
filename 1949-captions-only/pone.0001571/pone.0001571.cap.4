Green indicates genes that are up-regulated in the Sirt1−/− testis samples. Columns labeled in blue are analyses done using dye reversal. Only differentially expressed genes showing an average of 1.7 or greater fold change in expression across at least 5 of the 6 arrays analyzed are included in this analysis.</p>
