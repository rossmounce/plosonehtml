                Figure 5.  Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expression of the top 10 up and down regulated genes in the testis of Sirt1 deficient mice.The relative expression level of the top 10 differentially expressed genes, both up and down regulated (see Suppl. Table S1), was assessed using real-time RT-PCR for the Sirt1−/− and Sirt1+/− RNA samples. All PCR primers were designed to flank the most 3′ intron, and were shown to yield a single PCR product in the size range of 100–150 bp. Each analysis was performed intriplicate, and error bars representing standard deviation are shown. Expression level for qRT-PCR analysis is shown relative to the level of expression of Hprt.
