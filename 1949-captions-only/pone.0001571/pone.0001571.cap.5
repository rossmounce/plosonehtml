All PCR primers were designed to flank the most 3′ intron, and were shown to yield a single PCR product in the size range of 100–150 bp. Each analysis was performed intriplicate, and error bars representing standard deviation are shown. Expression level for qRT-PCR analysis is shown relative to the level of expression of Hprt.</p>
