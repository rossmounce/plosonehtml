We used the search term ““palm oil” or “oil palm”” and viewed the resulting 3056 publications between 1970 and 2006, recording the number found and classifying them according to their main research focus as interpreted through their title, abstract, key words, journal title and subject classification. It was therefore possible to visualize how the focus of oil palm research has changed since 1970. The number of oil palm publications was compared to the number of publications on agriculture (search term: “agriculture”) and to global palm oil production. We also compared the number of publications across the main vegetable oil crops (search term: ““vegetable crop name” and “oil””) with global oil production.</p>

In contrast, the number of publications relative to oil palm production has shown a net decrease (<a href="#pone-0001572-g002">Fig 2</a>). Despite being a major source of vegetable oil worldwide, oil palm has attracted relatively little research interest compared to other oil crops. Palm oil and soyabean contribute over 60% to the world's vegetable oil production but have less than 10% of the research interest (<a href="#pone-0001572-g003">Fig. 3</a>). Over the last 35 years, the major focus of oil palm research has been its uses in food and the resultant health issues (22.19% of total, 678 publications). In the last ten years there has been a marked increase in the number of publications on i) byproducts from the oil palm industry, ii) chemistry, engineering and biotechnology, and iii) the production of biofuel. The number of publications on biodiversity (0.75% of total, 23 publications) and other environmental issues (2.06% of total, 63 publications) has been extremely low (<a href="#pone-0001572-g004">Fig. 4</a>).</p>
