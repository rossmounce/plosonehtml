                Figure 1.  The σE-dependent extracytoplasmic stress response.σE is held at the membrane by the antisigma factor RseA. RseB binds to the periplasmic domain of RseA and protects RseA from proteolysis. Unfolded OMPs activate the protease DegS, which cleaves the periplasmic domain of RseA. The partially degraded RseA is now a substrate for RseP. RseP cleaves RseA further, releasing the cytoplasmic domain of RseA bound to σE. This remaining domain of RseA is degraded by ClpXP thereby freeing σE to interact with RNA polymerase and direct transcription of its regulon. The major classes of known genes in the σE regulon are indicated. The alarmone ppGpp and protein DksA can activate σE-dependent transcription once σE is released from RseA, but are not shown for clarity. (IM inner membrane, OM outer membrane).
