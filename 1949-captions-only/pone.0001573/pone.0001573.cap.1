RseB binds to the periplasmic domain of RseA and protects RseA from proteolysis. Unfolded OMPs activate the protease DegS, which cleaves the periplasmic domain of RseA. The partially degraded RseA is now a substrate for RseP. RseP cleaves RseA further, releasing the cytoplasmic domain of RseA bound to σ<sup>E</sup>. This remaining domain of RseA is degraded by ClpXP thereby freeing σ<sup>E</sup> to interact with RNA polymerase and direct transcription of its regulon. The major classes of known genes in the σ<sup>E</sup> regulon are indicated. The alarmone ppGpp and protein DksA can activate σ<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription once σ<sup>E</sup> is released from RseA, but are not shown for clarity.
