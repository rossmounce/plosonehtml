IPTG was added at OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.1 to induce overexpression of <em>rseA</em> and <em>rseB</em>, indicated by the arrow. (A) σ<sup>E</sup> was inhibited by overexpression of <em>rseA</em> and <em>rseB</em>, but not <em>rseA</em>D11H and <em>rseB</em>, as shown by β-galactosidase activity measured from the σ<sup>E</sup>-dependent <em>rpoH</em>P3-<em>lacZ</em> reporter. Miller units (open symbols, right axis) and OD<sub>600</sub> (closed symbols, left axis) are plotted at each time point. (B) Overexpression of <em>rseA</em> and <em>rseB</em>, but not <em>rseA</em>D11H and <em>rseB</em>, caused a reduction in the colony forming units and optical density. OD<sub>600</sub> (closed symbols, left axis) and cfu/ml (open symbols, right axis) were measured throughout the growth curve. A representative experiment is shown in both panels.</p>
