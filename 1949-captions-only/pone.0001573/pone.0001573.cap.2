                Figure 2.  Inhibition of σE activity caused cell death.Strains SEA007 (squares, pRseAB), SEA008 (circles, pTrc99a vector control), and SEA4044 (triangles, pRseAD11H) were grown in LB at 30°C with shaking in a gyrotary waterbath. IPTG was added at OD600 ~0.1 to induce overexpression of rseA and rseB, indicated by the arrow. (A) σE was inhibited by overexpression of rseA and rseB, but not rseAD11H and rseB, as shown by β-galactosidase activity measured from the σE-dependent rpoHP3-lacZ reporter. Miller units (open symbols, right axis) and OD600 (closed symbols, left axis) are plotted at each time point. (B) Overexpression of rseA and rseB, but not rseAD11H and rseB, caused a reduction in the colony forming units and optical density. OD600 (closed symbols, left axis) and cfu/ml (open symbols, right axis) were measured throughout the growth curve. A representative experiment is shown in both panels.
