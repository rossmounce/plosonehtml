                Figure 3.  Diagram of stress regulators and their respective regulon members used as reporters in this work.All reporter constructs are present as lacZ fusions integrated as a single-copy in the chromosome. The rpoHP3-lacZ fusion is regulated by σE. The degP-lacZ fusion is regulated by σE and CpxR. The cpxP-lacZ fusion is regulated by CpxR. The spy-lacZ fusion is regulated by CpxR and BaeR. The rprA-lacZ fusion is regulated by RcsB. The htpG-lacZ fusion is regulated by σ32. σE, Cpx, Bae, and Rcs all monitor envelope stress, while σ32 monitors cytoplasmic stress.
