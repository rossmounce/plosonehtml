The <em>rpoH</em>P3-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by σ<sup>E</sup>. The <em>degP</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by σ<sup>E</sup> and CpxR. The <em>cpxP</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by CpxR. The <em>spy</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by CpxR and BaeR. The <em>rprA</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by RcsB. The <em>htpG</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion is regulated by σ<sup>32</sup>. σ<sup>E</sup>, Cpx, Bae, and Rcs all monitor envelope stress, while σ<sup>32 </sup>monitors cytoplasmic stress.</p>
