                Figure 4.  Envelope stress responses are activated following inhibition of σE.β-galactosidase activity was measured from the htpG-lacZ (σ32, SEA4183), cpxP-lacZ (Cpx, SEA4177), rprA-lacZ (Rcs, SEA4190), and spy-lacZ (Cpx and Bae, SEA4187) reporters. The fold change in Miller units (M.U.) with and without rseA and rseB overexpression (M.U. with IPTG/M.U. no ITPG) is shown for samples taken at 0 (white), 1 (grey), 2 (blue), 2.5 (red), and 3 (black) hours after addition of IPTG.
