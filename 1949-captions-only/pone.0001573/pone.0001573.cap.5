                Figure 5.  Fractionation of strain SEA007 lysates with and without inhibition of σE on sucrose density gradients.At 2.5 hours following inhibition of σE, cells were harvested and lysates separated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Lysates from comparable numbers of cells (as determined by OD600) were loaded on the gradients. (A) Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels of gradient fractions from the control culture (top) and culture in which σE activity was inhibited (bottom). M denotes molecular weight markers. (B) β-NADH oxidase activity (closed symbols) and specific gravity (open symbols) of the fractions in (A), inhibition of σE (circles) and control (squares). (C) Western blots using polyclonal antibodies to detect FtsH (inner membrane) and FepA (outer membrane) in fractions from (A), control (top panels) and inhibition of σE (bottom panels). L denotes whole-cell lysates before fractionation.
