Lysates from comparable numbers of cells (as determined by OD<sub>600</sub>) were loaded on the gradients. (A) Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels of gradient fractions from the control culture (top) and culture in which σ<sup>E</sup> activity was inhibited (bottom). M denotes molecular weight markers. (B) β-NADH oxidase activity (closed symbols) and specific gravity (open symbols) of the fractions in (A), inhibition of σ<sup>E</sup> (circles) and control (squares). (C) Western blots using polyclonal antibodies to detect FtsH (inner membrane) and FepA (outer membrane) in fractions from (A), control (top panels) and inhibition of σ<sup>E</sup> (bottom panels). L denotes whole-cell lysates before fractionation.</p>
