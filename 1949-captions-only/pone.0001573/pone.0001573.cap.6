                Figure 6.  Cell envelope defects resulting from inhibition of σE.Cultures of SEA007 and SEA008 were grown as in Fig. 2. Samples were taken approximately 2.5 hrs. after induction of rseA and rseB overexpression. (A–D) Images of live cells are shown using differential interference microscopy (DIC, column 1) and fluorescence microscopy following addition of FM4-64 to visualize membranes (red, column 2), DAPI to visualize DNA (blue, column 3), and expression of YFP to visualize the cytoplasm (green, column 4). The three fluorescent micrographs are overlaid in column 5. (A) Images of the SEA008 control strain in which σE was not inhibited are shown. (B–D) Images of SEA007 following σE inhibition, reveal blebs that contain YFP and stain with DAPI (B and C) and that contain YFP but do not stain with DAPI (D). In (D), the arrow marks a bleb lacking DAPI staining and the arrowhead marks a lysed cell that retained DAPI staining, but lost YFP. Scale bars are 2 µm. Over 1,000 cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and typical micrographs are represented here. Scanning electron micrographs (E) and transmission electron micrographs (F) of SEA007 following σE inhibition. Scale bars are 1 µm. No blebs were seen on cells in control cultures.
