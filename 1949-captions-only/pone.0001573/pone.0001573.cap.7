                Figure 7.  Overexpression of ptsN reduces cell envelope stress.β-galactosidase activity from the rpoHP3-lacZ (σE, SEA4254), degP-lacZ (σE and Cpx, SEA4181), cpxP-lacZ (Cpx, SEA4179), rprA-lacZ (Rcs, SEA4199), spy-lacZ (Cpx and Bae, SEA4189), and htpG-lacZ (σ32, SEA4185) fusions was measured in overnight cultures, with and without overexpression of ptsN. Activity of each lacZ fusion was normalized to that of cultures with no ptsN overexpression and set to 100%. Average values and standard deviations from a minimum of 3 experiments are shown.
