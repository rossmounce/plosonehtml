                Figure 8.   ptsN requires known regulators to reduce stress sensed by the σE, Rcs, and Cpx envelope stress pathways.In each panel the β-galactosidase activity was measured with and without overexpression of ptsN in a WT strain and in a strain lacking known regulators of the respective stress responses. Measurements are expressed as the percentage of reporter gene activity in the WT strain without ptsN overexpression and this value is noted above the columns. Relative reporter gene activities are shown for (A) the rpoHP3-lacZ fusion in WT and ΔrseA strains (SEA4254 and SEA4228), (B) the rprA-lacZ fusion in WT and ΔrcsB strains (SEA4199 and SEA4203), and (C) the cpxP-lacZ fusion in WT and cpxR::Ωspec strains (SEA 4179 and SEA4251). The inset in C shows the cpxR::Ωspec strain with and without ptsN overexpression. The basal level of expression is &gt;250-fold lower in cpxR::Ωspec cells than in WT cells and is not easily seen on the main plot.
