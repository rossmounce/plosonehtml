Measurements are expressed as the percentage of reporter gene activity in the WT strain without <em>ptsN</em> overexpression and this value is noted above the columns. Relative reporter gene activities are shown for (A) the <em>rpoH</em>P3-<em>lacZ</em> fusion in WT and Δ<em>rseA</em> strains (SEA4254 and SEA4228), (B) the <em>rprA</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion in WT and Δ<em>rcsB</em> strains (SEA4199 and SEA4203), and (C) the <em>cpxP</em>-<em>lacZ</em> fusion in WT and <em>cpxR</em>::Ω<em>spec</em> strains (SEA 4179 and SEA4251). The inset in C shows the <em>cpxR</em>::Ω<em>spec</em> strain with and without <em>ptsN</em> overexpression. The basal level of expression is &gt;250-fold lower in <em>cpxR</em>::Ω<em>spec</em> cells than in WT cells and is not easily seen on the main plot.</p>
