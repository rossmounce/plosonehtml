Primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Arrows show representative desmosomes, and arrowheads point to areas of cytokeratin bundles. B. Representative immuno-fluorescence images of plakoglobin staining. Bar = 15 Âµm. C. Western blot analysis of plakoglobin expression in the primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells. Graph shows quantification of three experiments.</p>
