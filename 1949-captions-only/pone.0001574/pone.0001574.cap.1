                Figure 1.  Desmosomes and cytokeratin are gradually reduced in the course of transformation.A. Primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Arrows show representative desmosomes, and arrowheads point to areas of cytokeratin bundles. B. Representative immuno-fluorescence images of plakoglobin staining. Bar = 15 Âµm. C. Western blot analysis of plakoglobin expression in the primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells. Graph shows quantification of three experiments.
