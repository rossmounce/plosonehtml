Cell tracks, in yellow, were determined by marking cell nuclei in every frame of the movie. The figure shows the same cells at the beginning of the experiment (0 h), after 7 h, and at the end of the movie (14 h). Cell velocity was calculated by marking the cell nucleus in every frame, and following cell movement. Average velocity was calculated by an application within the UCSF PRIISM environment ((<a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive">http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive</a>). Errors represent standard error of &gt;100 cells examined in 3 independent experiments.</p>
