A. Images show a representative cell in 4 time-points along the experiment, in the beginning (0 min), after 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min of the experiment. B. Graph shows quantification of cell area along the experiment. To quantify cell spreading, polygons, defining the cell perimeter were manually marked, at different time points, and the projected cell area was calculated by an application within the UCSF PRIISM environment (<a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive">http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive</a>). Error bars represent standard errors of &gt;30 cells examined in 3 independent experiments.</p>
