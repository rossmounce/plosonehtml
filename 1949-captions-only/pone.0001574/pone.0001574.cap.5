                Figure 5.  Disruption of Actin organization in late HF1 cells is associated with reduced Rac1 activity.A. Representative images of phalloidin staining for F-Actin in the primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells. Bar = 15 Âµm. B. Western blot analysis of Rac1. Upper panel shows activated, GTP-loaded Rac1 pulled-down with GST-PBD. Lower panel shows total Rac1 levels in whole cell lysates before pull down. Graph shows average active, GTP-loaded Rac1. Error bars represent standard errors of three independent experiments.
