Late HF1 cells were transfected with active Rac1 (Rac1L61) or with GFP as control. Cell motility movies were created by acquiring live-cell images every 15 min throughout 5 h of the experiment. Cell velocity was calculated by marking the cell nucleus in every frame, and following cell movement. Average velocity was calculated by an application within the UCSF PRIISM environment ((<a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive">http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive</a>). Graph shows fold change in velocity, normalized to the control cells. Errors represent standard error of &gt;100 cells. B. Primary keratinocytes were treated with 5 µM PP1 or 5 µM LY294002 for 4 h before cell lysis and Rac1 activity assay. Graphs show quantification of Rac1-GTP. Error bars represent standard deviations of two experiments. C. Quantification of cell motility in the presence of PP1 or LY294002. Migration rate was examined as in A. Error bars represent standard error of &gt;50 cells.</p>
