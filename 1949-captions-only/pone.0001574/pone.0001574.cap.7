Cell motility movies were created by acquiring live-cell images every 15 min throughout 14 h of the experiment. Cell tracks, in yellow, were determined by marking cell nuclei in every frame of the movie. The figure shows the same cells at the beginning of the experiment (0 h), after 7 h, and at the end of the movie (14 h). Cell velocity was calculated by marking the cell nucleus in every frame, and following cell movement. Average velocity was calculated by an application within the UCSF PRIISM environment ((<a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive">http://msg.ucsf.edu/ive</a>). Errors represent standard error of &gt;200 cells. B. Western blot analysis of Rac1 in late HF1 cells and in SiHa cells. Upper panel shows activated, GTP-loaded Rac1 pulled-down with GST-PBD. Lower panel shows total Rac1 levels in whole cell lysates before pull down. Graph shows quantification of the active Rac1. Error bars represent standard errors of three independent experiments.</p>
