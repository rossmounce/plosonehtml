Mean±SEM of Penh values at 50 mg/ml MCh are shown for the first 4 weeks only from 3 independent experiments (n≥12). No differences between groups were detected after week 4. (b) Baseline Penh values were assessed during the same measurements. Mean±SEM from 5 independent experiments are illustrated (n≥15). Significant differences: * long term OVA challenges versus PBS control, +short term OVA challenges versus PBS control, levels of significance: */+ p&lt;0,01, **/++ p&lt;0,001.</p>
