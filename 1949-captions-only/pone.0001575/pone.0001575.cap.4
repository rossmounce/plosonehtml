                Figure 4.  Cytokines in BAL fluid after long and short term airway challenges.Following OVA sensitisation and short or long term OVA challenges or after sham sensitisation and long or short term PBS challenges, concentrations of (a) IL-5, (b) IL-13 and (c) activated TGF-β1were measured in BAL fluid by ELISA 3 days to 8 weeks after final airway challenge, n≥15 per group from 5 independent experiments. Significant differences: * OVA challenges versus PBS controls, +long term versus short term OVA challenges, */+ p&lt;0.05, **/++ p&lt;0.01, ***/+++ p&lt;0.001.
