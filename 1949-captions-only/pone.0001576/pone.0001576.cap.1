Strain AH109 carrying GAL4 activation domain, fused to cDNA containing HLA-DR, was tested for interaction with indicated domains of TIRC7 (N-terminus aa 1-173, large extracellular domain aa 438-512 or C-terminus aa 586-614) as bait. The growth of combined clones on Histidine-negative agar plates indicate a specific interaction between the HLA-DR alpha 2 and TIRC7 extracellular domain whereas no interaction between HLA-DR alpha 2 to the C – terminal or N- terminal domain of TIRC7 was observed. The growth of colonies on Histidine positive agar plates which represents a positive control, is shown in the left panel. B. Lysates were prepared from 1 h allo-activated PBL and Jurkat cells. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-TIRC7 mAb and immunoblotted (IB) with specific antibody against HLA-DR protein or TIRC7 in denaturing conditions. Co-precipitation of TIRC7 and HLA-DR is observed in PBL whereas only TIRC7 was precipitated in HLA-DR negative Jurkat cells. C. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with a TIRC7-<em>myc</em> fusion protein vector construct, incubated with sHLA-DRα2 and stained with secondary anti-human Fc protein-Cy3 conjugated mAb. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that sHLA-DRα2 solely binds to TIRC7 transfected COS7 cells and fail to bind to non-transfected COS7 control cells. Shown is one experiment out of four. D. COS7 cells transfected with TIRC7-<em>myc</em> fusion protein showed concentration-dependent binding of sHLA-DRα2 (0, 25, 50, 150 µg/ml) using direct immunofluorescence method. No binding of control protein was observed in transfected COS7 cells. Shown is one experiment out of three. E and F. TIRC7 deficient and wild-type mouse splenocytes were isolated and either stimulated with PHA for 48 h or remained unstimulated. Cells were incubated with either human HLA-DR alpha 2 or human control protein prior to flow cytometry (E) or confocal microscopic analysis (F) using anti-human Fc-specific Cy3 as secondary antibody. The results show that HLA-DR alpha 2 solely binds to stimulated WT cells in flow cytometric and microscopic analyses. Shown is one experiment out of three, respectively.</p>
