                Figure 2.  Soluble HLA-DR alpha 2 domain inhibits IFN-γ cytokine expression and phosphorylation of STAT4, but not STAT6.A. Human PBL were activated with PHA for 48 h and co-cultured with either sHLA-DRα2 or control protein. Supernatants were subjected to quantitative sandwich ELISA. sHLA-DRα2 at a concentration of 50 µg/ml significantly inhibited the IFN-γ expression of stimulated PBL, whereas control protein exhibited no significant effect. B. No inhibition of IL-10 expression was observed. The results shown represent the means of five independent experiments, respectively. C. Human PBL were allo-activated for 4 h in the presence of anti-TIRC7 mAb and subjected to Western blot analysis. Equal volume of cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation status of STAT4 and STAT6 was determined by Western blot analysis. STAT4 phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of sHLA-DRα2 whereas pSTAT6 remained unchanged. No changes were observed using STAT4, and anti-Tubulin mAb. Shown is one representative experiment out of three independent experiments. D. Human PBL were isolated using standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation protocol. Cells were activated with PHA, anti-CD3/CD28 mAb, and MLR, respectively, and co-cultured with either sHLA-DRα2 or control protein in varying concentrations (50, 100, and 150 µg/ml). Cells were subjected to CFSE proliferation assays. A significant inhibition of proliferation was observed using sHLA-DRα2 in all proliferation assays whereas the control protein did not show any inhibition. The results shown represent the means of four independent experiments, respectively. E. The inhibition of proliferation of 48 h anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated human PBL by sHLA-DRα2 (100 µg/ml) was prevented by co-incubation of the anti-TIRC7 mAb 136 (100 µg/ml). F. Cell lysates were prepared from 1 h allo-activated PBL and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-TIRC7 mAb and subjected to western blot analysis. The immunoblot (IB) with anti-TIRC7 and anti-SHP-1 mAb showed the co-precipitation of SHP-1 and TIRC7. G. The phosphorylation of TCR-ζ chain and ZAP70 induced by IL-2 is inhibited by sHLA-DRα2. Human PBL were isolated and activated using anti-CD3/CD28 mAb for 18 h in the presence and absence of sHLA-DRα2. In the presence of sHLA-DRα2 (50 µg/ml) the phosphorylation of TCR-ζ chain and ZAP70 in stimulated cells (right lane) was reduced to a level similar to that of non-stimulated cells (left lane) while in stimulated cells without sHLA-DRα2 (middle lane) substantial phosphorylation of both proteins was observed.
