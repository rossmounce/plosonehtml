Human PBL were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 48 h in the presence of sHLA-DRα2 or control protein (50 µg/ml). The cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodine for cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Incubation with sHLA-DR α2 resulted in a G0/G1 arrest (live cell gate) in comparison to control protein. Shown are resting cells, PBL activated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 48 h, activated PBL incubated with control protein, and activated PBL incubated with sHLA-DRα2. B. Human PBL activated with anti-CD3/CD28 were incubated with sHLA-DRα2 or control protein (50 µg/ml) for 48 h and then stained with Annexin V for the analysis of apoptosis using flow cytometry. When incubated with sHLA-DR α2, human PBL showed a strong increase of Annexin V positive cells in comparison to control protein. Apoptosis in stimulated cells prior to the administration of either control protein or sHLA-DRα2 protein was similar in both reactions indicating that the effect on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis was specific. C. Human CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes were separated by magnetic beads and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody for 72 h in the presence of either 50 µg/ml sHLA-DRα2 or Fc control protein. The cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis and stained with Annexin V for the detection of apoptosis. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations exhibited substantial apoptosis. Shown is one representative experiment out of four independent experiments.</p>
