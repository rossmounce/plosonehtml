Using anti-human Fc-Cy3 mAb as secondary antibody, binding of sHLA-DRα2 or control protein to TIRC7 protein was analyzed. The results show a binding in CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells co-incubated with sHLA-DRα2 (upper panel) whereas no binding was observed in various control experiments using either control protein (lower panel) or anti-Fc-Cy3 conjugated secondary mAb only. Shown is one experiment out of three.</p>
