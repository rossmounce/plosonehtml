                Figure 5.  Targeting of TIRC7 in lymphocytes induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway.A. PBL were co-incubated 50 µg/ml sHLA-DRα2 or control protein for 5 h, and immunobloting using mAb against caspase 9, caspase 8, caspase 7 and caspase 3 was performed. Activation of caspase 9 and caspase 7 is indicated by the appearance of cleaved fragments with a size of 37 and 20 kDa, respectively. No activation of caspase 8 and 3 was observed. B. Human PBL were isolated, activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies (a) cultured in the presence of 50 µg/ml sHLA-DRα2 (d), and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. In comparison to non-treated controls (b,c) stimulated human T cells incubated with 50 µg/ml sHLA-DRα2 (d) demonstrated a remarkably reduced expression of FasL as detected by FITC labeled anti-FasL mAb. C. Human PBL were recall antigen stimulated for 6 days and incubated with FITC labeled anti-TIRC7 mAb. A monocyte cell line, THP-1, was incubated with anti-HLA-DR mAb and secondary stained with Cy3-conjugate. To increase cell interaction, PBL and THP-1 cells were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 20 min and subjected to confocal microscopic analysis. The data show that HLA-DR (red color) and TIRC7 (green color) co-localize (merge, yellow color) at the physical site of T cell/APC interaction. Shown is one experiment out of three.
