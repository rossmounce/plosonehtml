                Figure 6.  TIRC7 signals triggering prevents T cell - APC interaction reflected in inhibition of several cytokines.A. Human PBL were isolated using standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation protocol and culture 14 days to induce monocyte differentiation. Either sHLA-DRα2 (50 µg/ml) or control (50 µg/ml) were co-incubated and subjected to cytokine release assays. Cytokine levels were measured by quantitative real time PCR which revealed a profound inhibition of MCP-1, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α and Rantes expression compared with the control. B. Human sHLA-DRα2 showed specific cross-reactivity on balb/c mice splenocytes (left side). For the in vivo functional analysis balb/c splenocytes were isolated and further subjected to microscopic analysis for cross-reactivity of human sHLA-DRα2 to mouse TIRC7 which resulted in significant binding on activated splenocytes. C. In balb/c mice (n = 14) LPS was administered followed by a single dose (100 µg/mice, i.p.) of human sHLA-DRα2 (200 µg/day, i.p.). Human sHLA-DRα2 resulted in a significant down-regulation of IFN-γ, TNF-α and Rantes after 24 h treatment. sHLA-DRα2 or control protein treated splenocytes were subjected to immunobloting using mAb against caspase 7. Activation of caspase 7 is indicated by the appearance of cleaved fragments with a size of 20 kDa in sHLA-DRα2 treated animals (a1 and a2) whereas no activation of caspase 7 was observed in controls. Shown are two examples out of five.
