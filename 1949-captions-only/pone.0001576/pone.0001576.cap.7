                Figure 7.  Scheme of proposed model of regulation of immune activation via TIRC7-HLA-DR alpha 2 binding.TIRC7 serves as ligand for HLA-DR alpha 2 upon TCR activation in the early phase of immune activation. After positive signals were received and immune cells are activated, TIRC7 is expressed on the cell surface (A) and its binding to HLA-DR alpha 2 transduces negative signals to lymphocytes (B).
