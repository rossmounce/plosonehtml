                Figure 1.  Variation of intrinsic growth rate r (A), carrying capacity K (B), cell size (C) and glucose consumption rate JT50 (D) in three culture media differing for glucose content.Each point represents the mean value of the trait for each industrial origin in each culture medium with the standard error associated. Vinery strains are represented by circles, brewery ones by crosses and bakery ones by triangles.
