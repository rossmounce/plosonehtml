                Figure 2.  Trade-offs between carrying capacity K (A), growth rate r (B), cell size (C) across culture media.Each point corresponds to the mean value of a strain in a culture condition. Blue, black and red colors correspond respectively to 0.25%, 1% and 15% glucose. Vinery strains are represented by circles, brewery ones by crosses and bakery ones by triangles.
