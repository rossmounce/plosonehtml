                Figure 3.  Correlations between glucose consumption rate and growth rate per cell (A), carrying capacity (B) and cell size (C).Each point corresponds to the mean value of a strain in a culture condition. Blue, black and red colors correspond respectively to 0.25%, 1% and 15% glucose. Vinery strains are represented by circles, brewery ones by crosses and bakery ones by triangles.
