                Figure 5.  Variation of the relative carrying capacity in the three culture media.In each medium, the relative carrying capacity of each strain was calculated as the ratio of its carrying capacity to the highest strain's carrying capacity in this medium. Each point represents the mean value of the relative carrying capacity for each industrial origin in each culture medium with the standard error associated. Vinery strains are represented by circles, brewery ones by crosses and bakery ones by triangles.
