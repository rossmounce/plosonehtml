                Figure 6.  Relationship between yield and glucose consumption rate.Yield is defined as the ratio of the biomass (product of carrying capacity by cell size) to the initial glucose amount in the medium. Each point corresponds to the mean value of a strain in a culture condition. Blue, black and red colors correspond respectively to 0.25%, 1% and 15% glucose. Vinery strains are represented by circles, brewery ones by crosses and bakery ones by triangles.
