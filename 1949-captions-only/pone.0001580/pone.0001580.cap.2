                Figure 2.  Behavioral responses to experimental signals.(control = control song, n = 19 birds; ptone = synthetic continuous pure tone, n = 11; mul1.5 = slope multiplied by 1.5, n = 10; div2 = slope divided by 2, n = 10; 2half = second half of the song, n = 6; noAM = without AM song, n = 6). Results of Krukal-Wallis tests: latency, H (5, n = 62) = 34.38, P = 0.000; approach, H (5, n = 62) = 22.24, P = 0.000; calls, H (5, n = 62) = 15.94, P = 0.007; songs, H (5, n = 62) = 4.55, P = 0.473. *: significant difference with control (post-hoc multiple comparison tests; see text for details).
