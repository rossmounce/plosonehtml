The percentages of the different cell populations are also shown for each quadrant of the contour plots in each upper right quadrant. (B) CD25 and FOXP3 expression in CD4+ cells (upper graph) and CD8+ (lower graph) cells were monitored daily upon activation of total PBMCs (t = 0). CD25 expression corresponds to the left axis (0–100%), while FOXP3 expression corresponds to the right axis (0–20%). The results are shown as Mean±SEM of 4 independent experiments. (C) Representative contour plots of total PBMC activated for 24 h show CD4+ and CD8+ cells stained with RatIgG2a (upper row) or FOXP3 (lower row) and CD25 as in A. The percentages of different population are also shown for the contour plots in each upper right quadrant. (D) The difference of FOXP3 expression between freshly isolated vs. αCD3-activated for 24 h in CD4+ (black bars; n = 16) and in CD8+ (gray bars; n = 17) cells. The results are shown as mean±SEM (vertical brackets).</p>
