                Figure 2.  Exogenous, recombinant IL2 prolongs FOXP3 expression.The time course of FOXP3 expression in (A) CD4+cells and (B) CD8+ cells upon αCD3-activation of PBMCs (t = 0), with and without exogenous rIL2 [10 nM]. Insets show the IL2Rα (CD25) expression under the same conditions. The results are shown as Mean±SEM of 4–6 independent experiments.
