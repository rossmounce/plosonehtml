Exogenous rIL2 [10 nM] was added where indicated (t = 0). Also, the expression of FOXP3 at 24 h was determined in CD4+ (black bars) and CD8+ (gray bars) cells upon total PBMCs activation together with an addition of increasing concentrations of exogenous rIL2 [0–10 nM] at t = 0 in the presence of (B) αCD25 [1 µg/ml] and (D) αIL2 [1 µg/ml]. The results are shown as Mean±SEM of 4 independent experiments.</p>
