                Figure 4.  Inhibition of anti-CD3-induced FOXP3 expression by combined antibodies reactive with both IL2R (αCD25) and IL2.FOXP3 expression at 24 h is shown in CD4+ (black bars) and CD8+ (gray bars) cells upon αCD3-activation of PBMCs and simultaneous addition of αCD25 and αIL2 (t = 0) at two concentrations (A) [1 µg/ml] and (B) [10 µg/ml] along with increasing concentrations of rIL2 [0–10 nM]. The results are shown as Mean±SEM of 4 independent experiments.
