                Figure 5.  The expression of FOXP3 and IL2 are mutually exclusive.(A) Dot plots monitoring FOXP3 and IL2 expression in CD4+ cells measured on different days after Î±CD3-activation of PBMCs (t = 0). (B) FOXP3 and IL2 expression are shown for CD4+ cells in division zero (upper dot plot) and in the first division (lower dot plot) 72 h after total PBMCs activation (t = 0). Histograms of corresponding CFSE labeled CD4+ cells are shown in the insets. The percentages of the different populations are also shown for each dot plot. Representative dot plots were chosen from 1 of 4 independent experiments. (C) FOXP3 and IL2 expression are shown after restimulation. PBMCs were activated with anti-CD3+IL2 (10 nM) for 24 hours, harvested and then reactivated with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 in the presence of Brefeldin-A for 6 hours. Representative dot blots were chosen from 1 of 5 independent experiments.
