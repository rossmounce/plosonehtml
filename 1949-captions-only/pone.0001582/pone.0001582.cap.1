                Figure 1.  Light microscopic studies of tissues from KD patient 1.A, H&amp;E of ciliated bronchial epithelium, demonstrating amphophilic supranuclear ICI (arrows); B, IHC using synthetic antibody J of ciliated bronchial epithelium, showing ICI (arrows); C, methyl green pyronin stain of ciliated bronchial epithelium, demonstrating red ICI (arrows) indicating the presence of RNA; D, IHC using synthetic antibody J on myocardium lesion, demonstrating antigen-positive macrophages (thin arrows) infiltrating an area that has undergone myocardial dropout near a vessel (thick arrow shows single viable cardiac myocyte in this field). Aâ€“D = 40X.
