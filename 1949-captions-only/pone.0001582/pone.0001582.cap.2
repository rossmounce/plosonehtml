                Figure 2.  Light microscopic studies of ciliated bronchial epithelium from KD patient 3.A, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using synthetic antibody J, examples of specific staining of ICI indicated with arrows; B, IHC using control antibody I, no specific staining; C, H&amp;E stain demonstrating that ICI are visible as amphophilic bodies (arrows); D, methyl green pyronin stain of paraffin section of a tangentially sectioned bronchus showing purple nuclei (DNA) and red ICI (RNA, arrows); E, higher-power image of Figure A, showing intense brown staining of multiple clusters of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (ICI, arrows); F, IHC from another bronchus, demonstrating fewer ICI (block arrows) and an IHC-positive macrophage in the lumen of the bronchus (thin arrow); G, frozen section of lung stained with methyl green pyronin; this unfixed tissue section shows typical blue-green nuclei (open arrows) and shows clusters of (thin arrow) and individual (black block arrows) ICI staining red, characteristic of RNA. A,B taken with 10X objective, E = 20X, C, D, F,G = 40X.
