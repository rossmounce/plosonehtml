                Figure 5.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of ciliated bronchial epithelium from glutaraldehyde-fixed, previously frozen lung from KD patient 3.A) Lower power image demonstrating finely granular, variably electron-dense ICI (block arrows). N = nucleus, L = lysosomes, M = mitochondria, C = cilia. B) Higher power image of ICI (block arrows). Note rough endoplasmic reticulum (thin arrow). ICI are spherical and do not appear membrane-bound. A = 14,000X, B = 52,000X.
