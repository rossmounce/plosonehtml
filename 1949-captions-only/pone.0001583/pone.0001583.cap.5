                Figure 5.  Hippuristanol targets eIF4A in vivo.(A) Inhibition of Renilla luciferase reporter in a yeast in vitro translation extract. Hippuristanol was added to a S. cerevisiae cytosolic translation extract programmed with 0.12 µg/ml capped Renilla luciferase mRNA. At various points following initiation of the translation reaction, aliquots were removed and the relative luciferase units (RLU) determined. (B) Haploinsufficiency for Tif1/2p leads to increased sensitivity to hippuristanol in vivo. Haploid wild type cells (strain CWO4) or an isogenic strain carrying the temperature-sensitive tif1V79A allele (strain SS13-3A/pSSC120) [41] were cultivated in rich medium (YPD) at 27°C to an O.D.600 of 0.2, at which point hippuristanol (1 µM or 10 µM final concentration) or solvent (DMSO, 0.1%) was added and the growth of different cultures was monitored for several hours by measuring the O.D.600. (C) Serial dilutions of different haploid yeast strains were plated on YPD-plates containing the indicated concentrations of hippuristanol and incubated for 2–3 days at 27°C: wt (CWO4), wild type strain CWO4; 4A-ts, strain SS13-3A/pSSC120 carrying the tif1V79A allele; Δtif1, a BY4741-derivative strain carrying a tif1::kanX deletion; Δtif2, a BY4741-derivative strain carrying a tif2::kanX deletion; wt (BY4741), wild type strain BY4741.
