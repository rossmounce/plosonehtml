The percent rescue was determined by normalizing the <em>Firefly</em> luciferase values to <em>Renilla</em> luciferase [to standardize for small variations in sample injection volumes], followed by dividing by the ratio obtained from the vehicle-treated samples (which was set at 100%). The data presented is the average of 9 independent sets of injections with the standard deviations denoted. (B) Western blot of extracts prepared from oocyte extracts. The equivalent of one oocyte was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and probed with α-His<sub>6</sub> (to detect recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-eIF4AI) or α-tubulin antibodies.</p>
