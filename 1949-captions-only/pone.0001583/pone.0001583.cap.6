                Figure 6.  In vivo rescue of hippuristanol-induced translation inhibition by eIF4AIIG/T.(A) Rescue of translation in Xenopus oocytes by eIF4AIIG/T. The percent rescue was determined by normalizing the Firefly luciferase values to Renilla luciferase [to standardize for small variations in sample injection volumes], followed by dividing by the ratio obtained from the vehicle-treated samples (which was set at 100%). The data presented is the average of 9 independent sets of injections with the standard deviations denoted. (B) Western blot of extracts prepared from oocyte extracts. The equivalent of one oocyte was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and probed with α-His6 (to detect recombinant His6-eIF4AI) or α-tubulin antibodies.
