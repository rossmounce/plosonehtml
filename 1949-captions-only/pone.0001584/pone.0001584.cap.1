The sites for the metagenomes are labeled with an *. Coral cover, fish counts, and other macro-organism data were sampled at all of these sites, as well as additional sites <a href="#pone.0001584-Sandin1">[18]</a>. The prevailing current is shown as a grey arrow. MIC = number of microbes per ml; Vibr = number of culturable <em>Vibrio</em> spp. on TCBS plates per ml; DOC = dissolved organic carbon in µM; TDIN = total dissolved inorganic nitrogen in µM (nitrite and nitrate, and ammonium). Maps were taken from Google Earth.</p>
