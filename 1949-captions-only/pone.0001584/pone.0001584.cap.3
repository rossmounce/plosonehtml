C) The metabolic potential expressed by the seven most abundant subsystems, across the atolls. These subsystems varied significantly between Kingman and Kiritimati using both XIPE <a href="#pone.0001584-RodriguezBrito1">[37]</a> and G-test (Supplementary data). Subsystems that are more closely associated with autotrophs are shown in green. The “potential pathogen” designation are known human pathogenic genera like <em>Staphylococcus</em>, <em>Vibrio</em>, and <em>Escherichia</em>, fish pathogens like <em>Aeromona</em>, and plant pathogens from the <em>Xylella</em> genera.</p>
