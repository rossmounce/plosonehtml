                Figure 4.  Analysis of the viral metagenomes showing: A) The relative abundances of phage host range by guild.This was the product of the mean number of virus-like particles and the proportion of sequences within the small metagenomic fraction that were similar to autotrophic, heterotrophic or potential pathogenic phage hosts. B) Sequence recruitment across the Escherichia coli Î¦ CP4-6 prophage (which is found in highly virulent E. coli) and Prochlorococcus marinus SSMP4 (which infects an open water autotrophic cyanobacteria).
