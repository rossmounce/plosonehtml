                Figure 6.  Prevalence of unhealthy scleractinian corals compared with scleractinian coral cover.The prevalence of unhealthy corals was negatively related to host density on both Tabuaeran (r2 = 0.477, P = 0.002) and Kiritimati (r2 = 0.664, P = 0.003). No relationship was found on Palmyra (r2 = 0.261, P = 0.141) or Kingman (r2 = 0.251, P = 0.300).
