                Figure 4.  ORS intake in mL during the time periods 0–12, 13–24, and 25–48 hours and total ORS intake (last two box plots).The box and whiskers plots show median and IQR (box) and lowest and highest value (whiskers). Two-tailed adjusted P values (Mann-Whitney) show the significance of differences between HAMS and HO ORS for that particular time period.
