Significant differences were noted between HAMS and HO ORS-treated patients also in the group of patients whose stool culture did not grow <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> (log rank test, P = 0.006). The <em>Vibrio</em>-positive subgroup was not statistically significantly different from the group that was negative by culture, whether it was HAMS or HO-ORS, and the <em>Vibrio</em>-positive subgroup showed significantly quicker recovery when treated with HAMS.</p>
