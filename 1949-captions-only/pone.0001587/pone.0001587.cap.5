                Figure 5.  Recovery from diarrhea in patients with positive cultures for Vibrio cholerae compared with those with negative cultures.Significant differences were noted between HAMS and HO ORS-treated patients in patients whose stool culture revealed Vibrio cholerae (log rank test, P&lt;0.001). Significant differences were noted between HAMS and HO ORS-treated patients also in the group of patients whose stool culture did not grow Vibrio cholerae (log rank test, P = 0.006). The Vibrio-positive subgroup was not statistically significantly different from the group that was negative by culture, whether it was HAMS or HO-ORS, and the Vibrio-positive subgroup showed significantly quicker recovery when treated with HAMS.
