                Figure 1.  Classification of Retinal Progenitor Cells.A classification scheme was developed to identify RPCs, RGCs, ACs and rod photoreceptors based on the expression of gene clusters. The scaled scores shown are derived from clusters of genes that were associated with known markers for the different cell types by a Fisher's exact test (p&lt;.001). The markers used were NF68 for RGCs, TCFAP-2Î² for ACs, Nrl for PRs and a combination of Cyclin D1, Fgf15, Sfrp2 and Crym for RPCs.
