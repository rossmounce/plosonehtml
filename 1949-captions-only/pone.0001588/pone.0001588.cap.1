The scaled scores shown are derived from clusters of genes that were associated with known markers for the different cell types by a Fisher's exact test (p&lt;.001). The markers used were <em>NF68</em> for RGCs, <em>TCFAP-2Î²</em> for ACs, <em>Nrl</em> for PRs and a combination of <em>Cyclin D1</em>, <em>Fgf15</em>, <em>Sfrp2</em> and <em>Crym</em> for RPCs.</p>
