                Figure 12.  Expression of G2/M phase cell cycle genes in RPCs.(A) A Treeview generated heatmap displaying the RPC expression of genes previously shown to play a role in G2/M portion of the cell cycle. Cyclin D1 expression is depicted for comparison. ISH was performed on retinal cryosections at E12.5 (B, E, H, K), E16.5 (C, F, I, L), and P0 (D, G, J, M) using the following probes: (B–D) BE988025 [Cdc20], (E–G) BE953861 [Cyclin B2], (H–J) BE985607 [Spbc25], and (K–M) BE954832 [Ube2c]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.
