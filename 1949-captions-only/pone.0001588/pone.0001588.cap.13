                Figure 13.  Classification of G2/M progenitors.A classification scheme was developed to identify RPCs in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The scaled scores shown are derived from clusters of genes that were associated with the G2/M markers Cdc20, Aurkb and Ube2c by a Fisher's exact test (p&lt;.001).
