                Figure 14.  Expression of genes that potentially play a role in cell cycle exit.(A) A Treeview generated heatmap displaying the RPC expression of genes that were isolated due to their expression in subsets of G2/M cells. The expression of Cyclin D1, G2/M genes (Cdc20, Cyclin B1, Ube2c, and P27Kip1) and some TFs (Hes6, Otx2 and NeuroD1) are depicted for comparison. ISH was performed on retinal cryosections at E12.5 (B, E, H, K), E16.5 (C, F, I, L), and P0 (D, G, J, M) using the following probes: (B–D) Delta-like 1 [123] (E–G) AI851775 [Btg2], (H–J) BE954420 [Rhbdl3], and (K–M) AI836584 [Spred1]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.
