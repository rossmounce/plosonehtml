The intensities from the Affymetrix signals have been scaled such that signals of 10,000 or greater are colored bright red, signals below 1,000 (called absent by Affymetrix software) are black, and signals in between 10,000 and 1,000 are graded according to their signal value. (B) ISH was performed on retinal cryosections at E12.5 (B, E, H, K), E16.5 (C, F, I, L), and P0 (D, G, J, M) using the following probes: <em>Cyclin D1</em> <a href="#pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">[27]</a> (B–D), BE952015 [<em>Fgf15</em>] (E–G), BE953569 [<em>Tropomyosin 4</em>] (H–J) and AI835674 [<em>Glutamine synthetase</em> (<em>GS</em>)] (K–M). Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.</p>
