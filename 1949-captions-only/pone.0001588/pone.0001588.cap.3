E12.5, E16.5 or P0 retinas were explanted, labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine for 1 hour, dissociated and probed for either (A, C) <em>Cyclin D1</em> <a href="#pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">[27]</a> or (B, D) BE952015 [<em>Fgf15</em>]. The graphs in A and B show the percentages of total DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells that were also positive for either <em>Cyclin D1</em> (A) or <em>Fgf15</em> (B) as well as the percentages of cells positive for either gene in relation to the population of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup> cells. Additionally, the percentage of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup> cells that express each gene is shown. The red arrows in C and D indicate cells that are positive for both [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine and for the probed gene. The blue arrow in D indicates a cell that is [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup>, but negative for <em>Fgf15</em>.</p>
