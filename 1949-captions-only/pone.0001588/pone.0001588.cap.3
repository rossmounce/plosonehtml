                Figure 3.  Examination of broadly expressed RPC genes by dissociated cell in situ hybridization (DISH).DISH was performed using either Cyclin D1 or Fgf15 probes. E12.5, E16.5 or P0 retinas were explanted, labeled with [3H]-thymidine for 1 hour, dissociated and probed for either (A, C) Cyclin D1 [27] or (B, D) BE952015 [Fgf15]. The graphs in A and B show the percentages of total DAPI+ cells that were also positive for either Cyclin D1 (A) or Fgf15 (B) as well as the percentages of cells positive for either gene in relation to the population of [3H]-thymidine+ cells. Additionally, the percentage of [3H]-thymidine+ cells that express each gene is shown. The red arrows in C and D indicate cells that are positive for both [3H]-thymidine and for the probed gene. The blue arrow in D indicates a cell that is [3H]-thymidine+, but negative for Fgf15.
