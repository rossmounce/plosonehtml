                Figure 4.  Expression of temporally regulated transcripts in RPCs.(A) A Treeview generated heatmap showing the expression of transcripts that are enriched in RPCs at early developmental stages (top portion) and those that are enriched at later developmental stages (bottom portion). Cyclin D1 expression is depicted for comparison. ISH for genes expressed in RPCs at early developmental stages was performed at E12.5 (B, E, H), E16.5 (C, F, I) and P0 (D, G, J). The probes used were (B–D) BF463274 [Sfrp2], (E–G) BE996428 [Fgf3], and (H–J) AW491862 [Foxp1]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.
