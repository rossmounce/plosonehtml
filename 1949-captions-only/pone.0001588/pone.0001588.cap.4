ISH for genes expressed in RPCs at early developmental stages was performed at E12.5 (B, E, H), E16.5 (C, F, I) and P0 (D, G, J). The probes used were (B–D) BF463274 [<em>Sfrp2</em>], (E–G) BE996428 [<em>Fgf3</em>], and (H–J) AW491862 [<em>Foxp1</em>]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.</p>
