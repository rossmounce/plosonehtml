The following probes were used: (A–C) AI834907 <em>[μ-crystallin</em>], (D–F) BE953342 [<em>Carbonic anhydrase 2</em>], (G–I) BF464755 [<em>Patched1</em>], (J–L) AI852545 [<em>Transgelin 2</em>], and (M–O) BF465231 [<em>Retinaldehyde binding protein 1</em>]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.</p>
