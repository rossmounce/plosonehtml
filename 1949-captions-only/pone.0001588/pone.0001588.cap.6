ISH was performed on retinal cryosections at E12.5 (B, E, H, K), E16.5 (C, F, I, L), and P0 (D, G, J, M) using the following probes: (B–D) AI836990 [<em>Pttg1</em>], (E–G) AW490674 [<em>Ect2</em>], (H–J) BE949444 [<em>RIKEN cDNA 6720460F02</em>], and (K–M) BE987101 [<em>Fgf9</em>]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.</p>
