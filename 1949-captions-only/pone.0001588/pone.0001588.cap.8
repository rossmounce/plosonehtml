(A) The slides were probed for <em>NeuroD1</em> <a href="#pone.0001588-Morrow1">[132]</a>, <em>Otx2</em> <a href="#pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">[27]</a>, BQ178789 [<em>Ngn2</em>], BE996421 [<em>Etv5</em>], AW048812 [<em>Hes6</em>] or <em>Crx</em> <a href="#pone.0001588-Furukawa2">[133]</a>. The graphs show the percentages of total DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells that were also positive for the individual TFs (red bars) and the percentages of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup> cells that express each TF (blue bars). (B) The slides were probed for BE984641 [<em>Rrm2</em>], BE981507 [<em>Kpna2</em>] or BE988025 [<em>Cdc20</em>]. The graphs show the percentages of total DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells that were also positive for the cell cycle genes (white bars), the percentages of cells positive for the cell cycle genes in relation to the population of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup> cells (red bars), and the percentages of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup> cells that express each TF (blue bars). (C) A representative field from a dissociated E16.5 retina that was labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine and probed with BE981507 [<em>Kpna2</em>]. The red arrows indicate three <em>Kpna2</em><sup>+</sup> cells that are also [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine<sup>+</sup>.</p>
