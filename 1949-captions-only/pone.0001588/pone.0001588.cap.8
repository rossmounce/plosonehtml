                Figure 8.  Examination of TFs and cell cycle markers by DISH.E16.5 or P0 retinas were explanted, then labeled with [3H]-thymidine for 1 hour, and dissociated. (A) The slides were probed for NeuroD1 [132], Otx2 [27], BQ178789 [Ngn2], BE996421 [Etv5], AW048812 [Hes6] or Crx [133]. The graphs show the percentages of total DAPI+ cells that were also positive for the individual TFs (red bars) and the percentages of [3H]-thymidine+ cells that express each TF (blue bars). (B) The slides were probed for BE984641 [Rrm2], BE981507 [Kpna2] or BE988025 [Cdc20]. The graphs show the percentages of total DAPI+ cells that were also positive for the cell cycle genes (white bars), the percentages of cells positive for the cell cycle genes in relation to the population of [3H]-thymidine+ cells (red bars), and the percentages of [3H]-thymidine+ cells that express each TF (blue bars). (C) A representative field from a dissociated E16.5 retina that was labeled with [3H]-thymidine and probed with BE981507 [Kpna2]. The red arrows indicate three Kpna2+ cells that are also [3H]-thymidine+.
