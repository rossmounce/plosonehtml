                Figure 9.  TF expression in RPCs.ISH on retinal cryosections was performed at three stages: E12.5 (A, D, G, J, M, P), E16.5 (B, E, H, K, N, Q) and P0 (C, F, I, L, O, R). The following probes were used: (A–C) AW048812 [Hes6], (D–F) BF462761 [Lhx2], (G–I) BF460628 [Gli3], (J–L) BE996421 [Etv5], (M–O) BE949919 [Foxm1], and (P–R) BE953382 [FoxO3A]. Representative scale bars are shown in the first panel of each column. All subsequent panels in that column are at the same scale unless otherwise indicated. Cellular laminae of the developing retina are diagrammed with the colored bars.
