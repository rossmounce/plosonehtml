                Figure 1.  Behavioral parameters of the 27 animals used in proteomic study.(A) Individual and median parkinsonian scores before (OFF) and 60 min after L-dopa administration (ON). (B) Individual and median dyskinetic scores 60 min after L-dopa administration. (C) Individual and mean automated locomotor activity counts recorded in parallel to the video recording (used for parkinsonian syndrome and dyskinesia severity ratings) during the 60min just before death. (D) Individual and mean DA transporter binding data (% of controls) showing that the 3 MPTP-treated groups displayed comparable extent of lesion.
