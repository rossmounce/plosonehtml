                Figure 2.  The five most significant STEM profiles for protein expression, their significance (rank I–V) and number of proteins identified in each profile.The Y-axis depicts expression change (EC) in relation to the controls, the maximum positive value being log2 0.75 and the minimum value being log2 −0.75. Dashed lines depict expression changes of log2 0.5. The X-axis shows the three sequential groups whose expression changes are plotted. From left to right: Untreated PD vs controls (UPvC), acute L-dopa vs untreated PD (APvUP) and chronic L-dopa vs. acute L-dopa (CPvAP).
