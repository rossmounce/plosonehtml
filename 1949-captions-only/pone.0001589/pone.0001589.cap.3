                Figure 3.  DEPPS heat map showing color-coded intervals of the RL-score.RL-scores with darker color are more significant than RL-scores with light colors. All groups contain at least five proteins (# â‰¥ 5) including three unique identities to prevent single identity isoform enriched DEPPS sets. N is a specific identity number that defines each DEPPS group. # designates the total number (isoforms included) of proteins in each DEPPS group.
