                Figure 4.  (A) Number of D1R- and D2R-immunopositive asymmetrical synapses in the dorsal caudate nucleus of control, untreated MPTP-lesioned and L-dopa chronically-treated MPTP-lesioned monkeys using the preembedding immunoperoxidase method.Data are expressed as the mean±standard deviation. Examples of D1R- (B) and D2R-immunopositive (C) asymmetrical synapses in the dorsal caudate nucleus. Stars denote presence of an asymmetrical synapse. Scale bars = 1 µm
