                Figure 5.  Visualization of DEPPS results in energy metabolism pathways.DEPPS effects are divided into three parts. (A) Untreated parkinsonian (DEPPS comparison UPvC); (B) Acute L-dopa parkinsonian (DEPPS comparisons APvUP, APvC); (C) Chronic L-dopa parkinsonian (DEPPS comparisons CPvUP, CPvC). An increasing darker red color indicates a more significant RL score with a greater impact on the metabolism pathways. OAA stands for oxaloacetate, aKG; alpha ketoglutarate, C1–C4; mitochondrial complexes I–IV, CytC; cytochrome C, UQ; Coenzyme Q.
