A focal stem cell has positive feedback (+) on itself but shares inhibition and negative feedback (âˆ’) with other stem cells. Transit amplifying cells receive positive feedback from stem cells and exert positive feedback on fully differentiated cells. Both transit amplifying and fully differentiated cells exhibit negative feedback on stem cells. The symbols that characterize these processes are explained in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>.</p>
