                Figure 5.  Deterministic replacement analysis allow us to determine when a mutation in one of the phenotypic parameters or the introduction of stem cells with different phenotypic parameters into a niche will lead to replacement of one stem cell clone by another, or coexistence of clones in the same niche.Upper panel) Stem cells differ in the cell cycle rate for symmetric renewal λ1. Lower panel) Stem cells differ in the cell cycle rate for symmetric differentiation λ3.
