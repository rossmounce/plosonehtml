The expression of ERα was evaluated by western blot analysis. The anti-actin Ab was used to validate equivalent loading protein. B. ERβ1 expression was evaluated by RT-PCR from total mRNA extracted from the indicated cell lines using primers specific for human ERβ1 and the housekeeping aldolase genes. C. Mammary tumor cell lines MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 361, SKBr3, BT474, BT549 and T47D were analyzed by FACS to reveal the expression level of β4 integrin subunit, ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors.</p>
