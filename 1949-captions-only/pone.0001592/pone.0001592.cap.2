                Figure 2.  The α6β4 influence Akt activation by ErbB-3.A. BT549, MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 361, BT474 and SKBr3 cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs and then the cells were spread onto LM5 and extracted in detergent. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunobloting to evaluate the relative expression of β4 and phospho-Akt. Total-Akt Ab was used to validate equivalent loading of protein in each lane. B. MDA-MB 361, BT474 and SKBr3 cells were transiently transfected for 48 hrs with either scrambled or specific β4-shRNA and ErbB-3 siRNA. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 hrs and extracted in detergent. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunobloting to evaluate the relative expression of β4, ErbB-3 and phospho-Akt. Hsp70 Ab was used to validate equivalent loading of protein in each lane.
