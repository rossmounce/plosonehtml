                Figure 3.  ErbB-3 expression influences survival and invasion of mammary tumor cells treated under TAM treatment.A. SKBr3, MDA-MB 361, BT474, T47D and MDAMB231 cells after three days of hormone deprivation were transiently transfected with either scrambled or specific ErbB-3 siRNA. Where specified, 24 hrs after transfection scrambled and ErbB3 interfered cells were pre-incubated for 24 hours at 37°C with TAM 2.5 µM. 48 hours following transfection, the cell death was evaluated by Trypan-blue exclusion. Statistical differences were evaluated by T test (p&lt;0.05). B. Equivalent amounts of total cell lysate derived from the cell lines described in A were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunobloting to evaluate the expression level of PARP cleavage. Hsp70 Ab was used to validate equivalent loading of protein in each lane. C. SKBr3, MDA-MB 361, BT474, T47D and MDAMB231 cells transfected as described in A were assayed for their ability to invade matrigel in the absence of hormone and under TAM treatment. Statistical differences were evaluated by T test (p&lt;0.05).
