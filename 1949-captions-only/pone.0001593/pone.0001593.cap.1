                Figure 1.  Frequency distribution of LD between unlinked SNPs in the BxD mouse recombinant inbred lines.A Black bars represent the observed frequency of pairs of unlinked SNPs at increasing levels of LD (measured as r2). White bars show the distribution of LD in 1000 simulated sets of RILs. The errors bars are standard deviations. As expected the distribution of the observed data is shifted to the right. B In the right tail of the distribution, the excess of unlinked SNPs that exhibit very strong LD relative to the neutral expectation remains consistently significant. It should be noted that very high levels of LD were observed in the simulated dataset but these are clearly outnumbered by the real data.
