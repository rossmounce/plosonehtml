                Figure 2.  Consumption of 3% ethanol explained by the interaction between genes involved in oxidative stress and detoxification.A Correspondence between the observed amount of ethanol consumed by BxD mice and the predicted values based on the genotype at four genes. The correlation between the observed and predicted values is 81% and the pattern is significant after Bonferroni correction for testing 626 phenotypes at p = 6.5×10−5. B Ethanol consumption of the four two-locus genotype classes based on Paraoxonase 2 and Nrf2. The error bars are standard error of the mean. The interaction between the two genes is apparent as the effect size of the increaser genotype at either gene depends on the genotype at the other locus. This pattern is very likely to be biologically relevant as Nrf2 is a known regulator of the expression of antioxidant proteins and Paraoxonase 2 is an antioxidant protein.
