A higher value represents a larger genetic distance between populations considering two genes at a time. White bars represent the observed frequency calculated from randomly selected NS. The distribution based on NSCS is shifted to the right. B Starting from relatively low levels of genetic differentiation the NSCS derived trans-haplotypes are significantly in excess compared to the random variability in F<sub>st</sub> observerd in the NS.</p>
