                Figure 3.  Frequency distribution of genetic distance between three major human populations at pairwise combinations of non-synonymous coding vs. neutral SNPs.A Black bars represent the observed frequency of Fst calculated for combinations of NSCS at different genes. A higher value represents a larger genetic distance between populations considering two genes at a time. White bars represent the observed frequency calculated from randomly selected NS. The distribution based on NSCS is shifted to the right. B Starting from relatively low levels of genetic differentiation the NSCS derived trans-haplotypes are significantly in excess compared to the random variability in Fst observerd in the NS.
