                Figure 4.  Distribution of two-locus Fst from a coalescent simulation of three major human populations.Simulated SNPs randomly called NSCS vs. NS exhibit no difference in pair-wise genetic distance between populations. Simulated SNPs were ascertained for being polymorphic in all three populations. Results from 100 replicates and a total of 2.5 billion combinations are summarized, with the error bars representing standard deviations.
