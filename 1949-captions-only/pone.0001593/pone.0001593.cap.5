Instead the phenotype depends on the specific combination of protein variants present at the two genes. B Given the small number of individuals homozygous for the minor alleles at either gene (15 out of 766 individuals), only the four common genotype classes are depicted here. A significant interaction between the genes can be observed as both the double heterozygous individuals and the individuals homozygous for both major alleles exhibit increased levels of anxiety/depression. The effect size of any given protein variant is dependent on the variant present at the other locus in the same individual.</p>
