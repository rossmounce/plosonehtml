                Figure 1.  Detection of PRAT satellite transcripts.(A) RT-PCR with primers RATZEB1 and RATZEB2 on total RNA from adults (ad), larvae (lar) and pupae (pup). For each reaction PCR was conducted in parallel without prior reverse transcription as a control for genomic DNA contamination, while 0 is control with no template. M is size standard. (B) Total RNA separated on 1.2% denaturing agarose gel (18 µg and 13 µg from adults and larvae, respectively) and corresponding Northern blot after hybridization with 32P labelled PRAT DNA probe. 18 µg of adult RNA digested with RNase A represents control for residual genomic DNA (+R) while 18 µg of D. melanogaster RNA (c) is used as a negative control. (C) Dot blot analysis of total RNA, using 32P labelled RNA probes for forward and reverse strand, respectively. 20 µg and 50 µg of larval RNA digested with RNase A represent control for genomic DNA contamination (+RNase) while the same amounts of S. cerevisiae RNA are used as a negative control (−control). Complementary transcripts, in amounts indicated, are used as a positive control (+control) and for calibration. (D) 30 µg of larval low molecular weight RNA (lar) separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel and Northern blot analysis with RNA probe for reverse strand, labelled with 32P. Hybridization was performed at 22°C and blot was exposed for one day on autoradiography film. Longer exposition as well as rehybridization with RNA probe for forward strand did not reveal signal in the siRNA region. D. melanogaster RNA (dm) serves as a size marker.
