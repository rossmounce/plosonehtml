                Figure 2.  Subcellular localization and polyadenylation of transcripts.(A) Agarose gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic (cy), nuclear (nu), polyadenylated (a+) and non-polyadenylated (a-) RNA and hybridization profile obtained with RNA probe for forward strand. 13 µg of cy and 1.3 µg of nu RNA extracted in parallel from the same sample of adults are loaded as well as 1 µg of a+ and 17 µg of a-. Cytoplasmic (13 µg) and non-polyadenylated RNAs (17 µg) treated with RNase A (+Rc and +Ra, respectively) serve as controls for genomic DNA contamination. S. cerevisiae RNA (c) represents negative hybridization control. (B) Dot blot analysis of total RNA (45 µg), polyadenylated RNA (a+, 6 µg), non-polyadenylated RNA (a-, 40 µg) using PRAT RNA probes for forward and reverse strand, as well as of cytoplasmic (cy) and nuclear (nu) RNA, in amounts indicated, using RNA probe for reverse strand. S. cerevisiae RNA is used as a negative control in amounts exactly matching those of above mentioned samples (−control). For the purpose of PRAT transcripts quantification in different RNA fractions, signal intensity was reduced for the signal detected in the corresponding negative control. Due to the low signal intensity in the a+ fraction of reverse strand precise quantification was not possible. Complementary PRAT transcripts, in amounts indicated, are used as a positive control (+control) and for calibration. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA digested with RNase A represent control for genomic DNA contamination (+RNase).
