Cytoplasmic (13 µg) and non-polyadenylated RNAs (17 µg) treated with RNase A (+Rc and +Ra, respectively) serve as controls for genomic DNA contamination. <em>S. cerevisiae</em> RNA (c) represents negative hybridization control. <em>(B)</em> Dot blot analysis of total RNA (45 µg), polyadenylated RNA (a+, 6 µg), non-polyadenylated RNA (a-, 40 µg) using PRAT RNA probes for forward and reverse strand, as well as of cytoplasmic (cy) and nuclear (nu) RNA, in amounts indicated, using RNA probe for reverse strand. <em>S. cerevisiae</em> RNA is used as a negative control in amounts exactly matching those of above mentioned samples (−control). For the purpose of PRAT transcripts quantification in different RNA fractions, signal intensity was reduced for the signal detected in the corresponding negative control. Due to the low signal intensity in the a+ fraction of reverse strand precise quantification was not possible. Complementary PRAT transcripts, in amounts indicated, are used as a positive control (+control) and for calibration. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA digested with RNase A represent control for genomic DNA contamination (+RNase).</p>
