                Figure 4.  Mapping of transcription start sites by 5′ RLM-RACE.(A) RT-PCR products of reactions with either RATZEB1 (left) or RATZEB2 (right) primer, resolved on agarose gel. –TAP lanes represent corresponding negative controls obtained without pyrophosphatase treatment. M is size standard. (B) Sequences of cloned 5′ RACE products obtained with RATZEB2 are aligned with forward strand of consensus PRAT dimer (above). Sequences obtained with RATZEB1 primer are compared to reverse strand of consensus PRAT monomer (below). Missing parts of sequences are marked by a dashed line. Accession numbers of sequences obtained by 5′RLM-RACE are EF209039-EF209047.
