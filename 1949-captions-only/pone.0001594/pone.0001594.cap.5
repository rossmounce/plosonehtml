                Figure 5.  Mapping of polyadenylation sites by 3′ RLM-RACE.(A) PCR products of reaction with RATZEB1 (left) and RATZEB2 (right) resolved on agarose gel. –RT lanes represent corresponding negative control reactions in which reverse transcription was omitted. (B) Sequences of cloned 3′ RACE products obtained with RATZEB1 are shown above, aligned with forward strand of consensus PRAT trimer. Products of reaction with RATZEB2, depicted below, are compared to reverse strand of consensus PRAT monomer. Poly(A) tails are marked with grey shading. Missing parts of sequences are marked by a dashed line. Accession numbers of sequences obtained by 3′RLM-RACE are EF209034-EF209038.
