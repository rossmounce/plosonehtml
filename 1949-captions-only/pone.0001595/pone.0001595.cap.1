                Figure 1.  Flies expressing CUG repeats show shorter lifespan.Average percentage of live flies, with the genotypes indicated, versus age (in days). (A) Whereas control flies showed an average lifespan of 57 (UAS-i(CTG)480/+; n = 80) and 34 (Mhc-Gal4/+; n = 40) days, i(CUG)480-expressing flies lived 13 days in average (n = 60). Differences in lifespan curves were highly significant when comparing i(CUG)480-expressing flies to UAS-i(CTG)480/+ control flies (p&lt;0.0001, Log-Rank test) but not to Mhc-Gal4/+ controls. (B) Expression of i(CUG)480 transgene in an ubiquitous manner (da-Gal4&gt;UAS-i(CTG)480) also reduced fly survival. Control flies showed a median survival of 57 (UAS-i(CTG)480/+, n = 80) and 55 (da-Gal4/+, n = 40) days. Median survival for i(CUG)480-expressing flies was of 41 days (n = 80), and lifespan curves for i(CUG)480-expressing flies and both controls showed differences that were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001, Log-Rank test). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism4 software.
