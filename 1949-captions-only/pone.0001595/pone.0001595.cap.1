(A) Whereas control flies showed an average lifespan of 57 (<em>UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub>/+</em>; n = 80) and 34 (<em>Mhc-Gal4/+</em>; n = 40) days, i(CUG)<sub>480</sub>-expressing flies lived 13 days in average (n = 60). Differences in lifespan curves were highly significant when comparing i(CUG)<sub>480</sub>-expressing flies to <em>UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub>/+</em> control flies (p&lt;0.0001, Log-Rank test) but not to <em>Mhc-Gal4/+</em> controls. (B) Expression of i(CUG)<sub>480</sub> transgene in an ubiquitous manner (<em>da-Gal4&gt;UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub></em>) also reduced fly survival. Control flies showed a median survival of 57 (<em>UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub>/+</em>, n = 80) and 55 (<em>da-Gal4/+</em>, n = 40) days. Median survival for i(CUG)<sub>480</sub>-expressing flies was of 41 days (n = 80), and lifespan curves for i(CUG)<sub>480</sub>-expressing flies and both controls showed differences that were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001, Log-Rank test). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism4 software.</p>
