IFMs were studied in 2–3-day old (A–C) or 38-day old (D–F) flies. Expression of (CUG)<sub>60</sub> RNA was not toxic to muscle fibres (B), and IFMs did not degenerate over time (E). Expression of i(CUG)<sub>480</sub> RNA in IFMs led to vacuolization (arrowheads) and muscle disorganization (C). Muscle degeneration and wasting was conspicuous in 38-day old flies with large vacuoles (arrowheads), lower density of myofibrils per muscle (arrow) and missing muscles (asterisk). Results consistent with these have been obtained independently <a href="#pone.0001595-Haro1">[5]</a>. (G) Cross-sectional area of left dorso longitudinal muscle 45e <a href="#pone.0001595-Bate1">[51]</a> in 2 day-old control (<em>Mhc-Gal4/+</em>) and DM1 model flies (<em>Mhc-Gal4&gt;UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub></em>). n = 12 (control) and n = 34 (CUG expressing). (H) Muscle degeneration was measured as the frequency of vacuolar pathology and muscle area reduction, according to the following rating scale: vacuoles with diameter larger or smaller than 8 µm, or showing 45% or less of the normal muscle area. Muscle 45e was measured in 3-4 thorax sections per animal and a total of 15 young (2-day-old) or 13 aged (38-day-old) flies were analyzed. Control (<em>Mhc-Gal4/+</em>) and <em>Mhc-Gal4&gt;UAS-(CTG)<sub>60</sub></em> flies showed no muscle phenotype 2 or 38 days after eclosion. Tangential (I, J) and frontal (K, L) sections of adult <em>Drosophila</em> eyes with the genotypes <em>gmr-Gal4/+</em> (I, K) and <em>gmr-Gal4/UAS-i(CUG)<sub>480</sub></em> (J, L) at 25°C. (I) Tangential sections exhibited a normal complement of photoreceptors per ommatidial unit (arrowheads point to rhabdomeres), although some pigment cells were absent. (J) Expression of expanded CUG repeats caused general disorganization of the eye retina. (K) In controls, rhabdomeres extend from the apical to the basal side of the retina (arrowheads) and the layer of pigment cell feet forms the fenestrated membrane (arrow), which is separated by the basement membrane (white arrowhead) from the underlying subretinal cells (bent arrow). (L) Eyes expressing i(CUG)<sub>480</sub> RNA lacked rhabdomeres and showed general disorganization of pigment cells. Fenestrated membranes were thinner and showed gaps (arrow). Subretinal cells were not tightly apposed to the basement membrane (bent arrow).</p>
