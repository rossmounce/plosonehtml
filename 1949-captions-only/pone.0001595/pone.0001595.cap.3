(E) <em>sev</em>-<em>Gal4</em> driven expression of (CUG)<sub>60</sub> RNA in eye precursors exhibits mild external defects, only altering mechanosensory bristles. Expression of i(CUG)<sub>480</sub> RNA driven by the same Gal4 generates a rough and reduced eye (H), a phenotype that is specifically suppressed by the simultaneous expression of human MBNL1 (G) but not by expression of the unrelated GFP protein (F). The CUG-dependent eye phenotype was not modified by the weak <em>mbl<sup>7103</sup></em> allele (I), and only slightly modified by <em>mbl<sup>E27</sup></em> (J). However, the compound heterozygote enhanced roughness and eye size reduction (K). The compound heterozygote <em>mbl<sup>7103</sup></em>/<em>mbl<sup>E27</sup></em> displayed normal eyes in the absence of i(CUG)<sub>480</sub> RNA.</p>
