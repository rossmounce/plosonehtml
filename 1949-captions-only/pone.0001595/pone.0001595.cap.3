                Figure 3.  Muscleblind forms nuclear inclusions with CUG repeat RNA and genetically interacts with repeat RNA phenotypes in vivo.i(CUG)480 RNA and MblC:GFP were coexpressed in adult flies using a hs-Gal4 line (A–C). i(CUG)480 transcripts detected by FISH (red; A) and MblC:GFP detected by the GFP tag (green; B). Red and green channels are shown merged in (C), with nuclei counterstained with DAPI. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Drosophila eyes (D–K). (D) External morphology of reference strain OrR. (E) sev-Gal4 driven expression of (CUG)60 RNA in eye precursors exhibits mild external defects, only altering mechanosensory bristles. Expression of i(CUG)480 RNA driven by the same Gal4 generates a rough and reduced eye (H), a phenotype that is specifically suppressed by the simultaneous expression of human MBNL1 (G) but not by expression of the unrelated GFP protein (F). The CUG-dependent eye phenotype was not modified by the weak mbl7103 allele (I), and only slightly modified by mblE27 (J). However, the compound heterozygote enhanced roughness and eye size reduction (K). The compound heterozygote mbl7103/mblE27 displayed normal eyes in the absence of i(CUG)480 RNA.
