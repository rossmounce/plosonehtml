                Figure 4.  CUG repeat RNA misregulates alternative splicing of muscle genes CG30084 and TnT.RT-PCR products from CG30084 (A) and TnT (B) at the stages and from animals with the genotypes indicated. Bar graph representing intensities of ethidium bromide fluorescence (ranging from 0 to 100%, which equalled saturation) of band E (CG30084; C) and band D (TnT; D) from the specified genotypes. All RT-PCRs were within the linear range of amplification. Abbreviations used: 16–18 h after egg laying embryos (E); 2-day old pupae (P); 6–30 h after eclosion adults (A). All missplicing events were detected at least twice from independent RNA extractions.
