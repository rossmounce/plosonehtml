Bar graph representing intensities of ethidium bromide fluorescence (ranging from 0 to 100%, which equalled saturation) of band E (<em>CG30084</em>; C) and band D (<em>TnT;</em> D) from the specified genotypes. All RT-PCRs were within the linear range of amplification. Abbreviations used: 16–18 h after egg laying embryos (E); 2-day old pupae (P); 6–30 h after eclosion adults (A). All missplicing events were detected at least twice from independent RNA extractions.</p>
