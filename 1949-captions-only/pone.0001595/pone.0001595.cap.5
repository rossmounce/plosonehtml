                Figure 5.  Dominant genetic enhancers and chemical suppressors of CUG-induced phenotypes.Stereomicroscope (A, B) and SEM (C–H) views of adult Drosophila eyes. Female flies with the genotype sev-Gal4 UAS-i(CTG)480/+ (A, C, E) show eyes smaller than normal and externally rough. Both features increased in female flies heterozygous for svp1 (B), Aly02267 (D), thread4 (F) and vikingk00236 (H) in the same genetic background whereas overexpression of th (thEP3308, G) considerably improved morphology. Flies were raised at 25°C. (I) Percentage of viable females from crosses between the X-linked 103Y-Gal4 line and lines carrying the UAS-i(CTG)480 or UAS-(CTG)60 transgenes (note that only F1 females express CUG RNA) at different temperatures. Only expression of 480 CUG RNA exhibited a temperature-dependent semilethal phenotype. Three independent MB-specific Gal4 driver lines showed a similar behaviour. (J) Emerged/non-emerged ratio measures the likelihood of survival of CUG-expressing females in control (−drug) and drug-treated flies (+drug).
