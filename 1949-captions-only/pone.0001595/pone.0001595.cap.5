Female flies with the genotype <em>sev-Gal4 UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub></em>/+ (A, C, E) show eyes smaller than normal and externally rough. Both features increased in female flies heterozygous for <em>svp<sup>1</sup></em> (B), <em>Aly<sup>02267</sup></em> (D), <em>thread<sup>4</sup></em> (F) and <em>viking<sup>k00236</sup></em> (H) in the same genetic background whereas overexpression of <em>th</em> (<em>th<sup>EP3308</sup></em>, G) considerably improved morphology. Flies were raised at 25°C. (I) Percentage of viable females from crosses between the X-linked <em>103Y-Gal4</em> line and lines carrying the <em>UAS-i(CTG)<sub>480</sub></em> or <em>UAS-(CTG)<sub>60</sub></em> transgenes (note that only F<sub>1</sub> females express CUG RNA) at different temperatures. Only expression of 480 CUG RNA exhibited a temperature-dependent semilethal phenotype. Three independent MB-specific Gal4 driver lines showed a similar behaviour. (J) Emerged/non-emerged ratio measures the likelihood of survival of CUG-expressing females in control (−drug) and drug-treated flies (+drug).
