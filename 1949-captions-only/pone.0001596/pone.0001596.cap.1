The calculated N<sub>ef</sub> assumes a generation time of 20 years following Hey <a href="#pone.0001596-Hey1">[16]</a>; alternatively, using a generation time of 25 years <a href="#pone.0001596-Fenner1">[55]</a> would uniformly decrease all estimates of N<sub>ef</sub> by 20%. “X” marks the median coalescent time with its 95% CI given in brackets. The shaded regions highlight two periods of substantial population growth. This skyline plot provides the principal evidence for our three-stage model of New World colonization, i.e. the three stages that are depicted and labeled here.</p>
