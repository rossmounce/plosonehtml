                Figure 2.  Conserved kinase motifs in ACAD10 and ACAD11.ACAD10 and ACAD11 contain conserved kinase motifs such as the nucleotide position loop, a phosphotransferase motif, and part of a choline kinase motif. Residues in pink are highly conserved; residues in green are commonly large hydrophobic amino acids. ACAD10 and ACAD11 are aligned with the choline kinase 1NW1 and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases 1ND4 and 1J7L for comparison.
