(B) Functional categorization of 127 proteins showing abundance changes of 1.5 fold or greater due to rapamycin treatment. The number of proteins from each category, and their relative percentages are also indicated on the pie chart. (C) Correlation or anticorrelation (described as similar or opposite changes between proteins and RNA, respectively) for rapamycin affected proteins (obtained via proteomic analysis in this study) and gene transcripts (obtained by microarray analysis of rapamycin treated yeast cells; *<a href="#pone.0001598-Hardwick1">[6]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001598-Huang1">[7]</a>, and heatshock/oxidative stress; **<a href="#pone.0001598-Gasch1">[13]</a>).</p>
