(B) Rapamycin sensitivity of <em>SSA1 SSA2</em>, <em>ssa1-3 ssa2-2</em>, and <em>ssa1-3 ssa2-2 hsf1P215Q</em> cells. Cells were grown to saturation at 25°C and serial dilutions (50,000, 5000, and 500 cells per spot) were spotted on YPD plates supplemented with 25 nM rapamycin or drug carrier solvent (methanol) and assayed for growth at 25°C for the indicated durations of time. <em>ssa1-3 ssa2-2</em> cells and derivatives were grown identically but spotted at a density of 5000 and 500 cells/spot.</p>
