                Figure 2.  Cells with increased Hsf1 transcriptional activity are hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment.(A) Rapamycin sensitivity of HSF1, hsf1-R206S, F256S, and hsf1-R256S cells (upper panel). FPR1-dependent rapamycin sensitivity of hsf1-R206S, F256S cells (lower panel). (B) Rapamycin sensitivity of SSA1 SSA2, ssa1-3 ssa2-2, and ssa1-3 ssa2-2 hsf1P215Q cells. Cells were grown to saturation at 25°C and serial dilutions (50,000, 5000, and 500 cells per spot) were spotted on YPD plates supplemented with 25 nM rapamycin or drug carrier solvent (methanol) and assayed for growth at 25°C for the indicated durations of time. ssa1-3 ssa2-2 cells and derivatives were grown identically but spotted at a density of 5000 and 500 cells/spot.
