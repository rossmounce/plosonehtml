(B) mRNA levels of diverse classes of Hsf1 targets in <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells relative to <em>HSF1</em> cells. The promoter region of <em>HSP12</em> is known to have ‘step’ heat shock elements (HSEs), while that of <em>SSA3/4, HSP78</em>, and <em>HSP42</em> have perfect HSEs <a href="#pone.0001598-Yamamoto1">[44]</a>. Although canonical HSEs have not been found in promoter regions of <em>PIR3</em> and <em>YRO2</em>, these were identified in global CHIP-on-CHIP experiments as Hsf1 targets <a href="#pone.0001598-Hahn1">[55]</a>. <em>CUP1-1</em> has a variant HSE <a href="#pone.0001598-Yamamoto1">[44]</a>. Cells were grown at 25°C, and processed for RNA isolation, real-time PCR analysis, and analyzed as described in <a href="#pone.0001598.s001">materials and methods</a> section. Relative expression of each gene was normalized to actin and expressed as an average fold induction in <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells versus unperturbed wild type cells.</p>
