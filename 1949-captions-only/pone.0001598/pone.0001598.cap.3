                Figure 3.  Effect of hsf1-R206S, F256S mutation on expression of HSE4Ptt-CYC1-LacZ reporter and Hsf1 target genes.(A) hsf1-R206S, F256S and isogenic HSF1 cells transformed with HSE4Ptt-CYC1-lacZ plasmid [53] were grown overnight in minimal selective media at 23°C to an OD600 of 0.5 units, and then shifted to 25°C, 29°C, or 33°C, for 90 minutes prior to determination of β-galactosidase activity. (B) mRNA levels of diverse classes of Hsf1 targets in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells relative to HSF1 cells. The promoter region of HSP12 is known to have ‘step’ heat shock elements (HSEs), while that of SSA3/4, HSP78, and HSP42 have perfect HSEs [44]. Although canonical HSEs have not been found in promoter regions of PIR3 and YRO2, these were identified in global CHIP-on-CHIP experiments as Hsf1 targets [55]. CUP1-1 has a variant HSE [44]. Cells were grown at 25°C, and processed for RNA isolation, real-time PCR analysis, and analyzed as described in materials and methods section. Relative expression of each gene was normalized to actin and expressed as an average fold induction in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells versus unperturbed wild type cells.
