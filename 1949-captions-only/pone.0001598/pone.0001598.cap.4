(B) Expression level of ribosomal protein (RP) genes and <em>RAP1</em>, a positive regulator of RP genes, upon rapamycin treatment in <em>HSF1</em> cells (left panel) and in <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells (right panel, in absence of rapamycin treatment) (C) Mobility of Gln3-<em>myc</em><sub>13</sub> in <em>HSF1</em> cells treated with or without rapamycin and <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells with or without rapamycin treatment as indicated above. Cells were grown to log-phase at 25Â°C and treated with 200nM rapamycin or methanol alone and processed for RNA isolation or total protein extraction as described in <a href="#pone.0001598.s001">materials and methods</a> section.</p>
