                Figure 4.  Reduced TOR signaling in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells.(A) Expression level of genes representing five different pathways repressed by TOR function, upon rapamycin treatment in HSF1 cells (left panel), and in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells (right panel, in absence of rapamycin treatment). (B) Expression level of ribosomal protein (RP) genes and RAP1, a positive regulator of RP genes, upon rapamycin treatment in HSF1 cells (left panel) and in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells (right panel, in absence of rapamycin treatment) (C) Mobility of Gln3-myc13 in HSF1 cells treated with or without rapamycin and hsf1-R206S, F256S cells with or without rapamycin treatment as indicated above. Cells were grown to log-phase at 25Â°C and treated with 200nM rapamycin or methanol alone and processed for RNA isolation or total protein extraction as described in materials and methods section.
