                Figure 5.  Role of Msn2/4 and Gln3/Gat1 in TOR-regulated phenotypes seen in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells.(A) Effect of deleting MSN2, 4 on elevated expression of Msn2/4 targets in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells (B) Effect of deleting MSN2, 4 on rapamycin induced expression of Msn2/4 targets in HSF1 cells (C) Effect of deleting GLN3 alone or both GLN3 and GAT1 on elevated expression of NCR genes in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells (D) Effect of MSN2/4, GLN3/GAT1, or HYR1 deletions on rapamycin sensitivity of hsf1-R206S, F256S cells. Relative expression of each gene was normalized to actin and expressed as an average fold induction relative to wild type cells.
