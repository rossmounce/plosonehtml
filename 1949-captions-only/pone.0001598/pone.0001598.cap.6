                Figure 6.  Deletion of Hsf1 target genes, PIR3 and YRO2 partially suppress TOR-regulated phenotypes of hsf1-R206S, F256S cells.A) Suppression of rapamycin sensitivity of hsf1-R206S, F256S cells by deletion of PIR3 and YRO2. HSF1 and hsf1-R206S, F256S cells bearing the indicated gene deletions were grown to saturation at 25°C and 5000 cells each were spotted on YPD plates supplemented with methanol alone (rapamycin solvent), 10 nM, and 25 nM rapamycin, respectively. B) PIR3 deletion reduced expression of multiple TOR-repressed genes in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells. Expression level of genes was monitored by RT-PCR as explained in materials and methods section. C) Effect of PIR3 and YRO2 deletion on temperature sensitivity of hsf1-R206S, F256S cells. Indicated strains were streaked out on YPD plates and allowed to grow 3 days at 34°C.
