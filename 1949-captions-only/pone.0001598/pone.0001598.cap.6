B) <em>PIR3</em> deletion reduced expression of multiple TOR-repressed genes in <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells. Expression level of genes was monitored by RT-PCR as explained in <a href="#pone.0001598.s001">materials and methods</a> section. C) Effect of <em>PIR3</em> and <em>YRO2</em> deletion on temperature sensitivity of <em>hsf1-R206S, F256S</em> cells. Indicated strains were streaked out on YPD plates and allowed to grow 3 days at 34°C.</p>
