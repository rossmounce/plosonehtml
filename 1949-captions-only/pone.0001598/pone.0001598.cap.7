                Figure 7.  Over expression of MSN2, MSN4 or HYR1 does not inhibit TOR signaling (A) Effect of over expression of MSN2, MSN4 or HYR1 on rapamycin resistance of wild type cells.Wild type HS170T cells (HSF1 cells isogenic to hsf1-R206S, F256S cells used in this study) were transformed with 2μ plasmids for over expression of the relevant genes, and spotted on selective media supplemented with 25 nM Rapamycin (or methanol) at 50,000, 5000, and 500 cells per spot and assayed for growth at 25°C (B) Effect of MSN2 over expression on TOR signaling ‘readouts’ assayed by real-time PCR (C) Effect of MSN2 over expression versus rapamycin treatment, on expression level of CTT1, a classical Msn2 target gene. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR conditions, and analysis of data are described in materials and methods section.
