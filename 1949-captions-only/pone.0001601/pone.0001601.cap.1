                Figure 1.  Effects of ventilation on indirect indices of injury in the BALF.(A) Mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours) resulted in increased cell count in BALF. (B) Lavage neutrophil cell count increased following ventilation (% of total cell count). (C) Ventilation led to significant total protein increase in the BALF. *represents significant differences between ventilated and control animals, p&lt;0.05. Control = no ventilation.
