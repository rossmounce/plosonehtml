                Figure 10.  Mechanical ventilation induces MMP8 and GADD45α expression in mice.(A) Quantified MMP8 activation data, expressed as active/pro-MMP8 following mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours). Arrows point at different forms of MMP8. (B) Increased GADD45α expression was also detected after 8 hours ventilation and expressed as GADD45α/loading control β-actin. Representative blots are shown. *represents significant differences between ventilation and control animals.
