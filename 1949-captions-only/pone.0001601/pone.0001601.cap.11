                Figure 11.  Indirect lung injury indices of mice deficient in mmp8.(A) Total protein levels were significantly higher in mmp8−/− mice than in wild-type mice following mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours). (B) Microvascular permeability, assessed with EB dye extravasation was significantly higher in mmp8−/− mice than in wild-type mice following mechanical ventilation. (C) Total cell counts were not modified by MMP8. (D) MMP8 did not affect neutrophil recruitment to the lung at 8 hours. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals, † represents significant differences between wild-type and mmp8−/− mice.
