(B) Microvascular permeability, assessed with EB dye extravasation was significantly higher in <em>mmp8</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice than in wild-type mice following mechanical ventilation. (C) Total cell counts were not modified by MMP8. (D) MMP8 did not affect neutrophil recruitment to the lung at 8 hours. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals, † represents significant differences between wild-type and <em>mmp8</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
