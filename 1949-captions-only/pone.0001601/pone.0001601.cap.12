                Figure 12.  Theoretical interactions of MAPK, GADD45α and MMP8 in alveolar epithelial cells.The p38 and JNK MAPKs transmit injury signals from the cell surface to the nucleus resulting in inflammation and apoptosis. Alveolar-capillary permeability interacts with inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. JNK1 MAPK inhibits GADD45α expression, which effects apoptotic signaling. MMP8 protects against increased alveolo-capillary permeability. Dashed line = theoretical connection. Arrow = activation, bar = inhibition
