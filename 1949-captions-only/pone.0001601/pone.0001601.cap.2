                Figure 2.  Time course of mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury with high tidal volume.(A) Total cell count increased following ventilation (20 ml/kg) for 2 and 4 hours (*10000 cells/ml). (B) BALF total protein levels (microgram/ml) were augmented by mechanical ventilation. *represents significant differences between ventilated and control animals, p&lt;0.05.
