                Figure 3.  Mechanical ventilation-induced neutrophil leukocyte infiltration in lung tissue.(A) Control (non-ventilated) lung tissue. (B) Mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury following mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours). Arrows point at mononuclear leukocytes in the alveoli. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, 40-fold magnification, scalebar = 50 micrometer. A representative picture is shown.
