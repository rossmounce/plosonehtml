                Figure 4.  JNK and p38 MAPK protein activation increased following ventilation.(A) Quantified c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation data, expressed as phospho/dephospho (total) JNK following mechanical ventilation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). (B) Increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation was also detected after 4 hours ventilation and expressed as phospho/total p38. Representative blots for phosphorylated and total forms of proteins are shown. *represents significant differences between ventilation and control animals.
