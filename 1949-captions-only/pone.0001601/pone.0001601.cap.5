                Figure 5.  Lung injury and cell death measurement in wild-type, mkk3−/− and jnk1−/− mice.(A) Reduced total cell count was detected in genetically deficient mice following ventilation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). (B) Tumor necrosis factor-α levels were reduced in genetically deficient mice after ventilation (20 ml/kg, 2 hours). (C) Neutrophil levels were lower in genetically deficient mice following ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours). (D) Quantified TUNEL staining for cell death showed that wild-type mice have increased cell death when compared to mkk3−/− and jnk1−/− mice following volume ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours). Values expressed as number of TUNEL staining cells/1000 cells. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals, † represents significant differences between wild-type and genetically deficient animals.
