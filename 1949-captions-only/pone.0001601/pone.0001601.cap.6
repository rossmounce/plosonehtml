No differences in total protein levels were observed in the <em>jnk1</em><sup>−/− </sup>mice. (B) Wild-type and <em>mkk3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice responded to mechanical ventilation with pulmonary edema formation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). Pulmonary edema formation was quantified by measuring the wet and desiccated dry weight of lung tissue. No significant lung water changes were detected in <em>jnk1</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice. (C) Increased microvascular permeability was detected with Evans Blue (EB) dye extravasation method in wild-type and <em>mkk3</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice following mechanical ventilation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). Mice lacking <em>jnk1</em> gene did not show increased permeability following mechanical ventilation. Changes in permeability are expressed as a ratio of lung tissue/blood plasma to correct for differences in volumes of injected dye to the circulation.. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals. <sup>#</sup> N.S. = non-significant change between control and ventilated mice.</p>
