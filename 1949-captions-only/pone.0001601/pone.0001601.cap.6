                Figure 6.  Alveolar protein content, lung microvascular permeability, and wet-to-dry weight ratio measurement in wild-type, mkk3−/− and jnk1−/− mice.(A) Total protein levels were significantly increased in wild-type and mkk3−/− mice following ventilation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). No differences in total protein levels were observed in the jnk1−/− mice. (B) Wild-type and mkk3−/− mice responded to mechanical ventilation with pulmonary edema formation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). Pulmonary edema formation was quantified by measuring the wet and desiccated dry weight of lung tissue. No significant lung water changes were detected in jnk1−/− mice. (C) Increased microvascular permeability was detected with Evans Blue (EB) dye extravasation method in wild-type and mkk3−/− mice following mechanical ventilation (20 ml/kg, 4 hours). Mice lacking jnk1 gene did not show increased permeability following mechanical ventilation. Changes in permeability are expressed as a ratio of lung tissue/blood plasma to correct for differences in volumes of injected dye to the circulation.. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals. # N.S. = non-significant change between control and ventilated mice.
