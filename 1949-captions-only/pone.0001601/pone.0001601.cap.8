                Figure 8.  Differential gene expression change following mechanical ventilation in wild-type and jnk1−/− mice.(A) The pattern of 103 differentially expressed genes is displayed. The gene expression profile of controls and animals subjected to mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours) is compared. Confirmed genes: growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-45alpha (gadd45α), WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (wisp2), activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) and mmp8 are highlighted. red = upregulation, blue = downregulaton, yellow = null expression. Big columns represent wild-type control, wild-type ventilated, jnk1−/− control and jnk1−/− ventilated mice. Small columns show the gene expression profile of one animal. Each row represents one gene. Gene symbols are shown on right side of the panel. For complete gene names please refer to Table S3. (B) Microarray and confirmatory TaqMan RT-PCR expression profile of gadd45α, wisp2, atf4 and mmp8 genes. The increased expression gadd45α following ventilation was identified by microarray and verified with RT-PCR. Jnk1−/− mice had a higher expression of gadd45α after ventilation than wild-type mice. Wisp2 expression was decreased in both wild-type and jnk1−/− mice following mechanical ventilation. RT-PCR confirmed the microarray findings. Microarray results showed that atf4 gene was regulated only in jnk1−/− mice and RT-PCR verified this finding. Mmp8 showed increased expression with ventilation on microarray and with RT-PCR verification, which was similar in both wild-type and jnk1−/− mice. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals, †represents significant difference between wild-type ventilated and jnk1−/− ventilated mice.
