The gene expression profile of controls and animals subjected to mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours) is compared. Confirmed genes: growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-45alpha (<em>gadd45α</em>), WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (<em>wisp2</em>), activating transcription factor 4 (<em>atf4</em>) and <em>mmp8</em> are highlighted. red = upregulation, blue = downregulaton, yellow = null expression. Big columns represent wild-type control, wild-type ventilated, <em>jnk1<sup>−/−</sup></em> control and <em>jnk1<sup>−/−</sup></em> ventilated mice. Small columns show the gene expression profile of one animal. Each row represents one gene. Gene symbols are shown on right side of the panel. For complete gene names please refer to <a href="#pone.0001601.s003">Table S3</a>. (B) Microarray and confirmatory TaqMan RT-PCR expression profile of <em>gadd45α</em>, <em>wisp2</em>, <em>atf4</em> and <em>mmp8</em> genes. The increased expression <em>gadd45α</em> following ventilation was identified by microarray and verified with RT-PCR. <em>Jnk1</em><sup>−/−</sup> mice had a higher expression of <em>gadd45α</em> after ventilation than wild-type mice. <em>Wisp2</em> expression was decreased in both wild-type and <em>jnk1</em><sup>−/− </sup>mice following mechanical ventilation. RT-PCR confirmed the microarray findings. Microarray results showed that <em>atf4</em> gene was regulated only in <em>jnk1</em><sup>−/− </sup>mice and RT-PCR verified this finding. <em>Mmp8</em> showed increased expression with ventilation on microarray and with RT-PCR verification, which was similar in both wild-type and <em>jnk1</em><sup>−/− </sup>mice. *represents significant differences between control and ventilated animals, †represents significant difference between wild-type ventilated and <em>jnk1<sup>−/−</sup></em> ventilated mice.</p>
