                Figure 9.  Immunohistochemistry dual staining for GADD45α and MMP8.Wild-type animals were stained for GADD45α and MMP8 prior to (A) and following mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg, 8 hours), (B). Both gene products showed increased expression following ventilation. The staining pattern suggests cytosolic staining in multiple cell types for GADD45α and staining for MMP8 restricted to inflammatory cells at the cell membrane. Large arrowheads indicate GADD45α staining cells. Small arrows indicate MMP8 staining cells. Green stain = GADD45α, red stain = MMP8, blue stain = counter nuclear staining. 40-fold magnification, scale bar = 50 micrometer.
