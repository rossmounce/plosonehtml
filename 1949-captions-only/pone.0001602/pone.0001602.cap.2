                Figure 2.  Survival curves of D. radiodurans strains exposed to (A) H2O2 and (B) ionizing irradiation.(A) Wild-type D. radiodurans R1 (○) compared to MOxyR (▪), MOxyR_wtC (•), and MOxyR_sdC (□) under 20 mM H2O2 treatment at the five recovery time points (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min). (B) Wild-type D. radiodurans R1 (○) compared to MOxyR (▪) after ionizing irradiation. Error bars represent standard deviations from four replicate experiments.
