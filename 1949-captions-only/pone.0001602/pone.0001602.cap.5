                Figure 5.  Q-RT PCR of the expression of potential OxyR-dependent genes in D. radiodurans R1 wild-type compared to wild type after H2O2 treatment (white bar), MOxyR (grey bar), and MOxyR H2O2 treatment (black bar).(A) genes positively regulated by DrOxyR; (B) genes negatively regulated by DrOxyR; (C) the expression patterns of DR1709 and DR2263 were measured in MOxyR_sdC; (D) genes not regulated by DrOxyR.
