                Figure 6.  Binding of reduced and oxidized OxyR to the upstream region of (A) negative control (dr0207 and coding sequence for dr1709); (B) positivly regulated genes (dr1998 and drB0125); (C) negativly regulated genes (dr1709, dr2263, and drB0036).To generate reduced protein, 200 mM DTT was added to the binding reactions. Column 1, 2, and 3 indicate non-added protein, reduced OxyR added, and oxidized OxyR added, respectively.
