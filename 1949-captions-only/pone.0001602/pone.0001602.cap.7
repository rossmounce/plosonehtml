                Figure 7.  Model for reduced and oxidized OxyR binding to and activation at the two classes genes.For Class I (katE): OxyR activates gene in the presence of H2O2, whereas under non-stressed conditions, reduced OxyR is bound to two pairs of adjacent major grooves separated by one helical turn of the DNA duplex and acts to repress its own synthesis. For Class II (mntH): mutation of OxyR can greatly enhance gene expression, reduced OxyR binds to DNA and minimally induced genes, whereas oxidized OxyR significantly decreases the gene expression levels.
