Typhimurium strain 14028s after pretreatment with oral kanamycin, compared to controls that received only oral kanamycin. (The controls were not followed beyond 8 days.) B. Numbers of Salmonella (geometric mean CFUÂ±SEM) recovered from feces, ceca, mesenteric nodes, and spleens at indicated time points after infection. There were 5 mice at each time point except for day 14 when there were only 3 mice.
