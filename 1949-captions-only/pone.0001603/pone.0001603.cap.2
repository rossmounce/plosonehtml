                Figure 2.  WT Salmonella causes extensive colitis in BALB/c.D2 mice.A. H&amp;E stained section from a representative mouse showing two adjacent turns of the colon, 9 days after infection, at low magnification (40X). Note the extensive inflammation throughout the colon with many mucosal ulcers (arrows), and exudation of inflammatory cells and sloughed epithelium from opposing sides of a segment of colon merging in the lumen. B. Higher power (200X) view of the colonic mucosa from the same mouse. Note the infiltration of inflammatory cells (PMN and mononuclear cells), mucosal hemorrhage (Arrow heads), and mucosal ulceration. There was no sub-mucosal edema in this segment but there was extensive edema in other areas of the section (see B).
