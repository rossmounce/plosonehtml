                Figure 5.  A phoP mutant of 14028s invades the colon, but does not persist in the colon, and does not cause colitis in BALB/c.D2Nramp1 congenic mice.A. Diarrhea scores for phoP-infected mice on days 2 and 8/9 after infection. The score is significantly higher on day 2 (P&lt;0.05). B. Water content of the stool on those days. The water content of the stool of phoP-infected mice on day 2 after infection was significantly higher than that of uninfected control mice and not significantly different from the water content of mice infected with WT Salmonella (14028s). However, by day 8 the water content of feces from mice infected with WT had increased to nearly 80% while the water content of feces from phoP-infected mice had returned to normal. C. Comparison of the numbers of CFU of WT and phoP Salmonella on days 2 and 7 after infection. Geometric meansÂ±1SEM are shown. * =  P &lt;0.05, ** =  &lt;0.001. P values for the differences between means were calculated using the Mann-Whitney test. There were 6 mice/group. We did not calculate P values for spleen since there were &lt;10 CFU of the phoP mutant, or for the CFU in stool on day 8 since we had only 3 stools from WT mice for culture.
