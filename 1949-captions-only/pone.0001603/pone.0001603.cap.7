                Figure 7.  pmrA and pmrF mutants cause severe colitis.BALB/c.D2 mice were infected as in Methods and sacrificed 8 days later. There were no statistically significant differences between the diarrhea scores or the water content of feces from mice infected with WT or the isogenic pmrA or pmrF mutants. The numbers of WT and mutant Salmonella that we recovered from the tissues on day 8 after infection were either not significantly different or the pmr mutants were slightly more numerous.
