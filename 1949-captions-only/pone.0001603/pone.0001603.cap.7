There were no statistically significant differences between the diarrhea scores or the water content of feces from mice infected with WT or the isogenic <em>pmrA</em> or <em>pmrF</em> mutants. The numbers of WT and mutant <em>Salmonella</em> that we recovered from the tissues on day 8 after infection were either not significantly different or the <em>pmr</em> mutants were slightly more numerous.</p>
