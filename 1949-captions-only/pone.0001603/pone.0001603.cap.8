Mice were infected as in <a href="#s4">Methods</a> and sacrificed 7 days later. We infected 12 mice/group and sacrificed half of them on day 2. A. Diarrhea scores for CGD mice and littermate controls 2 and 7 days after infection. The mean diarrhea score for CGD mice was significantly higher than scores for the controls on day 2 (P&lt;0.05), but the scores for the two strains were not significantly different on day 7, although there were only 3 surviving CGD mice on day 7. B. Geometric mean CFUÂ±SEM for various tissues on days 2 and 7 after infection. Colony counts were similar in the two groups on day two but significantly higher in the CGD mice on day 7 after infection. * indicates a P value (Mann Whitney U test) of &lt;0.01. On day 7 there were no solid feces in the colons of CGD mice so we could not culture their stool, and only 2/6 females had solid feces to culture.</p>
