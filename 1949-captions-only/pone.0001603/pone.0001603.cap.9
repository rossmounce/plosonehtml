                Figure 9.  Mice with CGD are not more susceptible to oral infection with a phoP mutant Salmonella.A. MeanÂ±SD of diarrhea scores of mice with CGD and controls (female littermates), 2 and 8 days after infection. There was no significant difference between the diarrhea scores of the two groups on either day. B. Quantitative bacteriology results for mice with CGD and control. There were no significant differences between CFU recovered from mice with CGD and littermate controls on either day. Note that by day 8 there were only ~200 CFU recovered from the ceca of both groups, and there were &lt;10 CFU recovered from spleen cultures. , indicating that in vivo the NADPH oxidase was not involved in the highly effective innate immune response that can resolve an oral infection with phoP mutants.
