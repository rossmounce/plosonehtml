A. Neurosphere consisting of SVZ cells isolated at E15 that have aggregated in suspension after 2 days in culture. Scale bar: 100 µm. B. Neurosphere of SVZ cells derived at E15 that has attached to the floor of the culture flask after 4 days in culture. Note cells migrating away from the neurosphere. Scale bar: 100 µm. C. Cells at the periphery of neurospheres were chosen for electrophysiological recording. Most of the recorded cells extended processes. Arrows indicate the location of recording (left) and puffer (right) pipettes. Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
