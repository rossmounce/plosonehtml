                Figure 2.  Undifferentiated cell phenotype.Embryonic rat neural progenitor cells were cultured in the presence of EGF and FGF-2. A. Immunocytochemical assays for nestin indicated that nearly all (&gt;99%) cells expressed this intermediate filament protein associated with undifferentiated neural progenitor cells. Scale bar: 25 µm. B. After various intervals in culture small fractions of the cells, typically 0.5% or less, expressed GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, βIII tubulin (not shown), a marker for neurons, and O4 (not shown), a marker for oligodendrocytes. Scale bar: 50 µm. C. Western blots were prepared using control tissue obtained from an adult rat-brain microsomal preparation (AB) and total lysate from SVZ progenitor cells (PC). They indicated nestin expression in the progenitor but not the adult cells and, conversely, βIII tubulin and NeuN (a neuronal marker) in the adult but not the progenitor cells. The astrocytic marker GFAP was detected in the adult but only rarely the progenitor cells. The discrepancies between Western blotting and immunocytochemical staining with respect to resolving βIII tubulin, GFAP, and O4 expression in eNPC can be attributed to the greater sensitity of immunocytochemical staining in comparison to Western blotting.
