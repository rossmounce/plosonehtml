A. Western blots were prepared using control tissue obtained from an adult rat-brain microsomal preparation (AB) and total lysate from eNPC (PC). Results are shown from the normal assay (normal) and the assay following preasdsorption of the antibodies with antigen (preadsorbed). In the adult, positive staining was detected for Kv 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1b, and 4.3. However, in eNPC only Kv 2.1 and Kv 4.3 expression was detected consistently. B. Kv2.1 and Kv4.3 were also detected with immunocytochemistry. Images were obtained following staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies. The cell nuclei (DAPI), the sub-types, and the merged images of both are shown. The calibration bar is 100 µm for K<sub>V</sub> 2.1 and 50 µm for Kv 4.3,</p>
