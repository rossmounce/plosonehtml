A. Currents were evoked in response to 10-mV membrane potential steps from −100 to +40 mV (bottom); holding membrane potentials were −100 (black) and −50 mV (blue). The differences between these currents recorded from the two holding potentials were calculated for each membrane-potential step (red). Two current types were identified: a fast-inactivating A-type, revealed by the subtraction protocol (red), and a more slowly inactivating delayed rectifier, obtained from the −50 mV holding potential (blue). B. The current-voltage curves for the two current components (red and blue) were plotted to illustrate activation properties. The conductance-voltage relationships were fit by Boltzmann equations (n = 23) to estimate activation parameters. C. Peak current density did not vary significantly as a function of the number of days in culture.</p>
