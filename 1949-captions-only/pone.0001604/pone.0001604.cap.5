A. Voltage-gated currents were evoked from a −100 (black) and a −50 (red) -mV holding membrane potential; the A-type current (blue) was derived by taking the difference between these two currents (black and red). B. The same currents were recorded 4 min after the addition of 10 µM 4-AP to the bath. The total (black) and the delayed rectifier (red) currents were reduced, but the A-type (blue) was unaffected. Thus, at the concentration of 4-AP that was used, only the delayed rectifier current is 4-AP sensitive. C. These differential sensitivities of the delayed rectifier (red) and A-type (blue) are further illustrated in the current-voltage relationships.</p>
