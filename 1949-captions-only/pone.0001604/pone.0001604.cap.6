A. Inactivation properties were determined by applying 200-ms conditioning, inactivating membrane voltage steps from the resting level, −80 mV, to values ranging from −130 to +10 mV in 10-mV steps. The membrane potential was then set to 0mV. The peak amplitudes of currents evoked at this 0-mV test level were measured (arrow in lower panel) and normalized relative to their maximum value. B. The relative peak current amplitudes were plotted as a function of the conditioning voltage potential, and a double Boltzmann equation was fit to the data. The A-type inactivation parameters were comparable to those of Kv 4.3 when expressed in oocytes. However, the delayed rectifier and Kv 2.1 when expressed in oocytes differed in both inactivation kinetics and inactivation voltage dependence.</p>
