A. Currents in response to stepping the membrane potential from âˆ’50 mV to +50 mV at least 200 times were recorded (upper trace). The mean and variance of these currents were then derived (middle traces). B. In a plot of the variance versus the mean (right), the data were fit with a second-order polynomial (blue curve) to estimate the single-channel current, <em>i</em>, and conductance as described in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. The delayed-rectifier channel conductance is considerably larger than in expressed Kv 2.1. The 4.7 pS value is similar to the value in expressed Kv 4.3.</p>
