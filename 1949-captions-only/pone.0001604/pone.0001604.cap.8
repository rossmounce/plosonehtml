                Figure 8.  Transformed cells.The cells in this image were derived from the SVZ of an E15 rat embryo. The cells had been cultured continuously for more than two years and were still proliferating at the time of fixation. However, the cells had transformed at around 8 weeks in culture, and no longer resembled neural cells cytologically. Scale bar: 50 Âµm.
