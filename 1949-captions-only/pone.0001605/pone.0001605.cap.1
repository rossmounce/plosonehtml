Sixty minutes after start of resuscitation or at the equivalent time point for shams, rats underwent Doppler studies of the ascending aorta. Data presented is the mean±SEM of peak acceleration of aortic blood flow; significant differences are indicated (one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Kuels test).</p>
