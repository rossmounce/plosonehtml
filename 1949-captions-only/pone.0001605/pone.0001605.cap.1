                Figure 1.  Effect of trauma/HS without or with IL-6 on peak acceleration of aortic blood flow.Rats were subjected to the sham or the SBR50 protocol; SBR50 rats were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or IL-6 at the start of resuscitation (n≥3 in each group). Sixty minutes after start of resuscitation or at the equivalent time point for shams, rats underwent Doppler studies of the ascending aorta. Data presented is the mean±SEM of peak acceleration of aortic blood flow; significant differences are indicated (one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Kuels test).
