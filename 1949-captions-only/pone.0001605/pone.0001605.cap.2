                Figure 2.  Effect of duration of hypotension and resuscitation on cardiac nucleosome levels.Rats (nâ‰¥3 in each group) were subjected to sham protocol (S) or the trauma/HS protocol with increasing severity of shock (SBR0, SBR10, SBR20, SBR35, and SBR50) as indicated followed by resuscitation. Hearts were harvested 60 minutes after the start of resuscitation. One group of rats (UHS) was subjected to the SBR50 protocol, but not resuscitated, rather, kept at the target MAP (35 mmHg) for an additional 60 minutes. Hearts were immediately harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nucleosome levels were measured in protein extracts of frozen sections of the heart and the results corrected for total protein and plotted as a function of the duration of the hypotensive period. Nucleosome levels increased exponentially with duration of hypotension (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.764, p&lt;0.0001, UHS group not included in the analysis).
