At the start of resuscitation, rats in the first two SBR50 groups were randomized in a blinded fashion to receive either placebo or IL-6 at the start of resuscitation; each rat in the last two SBR50 groups received IL-6. In panel A, extracts of cryotome sections of flash-frozen ventricles obtained 60 minutes after the start of resuscitation were used to measure nucleosome levels by ELISA. Data presented are the mean±SEM of nucleosome levels (Units/mg protein); significant differences are indicated (one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Kuels test). In panel B, sections of fixed ventricles were stained using the TUNEL protocol; representative slides showing TUNEL-positive cells (arrows) are shown. In panel C, the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was counted in twenty randomly chosen fields of each slide by an experienced microscopist blinded to the treatment the rats received. Data presented are mean number of TUNEL-positive nuclei per field±SEM for each group; significant differences are indicated (one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Kuels test).</p>
