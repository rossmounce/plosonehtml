Two additional groups of rats were randomly assigned 24 hr prior to SBR50 and IL-6 treatment to receive pretreatment with GQ-ODN or non-specific (NS)-ODN by tail vein injection as indicated (n≥7). Data presented is the percent resuscitation success for each group defined as achieving a MAP ≥mean MAP minus 2 SD of starting BP. Significant differences are indicated (Fisher's exact test).</p>
