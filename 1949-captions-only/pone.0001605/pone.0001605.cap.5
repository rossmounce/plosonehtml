                Figure 5.  Effect of IL-6 on mortality following HS.Rats were subjected to the SBR35 protocol and randomized in a blinded fashion to receive either placebo (0.1 ml PBS; n = 25; SBR35/P; filled triangles) or IL-6 (10 Âµg/kg in 0.1 ml PBS; n = 26; SBR35/IL-6; filled squares) at the start of resuscitation. At the end of the resuscitation period, catheters were removed and anesthesia was reversed. Mortality was monitored and cumulative survival was plotted per Kaplan-Meier analysis (p&lt;0.005).
