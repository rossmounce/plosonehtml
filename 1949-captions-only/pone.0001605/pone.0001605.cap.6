                Figure 6.  Effect of IL-6 on cardiac Stat3 activity.Rats were subjected to the SBR50 protocol and randomized in a blinded fashion to receive either placebo (0.1 ml PBS; −) or IL-6 (10 µg/kg in 0.1 ml PBS; +). Extracts (20 µg) of cryotome sections of flash-frozen ventricles were analyzed by EMSA; radiolabeled probe without cell extract (Neg) or an extract of cells previously shown to have Stat3 activity (Pos) were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. After separation, the gel was dried and autoradiographed (panel A) or subjected to phosphoimaging analysis (panel B). Data presented in panel B represents the mean±SD of the densitometry readings; significant differences are indicated (Student's t-test).
