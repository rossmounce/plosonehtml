                Figure 8.  Effect of Stat3β ablation on trauma/HS-induced cardiac apoptosis.Stat3β homozygous-deficient (Stat3βΔ/Δ) mice and their littermate control wild type mice were subjected to the murine trauma/HS protocol or sham protocol and their hearts harvested 1 hr after the start of resuscitation. Nucleosome levels were measured in protein extracts of frozen sections of the heart and the results corrected for total protein. Data presented are the means±SEM of each group (n≥3). Significant differences are indicated (Student's t-test)
