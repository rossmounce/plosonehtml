                Figure 9.  Effect of trauma/HS without or with IL-6 treatment on cardiac apoptosis-related gene expression; impact of Stat3 inhibition on the IL-6 effect.A. Heat map of apoptosis pathway genes whose expression is altered by trauma/HS. Rows in the heat map represent genes as listed in Table 1. Columns represent samples from the 3 groups examined in Experiment 1 (left panel) as indicated (S, Sham; P, placebo-treated SBR50; and I, SBR50/IL-6) and the 2 groups examined in Experiment 2 (right panel) as indicated (N, SBR50/IL-6/NS and G, SBR50/IL-6/GQ-ODN). Red indicates a level of expression above the mean expression of a gene within the experiment. White indicates a level of expression at the mean within the experiment while blue indicates a level of expression below the mean within the experiment. B and C. Changes in expression levels of apoptosis-related genes are shown comparing SBR50 vs. sham (open bars), SBR50/IL-6 vs. SBR50 (gray bars) and SBR50/IL-6/G vs. SBR50/IL-6/N (stippled bars). In panel B, the 196 apoptosis-related genes whose expression levels were changed in SBR50 vs. sham in the first microarray experiment were separated into those genes whose transcript levels were increased in SBR50 vs. sham (135 genes; left side of panel) and those whose transcript levels were decreased in SBR50 vs. sham (61 genes; right panel). In panel C, the 196 apoptosis-related genes whose expression levels were changed in SBR50 vs. sham in the first microarray experiment were separated into anti-apoptotic genes whose transcript levels were altered in SBR50 vs. sham (115 genes; left side of panel) and pro-apoptotic genes whose transcript levels were altered in SBR50 vs. sham (81 genes; right panel).
