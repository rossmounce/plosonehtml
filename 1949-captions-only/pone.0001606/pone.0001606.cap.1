After extensive washing, proteins were resolved and visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Results are representative of three independent experiments. (B) U937 cells were treated and nuclear lysate affinity chromatography was performed as in panel A. CaMKKα mass was quantified by Western analysis. Results are representative of three independent experiments. (C) U937 cells were treated as in panel A. Affinity chromatography of whole cell lysates was performed as indicated. CaMKKα mass was quantified by Western analysis. Results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
