                Figure 2.  The PKC inhibitor Bisindolylmaleimide inhibits PMA-dependent upregulation of CD86/CD11b expression.(A &amp; B) U937 cells were pretreated with or without 1 µM bisindolylmaleimide for 15 min prior to activation with 100 nM PMA for 48 h, as indicated. Surface expression of CD11b and CD86 was quantified by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated CD11b and PE-conjugated CD86 antibodies. Results significantly different from PMA at α = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM.
