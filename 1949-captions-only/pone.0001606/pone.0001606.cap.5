                Figure 5.  Inhibition of CaMKKα by siRNA enhances PMA-dependent up-regulation of CD86 but decreases CD11b expression.(A and B) Cells were treated with 0.25 µg of either CaMKKα siRNA or scramble siRNA control prior to stimulation with 100 nM PMA for 48 h. Surface expression of CD11b and CD86 was quantified by flow cytometry. Results significantly different from PMA at α = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM. (C) Cells were treated as in A and CaMKKα protein expression was quantified by intracellular flow. Results significantly different from control at α = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM.
