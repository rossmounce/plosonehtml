Surface expression of CD11b and CD86 was quantified by flow cytometry. Results significantly different from PMA at α = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM. (C) Cells were treated as in A and CaMKKα protein expression was quantified by intracellular flow. Results significantly different from control at α = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM.</p>
