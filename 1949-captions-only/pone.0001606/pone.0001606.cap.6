                Figure 6.  CaMKKα inhibition enhances production of TNFα while reducing that of IL-10.(A and B) U937 cells (1×106 cells/treatment) were pretreated with or without 5 µg/ml STO-609 for 6 h prior to activation with 100 nM PMA for 48 h, as indicated. TNFα and IL-10 concentrations were quantified from culture supernatants by cytokine assays. Results significantly different from PMA at α  = 0.05 are indicated by (*). Results represent an average of three independent experiments±SEM.
