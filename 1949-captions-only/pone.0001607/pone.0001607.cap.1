                Figure 1.  Circular maps of the three L. biflexa replicons.(1) the coordinates in bp beginning at 0 = oriC; (2) dark pink: genes unique to L. biflexa, not found in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis (identity &gt;40% over 80% of the length of the smallest protein). (3) dark purple: genes found in L. biflexa, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii (identity &gt;40% over 80% of the length of the smallest protein). (4) red: genes found in L. biflexa and L. borgpetersenii, but not in L. interrogans (identity &gt;40% over 80% of the length of the smallest protein). (5) brown : genes found in L. biflexa and L. interrogans, but not in L. borgpetersenii (identity &gt;40% over 80% of the length of the smallest protein). (6) blue: genes found in L. biflexa and other sequenced spirochetes (Borrelia afzelii PKo, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia garinii, Treponema denticola and Treponema pallidum) (identity &gt;40% over 80% of the length of the smallest protein ). (7) The innermost ring shows GC skew; positive skew is shown in grey, and negative skew is shown in black.
