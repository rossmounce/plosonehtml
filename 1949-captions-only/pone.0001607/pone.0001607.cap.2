Manual curation ensured a one to one relationship for orthologous CDS, particularly in situations where sets of paralogous CDS existed and in addition evaluated the nature of the relationship between CDS with reciprocal best-hits but low expect values. This analysis was performed using the <em>L. interrogans</em> serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz, <em>L. borgpetersenii</em> serovar Hardjo strain L550 and <em>L. bifle</em>xa serovar Patoc strain Ames genome sequences.</p>
