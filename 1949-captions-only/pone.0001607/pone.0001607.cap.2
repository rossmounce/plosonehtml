                Figure 2.  Venn diagram showing numbers of unique and shared genes amongst L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii and L. biflexa.Orthologous CDS were identified in a pair-wise fashion using Whole-Genome Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAST Analysis [37]. Manual curation ensured a one to one relationship for orthologous CDS, particularly in situations where sets of paralogous CDS existed and in addition evaluated the nature of the relationship between CDS with reciprocal best-hits but low expect values. This analysis was performed using the L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz, L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain L550 and L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Ames genome sequences.
