                Figure 3.  Synteny plot between the five Leptospira genomes.The line plots were obtained using synteny results between the large CI(A) or small CII(B) chromosomes of L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc1, L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601, L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130, L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain L550, and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain JB197. A line plot (C) compares synteny between L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain JB197 and L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. Comparative analysis was performed using the MaGe interface [35] in the SpiroScope database (https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage). The minimum size of the synteny groups is set to five genes. In green: synteny groups are organized on the same strand; in red: synteny groups are organized on opposite strands.
