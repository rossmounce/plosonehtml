                Figure 1.  Increased disease susceptibility in pregnant BALB/c mice infected with P. berghei-GFP.BALB/c pregnant females were infected on G13 by IV injection of 106 iRBC and non-pregnant females were simultaneously infected. The plots represent cumulative results of three independent experiments in a total of 32 pregnant and 16 non-pregnant females. (A) Parasitemia curves where data points represent meanÂ±SE. From day 3 post-infection onwards parasitemia was significantly higher in pregnant females (P-value&lt;0.05). (B) Survival curves up to 10 days after infection show that survival time of pregnant female mice are significantly lower than in controls (P-value&lt;0.0001). It should be noted that non-pregnant females died at a later stage with hyperparasitemia.
