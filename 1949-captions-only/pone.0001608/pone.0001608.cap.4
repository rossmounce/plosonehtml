HE stained sections from non-infected mice (panels A and C) and infected (panels B and D) are depicted. Different cell types are identified in panel A as (DC) decidual cells, (Cy) cytotrophoblastic cells and (La) labyrinthic cells. Fibrinoid necrosis areas (Ne) are indicated in panel B. Arrowhead in D shows syncytiotrophoblast tissue thickening. Scale bar represents 100 μm in (A–B), and 10 μm in (C–D).</p>
