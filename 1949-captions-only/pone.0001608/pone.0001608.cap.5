                Figure 5.  Placental malaria.HE stained placentas from BALB/c females infected with P. berghei-GFP and collected at G18. (A) Image from severely infected placenta with high number of parasitized maternal erythrocytes. (B) The same field as (A) under polarization microscopy revealing hemozoin parasite pigment. (C) Arrowhead and insert show an infected erythrocyte adhered to the syncytiotrophoblast layer. (D) Placental section with infected erythrocytes (arrowhead) in the maternal blood and fetal erythroblasts that were enhanced in the insert. Scale bar represents 30 μm in (A, B and D) and 20 μm in (C).
