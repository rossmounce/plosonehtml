                Figure 6.  Inflammatory infiltration and macrophage/monocyte attractant chemokine expression in malaria infected placenta.(A) Immunohistochemistry analysis of placentas from BALB/c females infected on G13 with P. berghei-GFP iRBC and collected at G18 that were stained with anti-GFP (green) and anti-CD11b (red) revealing the presence of parasites on vascular walls and monocytes/macrophages infiltration, respectively. The (B) panel represents sections of non infected placentas. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar represents 30 μm. (C) RNA expression of MIP-1 alpha and MCP-1 genes were quantified in 30 infected and 8 uninfected BALB/c placentas collected on G18. Relative quantification was obtained by normalization for GAPDH expression. Each bar represents the mean±standard error of individual values. P-value = 0.0002 is represented by ***.
