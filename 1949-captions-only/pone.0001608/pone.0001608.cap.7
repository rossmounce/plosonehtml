                Figure 7.  Reduction of placental vascular space in infected pregnant mice.(A) The available area for blood circulation at G18 is reduced in the case of infected placentas (A, right) in comparison with non-infected (A, left). Scale bar represents 25 Î¼m. (B) The placental area occupied by blood sinusoids was quantified in relation to the total placental area using an automated morphometric procedure, as described in Materials and Methods (p&lt;0.001, Mann Whitney Test).
