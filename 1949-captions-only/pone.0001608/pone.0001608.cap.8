Representative images of blocking adherence assays where iRBC were pre-incubated with 2 mg/ml of CSA (B) and HA (C). IRBC were preincubated with increasing concentrations of HA, CSA and colominic acid and then used in binding assays as described in <a href="#s2">materials and methods</a> (D, upper graph). Adhesion of iRBC to uninfected placental tissue pre-treated with chondroitinase ABC and hyaluronidase but not with heparinase (D, middle graph). Intact iRBC were treated with neuraminidase, proteinase K and trypsin prior incubation with the placental tissue (D, lower graph). All data represent the proportion of bound iRBC expressed as a percentage of control (meanÂ±s.e.m. for three experiments). <em>P</em>-value&lt;0.001 is represented by ***.</p>
