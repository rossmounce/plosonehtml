                Figure 8.   Ex vivo adherence of P. berghei-GFP iRBC to mouse placenta.(A) Typical microscopic image of adherence assays showing iRBC adhered in the intervillous space and to syncytiotrophoblast cell layer (A). Representative images of blocking adherence assays where iRBC were pre-incubated with 2 mg/ml of CSA (B) and HA (C). IRBC were preincubated with increasing concentrations of HA, CSA and colominic acid and then used in binding assays as described in materials and methods (D, upper graph). Adhesion of iRBC to uninfected placental tissue pre-treated with chondroitinase ABC and hyaluronidase but not with heparinase (D, middle graph). Intact iRBC were treated with neuraminidase, proteinase K and trypsin prior incubation with the placental tissue (D, lower graph). All data represent the proportion of bound iRBC expressed as a percentage of control (meanÂ±s.e.m. for three experiments). P-value&lt;0.001 is represented by ***.
