The <em>rtTA</em> transcriptional activator is expressed under the control of a CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter. The <em>RNF5</em> transgene is expressed under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter and is activated only in the presence of both the <em>rtTA</em> activator and doxycyclin. B. Tissue expression of RNF5 transgene in double transgenic animals. <em>rtTA RNF5 DTg</em> animals were treated with 2 mg/ml of doxycyclin in drinking water for 10 days and RNF5 protein levels were monitored in different organs. RNF5 expression was assessed using RNF5 polyclonal antibody, either by western blotting (skeletal muscle) or after immunoprecipitation (heart, kidney). α-tubulin was used as a loading control. In the case of heart and kidney, equal volumes of supernatants obtained following the immunoprecipitation were loaded and probed with α-tubulin. C. Comparison of a representative <em>DTg</em> animal overexpressing RNF5 after 4 wk of doxycyclin treatment with its control littermate. D. Weight curve comparison of RNF5-overexpressing <em>DTg</em> animals and their matching controls during doxycyclin treatment. The body mass of individual animals was monitored on a weekly basis for 6 wk. Graphs represent the change in body mass relative to the original weight of a single animal (n = 5). Note: In the same gender and age class, both experimental and control animals had the same external appearance and similar weight at the beginning of treatment.</p>
