Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA µm<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to each muscle type was calculated and plotted as a percentage of the total number of fibers analyzed (n&gt;200) (right panel). D. Average muscle mass of <em>RNF5 STg</em> and <em>rtTA RNF5 DTg</em> animals treated with doxycyclin for 6 wk. Each muscle was extracted, trimmed under the microscope and weighed on a precision scale (n = 5 for experimental and control groups). E. Average organ mass of <em>RNF5 STg</em> and <em>rtTA RNF5 DTg</em> animals treated with doxycyclin for 6 wk.</p>
