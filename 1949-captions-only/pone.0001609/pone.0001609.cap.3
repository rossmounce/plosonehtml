                Figure 3.  RNF5-overexpression is associated with muscle fiber degeneration.A–C Cross-sections of fresh frozen specimens of triceps brachii (A), tibialis anterior (B) and vastus lateralis (C) muscles from RNF5 STg or rtTA RNF5 DTg animals treated with doxycyclin for 6 wk (H&amp;E stain). Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA µm2) corresponding to each muscle type was calculated and plotted as a percentage of the total number of fibers analyzed (n&gt;200) (right panel). D. Average muscle mass of RNF5 STg and rtTA RNF5 DTg animals treated with doxycyclin for 6 wk. Each muscle was extracted, trimmed under the microscope and weighed on a precision scale (n = 5 for experimental and control groups). E. Average organ mass of RNF5 STg and rtTA RNF5 DTg animals treated with doxycyclin for 6 wk.
