                Figure 5.  RNF5 localizes to the ER and its overexpression correlates with altered ER function.A. Expression levels of select ER stress markers in muscles of DTg animals are elevated compared to their control littermates. Western blot analysis of muscle extract (80 Âµg) from RNF5 STg or rtTA RNF5 DTg animals treated for 6 weeks with doxycyclin was probed with Grp78, PDI, Grp94, calnexin and CHOP antibodies. RNF5 and GAPDH antibodies were used for RNF5 expression and loading controls, respectively. B. Grp94 immunostaining of vastus lateralis cross-sections from treated rtTA RNF5 DTg and STg animals. C. RNF5 localizes to the ER of muscle fibers. Vastus lateralis cross-sections from treated DTg animals were stained with RNF5 antibody. Normal (top panels) or regenerative fibers (bottom panels) are shown for RNF5 staining alone (left panels) or combined with DAPI (right panels).
