Expression levels of select ER stress markers in muscles of <em>DTg</em> animals are elevated compared to their control littermates. Western blot analysis of muscle extract (80 Âµg) from <em>RNF5 STg</em> or <em>rtTA RNF5 DTg</em> animals treated for 6 weeks with doxycyclin was probed with Grp78, PDI, Grp94, calnexin and CHOP antibodies. RNF5 and GAPDH antibodies were used for RNF5 expression and loading controls, respectively. B. Grp94 immunostaining of vastus lateralis cross-sections from treated rtTA RNF5 <em>DTg</em> and <em>STg</em> animals. C. RNF5 localizes to the ER of muscle fibers. Vastus lateralis cross-sections from treated <em>DTg</em> animals were stained with RNF5 antibody. Normal (top panels) or regenerative fibers (bottom panels) are shown for RNF5 staining alone (left panels) or combined with DAPI (right panels).</p>
