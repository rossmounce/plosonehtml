                Figure 7.  Delayed Muscle regeneration in RNF5 KO mouse subjected to muscle damage by cardiotoxin treatment.A. Generation of RNF5 KO mouse. Schematic of RNF5 genomic structure (upper) and targeting vector (lower) are shown. Restriction enzyme sites (K: KpnI, Xh: XhoI, S: SalI) are marked. Location of the primers for PCR and the probe for Southern blotting are indicated. Exons 1, 2 and 3 including the translational start site (ATG) and RING finger domain are substituted with neo cassette. Southern blot for analysis of RNF5 gene is shown on the right panel. DNA isolated from the tails of +/+, +/−, and −/− mice was digested with EcoRI and resolved by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels. After transferring to nitrocellulose paper, blots were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes corresponding to the fragment indicated in diagram. B. Protein extracts from cardiotoxin and PBS treated tibialis muscles from WT and RNF5 KO animals were analyzed by western blots with the indicated antibodies to monitor changes in endogenous RNF5 as well as ER stress and muscle markers. Ponceau staining is used as a loading control. C. Cross section of tibialis anterior from WT and RNF5 KO mice performed 28 days after cardiotoxin treatment.
