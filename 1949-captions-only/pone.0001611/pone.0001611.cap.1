(B) At the same age, individual Hnf6 Tg islets are larger, have a mixed islet phenotype, and are closely apposed to the ductal epithelium. (A*, B*) At e18.5, WT endocrine cells have begun to adopt the stereotypic architecture; however, Hnf6 Tg α cells are often clustered together in islet-like structures that have few, if any, β cells (arrows in B*). (C) Morphometric analysis demonstrates increased glucagon<sup>+</sup> cell area (red) as early as e15.5 in Hnf6 Tg islets (dark red). This relative increase over WT islets (solid bars) persists into postnatal stages. Total insulin<sup>+</sup> area decreases in transgenic animals (dark green) at postnatal stages, but does not appear to be altered during embryogenesis. e15.5, n = 4; e18.5, n = 4; P1, n = 2; 2 weeks, n = 3. Error bars were determined by 95% confidence interval. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05, **<em>p</em>&lt;0.005, as determined by Student's t-test. <em>d</em>, duct; <em>bv</em>, blood vessel.</p>
