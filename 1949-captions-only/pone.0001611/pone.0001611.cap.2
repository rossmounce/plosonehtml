                Figure 2.  Assessment of replicate consistency and gene expression changes.Each line on the graph represents an individual spot on the array. Normalized ratio values of the average for the three WT samples (WT1-WT3) were plotted against each individual WT sample (left) and each individual Hnf6 Tg sample (right; Tg1-Tg3). Ratio values indicating no change in gene expression are seen in yellow at a value of 1.0. Transcripts that have an altered expression in Hnf6 Tg animals compared to WT animals are indicated in shades of red (greater than 1.0) or blue (less than 1.0).
