Values are expressed in arbitrary units as a ratio (transcript:tubulin) of the average of individual samples for each genotype. Error bars represent SEM; *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. <em>n.d.</em>, not detectable. For comparison, microarray analysis of these same transcripts revealed the following: OC-1 increased two-fold; Pdx1 no change; Nnat decreased two-fold; Reg2 increased 1.7-fold; Ectodin increased 1.6- to 1.9-fold; Serpina6 increased 4.6-fold; PERK decreased two-fold.</p>
