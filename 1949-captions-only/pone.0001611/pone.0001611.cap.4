                Figure 4.  Relative proportion of transcripts altered in Hnf6 Tg animals as determined by gene ontology analysis.Known transcripts altered by 1.5-fold or greater were placed into one of 16 categories, represented by specific colors on each chart. (A) Transcripts up-regulated at e18.5 (total 582). (B) Transcripts down-regulated at e18.5 (total 283). (C) Transcripts up-regulated at P1 (total 135). (D) Transcripts down-regulated at P1 (total 161).
