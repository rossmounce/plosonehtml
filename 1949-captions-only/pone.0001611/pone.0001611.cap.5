In contrast, Increased numbers of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells (green) were observed within the pancreatic epithelium (outlined) at e15.5 (glucagon<sup>+</sup> cells shown in red) in HNF6 Tg pancreata (C) as compared to WT pancreata (D). P1 pancreatic extracts (E) were probed for the expression of the proteins indicated. Values are expressed as a ratio (WT:Hnf6 Tg). Two representative samples for each genotype are shown.</p>
