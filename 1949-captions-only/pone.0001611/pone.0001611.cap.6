                Figure 6.  Increased proliferation of glucagon+ cells in Hnf6 Tg pancreata.Proliferation rates in WT (A) versus Hnf6 Tg (B) pancreata were determined by co-immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated histone H3 (p-H3, red) and either glucagon (green) or insulin (data not shown). (C) Number of cells that co-expressed p-H3 and either glucagon or insulin are expressed as a percentage of the total hormone+ cells counted at e15.5, e18.5, and P1; **p = 0.004.
