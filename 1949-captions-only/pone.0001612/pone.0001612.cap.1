                Figure 1.  FOXP3 expression in sorted cell populations and confirmation of Treg function.(A) The sorted CD4+CD25lo, CD4+CD25hi and CD19+ cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. (B) FOXP3 expression in the sorted populations as determined by intracellular flow cytometry. Plots showing results from one representative donor out of four analyzed, except for plot showing FOXP3 expression in CD19+ cells where one single donor was analyzed (C) Sorted CD4+CD25+ cells suppress the proliferation of CD4+CD25− cells. CD4+CD25− cells were activated with CD3 and CD28 antibodies together with CD4− feeder cells and increasing numbers of CD4+CD25+ cells in triplicate samples. Proliferation was measured as incorporation of [3H]Thymidine for 18 hours, here illustrated as counts per minute (cpm) on the y-axis. The CD4+CD25+ to CD25− cell ratio is displayed on the x-axis. Squares indicate coculture of CD25− and CD25+ cells. Triangles indicate control samples with only CD4+CD25− cells. (D) FOXP3 mRNA expression of sorted cell populations. FOXP3 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR in FACS sorted CD4+CD25hi, CD4+CD25lo and CD19 cells. Data was normalized to the expression in CD4+CD25lo cells using the 2−ΔΔCt method and RPII as housekeeping gene. Data represent mean of triplicate samples from one single donor.
