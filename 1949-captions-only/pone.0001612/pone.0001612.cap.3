                Figure 3.  Tregs are unmethylated at the FOXP3 promoter region.Bars in (A) to (C) indicate the percentage of methylated (black) and unmethylated (white) cells at each CpG position (specified on x-axis labels as relative the transcription start site) in (A) CD4+CD25hi, (B) CD4+CD25lo and (C) CD19+ cell populations isolated by FACS from one male donor. (D) to (F) Methylation grade of the most discriminating CpG position (âˆ’77). Percentage methylated (filled) versus unmethylated (open) CpGs in the (D) CD4+CD25hi, (E) CD4+CD25lo and (F) CD19+ cells.
