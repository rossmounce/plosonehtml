                Figure 6.  Activated CD25lo T cells demethylate during proliferation and exert suppressive activity in vitro.The methylation level of activated cells derived from the CD25lo population was monitored with the COBRA based analysis described in Figure 4. (A) Cultures from three separate donors were setup and stimulated as in Figure 5, after which the methylation status in the CD25hi and CD25lo fraction was monitored for 16 days. Cultures of T regulatory cells from two donors were kept in parallel and likewise analyzed with respect to methylation at day 0 as well as indicated time points. Shown are mean values±SEM. (B) FOXP3 expression in the CD25hi and CD25lo cells isolated at day 0 was determined by intracellular flow cytometry (left graph). During activation, FOXP3 expression was also determined in the sorted populations derived from stimulated CD25lo cells (right graph). Data represent mean values from three separate donors±SEM. (C) CD25hi and CD25lo cells from three donors were isolated on day 5 post-activation. To examine the suppressive capacity of these activated CD25lo derived cells, they were put into co-culture with autologous CFSE-stained non-activated CD4+ T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and autologous CD4− cells as feeder cells. A control sample was included for each donor where only responder and feeder cells were included in the culture. Suppressive activity was evaluated on day 3 of co-culture as the mean fluorescence intensity ratio of CFSE+ responder cells in each sample relative the control sample.
