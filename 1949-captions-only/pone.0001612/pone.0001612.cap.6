(A) Cultures from three separate donors were setup and stimulated as in <a href="#pone-0001612-g005">Figure 5</a>, after which the methylation status in the CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>lo</sup> fraction was monitored for 16 days. Cultures of T regulatory cells from two donors were kept in parallel and likewise analyzed with respect to methylation at day 0 as well as indicated time points. Shown are mean values±SEM. (B) FOXP3 expression in the CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells isolated at day 0 was determined by intracellular flow cytometry (left graph). During activation, FOXP3 expression was also determined in the sorted populations derived from stimulated CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells (right graph). Data represent mean values from three separate donors±SEM. (C) CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells from three donors were isolated on day 5 post-activation. To examine the suppressive capacity of these activated CD25<sup>lo</sup> derived cells, they were put into co-culture with autologous CFSE-stained non-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and autologous CD4<sup>−</sup> cells as feeder cells. A control sample was included for each donor where only responder and feeder cells were included in the culture. Suppressive activity was evaluated on day 3 of co-culture as the mean fluorescence intensity ratio of CFSE<sup>+</sup> responder cells in each sample relative the control sample.</p>
