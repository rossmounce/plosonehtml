                Figure 7.  Activation results in a partial demethylation at long-term follow-up.CD25 and FOXP3 expression was monitored in CD4+CD25lo cells during activation with (A) CD3/CD28 dynabeads as described in Figure 5 or repeated stimulation with anti-CD3 (5 µg/mL) and anti-CD28 (1 µg/mL) antibodies every 7 days. CD4+CD25hi Tregs were also monitored as they were stimulated continuously with CD3/CD28 dynabeads. (B) CD4+CD25lo cells stimulated with high (10 µg/mL), medium (5 µg/mL) or low (0.5 µg/mL) anti-CD3 antibody together with 1 µg/mL anti-CD28 antibody. (C) CD4+CD25lo cells stimulated with anti-CD3 (5 µg/mL) and anti-CD28 (1 µg/mL) antibodies together with TGF-β (5 ng/mL), TGF-β (5 ng/mL) and IL-10 (10 ng/mL) or IL-10 only (10 ng/mL). Stimuli were removed on day 2 after stimulation and FACS analysis performed on days 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21. Data represent mean values from three separate donors±SEM, except for expanded Tregs where data represent mean values from two separate donors. Methylation status of the −77 reporter position was monitored during conditions described above (D–F). Evaluation of methylation status was performed on DNA from one donor at days 0, 7, 14 and 21 for each separate population. Methylation of expanded Tregs at day 7, 12 and 16 represent mean values from two separate donors.
