Suppressors of <em>mblC</em> overexpression (C, D) ameliorated ommatidial irregularity to diverse extent. Enhancers (E–H) reduced eye size and/or increased roughness, and sometimes led to fusion of the overlying lenses. Halving <em>jumeaux</em> dose also suppressed <em>mblC</em> overexpression in the wing disc. Stereomicroscope images of wings from <em>Or-R</em> (I), <em>en-Gal4 UAS-mblC/+</em> (J), and <em>en-Gal4 UAS-mblC/+; jumu<sup>L70</sup>/+</em> (K). Arrows in (J) point to ectopic vein material. Bar graph representing the percentage of flies, with the genotypes indicated, that show a type I, II or III vein phenotype, or any vein phenotype (total). Phenotypic classes were defined as: I, L4 and L5 become fused and both of them disappear; II, L4 and L5 fuse but at least a vein was recognizable; III, L4 and L5 fuse, but are both recognizable. Wing in (J) would score as type III.</p>
