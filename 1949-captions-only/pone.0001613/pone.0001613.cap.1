                Figure 1.  Genetic modifiers of mblC overexpression exhibit different interaction strengths.(A–H) Scanning electron microscopy of eyes from Or-R (A), sev-Gal4 UAS-mblC/+ (B), and flies expressing mblC as in (B) and simultaneously heterozygous for Traf1GS2154 (C), jumuL70 (D), TrafEP578 (E), aret01284(F), th5 (G), and nonAf00870 (H). Suppressors of mblC overexpression (C, D) ameliorated ommatidial irregularity to diverse extent. Enhancers (E–H) reduced eye size and/or increased roughness, and sometimes led to fusion of the overlying lenses. Halving jumeaux dose also suppressed mblC overexpression in the wing disc. Stereomicroscope images of wings from Or-R (I), en-Gal4 UAS-mblC/+ (J), and en-Gal4 UAS-mblC/+; jumuL70/+ (K). Arrows in (J) point to ectopic vein material. Bar graph representing the percentage of flies, with the genotypes indicated, that show a type I, II or III vein phenotype, or any vein phenotype (total). Phenotypic classes were defined as: I, L4 and L5 become fused and both of them disappear; II, L4 and L5 fuse but at least a vein was recognizable; III, L4 and L5 fuse, but are both recognizable. Wing in (J) would score as type III.
