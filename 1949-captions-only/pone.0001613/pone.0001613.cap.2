                Figure 2.  Muscleblind proteins regulate troponin T alternative splicing in vivo and in cell culture.(A) Drosophila troponin T splicing characterisation in wild type (OrR); mblE27/CyO, ubi-GFP; mblK7103/CyO, ubi-GFP; and the hypomorphic allelic combination mblE27/mblk7103 early pupae. Molecular weight of DNA marker bands is shown on the left. Exon composition compatible with product size is shown on the right. Rp49 is shown as control in RT-PCR. (B) Murine TnnT3 minigene was co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with plasmids expressing Drosophila Muscleblind and Bruno proteins. +F indicates presence of the foetal exon and â€“F its absence. (C) Bar graph representing the average intensity of +F (light grey) and -F (dark grey) bands, as percentage of total, in three replica experiments, except for co-transfection of MblB that could only be amplified once. Statistically significant differences from vector alone controls (GFP lane) are denoted by an asterisk (p-value&lt;0.01). Error bars are standard deviations. Bruno proteins did not significantly modify minigene alternative splicing.
