Molecular weight of DNA marker bands is shown on the left. Exon composition compatible with product size is shown on the right. <em>Rp49</em> is shown as control in RT-PCR. (B) Murine <em>TnnT3</em> minigene was co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with plasmids expressing <em>Drosophila</em> Muscleblind and Bruno proteins. +F indicates presence of the foetal exon and â€“F its absence. (C) Bar graph representing the average intensity of +F (light grey) and -F (dark grey) bands, as percentage of total, in three replica experiments, except for co-transfection of MblB that could only be amplified once. Statistically significant differences from vector alone controls (GFP lane) are denoted by an asterisk (p-value&lt;0.01). Error bars are standard deviations. Bruno proteins did not significantly modify minigene alternative splicing.</p>
