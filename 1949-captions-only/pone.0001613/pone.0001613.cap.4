SUMOplot web server predicts the <em>Drosophila</em> FKRP and <em>C. elegans</em> MKRP sequences (boxed) as sumoylation target sites. A conserved lysine (asterisk) was mutated to isoleucine in MblC<sup>K202I</sup>. (B) COSM6 cells transfected with 1 µg of GFP-tagged MblC protein showed preferential nuclear localization and perinuclear aggregates that increased in number in MblC<sup>K202I</sup>. (B) HEK293T cells transfected with 300 ng of GFP-tagged MblC showed no perinuclear aggregates whereas MblC<sup>Κ202Ι</sup> still aggregated. Mutant MblC (green) co-localized with CUG ribonuclear foci (red) in the cell nucleus (blue) stained with DAPI (C). (D) <em>TnnT3</em> minigene splicing assay in HEK293T cells. GFP-tagged MblC and MblC<sup>K202I</sup> promoted foetal exon exclusion to the same extent compared to transfection of the empty vector (p&lt;0.01). (E) <em>Drosophila</em> S2 cell viability assay 48 h after transfection of normal and mutant MblC. MblC<sup>K202I</sup> significantly reduced the number of viable cells (y-axis) compared to transfection of vector alone (p&lt;0.05).</p>
