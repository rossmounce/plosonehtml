                Figure 4.  Mutation of a conserved FKRP motif reduces nuclear localization and enhances cell death-inducing activity of MblC.(A) ClustalW multiple alignment of part of Drosophila MblC-specific sequence (dmel) with homologous sequences from C. elegans (cel), Anopheles (aga), Danio rerio (dre) mus musculus (mmu; Mbnl1) and humans (hsa; MBNL1). SUMOplot web server predicts the Drosophila FKRP and C. elegans MKRP sequences (boxed) as sumoylation target sites. A conserved lysine (asterisk) was mutated to isoleucine in MblCK202I. (B) COSM6 cells transfected with 1 µg of GFP-tagged MblC protein showed preferential nuclear localization and perinuclear aggregates that increased in number in MblCK202I. (B) HEK293T cells transfected with 300 ng of GFP-tagged MblC showed no perinuclear aggregates whereas MblCΚ202Ι still aggregated. Mutant MblC (green) co-localized with CUG ribonuclear foci (red) in the cell nucleus (blue) stained with DAPI (C). (D) TnnT3 minigene splicing assay in HEK293T cells. GFP-tagged MblC and MblCK202I promoted foetal exon exclusion to the same extent compared to transfection of the empty vector (p&lt;0.01). (E) Drosophila S2 cell viability assay 48 h after transfection of normal and mutant MblC. MblCK202I significantly reduced the number of viable cells (y-axis) compared to transfection of vector alone (p&lt;0.05).
