                Figure 1.  Histopathology of the small intestine.H&amp;E-stained tissue sections of duodenum and proximal jejunum from rhesus macaques with idiopathic diarrhea. (A) Normal control duodenum from an age-matched rhesus macaque illustrating characteristic morphology of the villi. 100× magnification. (B) Enteropathy of duodenum. Diffuse enteritis characterized by shortening of villi, severe lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration of the lamina propria, and vacuolar degeneration of the epithelium. 100× magnification. (C) Normal control jejunum from an age-matched rhesus macaque. 100× magnification. (D) Enteropathy of jejunum. The mucosa appears flat with marked blunting of villi and dense infiltration of lamina propria by mononuclear cells. 100× magnification.
