                Figure 2.  Gluten dependence of clinical symptoms and serology in gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque FH09.(A) Gastrointestinal symptoms in gluten-sensitive FH09 improve with sequential administration of reduced gluten and gluten-free diets, but return upon reintroduction of dietary gluten (diet changes indicated by vertical arrows). Criteria that were used in clinical scoring of gluten sensitivity in the juvenile macaque FH09 were scaled relative to the healthy, age-matched control, FR26 (score 1, indicated by dotted line). Score 2 corresponded to beginning of diarrhea, e.g. pasty stools. Score 3 corresponded to semi-liquid stools and decreased activity. Score 4 corresponded to liquid stools, decreased activity, moderate dehydration and “balloon” stomach. Score 5 corresponded to liquid stools, depression, severe dehydration and balloon stomach. Score 6 would correspond to a moribund animal where prompt euthanasia is recommended. Each datapoint represents the mean of 7 daily measurements taken over the course of the indicated week. Standard deviations are indicated by error bars. (B) Anti-gliadin IgG (blue; open circles) and IgA (red; open squares) return to baseline with dietary exclusion of gluten, but are elevated following reintroduction of dietary gluten. The level of anti-gliadin IgG (blue; closed circle) and IgA (red; closed square) in control FR26 are shown for comparison. Each datapoint represents the mean of triplicate measurements. Standard deviations are indicated by error bars.
