The nucleotide changes within the study species represent segregating sites, some of which will be fixed in the long term, but most of which will be removed by drift or selection. The changes between the study species and outgroup species represent substitutions. If an estimate of the evolutionary rate is calibrated using an external calibration point, such as the split between the study and outgroup species, then the intraspecific rate will be underestimated. This will lead to an overestimation of times to divergence, including the age of the most recent common ancestor of the study species.</p>
