Schematic of transgenic constructs utilized to create transgenic mice with inducible elevation of human MAO-B (h-MAO-B) expression specifically within astrocytes via the bacterial tetracycline regulatory system.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1"></a><p>A bacterial reverse tetracycline response gene (<em>rtetR)</em> was expressed constitutively via a mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (pGFAP). The resulting gene product, rtTA, a tet-responsive transactivator protein, is activated only in the presence of doxycycline (dox) and is able to bind to a tetracycline operator (TET) sequence in the promoter of a second transgene, resulting in induction of expression of both h-<em>MAO-B</em> and bacterial beta-galactosidase (lac Z) from the bidirectional promoter. B. Human MAO-B cDNA transgene is expressed in the brains of transgenic mice following dox induction. Inducible transgene mRNA expression (a 448 bp amplicon) was visualized by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from whole brains of uninduced (U), dox-induced (I) transgenic mice and wild type littermates (W). C. Enzymatic activities of h-MAO-B and lacZ transgenes in whole brain lysates from uninduced (ND) and dox-induced (D) transgenic animals. n = 3 animals per condition run in triplicate; * p&lt;0.01. Data is presented as percent ND control. ND lacZ activity was calculated to be 11.9±0.54 nmoles ONPG converted/mg protein/hour and wild type C57BL6 lacZ activity (not shown) to be 11.3±0.13 nmoles ONPG converted/mg protein/hour respectively. Brain MAO-B activity in tissue isolated from the uninduced transgenic (ND) was calculated to be 14.6±0.9 nmoles β-PEA converted/mg protein/hour and in tissues from wild type C57BL6 mice (not shown) to be 14.2±0.23 nmoles β-PEA converted/mg protein/hour. D. Dox-inducible expression of human MAO-B (h-MAO-B) and lacZ is localized within GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. GFAP immunostaining is shown in green, h-MAO-B is red, and merged in yellow in uninduced (No DOX) and dox-induced (DOX) animals. Scale bar applies to all images. E. Loss in striatal dopamine (ST DA) content is exacerbated in dox-induced transgenics following a single MPTP injection of 30 mg/kg body weight. Striatal dopamine was estimated from wild type (W), uninduced transgenics (ND), induced transgenics (D), and dox-induced transgenics co-treated with deprenyl (Ddep). Grey bars without MPTP, black bars after a single injection of 30 mg/kg MPTP. Data is expressed as ng dopamine/mg striatal protein. * p&lt;0.01 D vs. ND, ** = p&lt;0.01 Ddep vs. ND. F. Loss in dopaminergic tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) after a single injection of MPTP (30 mg/kg) is exacerbated in dox-induced mice. Uninduced transgenic mice (ND), induced transgenics (Dox), and induced transgenics co-treated with 10mg/kg deprenyl (Doxdep). Data is presented as percent of non-MPTP treated ND controls where SN TH<sup>+</sup> cell numbers are estimated at 13,318±475 TH<sup>+ </sup>neurons in untreated ND mice (WT values, not shown, were 13,699±325). n = 3 animals per condition run in triplicate; * p&lt;0.05.</p>
