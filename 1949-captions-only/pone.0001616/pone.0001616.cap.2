A. TH<sup>+</sup> cell counts in uninduced mesencephalic cultures isolated from either wildtype littermates (WT), uninduced transgenics (ND) or transgenic cultures induced with 40 µg/ml doxycycline for 24 hrs in the absence (D) or presence of 10<sup>-6</sup>M deprenyl (Ddep).</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1"></a><p>Counts are expressed as % WT values which were estimated to be 300±15 TH<sup>+</sup> neurons. Cell counts were performed in a minimum of three different wells and 4 separate fields in each well. * = p&lt;0.01 compared to ND; **p&gt;0.01 compared to Dox. B. Representative micrographs of the TH<sup>+</sup> cells obtained by TH<sup>+</sup> immunofluorescence in uninduced (No Dox), dox-induced (Dox) and dox-induced mesencephalic cultures treated with deprenyl (Doxdep). Note the truncated processes and shrunken dopaminergic cell morphology in the induced cultures versus uninduced and deprenyl-treated induced cultures.</p>
