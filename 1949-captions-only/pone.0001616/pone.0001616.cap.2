                Figure 2.  Inducible elevation of astrocytic MAO-B levels in mesencephalic cultures isolated from transgenic mice results in TH+ cell loss which is prevented by co-treatment with deprenyl. A. TH+ cell counts in uninduced mesencephalic cultures isolated from either wildtype littermates (WT), uninduced transgenics (ND) or transgenic cultures induced with 40 µg/ml doxycycline for 24 hrs in the absence (D) or presence of 10-6M deprenyl (Ddep).Counts are expressed as % WT values which were estimated to be 300±15 TH+ neurons. Cell counts were performed in a minimum of three different wells and 4 separate fields in each well. * = p&lt;0.01 compared to ND; **p&gt;0.01 compared to Dox. B. Representative micrographs of the TH+ cells obtained by TH+ immunofluorescence in uninduced (No Dox), dox-induced (Dox) and dox-induced mesencephalic cultures treated with deprenyl (Doxdep). Note the truncated processes and shrunken dopaminergic cell morphology in the induced cultures versus uninduced and deprenyl-treated induced cultures.
