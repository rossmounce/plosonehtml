A. TH<sup>+</sup> SN cell counts from uninduced transgenics (no dox) versus induced transgenics at 3-4 months (dox) , following dox removal (dox rem) at 14 months of age (dox 14 mo), and induced co-treated with deprenyl at 10-30 mg/kg (dox dep 10-30), the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline at 10 mg/kg (dox mino) or the anti-oxidant Euk189 at 10 mg/kg in young animals.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1"></a><p>Data is expressed as total number of SN TH<sup>+</sup> cells numbers per animal; *p&lt;0.01 compared to ND, ** p&lt; 0.05 compared to Dox, and *** p&lt; 0.05 compared to dox. B. Neuronal (NeuN<sup>+</sup>) counts from uninduced (No Dox, filled bars) versus dox-induced transgenics (Dox, open bars) performed in equivalent nigral (SN), cortical (CT), and striatal (ST) tissue sections. Values represent average cell numbers per field in three separate fields per section, three sections per animal. N = 5 animals per group. C. Representative micrographs demonstrating cortical astrocytic activation in dox-induced (Dox) versus uninduced (ND) animals and dox-induced animals co-treated with deprenyl (Ddep). Astrocytes from induced transgenics displayed enhanced GFAP staining and increased branching indicative of astrocyte activation (higher magnification in lower middle panel); deprenyl treatment resulted in reduced branching similar to that observed in uninduced controls (higher magnification in lower right-hand panel). D. Astrocytic (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) counts from uninduced (No DOX, open bars) versus dox-induced transgenics (DOX, light grey bars) and mice dox-induced in the presence of deprenyl co-treatment (D DEP, dark grey bars) performed in equivalent striatal (ST), nigral (SN), and cortical (CT) tissue sections. Values represent average cell numbers per field at 40×magnification in three separate fields per section, three sections per animal. N = 5 animals per group; *p&gt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.1. E. Representative micrograph demonstrating increased expression of the astrocytic activation marker S-100β (blue) in GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the transgenic cortex following dox induction. GFAP-labeled astrocytes (red) in induced animals display increased S-100β staining (pink) versus uninduced. F. Neurodegeneration of TH<sup>+</sup> cells as assessed by silver staining. SN sections from uninduced (No Dox) and induced (Dox) animals were processed for TH<sup>+</sup> immunoreactivity visualized by alkaline peroxidase (blue) and further processed for silver staining. A black punctate staining was observed in and around dying TH<sup>+</sup> neurons (arrows) in Dox but not No Dox fields.</p>
