                Figure 4.  Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in increased extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).Extracellular H2O2 concentrations were measured in media isolated from uninduced (ND) versus dox-induced (Dox) mesencephalic cultures in the absence and presence of 10 µM deprenyl (Dox Dep), 30 µM EUK189 (Dox Euk) or 500 nM apocynin (Dox Apo) using the Amplex Red assay. H2O2 concentrations were quantified against a standard H2O2 curve. Measurements were made on three separate media aliquots harvested prior to immunostaining of cultures; *p&lt;0.01 compared to ND, ** p&lt;0.05 compared to ND.
