Elution of the DA synaptosomes was obtained via removal of the magnetic field. Flow-through contains striatal non-dopaminergic synaptosomes used as negative controls in subsequent biochemical experiments. B. Densitometric quantitation of western blot analyses of fractions from immunomagnetic isolation of ST synaptosomes probed with TH, GABA or SNAP-25 antibodies. Levels of Dopaminergic TH (grey bars) versus Non-dopaminergic GABA (white bars) synaptosomes were assessed using SNAP-25, a general synaptic protein, as a loading control. Control (C), unbound fraction (U), flow-through (FT), wash (W) and eluate (E). Representative blots are shown in the lower panel. C. Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within dopaminergic ST synaptosomes. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were estimated 3 hrs following tail vein injection of DCFDA into either wildtype littermates (WT), uninduced (ND) or dox-induced (Dox) transgenics, or induced transgenic animals co-treated with either deprenyl (D DEP), EUK189 (D EUK) or 1 mg/ml catalase (Dox Cat). DCF fluorescence was examined at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission at 512 nm. Data is reported normalized to microgram synaptosomal protein. N = 3; *p&lt;0.005 versus ND, ** = p&lt;0.01 versus Dox. D. Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in increased ST DAChr levels. DAChr levels were estimated in ST samples from uninduced (ND) versus dox-induced (Dox) transgenic mice via HPLC. Values are presented as picomoles DAChr/mg protein.* p&lt;0.02, n = 3. E. Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in decreased complex I but not complex IV activity in ST dopaminergic synaptosomes. Complex I and complex IV activities were measured in isolated ST dopaminergic versus non-dopaminergic synaptosomes from uninduced (ND), dox-induced (Dox) and induced transgenic animals co-treated with either deprenyl (Dep) or EUK-189 (EUK). N = 3–5 animals per group and a total of 3 separate experiments, values are expressed as mean±SD; * p&lt;0.01 compared to ND, ** p&gt;0.05 compared to ND. CI activity was calculated to be 4.0 versus 3.3 µM NADH/min/mg protein in ND striatal dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic synaptosomes, respectively. CIV activity was calculated to be 139 versus 109 µM ferrocytochrome c/minute/mg protein in ND striatal dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic synaptosomes, respectively. Activities of WT DA striatal synaptosomes was calculated to be 4.4 µM NADH/min/mg protein (CI) and 130 µM ferrocytochrome c/minute/mg protein (CIV); dox feeding of the WT animals did not alter the activities. Note: addition of doxycycline has been reported to interfere with mitochondrial protein translation including CI thereby affecting enzyme activity <a href="#pone.0001616-Yadava1">[62]</a>, however in addition to lack of effect on CI activity in WT animals +/− dox, we also find no change in CI subunit protein levels in WT mice as a consequence of dox treatment as assessed via immunoprecipitation/gel electrophoretic analyses (data not shown).</p>
