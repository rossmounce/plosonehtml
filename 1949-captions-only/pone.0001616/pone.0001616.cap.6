                Figure 6.  Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in increased mitochondrial superoxide levels within dopaminergic SN mitochondria.Representative confocal micrographs illustrating increased merged (yellow) mitosox red fluorescence (red) in the SN and striatum of dopaminergic neurons following tail vein injection, fixation and TH immunochemistry (green) in uninduced (No Dox) versus induced transgenic mice (Dox) which is prevented in the presence of co-deprenyl (DEP) or EUK-189 (EUK) treatment. Nuclei are visualized via DAPI staining (blue).
