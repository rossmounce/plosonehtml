                Figure 7.  Global elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in local SN microglial activation. A. Mitosox staining of local SN microglia following dox treatment reveals increased mitochondrial superoxide levels within these cells.Microglia were immunostained with Iba1 (green) antibody in sections of brain fixed 3 hrs following tail injection of mitosox red. Confocal detail shows mitochondrial mitosox red fluorescence within an activated microglial cell body following dox induction. B. Microglial activation occurs following dox induction within the SN. Microglial activation as assessed by Iba1 immunochemistry (black, DAB-nickel staining) in SN sections from uninduced (No Dox), induced (Dox), and dox-induced co-deprenyl-treated transgenics (Ddep). Dopaminergic (TH+) neurons are labeled in brown (DAB). Note that few activated microglia are visible in No Dox and Ddep treated mice versus in the Dox panel where several stages of microglial activation (resting, activated, withdrawing, and motile stages) can be visualized. Scale bar equals 50 ÂµM unless indicated otherwise. C. Higher magnification of representative SN Iba1 immunochemistry demonstrating stages of microglial activation (activated, withdrawing, and motile stages are indicated by cartoons). Cortical microglia were found to be in a ramified or resting stage in all the conditions (supplementary figure S1). D. Representative Iba1 immunochemistry in ST sections demonstrating increased microglial activation following dox induction. Shown are ST sections from uninduced (No Dox) versus dox-induced (Dox) or dox-induced, co-deprenyl treated (Ddep) transgenics. Note the presence of numerous retracted processes in the microglia in the Dox panel versus presence of ramified microglia in the No Dox and Ddep panels.
