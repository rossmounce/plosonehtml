                Figure 8.  Elevation in astrocytic MAO-B results in loss of ambulatory movement in MAO-B transgenics.Total ambulatory velocity (A) and ambulatory distance (B) following two weeks of dox administration. Data is presented as average ambulatory velocity calculated over a 10 minute observation period and total ambulatory distance is for that same time interval. N = 5 mice per condition; experiments were run in triplicate. * p&lt;0.01 compared to ND, ** p&gt;0.05 compared to ND. Values are given for untreated (ND), dox-treated (Dox), and dox, deprenyl co-treated mice. Wildtype untreated littermates had an ambulatory velocity of 2.37±0.45 cm/s and a total ambulatory distance moved of 1082±101 cm.
