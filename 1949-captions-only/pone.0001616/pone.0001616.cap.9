Astroglia are themselves protected from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> due to relatively high levels of glutathione-gluathione peroxidase versus neurons. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can diffuse out of astroglia and into neighboring cells including local dopaminergic neurons and microglia; this can be prevented by EUK. Dopamine can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through dopamine quinone formation to stable dopaminochrome (DACHR). DACHR can extract an electron from the auto-oxidizable site of mitochondrial complex I forming DACR radical and impacting selectively on complex I function. Due its high affinity for molecular oxygen, DACR radical can pass an electron on to this molecular species resulting in its re-reduction to DACHR and increased formation of mitochondrial superoxide radical. MAO-B generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can also stimulate local microglia; microglial activation can be greatly secondarily enhanced within the SN due to dopaminergic cell demise which can also exacerbate ROS production and impact on local dopaminergic neurons.</p>
