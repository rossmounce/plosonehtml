                Figure 9.  A schematic representation of the events occurring upon the elevation of glial MAO-B.Increased astroglial levels of MAO-B results in elevation of H2O2 levels; this can be prevented by deprenyl. Astroglia are themselves protected from H2O2 due to relatively high levels of glutathione-gluathione peroxidase versus neurons. H2O2 can diffuse out of astroglia and into neighboring cells including local dopaminergic neurons and microglia; this can be prevented by EUK. Dopamine can be oxidized by H2O2 through dopamine quinone formation to stable dopaminochrome (DACHR). DACHR can extract an electron from the auto-oxidizable site of mitochondrial complex I forming DACR radical and impacting selectively on complex I function. Due its high affinity for molecular oxygen, DACR radical can pass an electron on to this molecular species resulting in its re-reduction to DACHR and increased formation of mitochondrial superoxide radical. MAO-B generated H2O2 can also stimulate local microglia; microglial activation can be greatly secondarily enhanced within the SN due to dopaminergic cell demise which can also exacerbate ROS production and impact on local dopaminergic neurons.
