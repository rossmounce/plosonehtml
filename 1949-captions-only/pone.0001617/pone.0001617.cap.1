Wild-type (BY4741), <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1028), and <em>mad2</em>Δ (Y516) strains were spotted in 5-fold dilutions from 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per spot on YPD plates containing 20 µg/mL benomyl and incubated at 25°C for 3 days. (B) The <em>ybp2</em>Δ cells accumulate at G2/M. Logarithmically growing cells, wild type (Y14) and <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1831), were cultured at 25°C and processed for flow cytometry. (C) Double mutants of <em>ybp2</em>Δ and the spindle checkpoint genes show temperature-dependent synthetic lethality. Yeast strains were spotted in 5-fold dilutions from 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per spot on YPD plates. The plates were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 2 days. Isogenic yeast strains were wild type (YPH500), <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1342), <em>mad1</em>Δ (Y550), <em>mad2</em>Δ (Y1323), <em>mad3</em>Δ (Y554), <em>bub1</em>Δ (Y530), <em>bub3</em>Δ (Y548), <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>mad1</em>Δ (Y1398), <em>ybp2Δmad2</em>Δ (Y1419), <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>mad3</em>Δ (Y1402), <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>bub1</em>Δ (Y1415), and <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>bub3</em>Δ (Y1396). (D) Immunofluorescence analysis of <em>ybp2</em>Δ cells. Logarithmically growing cells cultured at 25°C were fixed and stained with antitubulin antibodies and DAPI. The strains shown are wild type (Y14) and <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1831). For each sample, 300 cells were counted.</p>
