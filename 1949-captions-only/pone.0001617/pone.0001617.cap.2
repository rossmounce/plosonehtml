Logarithmically growing cells cultured at 25°C were processed for flow cytometry. (B) The <em>ybp2</em>Δ strain does not display a substantial chromosome-missegregation phenotype. Chromosome fragment segregation was analyzed by a colony color assay (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Loss of nonessential chromosome fragments results in a red sector in a white colony. Isogenic yeast strains used in (A) and (B) were wild type (Y14), <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1831), <em>mad2</em>Δ (Y1833), and <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>mad2</em>Δ (Y1834). (C) The phenotype of the <em>ybp1</em>Δ mutant was not similar to that of the <em>ybp2</em>Δ mutant. Yeast strains were spotted in 5-fold dilutions from 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per spot on YPD plates containing the indicated concentrations of benomyl and incubated at 30°C for 2–3 days. (D) The <em>ybp2</em>Δ cells showed a subtle chromosome-missegregation phenotype, but <em>ybp1</em>Δ cells did not. The <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>ybp1</em>Δ double mutant exhibited the same subtle chromosome-missegregation phenotype, indicating that Ybp1 does not participate in the mitotic function of Ybp2. Isogenic yeast strains used in (C) and (D) were wild type (Y14), <em>ybp2</em>Δ (Y1831), <em>ybp1</em>Δ (Y1835), and <em>ybp2</em>Δ<em>ybp1</em>Δ (Y1836).</p>
