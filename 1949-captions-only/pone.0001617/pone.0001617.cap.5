                Figure 5.  Interactions among 3 central kinetochore subcomplexes in the ybp2Δ mutant.(A) The model indicates the positions of the 3 central kinetochore subcomplexes Ndc80, MIND, and COMA. Orange arrows show protein–protein interactions that link the subcomplexes. (B–D) The indicated strains were grown to log phase at 30°C, lysed, and anti-myc immunoprecipitations were performed. Total lysate (T), supernatant (S), and the immunoprecipitated fraction (IP) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were used to detect Ctf19, HA-tagged, or myc-tagged proteins with the respective antibodies. For the quantification of (B) Mtw1-HA, aliquots of the total lysate (1/500 of the total), supernatant (1/500 of the total), and IP fraction (2/25 of the total lysate) were loaded. ND, not detectable. For the quantification of (C) Ctf19, aliquots of the total lysate (1/500 of the total), supernatant (1/500 of the total), and IP fraction (2/5 of the total lysate) were loaded. For the quantification of (D) Ctf19, aliquots of the total lysate (1/1000 of the total), supernatant (1/1000 of the total), and IP fraction (1/5 of the total lysate) were loaded. Arbitrary number is defined as described in Figure 3. The yeast strains used were (B) untagged (YPH499), Spc25-myc Mtw1-HA (Y1837), and Spc25-myc Mtw1-HA ybp2Δ (Y1839); (C) untagged (YPH499), Mtw1-myc (Y1709), and Mtw1-myc ybp2Δ (Y1840); and (D) untagged (YPH499), Ndc80-myc (Y1713), and Ndc80-myc ybp2Δ (Y1841). (E and F) Ndc80, Ctf19, and Mcm21 bind more tightly to CEN DNA in the absence of Ybp2. ChIP assays were performed with nocodazole-arrested cells (treated with 20 µg/mL nocodazole for 3 h at 25°C). Total lysate (T, 1/800 of the total) and coimmunoprecipitated DNA (IP, 1/10 of the total) were analyzed by PCR with primers specific to the centromeric regions of chromosome I and to a noncentromeric region (PGK1) as a control for binding specificity. For the quantification of CEN1, aliquots of the total lysate (2/25 of the total) and IP fraction (2/5 of the total) were loaded in 8% acrylamide gel. Arbitrary number is defined as described in Figure 4. ND, not done. Isogenic yeast strains were (E) untagged (YPH499), Ndc80-myc (Y1713), Ndc80-myc ybp2Δ (Y1841), Ctf19-myc (IPY313), Ctf19-myc ybp2Δ (Y1842), Mtw1-myc (Y1709), and Mtw1-myc ybp2Δ (Y1840); and (F) untagged (YPH499), Mcm21-myc (Y1708), Mcm21-myc ybp2Δ (Y1866), Nuf2-myc (Y1714), Nuf2-myc ybp2Δ (Y1867), Dsn1-myc (Y1712), and Dsn1-myc ybp2Δ (Y1868). (G) Synthetic-sick interaction between ybp2Δ and mutation of COMA complex genes. Yeast strains were spotted in 5-fold dilutions from 5×104 cells per spot on YPD plates. The plates were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 2 days. Isogenic yeast strains used were wild type (YPH499), ybp2Δ (Y1337), ctf19Δ (YPH1315), mcm21Δ (Y1824), ame1-4 (YPH1676), okp1-5 (YPH1678), ybp2Δctf19Δ (Y1826), ybp2Δmcm21Δ (Y1827), ctf19Δmcm21Δ (Y1828), ybp2Δame1-4 (Y1864), ybp2Δokp1-5 (Y1865), and ybp2Δctf19Δmcm21Δ (Y1829).
