                Figure 7.  Maximum likelihood phylogram of Stygiocaris Combined dataset (H3/16S/COI).Branches with support &gt;75% for all forms of analysis have thicker lines (Maximum Likelihood bootstrap values/Bayesian posterior probabilities above node, and Parsimony bootstrap values below). Also, individual gene maximum likelihood phylograms. Outgroup (Antecaridina sp. East Timor) not displayed.
