                Figure 1.  Screening of P. aeruginosa mutants with altered antibiotic susceptibility.Two libraries of transposon-tagged P. aeruginosa mutants were screened to detect changes in their susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents polymixin B, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, imipenem, and ceftazidime. A mutant was considered resistant (red square in A) if it was able to grow at antibiotic concentrations that inhibited the growth of the wild-type strain (black square in both panels). A mutant was considered hypersusceptible (green square in B) if it was not able to grow at antibiotic concentrations permissive for the wild-type strain.
