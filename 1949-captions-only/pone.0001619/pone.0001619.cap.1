A mutant was considered resistant (red square in A) if it was able to grow at antibiotic concentrations that inhibited the growth of the wild-type strain (black square in both panels). A mutant was considered hypersusceptible (green square in B) if it was not able to grow at antibiotic concentrations permissive for the wild-type strain.</p>
