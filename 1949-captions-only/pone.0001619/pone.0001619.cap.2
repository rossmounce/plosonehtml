                Figure 2.  Antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa mutants.The susceptibility of the selected mutants was determined by comparison to the wild-type parental strains. (A) The antibiotic susceptibility ratios of each mutant and its isogenic wild-type strain are shown. The ratios of changes were hierarchically clustered [48] using freely available software (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Green, more susceptible; red, more resistant; Pol, polymixin B; Amk, amikacin; Cip, ciprofloxacin; Tet, tetracycline; Imi, imipenem; Cef, ceftazidime. Note that in most cases, susceptibilities to several antibiotics changed simultaneously. (B) The number of mutants with higher resistance (resistant mutants) to a given number of tested antibiotics. Most of the mutants had increased resistance to several antibiotics belonging to different structural families. (C) The number of mutants with higher susceptibility (hypersusceptible mutants) to a given number of tested antibiotics. Note that a mutant can be more resistant to some antibiotics (see A) and more susceptible to others and therefore can be included in both (B) and (C).
