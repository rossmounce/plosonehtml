                Figure 1.  Sequence analysis of ARL-1/ARF-1 of various species.Consensus motives for the GDP-GTP binding site are boxed in black. Mutated and amino acids of interest are boxed in grey. The sequence of the C-terminal peptide synthesised for the production of the rabbit immune serum is underlined.
