Internal standard: 37 kDa LACK antigen. Left, negative control without anti-LdARL-1 antiserum. Additional bands are revealed when the GFP-fused proteins are expressed, probably due to partial degradation when the cells were lysed, in spite of the presence of antiproteases (see <a href="#s4">Methods</a>).</p>
