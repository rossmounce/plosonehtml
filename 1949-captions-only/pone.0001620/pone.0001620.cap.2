                Figure 2.   Expression of LdARL-1 and mutants in L. amazonensis.Extracts of 3.106 exponentially growing L. amazonensis promastigotes (about 3 Âµg of proteins) were submitted to western blot analysis using the rabbit anti-LdARL-1 C-terminus immune serum (1:5000 dilution); color was developed with an anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:10000 dilution) and an ECL revelation kit (Amersham). Internal standard: 37 kDa LACK antigen. Left, negative control without anti-LdARL-1 antiserum. Additional bands are revealed when the GFP-fused proteins are expressed, probably due to partial degradation when the cells were lysed, in spite of the presence of antiproteases (see Methods).
