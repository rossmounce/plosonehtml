                Figure 3.   LdARL-1 subcellular localisation in L. amazonensis promastigotes.A. IF on fixed cells: A1, phase contrast; A2, co-labelling with DAPI (blue) and FITC-anti rabbit-IgG plus anti-LdARL-1 rabbit immune serum (green). B. IF on fixed cells co-transformed with pNUS-LdARL-1-GFPcH (green) and pNUS-mREDnD-LdLPG-2 (red) plus DAPI staining (blue). C. IF on fixed cells co-transformed with pNUS-LdARL-1-GFPcH (C1, green) plus pNUS-LdARF-1-mRedcD (C2, red), overlay (C3). D. EM of cells transformed with pNUS-LdARL-1-GFP and incubated with anti-LdARL-1 immune serum. C1 and C2 are sections of two different cells. Black dots (10 nm gold particles) show the LdARL-1 immunoreactive spots. N: nucleus; G: Golgi apparatus; K: kinetoplast; F: flagellum; FP: flagellar pocket.
