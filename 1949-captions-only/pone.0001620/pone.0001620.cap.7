                Figure 7.   LdARL-1 and FM4-64 internalisation.L. amazonensis promastigotes expressing LdARL-1-GFP (A–D, green) or LdARL-1/T34N-GFP (empty) (E–H, green) were incubated at 24°C for 15 min with 2 µg/ml FM4-64FX (red), washed and further incubated for 0 min (A, E), 15 min (B, F), 60 min (C, G) and 120 min (D, H) before fixation; fp, flagellar pocket; MVT, Lysosome/Multivesicular Tubule. Colocalization of red and green results in a yellow signal.
