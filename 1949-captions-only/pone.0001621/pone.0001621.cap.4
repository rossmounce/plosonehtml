The C-ME client (upper left) reads and writes data to and from MOSS 2007 (upper right). MOSS 2007 organizes C-ME data and annotations into a research site with multiple project sites (lower right). Each of the project sites can contain multiple entity sites (lower left) for each 3D molecule or 2D image to be annotated and shared.</p>
