                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic tree of mature tRNA sequences in 45 archaeal species.The phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree was constructed by using mature sequences of 1953 predicted tRNAs from the complete genomes of 45 archaeal species. Clusters are numbered from 1 to 22, and tRNAs within each cluster are denoted by amino acids corresponding to the anticodon. Clusters including tRNAs from all 3 archaeal phyla (Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota) are shaded in blue. The amino acids corresponding to the split tRNAs are boxed.
