Clusters are numbered from 1 to 22, and tRNAs within each cluster are denoted by amino acids corresponding to the anticodon. Clusters including tRNAs from all 3 archaeal phyla (Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota) are shaded in blue. The amino acids corresponding to the split tRNAs are boxed.</p>
