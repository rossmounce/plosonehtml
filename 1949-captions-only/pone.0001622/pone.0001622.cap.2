Black bar marks the intron of the intronic tRNAs and the leader sequences of the split tRNAs, which are inserted at tRNA nucleotide position 32/33. Red bar marks the anticodon. (B) Comparison of the secondary structures and nucleotide sequences around the exonâ€“intron boundary of the 3 types of tRNAs. Nucleotides that are identical between leader sequence and intron are shown in red. Red bar marks the anticodon.</p>
