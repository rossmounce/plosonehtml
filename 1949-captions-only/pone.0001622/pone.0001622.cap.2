                Figure 2.  Comparison of the 3 types of tRNA sequences.(A) Full nucleotide sequences of pre-tRNAs (1 split tRNALys [Neq] and 2 intronic tRNAArgs [Pae]) and 2 nonintronic tRNALys (Pfu and Afu) were aligned. Black bar marks the intron of the intronic tRNAs and the leader sequences of the split tRNAs, which are inserted at tRNA nucleotide position 32/33. Red bar marks the anticodon. (B) Comparison of the secondary structures and nucleotide sequences around the exonâ€“intron boundary of the 3 types of tRNAs. Nucleotides that are identical between leader sequence and intron are shown in red. Red bar marks the anticodon.
