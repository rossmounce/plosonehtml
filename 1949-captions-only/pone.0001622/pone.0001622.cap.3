Each node (colored dot) represents a tRNA half, and its color indicates the charged amino acid's chemical properties (DE, mid-green; MNQ, light green; RKH, blue; FWY, purple; AGP, red; ILV, orange; CST, yellow; iMet, gray). Nodes are linked by a white line (edge) when the sequence similarity is above the threshold. (A) Network created by set of 5′ half sequences with thresholds of &gt;70%, &gt;75%, and &gt;80%. The sequences are classified into 6 clusters (1–6) at a threshold of &gt;80%. (B) Network created by set of 3′ half sequences with thresholds of &gt;80%, &gt;85%, and &gt;88%. The sequences are classified into 9 clusters (A–I) at a threshold of &gt;88%.</p>
