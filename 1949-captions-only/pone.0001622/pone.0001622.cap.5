                Figure 5.  Representation of N. equitans codon table filled with 5′ and 3′ tRNA halves.The table is filled with the group IDs (see Fig. 3) corresponding to each of the 5′ and 3′ tRNA halves in N. equitans (Neq). The anti-codon corresponding to the 6 split tRNAs is shown in red. An asterisk indicates that a sequence does not have a similar sequence above the threshold (5′ half, 80%; 3′ half, 88%).
