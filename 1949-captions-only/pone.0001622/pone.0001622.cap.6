                Figure 6.  Examples of tRNA sequences explained by specific combinations of 5′ and 3′ tRNA halves.(A) Examples of tRNA sequences with different 5′ half sequences but a common 3′ half sequence. (B) Example of tRNA sequences with different 3′ half sequences but a common 5′ half sequence. Asterisk denotes matching nucleotides in the aligned tRNA sequences. Boxes delineate sequences belonging to the same group in the sequence similarity network (Fig. 3). The corresponding group ID is labeled in a black box.
