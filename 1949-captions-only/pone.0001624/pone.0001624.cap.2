The deduced amino acid sequence of pro-boophilin is shown in red below the nucleotide sequence, in one-letter code. An orange line indicates the fragment amplified by PCR. The in-frame stop codon that precedes the start codon for pro-boophilin is shaded blue. The deduced amino acid sequence of boophilin (142 residues) would correspond to a polypeptide with a higher molecular mass than that experimentally determined by MALDI-MS. However, if one considers the presence of a 15-residue pro-peptide, the resulting mature inhibitor would have a theoretical mass of 13,950 Da, in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined value of 13,964 Da. (Notice that no putative <em>N</em>-glycosylation sites are present in the boophilin sequence). Further, the mature protein starts with a glutamine residue that could spontaneously cyclise to pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (5-oxo-proline). This modification would explain the blocked N-terminus observed in native boophilin, and has previously been reported in other Kunitz inhibitors such as an BPTI variant from bovine lung <a href="#pone.0001624-Siekmann1">[74]</a>. Open triangles indicate the positions where discrete differences exist in the amino acid sequences of the two boophilin variants.</p>
