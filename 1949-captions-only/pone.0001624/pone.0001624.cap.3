                Figure 3.  The two boophilin domains are more closely related to canonical Kunitz modules than to ornithodorin.Comparison of the amino acid sequence of mature boophilin with three other two-domain inhibitors, ornithodorin, amblin, and bikunin; the unique C-terminal extension in amblin has been omitted for clarity. Also included in the alignment are the sequences of BPTI and of the closest related human Kunitz modules structurally characterised so far (two copies, one aligned with each Kunitz module of boophilin): The second and third TFPI domains (1TFX [6] and 1IRH [75], respectively), the single Kunitz domain of APP (1AAP) [39], and the C-terminal Kunitz domain of type VI collagen (2KNT) [76]. Numbers refer to the full-length sequence of boophilin. Residues conserved throughout are white with red shading; residues identical to boophilin are white with blue shading; conservatively replaced residues are shaded green. The four major antigenic determinants in boophilin are boxed. The secondary structure elements of boophilin are shown below the alignment; β-strands are represented as arrows and α-helices as cylinders. The P1 residues within the reactive-site loops are indicated with black arrowheads; open arrowheads point to boophilin/ornithodorin residues involved in important contacts with thrombin exosite I. Notice that several exosite-interacting residues are conserved or conservatively replaced in boophilin, while they are mostly non-conservatively replaced in amblin (e.g., E130→K, L137→K).
