                Figure 4.  Thrombin-bound boophilin retains the ability to interact with other serine proteinases.(A) Schematic representation of two hypothetical thrombin·boophilin complexes. In the upper, BPTI-like mechanism, binding of the C-terminal boophilin domain to exosite I promotes extensive rearrangements of loops surrounding the active site to allow insertion of the N-terminal domain in a canonical manner. In the alternative, ornithodorin-like mechanism, exosite engagement is not associated with important modifications of the thrombin active site region, which is occupied by the N-terminal peptide of the inhibitor in a parallel manner. (B) Demonstration of thrombin·boophilin·trypsin ternary complex formation via native gel electrophoresis. One µg human α-thrombin·boophilin complex was incubated with increasing amounts of bovine trypsin (from ≈300 ng, lane 3, to ≈6 µg, lane 9), and samples were resolved in an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Lanes 1 and 2 contain 1 µg thrombin and 1 µg thrombin·boophilin complex, respectively; the newly formed species corresponds to the ternary complex.
