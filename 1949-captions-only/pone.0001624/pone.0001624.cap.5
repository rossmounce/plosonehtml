Notice that the reactive-site loops of both inhibitor domains point away from the proteinase moiety; the corresponding P<sub>1</sub> residues, <sup>B</sup>K31 and <sup>B</sup>A99, are shown as space-filling models. Within the dimer interface, direct hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of <sup>B</sup>S97 and the main-chain carbonyl of <sup>B</sup>G124 located in opposite C-terminal domains of boophilin, and between the side chains of <sup>T</sup>D21 and <sup>T</sup>Q14A.</p>
