                Figure 5.  Three-dimensional structure of the α-thrombin·boophilin complex.The crystallographic dimer present in the asymmetric unit is shown as a ribbon plot; thrombin molecules are coloured blue and green and boophilin molecules are coloured red and orange. Notice that the reactive-site loops of both inhibitor domains point away from the proteinase moiety; the corresponding P1 residues, BK31 and BA99, are shown as space-filling models. Within the dimer interface, direct hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of BS97 and the main-chain carbonyl of BG124 located in opposite C-terminal domains of boophilin, and between the side chains of TD21 and TQ14A.
