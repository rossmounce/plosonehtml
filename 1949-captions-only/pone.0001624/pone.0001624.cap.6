The N and C termini of boophilin are labelled and its disulfide bonds are shown as sticks. Notice that in spite of significant sequence similarity between the carboxy-terminal domain of boophilin and other Kunitz-type inhibitors (<a href="#pone-0001624-g003">Figure 3</a>), with strict conservation of cysteine spacing, its putative P<sub>1</sub> residue is nevertheless an alanine (<sup>B</sup>A99), thus precluding inhibition of trypsin-like serine proteinases.</p>
