                Figure 6.  Boophilin is structurally more related to canonical Kunitz modules than to the distorted ornithodorin domains.Stereo plots showing the three-dimensional structure of (A) boophilin's N-terminal domain (red) overlaid on those of the second TFPI domain, as seen in its complex with porcine trypsin (orange, PDB entry 1TFX) [6], and of the N-terminal ornithodorin domain (yellow, 1TOC) [25], and (B) boophilin's C-terminal domain (red) superimposed on those of APP single Kunitz domain (cyan, 1TAW) [8], and the C-terminal ornithodorin domain (yellow, 1TOC) [25]. The N and C termini of boophilin are labelled and its disulfide bonds are shown as sticks. Notice that in spite of significant sequence similarity between the carboxy-terminal domain of boophilin and other Kunitz-type inhibitors (Figure 3), with strict conservation of cysteine spacing, its putative P1 residue is nevertheless an alanine (BA99), thus precluding inhibition of trypsin-like serine proteinases.
