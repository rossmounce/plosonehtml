                Figure 7.  Different orientations of the Kunitz domains in thrombin complexes with boophilin and ornithodorin.(A) Stereo plot showing a comparison of thrombin·boophilin (blue/red) and thrombin·ornithodorin (blue/yellow) complexes, after overlaying both thrombin moieties. Notice the large displacements of the corresponding N- and C-terminal Kunitz modules relative to each other. (B) Stereo close-up highlighting the docking of the C-terminal domain of boophilin (red) to thrombin (blue) exosite I. Water molecules are represented as orange spheres and hydrogen bonds as rows of small grey spheres. The side chains of residues involved in intermolecular contacts are shown and labelled.
