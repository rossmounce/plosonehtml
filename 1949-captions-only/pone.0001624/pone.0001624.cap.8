The final electron density for the thrombin·boophilin complex, contoured at 1σ, is displayed as a blue mesh. The catalytic triad of thrombin (<sup>T</sup>H57, <sup>T</sup>D102, <sup>T</sup>S195) is highlighted in orange and the side-chains of <sup>T</sup>D189 and <sup>T</sup>E192 are coloured pale green and cyan, respectively. Disulfide bonds are represented as yellow sticks. (B) Schematic representation of the thrombin-boophilin interactions at the enzyme's active site. Inhibitor residues are coloured red and hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines.</p>
