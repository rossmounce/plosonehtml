                Figure 9.  Predicted boophilin interactions with meizothrombin and FXa.(A) Model of the three-dimensional meizothrombin路boophilin complex, generated by overlaying the coordinates of bovine meizothrombin (blue except for the Kringle 2 domain, in green; 1A0H) [57] onto the thrombin moiety of the current complex with boophilin. Residues BR17 and BK31 are shown as space-filling models and labelled. (B) Model of the putative MzT路boophilin路FXa ternary complex. FXa (yellow, except for domain EGF2, in olive; 1FJS) [58] was docked onto the complex displayed in (A) by juxtaposition onto a trypsin路APP complex (1TFX) [6] that had been previously overlaid onto the N-terminal domain of boophilin (red). Absence of any steric clashes shows that formation of such a ternary complex in vivo would be feasible. The N- and C-terminal domains of boophilin (Boophilin (N) and Boophilin (C), respectively), the serine proteinase and Kringle 2 domains of meizothrombin (SP (MzT) and Kringle 2, respectively), and the serine proteinase and EGF-2 domains of factor Xa (SP (FXa) and EGF-2, respectively) are labelled. (C) Schematic representation of a possible mechanism for boophilin inhibition of the membrane-bound prothrombinase complex. Both FXa and meizothrombin interact with the membrane surface (dark red) via their respective Gla domains (light green). The multi-domain organisation of FVa (violet) and its contacts with FXa/MzT have been omitted for simplicity. The N-terminal domain of boophilin (red) could bridge the catalytic domains of meizothrombin (dark green) and FXa (blue) while bound to the cofactor.
