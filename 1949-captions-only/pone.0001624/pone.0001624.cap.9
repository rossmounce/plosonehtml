Residues <sup>B</sup>R17 and <sup>B</sup>K31 are shown as space-filling models and labelled. (B) Model of the putative MzT路boophilin路FXa ternary complex. FXa (yellow, except for domain EGF2, in olive; 1FJS) <a href="#pone.0001624-Adler1">[58]</a> was docked onto the complex displayed in (A) by juxtaposition onto a trypsin路APP complex (1TFX) <a href="#pone.0001624-Burgering1">[6]</a> that had been previously overlaid onto the N-terminal domain of boophilin (red). Absence of any steric clashes shows that formation of such a ternary complex <em>in vivo</em> would be feasible. The N- and C-terminal domains of boophilin (Boophilin (N) and Boophilin (C), respectively), the serine proteinase and Kringle 2 domains of meizothrombin (SP (MzT) and Kringle 2, respectively), and the serine proteinase and EGF-2 domains of factor Xa (SP (FXa) and EGF-2, respectively) are labelled. (C) Schematic representation of a possible mechanism for boophilin inhibition of the membrane-bound prothrombinase complex. Both FXa and meizothrombin interact with the membrane surface (dark red) via their respective Gla domains (light green). The multi-domain organisation of FVa (violet) and its contacts with FXa/MzT have been omitted for simplicity. The N-terminal domain of boophilin (red) could bridge the catalytic domains of meizothrombin (dark green) and FXa (blue) while bound to the cofactor.</p>
