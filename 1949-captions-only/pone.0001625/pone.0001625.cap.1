                Figure 1.  BMP and Wnt Signals are Required for the Specification of Neural Crest at the Gastrula Stage.(A) To the right, a schematic stage 10 chick embryo. The line indicates the level of the transverse sections shown in the corresponding panel. Sox1 is expressed in neural cells. Snail2 is expressed in premigratory and early migratory neural crest cells. HNK-1 is expressed in all migratory neural crest cells. Ker is expressed in epidermal cells. (B) Ectodermal explants were isolated, separated form the mesoderm and endoderm, cultured in vitro to the developmental equivalent of stage 10, before fixation, freezing and sectioning. Green box indicates explanted tissue used in (C–E). (C–E) Consecutive sections showing expression of molecular markers in explants cultured for 20–22 hr. (C) Stage 4 CB explants (n = 30) generated Snail2+ and HNK-1+ cells, and a few Sox1+ cells and Ker+ cells. (D) Stage 4 CB explants cultured in the presence of Noggin (n = 30) generated Sox1+ cells, but no Snail2+, HNK-1+ or Ker+ cells. (E) Stage 4 CB explants cultured in the presence of mFrz8CRD (n = 20) generated Ker+ cells, but no Sox1+, Snail2+ or HNK-1+ cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (C–E).
