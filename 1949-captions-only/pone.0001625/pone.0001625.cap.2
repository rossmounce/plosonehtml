                Figure 2.  Wnt Activity Caudalizes Border Cells.(A–D) Consecutive sections showing expression of molecular markers in explants cultured for 20–22 hr or 43–45 hr. (A) Stage 4 CB explants (n = 30) generated Snail2+ and HNK-1+ cells, and a few Ker+ cells, but no δ-crystallin+, HuCD+ or Raldh3+ placodal cells. (B) Stage 4 CB explants cultured in the presence of mFrz8CRD (n = 20) generated a distinct region of Raldh3+, HuCD+ and Ker+ cells and a separate region of δ-crystallin+ and Ker+ cells, but no Snail2+ or HNK-1+ cells were detected. (C) Stage 4 RB explants (n = 30) generated a distinct region of Raldh3+, HuCD+ and Ker+ cells and a separate region of δ-crystallin+ and Ker+ cells, but no Snail2+or HNK-1+cells were detected. (D) Stage 4 RB explants cultured in the presence of Wnt3A (1×) (n = 20) generated Snail2+ and HNK-1+cells, and a few Ker+cells, but no δ-crystallin+, HuCD+ or Raldh3+ cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–D).
