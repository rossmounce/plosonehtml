(A,B) Stage 4 C explants cultured alone (n = 25) or together with Wnt3A (4x) (n = 30) generated Sox1<sup>+</sup>cells, but no Snail2<sup>+</sup>, HNK-1<sup>+</sup> or Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells. (C) Stage 4 C explants cultured together with BMP4 (20 ng/ml) (n = 30) generated Pax7<sup>+</sup>, Snail2<sup>+</sup>and HNK-1<sup>+</sup>cells, but no Sox1<sup>+</sup>cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–C).</p>
