                Figure 3.  BMP but not Wnt Signals Induce Neural Crest Character in Caudal Neural Cells.(A–C) Consecutive sections showing expression of molecular markers in explants cultured for 6 hr or 20–22 hr. (A,B) Stage 4 C explants cultured alone (n = 25) or together with Wnt3A (4x) (n = 30) generated Sox1+cells, but no Snail2+, HNK-1+ or Pax7+ cells. (C) Stage 4 C explants cultured together with BMP4 (20 ng/ml) (n = 30) generated Pax7+, Snail2+and HNK-1+cells, but no Sox1+cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–C).
