                Figure 4.  The Specification of Neural Crest is Independent of BMP and Wnt Activity at the Head Fold Stage.(A–C) Consecutive sections showing expression of molecular markers in explants cultured for 18–20 hr. (A,B) Stage 6 CB explants cultured alone (n = 20) or in the presence of mFrz8CRD (n = 15) generated Snail2+and HNK-1+cells, and a few Sox1+cells and Ker+cells. (C) Stage 6 CB explants cultured in the presence of Noggin (n = 20) generated Snail2+cells, and a few Sox1+cells and Ker+cells, but no HNK-1+ cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–C).
