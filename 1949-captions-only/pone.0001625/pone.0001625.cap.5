(A) Stage 4 R explants cultured alone (n = 30) generated Sox1<sup>+</sup> and Pax6<sup>+</sup>cells, but no Pax2<sup>+</sup>, En1/2<sup>+</sup>, Snail2<sup>+</sup> or HNK-1<sup>+</sup> cells. (B) Stage 4 R explants cultured together with Wnt3A (2x) (n = 30) generated Snail2<sup>+</sup>and HNK-1<sup>+</sup>cells, but no Sox1<sup>+</sup>, Pax6<sup>+</sup>, Pax2<sup>+</sup> or En1/2<sup>+</sup> cells. (C) Stage 4 R explants cultured together with Wnt3A (2×) and Noggin (n = 20) generated Sox1<sup>+</sup>, Pax2<sup>+</sup> and En1/2<sup>+</sup>cells, but no Pax6<sup>+</sup>, Snail2<sup>+</sup> or HNK-1<sup>+</sup> cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–C).</p>
