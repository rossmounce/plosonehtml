                Figure 5.  Wnt-regulated BMP Activity Induces Neural Crest Character in Prospective Forebrain Cells.(A–C) Consecutive sections showing expression of molecular markers in explants cultured for 20–22 hr. (A) Stage 4 R explants cultured alone (n = 30) generated Sox1+ and Pax6+cells, but no Pax2+, En1/2+, Snail2+ or HNK-1+ cells. (B) Stage 4 R explants cultured together with Wnt3A (2x) (n = 30) generated Snail2+and HNK-1+cells, but no Sox1+, Pax6+, Pax2+ or En1/2+ cells. (C) Stage 4 R explants cultured together with Wnt3A (2×) and Noggin (n = 20) generated Sox1+, Pax2+ and En1/2+cells, but no Pax6+, Snail2+ or HNK-1+ cells. Data are represented as mean±SEM. Scale bar, 100 µm (A–C).
