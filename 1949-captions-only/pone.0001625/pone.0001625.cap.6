                Figure 6.  Wnt Signaling Up-regulates Bmp2 and Bmp4 Expression in Prospective Forebrain Cells.Relative Bmp2, Bmp4 and Sp5 mRNA levels measured by quantitative real-time PCR in stage 4 R explants cultured in the presence of Wnt3A (2x) compared to explants cultured alone. Bars represent meanÂ±SEM of 5 independent experiments.
