                Figure 7.  Early Development of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems is Coordinated by Wnt and BMP Signals.(A) Schematic representation of a stage 4 embryo showing the distribution of Wnt and BMP activities in the neural plate and neural plate border. (B) Schematic diagram showing proposed roles of Wnt and BMP signals between stage 4 and 6 in chick. Wnt signals impose caudal character in both neural plate and neural plate border cells. At rostral neural (RN) levels in absence of Wnt signals, BMP signals induce olfactory/lens placodal (OLP) cells, and at caudal neural (CN) levels in the context of Wnt signaling, BMP signals induce neural crest (NC) cells.
