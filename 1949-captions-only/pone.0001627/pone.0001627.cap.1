                Figure 1.  Induction of WB-MCF in rabbits.A. Cumulative incidence survival curve of AlHV-1 infected rabbits. On day 0, two groups, each consisting of four rabbits, were inoculated intravenously with 3×106 mock infected or AlHV-1 infected EBL cells. At day 10 post-inoculation, BrdU (25 mg/kg) was injected intravenously every day to all rabbits. Rabbit developing WD-MCF were euthanized when rectal temperature remained higher than 40°C for two consecutive days. For each euthanized infected rabbit, a contemporary mock infected rabbit was also sacrificed. Rabbits were identified according to their infected (IR) or mock infected (MR) status and according to the time of death (see numbers). B. Popliteal lymph nodes were dissected during necropsy examination. C. Relative proportions of CD11b+, IgM+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in PBMC, popliteal lymph node and spleen of AlHV-1 infected (IR) or mock infected rabbits (MR). At time of death, cell suspensions were prepared, stained and analysed by flow cytometry.
