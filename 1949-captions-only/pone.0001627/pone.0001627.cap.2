PBMCs were collected at days 11, 15, 17, 20 and 24 post-inoculation, while mononuclear cells were isolated from popliteal lymph node and spleen at the time of death. Cells were labelled with anti-CD11b, IgM, CD5, CD4 and CD8 mAbs as the primary antibodies. Alexa 633-GAM was used as the secondary antibody. <em>In vivo</em> BrdU incorporation was revealed by immunofluorescent staining as described in <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. After staining, cells were analysed by flow cytometry. A. Representative flow cytometry dot plots are shown for each double staining, they illustrate the data obtained at day 17 post-infection for the PBMC of rabbits MR17/1 and IR17/1. The data represent the percentages of BrdU positive cells (<em>y</em>-axis) calculated based on the acquisition of 10,000 cells expressing the indicated cell marker (<em>x</em>-axis). B. The percentage of BrdU positive cells amongst the indicated cellular subset was determined and compared between AlHV-1 infected (left column: bold lines; middle and right columns: hatched bars) and mock infected (left column: dotted lines; middle and right columns: open bars) groups (* <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; **<em>P</em>&lt;0.005, *** <em>P</em>&lt;0.0001). In the left column the following symbols were used: ▴, MR17/1 and IR17/1; □, MR17/2 and IR17/2; •, MR20 and IR20; ○, MR24 and IR24.</p>
