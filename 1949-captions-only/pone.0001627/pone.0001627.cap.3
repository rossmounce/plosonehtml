A. Viral load in PBMC over time and in lympoid organs at the time of death. PBMC were collected at days 0, 7, 11, 15, 17, 20 and 24 post-infection, while mononuclear cells were isolated from popliteal lymph node and spleen at the time of death. DNA was extracted from cells and was subjected to viral (ORF3) and cellular (β-globin) real-time PCR quantification. The results are expressed as the estimated AlHV-1 mean genome copy number per 10<sup>5</sup> cellular β-globin genomic copies. Data are the mean±SEM of triplicate measures. In the left panel, the following symbol are used: ▴, IR17/1; □, IR17/2; •, IR20; ○, IR24. B. AlHV-1 tropism amongst PBMC collected before euthanasia. Isolated cells were labelled with anti-CD11b, IgM, CD5, CD4 and CD8 mAbs as the primary antibodies, and Alexa 633-GAM, as the secondary antibody. For each mAbs, ten positive cells were sorted per well in 10 wells of a 96-well plate using an automatic cell deposit unit as described in <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. After freezing at −80°C, PCR were performed in order to detect the AlHV-1 ORF50 and the cellular β-globin gene. Marker sizes (MS) are indicated on the left. The results presented in this figure were obtained with the PBMC of IR20. They are representative of the results obtained with the 4 infected rabbits.</p>
