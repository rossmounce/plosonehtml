Total RNA was extracted from isolated cells. Expression of cellular Î²-globin gene and viral genes (ORF73, ORF50, ORF9 and ORF25) was studied using the RT-PCR approach described in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. DNA, purified AlHV-1 genomic DNA; MR, RNA extracted from the lymph node of a mock infected rabbit, C<em>+</em>, RNA purified from infected EBL cells.</p>
