                Figure 4.  AlHV-1 gene expression in secondary lymphoid organs of rabbit with WD-MCF.Mononuclear cells were isolated from the spleen and the popliteal lymph node of rabbits at the time of death. Total RNA was extracted from isolated cells. Expression of cellular Î²-globin gene and viral genes (ORF73, ORF50, ORF9 and ORF25) was studied using the RT-PCR approach described in the Methods. DNA, purified AlHV-1 genomic DNA; MR, RNA extracted from the lymph node of a mock infected rabbit, C+, RNA purified from infected EBL cells.
