Black and stippled boxes represent coding exons for the propeptide and C-terminal domain, respectively. The location of the point mutation (D76A) is denoted by an asterisk, and LoxP sites are denoted by triangles. Removal of the neo cassette using EIIa-cre mice resulted in <em>Mstn</em> alleles containing a single LoxP site (in intron 1) either with (<em>Mstn<sup>D76A</sup></em>) or without (<em>Mstn<sup>LoxP</sup></em>) the point mutation. (b) Northern analysis of <em>Mstn</em> RNA expression in mutant mice. Muscle RNA isolated from <em>Mstn<sup>−/−</sup></em>, wild type, and <em>Mstn<sup>D76A/D76A</sup></em> mice was electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with a <em>Mstn</em> probe. The blots were re-hybridized with a probe for the S26 ribosomal protein to control for loading. (c) Analysis of myostatin protein in mutant mice. Hydroxylapatite-bound serum samples isolated from wild type, <em>Mstn<sup>−/−</sup></em>, and <em>Mstn<sup>D76A/D76A</sup></em> mice were electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with antiserum directed against either the C-terminal domain <a href="#pone.0001628-McPherron1">[2]</a> or the propeptide <a href="#pone.0001628-Lee3">[15]</a>. In each gel, the first lane contains purified myostatin latent complex isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells <a href="#pone.0001628-Lee3">[15]</a>.</p>
