                Figure 1.  Generation of mice carrying a Mstn point mutation rendering the propeptide resistant to cleavage by BMP-1/TLD proteases.(a) Gene targeting strategy. Black and stippled boxes represent coding exons for the propeptide and C-terminal domain, respectively. The location of the point mutation (D76A) is denoted by an asterisk, and LoxP sites are denoted by triangles. Removal of the neo cassette using EIIa-cre mice resulted in Mstn alleles containing a single LoxP site (in intron 1) either with (MstnD76A) or without (MstnLoxP) the point mutation. (b) Northern analysis of Mstn RNA expression in mutant mice. Muscle RNA isolated from Mstn−/−, wild type, and MstnD76A/D76A mice was electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with a Mstn probe. The blots were re-hybridized with a probe for the S26 ribosomal protein to control for loading. (c) Analysis of myostatin protein in mutant mice. Hydroxylapatite-bound serum samples isolated from wild type, Mstn−/−, and MstnD76A/D76A mice were electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with antiserum directed against either the C-terminal domain [2] or the propeptide [15]. In each gel, the first lane contains purified myostatin latent complex isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells [15].
