Locations of exons 6–9 are shown as black boxes, and LoxP sites are denoted by triangles. (b) Northern analysis of <em>Tll2</em> expression levels. Twenty micrograms of poly A-selected brain RNA isolated from either wild type or <em>Tll2<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice were electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with a <em>Tll2</em> probe corresponding to exons 1–3. The blot was re-hybridized with a probe for the S26 ribosomal protein to control for loading. (c) Muscle weight increases in <em>Tll2<sup>−/−</sup></em> mice. Numbers represent percent increases relative to wild type mice and were calculated from the data shown in <a href="#pone-0001628-t001">Table 1</a>. Muscles analyzed were: pectoralis (red), triceps (gray), quadriceps (blue), and gastrocnemius (green).</p>
