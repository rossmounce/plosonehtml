                Figure 3.  Generation and analysis of mice carrying a loss-of-function mutation in the Tll2 gene.(a) Gene targeting strategy. Locations of exons 6–9 are shown as black boxes, and LoxP sites are denoted by triangles. (b) Northern analysis of Tll2 expression levels. Twenty micrograms of poly A-selected brain RNA isolated from either wild type or Tll2−/− mice were electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with a Tll2 probe corresponding to exons 1–3. The blot was re-hybridized with a probe for the S26 ribosomal protein to control for loading. (c) Muscle weight increases in Tll2−/− mice. Numbers represent percent increases relative to wild type mice and were calculated from the data shown in Table 1. Muscles analyzed were: pectoralis (red), triceps (gray), quadriceps (blue), and gastrocnemius (green).
