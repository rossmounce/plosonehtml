                Figure 4.  Rapid colour changes in Uca capricornis in response to capture.Each graph corresponds to the spectral reflectance of the area indicated in red on the stylised carapace. Measurements were taken at 0 (blue), 5 (red), 10 (yellow) and 20 (black) minutes after capture. Most individuals steadily darkened their entire colour pattern (a), while in others the yellow scarf region and blue meral spots were more likely to darken (b). Some began to regain their colour within the 20 minutes (c). A small number of crabs, particularly males, did not change colour over 20 minutes (d).
