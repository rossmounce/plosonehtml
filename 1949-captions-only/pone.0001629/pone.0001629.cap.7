                Figure 7.  Changes in colouration associated with moulting in Uca capricornis.(a) The typical male progression from a mottled black and white pattern, to distinct white spots with a yellow scarf is illustrated by the successive moults of 2 males, separated by a line. (b) Females have a more variable progression. The successive moults of one small individual are presented to represent the less colourful phase, and three individuals are presented to illustrate the more variable colour patterns of larger females, with their corresponding carapace widths below.
