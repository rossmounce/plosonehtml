                Figure 8.  The theoretical perception of average colour patterns by Uca capricornis.The dorsal view of the carapace has been projected onto the ommatidial array (indicated by the red circles), for viewing distances of 5, 10 and 15 cm. The various colour patches of both females (a) and males (b) are theoretically distinguishable at 5, 10, and 15 cm.
