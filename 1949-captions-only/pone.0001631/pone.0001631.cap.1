Glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) was used as a loading control. Graphic representation of Fabp7 expression normalized against Gapdh indicated 3 to 5 fold changes in mRNA levels (top panel); **p&lt;0.01, *p&lt;0.05, t = 0.06 (t-test). Each time point represents 12 individual animals pooled. <em>N</em> = 2–3 groups. B) Northern blot analysis of RNA collected every 4 hours showed diurnal changes in Fabp7 mRNA but not Fabp5. C) Collapsed data from B normalized with Gapdh indicated significant diurnal changes in Fabp7 mRNA across a 24-hour period but no changes in Fabp5 expression. One-way ANOVA, ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01 (post-hoc Bonferroni). Each value represents the regional average +/− S.E.M. Each time point represents 3 individual animals pooled.</p>
