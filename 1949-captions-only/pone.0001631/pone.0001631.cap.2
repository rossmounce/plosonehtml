                Figure 2.  Fabp7 mRNA changes globally during the diurnal period.A) Coronal (top series) and sagittal (bottom series) sections from four diurnal time points subjected to in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled Fabp7 antisense riboprobe. Note more intense expression levels during lights-on. B) Graphic representation of relative Fabp7 mRNA expression at four time points. A statistically significant diurnal variation in expression was observed; Two-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.001). ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01 versus ZT18 (post-hoc Bonferroni). Each value represents the average +/− S.E.M. N = 2–5 per time point. A, Amygdala; Cb, cerebellum; CC, cerebral cortex; Hb, medullaris/hebenula; Hy, hypothalamus; OB, olfactory bulb; T, thalamus
