                Figure 3.  Fabp7 protein levels are elevated during the dark period.Graphic representation of Western blots from whole brain indicating an increase in Fabp7 protein levels with increasing Zeitgeber time. There is a significant increase in Fabp7 protein at ZT18 compared to ZT0,*p&lt;0.05 (t-test). Each value represents the average +/− S.E.M. N = 3–4 per time point. Values are normalized to an average of Gapdh and β-actin. Inset: Representative immunoblot of whole brain homogenates from tissue isolated at four diurnal time points. A single, predicted 15 kilodalton band was evident in blots incubated with anti-Fabp7 antibody. Blots were subsequently incubated with anti-β-actin and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh).
