There is a significant increase in Fabp7 protein at ZT18 compared to ZT0,*p&lt;0.05 (<em>t</em>-test). Each value represents the average +/− S.E.M. <em>N</em> = 3–4 per time point. Values are normalized to an average of Gapdh and β-actin. Inset: Representative immunoblot of whole brain homogenates from tissue isolated at four diurnal time points. A single, predicted 15 kilodalton band was evident in blots incubated with anti-Fabp7 antibody. Blots were subsequently incubated with anti-β-actin and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh).</p>
