Top panels, phosphorimages of amygdala, bottom panels, dark field images of a different set of hybridized sections subjected to emulsion autoradiography. Higher levels of Fabp7 were evident during lights-on. B) Graphic representation of elevated Fabp7 mRNA levels during lights-on in basolateral and medial amygdala. Two-way ANOVA (p = 0.002). ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01 vs. ZT18 (post-hoc t-test). Each value represents the average +/− S.E.M. <em>N</em> = 2–4 per time point. C) Sections processed for <em>in situ</em> hybridization for Fabp7 subjected to emulsion autoradiography. Dark field microscopy revealed a more dispersed labeling pattern at ZT 6 (C1) compared to ZT18 (C2). Higher magnification micrographs of Nissl counterstained sections indicated labeling over cells whose staining pattern was consistent with an astrocyte morphology and whose labeling pattern was more disperse at ZT6 (C3) compared to ZT18 (C4). Note that silver grain accumulation around cell nuclei was similar at the two time points (arrows in C3 and C4). Astrocytes stained with DIG-labeled riboprobe for Fabp7 (unstained astrocytic nuclei (n) are indicated) were also co-labeled for mRNA for the astrocyte protein, GFAP (silver grain accumulations). Unstained neuronal nuclei (N) are shown for reference. A representative tissue section subjected to immunohistochemistry with anti-Fabp7 antibodies is shown in C6. Note astrocytic processes emanating from stained cell somata. Bar in A = 400 µm; in C1,C2 = 100 µm; in C3,C4 = 20 µm; in C5 = 10 µm, C6 = 30 µm BLA, basolateral amygdala; MA, medial amygdala</p>
