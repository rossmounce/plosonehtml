Top panels, phosphorimages of hippocampus, bottom panels, dark field images of a different set of hybridized sections subjected to emulsion autoradiography. Higher levels of Fabp7 were evident during lights-on. Arrowheads in bottom panels indicate subgranular zone of dentate gyrus (DG). B) Graphic representation of <em>in situ</em> hybridization data indicating elevated levels of Fabp7 mRNA during lights-on in hippocampus (top panel) and subgranular zone (bottom panel). One-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.001). ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01 vs. ZT18 (post-hoc Bonferroni). Each value represents the average +/− S.E.M. <em>N</em> = 2–4 per time point. C) Sections subjected to <em>in situ</em> hybridization for Fabp7 and emulsion autoradiography. Light- (C1, C2) and dark field (C3, C4) micrographs of sections from ZT6 and ZT18, respectively. Arrowheads indicate Fabp7 positive precursor cells in subgranular zone. Sections co-stained for Fabp7 mRNA (dark stain) and nestin mRNA (dark silver grains) identified co-labeled precursors in the subgranular zone (C5). Sections subjected to immunohistochemistry for Fabp7 (C6) revealed radial fibers emanating from stained cell bodies (arrows) as previously described. Bar in upper, lightfield micrographs in A = 500 µm; in lower, darkfield micrographs in A = 200 µm; in C1,C2 = 30 µm; in C3,C4 = 30 µm; in C5 = 5 µm; C6 = 25 µm. DG, dentate gyrus; GCL, granule cell layer; H, hebenula; HF, hippocampal fissure; T, thalamus</p>
