                Figure 1.  Involvement of chromosomes in missegregations (MSG) and structural rearrangements (SR) in our series of 96 near-diploid colorectal tumors.Frequencies of MSG (A) with their resulting gains and losses (B) and frequencies of SR (C) with their resulting gains and losses (D) are represented. The dotted line represents the cut-off value indicated by the likelihood statistical modeling that discriminates chromosomes that are likely to be selected for during tumor progression (red) from those constituting the background of chromosomal instability (grey). In B and D, each bar represents the percentage of loss (lower) or gain (upper) of a chromosome (B) or chromosome arm (D, p arm first, then q arm for non-acrocentric chromosomes).
