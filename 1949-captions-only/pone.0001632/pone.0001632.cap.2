                Figure 2.  Most relevant chromosomal targets for missegregation (MSG) and structural rearrangements (SR) are mutually exclusive.Among the chromosomes or chromosome arms that are likely to be selected for during tumor progression according the likelihood modeling (see Figures 1B and 1D), only those for which a significative tendency towards either gain or loss were retained (Chi2 test, under the null hypothesis, the numbers of gains and losses should be distributed uniformly). Chromosomal losses (blue background) and gains (red background) are distinguished.
