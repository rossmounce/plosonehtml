Positive (continuous lines) and negative (dotted lines) associations are represented by thick and thin lines indicating significant associations at p = 0.01 and 0.05 level, respectively. The size of each box is proportional to the frequency of the alteration, whole-chromosome or chromosome arm gains (red background), and chromosome losses or deletions (blue background) being distinguished. The preferential associations between alterations involving both arms of the same chromosome, such as -8p and +8q, or -17p and +17q, need to be interpreted with caution since they originate mostly from a single isochromosome formation event. For instance, gain of 17q seems to be a side effect of 17p deletion via isochromosome 17q formation (10/11 tumors with 17q gain also exhibited 17p loss whereas 17p loss alone was observed in an additional 30 tumors) whereas both 8p loss and 8q gain might provide tumor cells with a selective advantage since although associated in 20 tumors, these alterations were also observed independently in 8 and 7 tumors, respectively (see also Supplementary <a href="#pone.0001632.s005">Figure S1</a>). Some negative associations (between +13 and +13q, +8 and +8q, +8 and -8p) could also be due to the fact they involve the same chromosome.</p>
