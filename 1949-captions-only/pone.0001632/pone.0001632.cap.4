                Figure 4.  The role of chromosomal instability in near-diploid colorectal tumors according to MSI status.In MSS tumors, combination of the pathway of chromosome gains with that of chromosomal losses is necessary to target both oncogenes (ONC) and tumor suppressor genes (TSG), respectively. In MSI tumors, the pathway of chromosome gains is frequently observed whereas that of chromosomal losses is rarely found. In these tumors however, loss of function events are frequently observed as the consequence of frameshift mutations in coding microsatellite sequences. MSG, missegregation; SR, structural rearrangements.
