In MSI tumors, the pathway of chromosome gains is frequently observed whereas that of chromosomal losses is rarely found. In these tumors however, loss of function events are frequently observed as the consequence of frameshift mutations in coding microsatellite sequences. MSG, missegregation; SR, structural rearrangements.</p>
