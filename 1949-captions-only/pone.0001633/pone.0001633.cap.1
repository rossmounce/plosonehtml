                Figure 1.  Sequential translocations of Bb across a platelet (see text).Total elapsed time, A-H: 9 sec. Measured crossing speeds were as fast as 2800 µm/min, upward of two orders of magni-tude above the speed of a human neutrophil, the fastest cell in the body. Images from real-time phase-contrast videomicroscopy. Approx. ×1,000.
