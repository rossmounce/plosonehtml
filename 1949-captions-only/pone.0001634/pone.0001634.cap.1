                Figure 1.  Profiles and cross-over points of novel recombination in the AAV cap gene.A. Schematic drawing of the cap gene products (VP1-3) with five recombination cross-over points inferred by LOHA analyses below (triangles colour-coordinated with Panels B-F) is shown. Viral phospholipase A and antigenic GH loop domains are indicated. B–F. Recombination profiles for representative combinations of 3 sequences (recombinant/parent 1×parent 2) were visualised by the LOHA analysis. Percent mismatch across a sliding window of 41 Nt positions between recombinant/parent pairs were plotted against the nucleotide positions along the multiple alignment with a step interval of 1 position. The x-axis also indicates three regions (R1-3) separately analysed in the following studies (see Fig 2 and 3).
