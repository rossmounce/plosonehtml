                Figure 2.  Local phylogenetic trees between 53 AAV cap sequences.Neighbour-joining trees were produced based on the nucleotide alignment for 3 regions: R1, VP1 unique; R2, between VP2 and VP3 N-termini; R3, VP3 coding region shared by all VP 1-3 (see Fig 1). Phylogenetic discordance between the three regions was observed for recombinant sequences. Tree structure difference between regions, particularly R1 versus R3, demonstrates the mosaic nature of the cap gene. Fifty-three sequences were selected by excluding sequences of non-mammalian origin (except an avian AAV used as the root), sequences derived from Tulane/F953 monkey and a number of ‘redundant’ sequences as indicated in Table S1. Bootstrap scores greater than 90 % are shown. Recombinant sequences depicted in Fig 1B–F are colour-boxed. A branch length scale common for all three trees is shown.
