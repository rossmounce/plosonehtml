Phylogenetic discordance between the three regions was observed for recombinant sequences. Tree structure difference between regions, particularly R1 versus R3, demonstrates the mosaic nature of the <em>cap</em> gene. Fifty-three sequences were selected by excluding sequences of non-mammalian origin (except an avian AAV used as the root), sequences derived from Tulane/F953 monkey and a number of ‘redundant’ sequences as indicated in <a href="#pone.0001634.s001">Table S1</a>. Bootstrap scores greater than 90 % are shown. Recombinant sequences depicted in <a href="#pone-0001634-g001">Fig 1B–F</a> are colour-boxed. A branch length scale common for all three trees is shown.</p>
