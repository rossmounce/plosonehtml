A Phyml maximum likelihood (ML) tree for R1 region was generated for a dataset of 29 sequences (see selection in <a href="#pone.0001634.s001">Table S1</a>). AAV4 was used as the outgroup and the bootstrap scores greater than 80 % are shown. Tightly clustered sequence groups, G1 of 15 sequences and G2 of 10 sequences, were identified and indicated. A similar tree was obtained using neighbour-joining method and its bootstrap scores that support G1 and G2 clustering are shown in parentheses. B. An ML tree for the full-length cap was obtained and shown in the same way as the R1 tree (Panel A). C. Average group LOHA profiles based on the nucleotide alignment are shown. Percent mismatch scores across a sliding window of 101 Nt positions for all possible pairs between all 29 sequences (Control), 15 G1 sequences (G1) and 10 G2 sequences (G2) were averaged and plotted against the nucleotide positions. D. Similar average LOHA profiles with 33 a.a. window size were obtained based on the amino acid sequence alignment.</p>
