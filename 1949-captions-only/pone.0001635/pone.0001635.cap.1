                Figure 1.  Spatial clustering of invaded counties throughout the invasion history.Join count z-score test statistic values at each decadal interval since initial introduction for the contiguous US (A,D), and east (B,E) and west (C,F) of the 90th meridian for Japanese knotweed (left column) and mugwort (right column). The bold line (1,1) represents adjoining counties both with a Japanese knotweed or mugwort record, the solid line (0,1) represents adjoining counties where one county has a weed record and the other does not, and the dashed line (0,0) represents adjoining counties where neither contain a weed record. Horizontal red bars show positive and negative Z-score thresholds at P = 0.05.
