(A) The identity of each commercially-purchased immunoglobulin myeloma protein was confirmed upon reaction with the corresponding HRP-labeled anti-isotype antibodies respectively i.e. IgG1κ, IgG2κ, IgG3κ, IgA1κ, IgA2κ, IgMκ, IgDκ and IgEλ (B) Similarly HRP-labeled antibody against IgG4 Fc specifically reacted to IgG4κ. It also reacted to IgG Fc (faint band on the right panel) but not to IgG Fab or yet Ig Fc lacking IgG4 Fc. (C) An identical membrane (to panel A) was subjected this time, first, to pooled autoimmune pancreatitis sera and then to HRP-labeled anti-IgG4 Fc antibody which in contrast to panel B, reacted to IgG1κ, IgG2κ, IgG3κ, IgG Fc and affinity-purified IgG Fc lacking IgG4 Fc, but not to other human immunoglobulins and IgG Fab, hence establishing the fact that patient IgG4 reacts to IgG1,2 and 3 Fc (additional bands at 220 kDa and about 38 kDa are likely aggregation or degradation products of IgG4). Experiments were repeated three times with identical results and the pooled serum was used at 1:1000 dilution.</p>
