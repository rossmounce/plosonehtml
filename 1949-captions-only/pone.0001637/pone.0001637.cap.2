IgG Fc lacking IgG4 Fc was blotted on each lane. HRP-labeled anti-human IgG4 Fc or HRP-labeled anti-human κ light-chain showed no reactivity to IgG Fc lacking IgG4 Fc (lanes 1 and 2). HRP-labeled anti-IgG4 Fc antibody reacted to lanes 3 and 5, which were previously incubated with purified IgG4 and IgG4 Fc, respectively. HRP-labeled anti-human κ light-chain had no reactivity to lane 4, which was incubated with IgG4 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> (lane 4). These results indicated that IgG4 binds to IgG Fc by its own Fc, and not Fab as a classical RF. Experiments were repeated three times with identical results.</p>
