                Figure 1.  Schematic of construct for recombination into deletion III locus of MVA, based on pBELO-BAC11.DIIIL and DIIIR = left and right flanks for homologous recombination into MVA genome; GFP = green fluorescent protein gene; p4B = Fowlpox virus late promoter; CmR = chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene for selection in E. coli. Flanking FseI sites are absent from MVA and permit excision of the cassette. The PacI site is provided for linearisation of the plasmid prior to recombination with MVA in infected transfected cells.
