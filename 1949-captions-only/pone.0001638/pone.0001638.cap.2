                Figure 2.  Immunogenicity of four MVA-BAC clones (21, 22, 26, 48) in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice compared to parent virus (containing the BAC cassette) and MVA (lacking the BAC cassette).Mice were immunised with 106 pfu i.d. and the specific T cell responses to the indicated endogenous synthetic peptide epitopes [61], [62] were measured 14 days later by IFN-Î³ ELIspot assay. Data are means and SEM from groups of four mice.
