                Figure 4.  Multifunctionality of CD8+ T cells induced 7 days (d7) or 56 days (d56) after immunisation of BALB/c mice with unmodified MVA-BAC or B15R deletion mutant.Histograms show frequency of cells expressing each of the seven possible combinations of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α with bars showing the mean and circles showing the values for individual mice (n = 4). Pie charts show fraction of the total response comprised of cells expressing all three cytokines (black), any two cytokines (dark gray), or one cytokine only (light gray). * p = 0.018, Willcoxon-Rank test. Analysis performed using SPICE software [66].
