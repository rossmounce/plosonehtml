                Figure 5.  Immunogenicity of MVA-BAC expressing a recombinant antigen inserted at the standard thymidine kinase insertion site, in comparison to conventional recombinant MVA and recombineering precursors containing no insertion or GalK.The recombinant antigen, TIP, is an epitope string containing the Pb9 epitope from Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein [67]. Bars show mean specific CD8+ T cell responses to the indicated peptides 7 days after i.d. vaccination of with 106 pfu, from groups of four BALB/c mice, with error bars showing SEM.
