                Figure 10.  Potential role for Stat5 in OX-expressing LHA neurons in mice.(A) Histochemical sections from perfused wild-type male mice were subjected to immunostaining for OX (green, left) and STAT5B (red, middle). Right panel shows merged images demonstrating co-localization of prominent STAT5B expression with OX-expression in the LHA. Insets: magnified view of co-labeled neurons. F = fornix. (B) Total RNA prepared from whole hypothalamus tissue from and Stat5fl/f (ff) and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre (ffnc) mice treated with vehicle (veh) or GM-CSF (GM) was subjected to semi-quantitative real-time PCR for POMC, AgRP, NPY and OX mRNA expression. n&gt;5; *p = 0.01 versus Wt Veh, S5, Veh by ANOVA F(3, 55) = 4.383 with Fisher's LSD test.
