Right panel shows merged images demonstrating co-localization of prominent STAT5B expression with OX-expression in the LHA. Insets: magnified view of co-labeled neurons. F = fornix. (B) Total RNA prepared from whole hypothalamus tissue from and <em>Stat5<sup>fl/f</sup></em> (ff) and <em>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></em> (ffnc) mice treated with vehicle (veh) or GM-CSF (GM) was subjected to semi-quantitative real-time PCR for POMC, AgRP, NPY and OX mRNA expression. n&gt;5; *p = 0.01 versus Wt Veh, S5, Veh by ANOVA F(3, 55) = 4.383 with Fisher's LSD test.</p>
