                Figure 11.  Summary diagram of cytokine signaling pathways controlling body weight.While leptin preferentially signals through STAT3, GM-CSF utilizes STAT5. However, since the GM-CSF-null mice develop milder symptoms than the STAT5-mutant mice described in this study, we propose that some of the STAT5 signaling is induced by leptin or yet another unknown pathway.
