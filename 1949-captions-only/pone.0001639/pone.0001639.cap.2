Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA test revealed that the effect of the genotype on body weight was significant in males (F(1,103) = 5.77, P = 0.024) and females (F9(1,36) = 64.6, P&lt;0.001) (B). Panels C and D show body weights at various ages combined from several cohorts of mice. Values are mean±SEM, n = 5–37 per group. Two Way ANOVA analysis of variance for each age group shows a significant effect of genotype on body weight at all ages tested: 8 weeks−F(1,70) = 4.5, P = 0.037; 10 weeks−F(1,89) = 24.3, P&lt;0.001; 12 weeks−F(1,99) = 6.4, P = 0.013; 14 weeks−F(1,80) = 8.98, P = 0.004; 16 weeks−F(1,87) = 14.9; P&lt;0.001; 18 weeks−F(1,22) = 56.1, P&lt;0.001; 20 weeks−F(1,13) = 37.1, P&lt;0.001; 22 weeks−F(1,20) = 18.6, P&lt;0.001. The effect of gender on body weight was significant at weeks 8 through 16 (with F values ranging from 24 to 87, P&lt;0.001). The interaction between genotype and gender was detected at week 10 only (F(1,89) = 11,2, P = 0.01).</p>
