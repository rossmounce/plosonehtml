                Figure 3.  Increased body fat in Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice.(A) Fat mass of 22 week-old males (n = 4/group) and females (n = 5/group). Left panel shows the amount of fat in grams. By Two Way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak test the effect of genotype was significant ( F(1,14) = 83.1, P&lt;0.001). Right panel represents fat mass as a percentage of body weight (F(1,14) = 42.4, P&lt;0.001 for the effect of genotype; F(1,14) = 8.0, P = 0.014 for the gender effect. (B) Lean mass of 22 week-old males and females in grams (left panel-( F(1,14) = 137, P&lt;0.001 for the genotype effect; F(1,14) = 164, P&lt;0.001 for the gender effect). Right panel presents lean mass as a percentage of total body weight (F(1,14) = 70.4, P&lt;0.001, for the genotype effect, F(1,14) = 30.7 for the gender effect). Body weights were: Stat5fl/fl males 30.5±1.5, Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre males–49.8±0.9 g; Stat5fl/fl females 25.3±1.3 g, Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre females–39.4±1.5 g; F(1.14) = 143, P&lt;0.001 for the genotype effect, F(1,14)+30 for the gender effect. (C) X-ray images of Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre and Stat5fl/fl control male mice (right panel) showing similar size of bone length. There was no statistically significant difference in body length as shown in the graph (left panel).
