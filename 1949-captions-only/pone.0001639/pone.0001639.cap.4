                Figure 4.  Analysis of fat depots and adipocyte size fat analysis from 22 week-old female mice.Subcutaneous (A) and visceral (B) fat were increased in Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice, compared to Stat5fl/fl control mice. (C) Unpaired t-test was used for comparison of fat pad weights from Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre and Stat5fl/fl control mice. Ing (inguinal, t(8) = 5.6, P&lt;0.001), ParaM (parametrial, t(8) = 4.1, P = 0.004), Retro (retroperitoneal, t(8) = 2.9, P = 0.019), Mes (mesenteric, t(8) = 5.3, P&lt;0.001)) and P-renal (perirenal, t(8) = 3.2, P&lt;0.013). See figure 3 for body composition and body weight data. (D–E) Images of cross-sectional adipocytes from Stat5fl/fl (D) and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice (E). (F) Comparison of cell size distribution between two different genotypes for each fat pad. Values are mean cross-sectional area of each fat pad±SEM (n = 3–5 mice per group). Cross-sectional areas less than 100 µm2 were considered artifacts generated during image processing and were not used for statistical analysis. Adipocytes from Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cr mice were significantly larger in inguinal fat (t(8) = 5.3, p,0.001), parametrial fat (t(8) = 2.8, p = 0.02) and mesenteric fat (t(6) = 3.1, 0.02).
