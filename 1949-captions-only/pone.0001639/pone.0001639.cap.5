                Figure 5.  Glucose and insulin tolerance tests in 22 week-old Stat5fl/fl and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice.(A) Glucose tolerance tests were performed on fasted 22 week-old female mice after an i.p. injection of 2 g/kg BW glucose. Results are expressed as average blood glucose level±SEM of 5 females of each group. The effect of genotype was significant (Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA with Holm-Sidak test: (F(1,24) = 6.6, p = 0.033. (B) Insulin tolerance test on 22 week-old females. Mice were fasted for 9 hours followed by the administration of 0.75U insulin per kg body weight. Results are expressed as average blood glucose level±SEM of 5 females of each group. The effect of genotype was significant (Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA Holm-Sidak test: (F(1,24) = 7.3, p = 0.022). GTT and ITT were perform on the same set of Stat5fl/f and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice weighing mice 27.1±3.8 and 41.5±4.2 g, respectively.
