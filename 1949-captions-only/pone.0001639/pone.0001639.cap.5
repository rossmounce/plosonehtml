Results are expressed as average blood glucose level±SEM of 5 females of each group. The effect of genotype was significant (Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA with Holm-Sidak test: (F(1,24) = 6.6, p = 0.033. (B) Insulin tolerance test on 22 week-old females. Mice were fasted for 9 hours followed by the administration of 0.75U insulin per kg body weight. Results are expressed as average blood glucose level±SEM of 5 females of each group. The effect of genotype was significant (Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA Holm-Sidak test: (F(1,24) = 7.3, p = 0.022). GTT and ITT were perform on the same set of <em>Stat5<sup>fl/f</sup></em> and <em>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></em> mice weighing mice 27.1±3.8 and 41.5±4.2 g, respectively.</p>
