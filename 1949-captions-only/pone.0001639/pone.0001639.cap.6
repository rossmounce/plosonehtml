                Figure 6.  Food intake of Stat5fl/fl and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice was measured in a set of male mice (n = 6 per group) at the age of 8-weeks (A) and 16 weeks (B).Data show the total grams of food consumed per mouse per day. Mice were housed individually for all measurements. Values are mean±SEM. At 8 weeks of age, Stat5fl/f weighed 25.6±3.1 g and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre was 23.9+3.2 g; at 16 weeks body weights were 28.1±3.3 vs 29.2±3.7 respectively. By Two Way Repeated Measured ANOVA there were no effect of genotype on body weight in this cohort of male mice, however the effect of genotype on food intake was significantly different (F(1,10) = 5.7, p = 0.038. All pairwise multiple comparison (Holm-Sidak test) revealed that food intake was significantly different between two groups at 16 weeks of age (P = 0.0.005, t = 3.2), but not at 8 weeks of age.
