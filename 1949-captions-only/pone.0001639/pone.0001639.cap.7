                Figure 7.  Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre mice are defective in cold-induced thermogenesis.26 week-old Stat5fl/fl and Stat5fl/fl; Nestin-Cre males (A) and females (B) were housed at 4°C for 6 hours and rectal temperature was measured at 60-min intervals. The reduced cold tolerance in both males and females was statistically significant. N = 4/group. Statistical analysis was done using ‘Two Way Repeated Measures ANOVA’ followed by the ‘Holm-Sidak test’. The effect of genotype was significant in both females (F(1, 36) = 12.4, P = 0.013) and males (18.2, P = 0.005). The effect of length of cold exposure was also significant in females (F(6,36) = 9.5, P&lt;0.001) and males (F(6,36) = 6.9, P&lt;0.001
