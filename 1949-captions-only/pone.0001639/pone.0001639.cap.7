The reduced cold tolerance in both males and females was statistically significant. N = 4/group. Statistical analysis was done using ‘Two Way Repeated Measures ANOVA’ followed by the ‘Holm-Sidak test’. The effect of genotype was significant in both females (F(1, 36) = 12.4, <em>P</em> = 0.013) and males (18.2, <em>P</em> = 0.005). The effect of length of cold exposure was also significant in females (<em>F</em>(6,36) = 9.5, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001) and males (<em>F</em>(6,36) = 6.9, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001</p>
