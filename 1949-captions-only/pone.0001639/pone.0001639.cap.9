Dapi staining to reveal nuclei is shown in blue. Representative images from the LHA are shown, along with percent of neurons with nuclear STAT5 localization. (B) graph of double labeled cells; n = 4; *p&lt;0.01 vs vehicle by students t test. (C) Recombinant mouse GM-CSF was injected into the third ventricular region of 8 week-old <em>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></em> mice and <em>Stat5<sup>fl/fl</sup></em> control littermates and food intake was measured after 4 hrs (N = 16 for Stat5 ff vehicle (body weight 29.8±0.9) and Stat5 ff GM-CSF ((body weight 29.4±0.9), n = 6–7 for Stat5 ff; Nestin-Cre (body weight 29.7±1.7) vehicle and Stat5 ff; Nestin-Cre GM-CSF(body weight 29.7±1.8)) . Two-way ANOVA tests followed by the ‘Holm-Sidak test’ revealed significant effect of GM-CSF on food intake (F(1,40) = 4.6, P = 0.039 showed a significant reduction of food intake with control mice and no significant reduction was observed with mutant mice. The p value for the drug effect was 0.039. Using ‘All pairwise multiple comparison procedures’ the p value for drug effect within wild type was 0.008. No significant effect was observed in the mutant group (p 0.435).</p>
