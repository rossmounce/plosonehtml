                Figure 1.  Presence of CB2 gene in the brain.A, Relative brain expression of CB2 gene in C57BL/6J and BALBc strains subjected to stress. B, Relative CB2 gene expression levels in the striatum, midbrain, and hippocampus of C57Bl/6J mice. C, Mouse whole brain relative CB2 gene expression levels following chronic treatment with heroin and cocaine. D, relative CB2 gene expression levels in striatum and midbrain of mice that developed alcohol preference. CB2 gene expression was relative to the standard laboratory brain obtained from C57BL/6J that was set to 1.0. The positive control was from the spleen and no cDNA in TaqMan PCR reaction served as negative controls.
