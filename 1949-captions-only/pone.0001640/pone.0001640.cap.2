                Figure 2.  Brain CB2-Rs: Immunoblots, genotyping and in-situ hybridization.A, In-situ hybridization indicating CB2 gene is expressed in the cerebellum of wild type and not in the cerebellum of the CB2-R deficient mice and also in sense controls in the wild type mice. B, RFLP genotyping discrimination on agarose gel for CB2 Q63R polymorphism in depressed subjects (Ba) and, Resequences of CB2 Q63R polymorphism (Bb). C, Western blotting of CB2-Rs in CMS and control mice (left panel) and in right panel in mice exposed to 4 mg/kg capsaicin in utero.
