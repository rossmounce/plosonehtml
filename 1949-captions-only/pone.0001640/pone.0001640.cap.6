                Figure 6.  CB2-R gene targeting modifies behavior.A, Behavioral effects of CB2 intracerebral gene targeting by antisense oligonucleotide microinjected into the mouse brain and performance of mice in plus-maze test was assessed before and after 3 days of twice daily microinjection. AS1 and AS2 were before and after CB2 antisense oligo microinjection. V1 and V2 are controls. B, performance in plus-maze test following CMS or mice exposed prenatally to capsaicin and the effect of JWH015 (20 mg/kg).
