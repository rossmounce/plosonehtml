                Figure 8.  Subcellular localization of rat hippocampal CB2-Rs.A, a CB2-IR dendrite [CB2(+) D] receiving multiple synaptic contacts from axon terminals lacking CB2-R immunolabeling [CB2(−) AT]. B, a CB2-IR dendrite [CB2(+) D] was contacted by a non-immunoreactive axon terminal [CB2(−) AT]. Scale bar represents 0.3 µm.
