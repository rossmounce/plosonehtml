Labeling was performed with a sheep anti-morphine antibody (visualized in green with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG) and with an antibody against CGA (a specific intragranular marker) visualized in red with a mouse Cy3-conjugated IgG. Colocalized immunolabelling (merged window) appears as yellow staining. <em>Lower panel</em>, SH-SY5Y termini shown at higher magnification. Arrows indicate colocalization points. An identical pattern of labelling was obtained for a different mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody (data not shown). <em>B.</em> To assess the specificity of morphine immunolabelling, control experiments were performed using either sheep non-immune serum and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG, or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG and Cy3-conjugated IgG without a primary antibody.</p>
