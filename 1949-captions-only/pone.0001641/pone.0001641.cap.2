Amplification of UGT2B7 RNA and Western blot analysis. <em>Left panel</em>, total SH-SY5Y RNA was submitted to RT-PCR using specific human UGT2B7 primers. Lane 1, control using water to test for contamination. Lane 2, total RNA from human hepatocyte extract was used as a positive control, showing a single band of 462 bp corresponding to the expected UGT2B7 PCR product. Lane 3, SH-SY5Y total RNA showing a single band of 462 bp. Lane 4, negative control of GAPDH amplification (water). Lane 5, SH-SY5Y total RNA (GAPDH, 142 bp). The size of standards are indicated in bp. <em>Right panel</em>, Western blot analysis of SH-SY5Y cell extracts was done using 1 µg of human recombinant UGT2B7 (positive control) and 50 µg of SH-SY5Y cell extract. Western blots using anti-UGT2B antibody show a band at 65 kDa <a href="#pone.0001641-Goumon2">[15]</a>. <em>B</em>. Localization of UGT2B immunoreactivity in SH-SY5Y cells. Double immunofluorescence confocal micrographs were obtained using an anti-UGT2B antibody (detected in red with an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated IgG) and with an antibody against morphine visualized in green with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG. Colocalized immunolabelling appears as yellow staining (merged window).</p>
