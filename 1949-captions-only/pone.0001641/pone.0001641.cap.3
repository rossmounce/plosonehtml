                Figure 3.  Characterization of morphine and M6G in SH-SY5Y extracts.A. Purification of morphine and M6G. Upper panel, RP-HPLC chromatogram showing the purification of endogenous alkaloids from SH-SY5Y cells (375Ã—106 cells). Lower panel, RP-HPLC purification of morphine (Mor) and M6G standards (500 pmol). B. Characterization of M6G. Q-TOF MS-MS analysis of the HPLC fraction showing M6G in the intragranular material (marked with an arrow in Fig. 3A, upper panel). The fragment at 462.12 Da corresponds to M6G, whereas the 286.18 Da fragment corresponds to morphine. C. Q-TOF MS analysis of the HPLC fraction showing morphine (286.17 Da) in the intragranular material (marked with an arrow in Fig. 3A, upper panel).
