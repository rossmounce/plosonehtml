                Figure 4.  Characterization of morphine secretion from SH-SY5Y cells.Upper panel. The amount of morphine secreted into the culture medium was determined after stimulating 4×105 cells with 100 µM of nicotine with or without cadmium (200 µM) for 24 h. The basal secretion level was obtained from cells incubated without nicotine at the same time (n = 6). Amounts of secreted morphine in the nicotine and nicotine+cadmium groups were statistically different and were both different from the two control groups (no nicotine and no nicotine+cadmium; Mann-Whitney test, * p&lt;0.01). Lower panel. The efficiency of secretion was assessed by monitoring the secretion of chromogranin B (CGB), an intra-LDC vesicle protein [28], by Western blot analysis. A positive control, intragranular protein matrix from bovine chromaffin cells (10 µg), was loaded in order to evaluate the molecular weight of the entire CGB (80 kDa).
