Immunodetection of morphine present in the mouse brain. Sagittal slices were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody and visualized with an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, in order to detect endogenous morphine in specific brain areas. <em>B.</em> Control experiment using morphine immunoadsorbed mouse monoclonal antibody (same incubation time as in <em>A</em>). <em>C.</em> Quantification of the morphine present in different mouse brain areas using morphine-specific ELISA. The table shows the quantities of endogenous morphine (pmoles) present per gram of wet tissue. The values correspond to an average of the morphine amount determined for 5 brains (n = 5). <em>D</em>. Localization of morphine label in the cerebellum using mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Morphine labelling was observed around Purkinje cells and in basket cells. PC, Purkinje cell; BC, basket cell. <em>E.</em> Control for immunolabelling using morphine-immunoadsorbed mouse monoclonal antibody.</p>
