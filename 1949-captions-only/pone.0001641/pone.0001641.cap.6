                Figure 6.  Mapping of endogenous morphine in the mouse brain.A. Immunodetection of morphine present in the mouse brain. Sagittal slices were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody and visualized with an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, in order to detect endogenous morphine in specific brain areas. B. Control experiment using morphine immunoadsorbed mouse monoclonal antibody (same incubation time as in A). C. Quantification of the morphine present in different mouse brain areas using morphine-specific ELISA. The table shows the quantities of endogenous morphine (pmoles) present per gram of wet tissue. The values correspond to an average of the morphine amount determined for 5 brains (n = 5). D. Localization of morphine label in the cerebellum using mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Morphine labelling was observed around Purkinje cells and in basket cells. PC, Purkinje cell; BC, basket cell. E. Control for immunolabelling using morphine-immunoadsorbed mouse monoclonal antibody.
