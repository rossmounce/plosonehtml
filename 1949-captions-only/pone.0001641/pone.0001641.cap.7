Characterization of morphine immunolabelling around Purkinje cells. Electron microscopy using sheep anti-morphine antibody showed morphine-like immunoreactivity in nerve termini innervating Purkinje cell bodies (PC). Arrows indicate strong immunolabelling of morphine-containing termini around the Purkinje cell body. GC, granular cell. ML, molecular layer, N, nucleus. <em>B.</em> Higher magnification showing the presence of morphine immunoreactivity in nerve termini innervating Purkinje cell bodies. <em>C.</em> Electron microscopy showing morphine immunoreactivity in basket cells (BC). BV, blood vessel. ML, molecular layer. Control experiments using anti-sheep HRP-conjugated IgG showed the specificity of the immunolabelling. <em>D.</em> Electron microscopy showing PEBP-immunoreactivity in nerve termini covering Purkinje cell bodies (PC). Arrows indicate strong immunolabelling of PEBP-containing basket cell termini. <em>E.</em> Evidence of colocalization of morphine and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Double immunofluorescence confocal micrographs were obtained using a sheep anti-morphine antibody (detected with a CY5-conjugated IgG, green pseudocolor label) and an antibody against GAD visualized in red with a Cy3-conjugated IgG. Colocalized immunolabelling (arrows and merged window) appears as yellow staining. <em>F.</em> Control experiments were performed using sheep non-immune serum, or only secondary antibodies detected with Cy5- and Cy3-conjugated IgG (primary antibody omitted), to demonstrate the specificity of the immunolabelling.</p>
