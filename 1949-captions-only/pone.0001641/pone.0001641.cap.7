                Figure 7.  Characterization of morphine immunoreactivity in the mouse cerebellum.A. Characterization of morphine immunolabelling around Purkinje cells. Electron microscopy using sheep anti-morphine antibody showed morphine-like immunoreactivity in nerve termini innervating Purkinje cell bodies (PC). Arrows indicate strong immunolabelling of morphine-containing termini around the Purkinje cell body. GC, granular cell. ML, molecular layer, N, nucleus. B. Higher magnification showing the presence of morphine immunoreactivity in nerve termini innervating Purkinje cell bodies. C. Electron microscopy showing morphine immunoreactivity in basket cells (BC). BV, blood vessel. ML, molecular layer. Control experiments using anti-sheep HRP-conjugated IgG showed the specificity of the immunolabelling. D. Electron microscopy showing PEBP-immunoreactivity in nerve termini covering Purkinje cell bodies (PC). Arrows indicate strong immunolabelling of PEBP-containing basket cell termini. E. Evidence of colocalization of morphine and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Double immunofluorescence confocal micrographs were obtained using a sheep anti-morphine antibody (detected with a CY5-conjugated IgG, green pseudocolor label) and an antibody against GAD visualized in red with a Cy3-conjugated IgG. Colocalized immunolabelling (arrows and merged window) appears as yellow staining. F. Control experiments were performed using sheep non-immune serum, or only secondary antibodies detected with Cy5- and Cy3-conjugated IgG (primary antibody omitted), to demonstrate the specificity of the immunolabelling.
