                Figure 1.  VRK1 levels in different growth conditions of human fibroblasts.(A). Flow cytometry profile of WS1 cell cycle in non-synchronized (left) and serum starved cells (right). (B). Nuclear localization of VRK1 and morphology of WS1 cells in non-synchronized and starved WS1 cells. Endogenous VRK1 protein was detected with a specific polyclonal antibody (VE1) in the cell nuclei. The size bar represents 50 Âµm. (C). Level of VRK1 endogenous protein determined in an immunoblot. (D). Change in VRK1 gene expression by qRT-PCR upon withdrawal or addition of serum to the cell culture. These experiments were independently performed three times.
