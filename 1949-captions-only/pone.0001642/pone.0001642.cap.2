                Figure 2.  Changes in VRK1 RNA level upon serum withdrawal or readdition to the culture.(A). Quantification of the VRK1 gene expression in WS1 fibroblasts at different time points upon serum withdrawal (top) and serum readdition to the cell culture (bottom) which was previously serum-deprived for five days. These experiments were independently performed three times. (B). Regulation of the human proximal promoter of human VRK1 by serum. WS1 cells were transfected with plasmid pGL2-B-VRK1(âˆ’1028+52). The luciferase activity was determined under different experimental conditions. Control activity is that of cells in the continuous presence of serum. The result is the mean of three experiments.
