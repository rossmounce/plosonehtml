                Figure 3.  Cell cycle gene expression induced by removal or serum readdition.(A). Expression of MYC, FOS and VRK1 genes after serum readdition to the culture. Before serum readdition cells were maintained for forty hours in 0.1% FBS. (B). Sequential expression of five cyclin genes after serum readdition to starved WS1 cells. (C). Timing of Rb phosphorylation after serum readdition to the starved WS1 cell culture detected with a specific anti p-Rb antibody. These experiments were independently performed three times.
