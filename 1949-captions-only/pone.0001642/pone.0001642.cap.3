Expression of <em>MYC</em>, <em>FOS</em> and <em>VRK1</em> genes after serum readdition to the culture. Before serum readdition cells were maintained for forty hours in 0.1% FBS. (B). Sequential expression of five cyclin genes after serum readdition to starved WS1 cells. (C). Timing of Rb phosphorylation after serum readdition to the starved WS1 cell culture detected with a specific anti p-Rb antibody. These experiments were independently performed three times.</p>
