                Figure 4.  Time course of changes in cell cycle related proteins level after serum withdrawal and serum readdition to WS1 cells.The proteins were determined in an immunoblot with specific antibodies for each protein, VRK1, p27, PCNA and phospho-Rb. The level of actin was used as a loading control. At the bottom is shown the quantification of the level of each protein. In the case of VRK1 it is also shown the quantification by RT-PCR of its RNA (dashed line) at the same time points. These experiments were independently performed three times.
