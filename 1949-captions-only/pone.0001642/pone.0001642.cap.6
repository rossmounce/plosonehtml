                Figure 6.  Effect of siVRK1 on proteins related with cell cycle progression.Levels of proteins in non-transfected, transfected with siRNA control, or with siRNA specific for VRK1 were determined in after 120 hours post transfection. The proteins were determined with the corresponding antibody indicated in the methods section, and identified in the corresponding immunoblot. These experiments were independently performed five times.
