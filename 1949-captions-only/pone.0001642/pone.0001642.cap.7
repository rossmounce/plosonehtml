                Figure 7.  Effect of siRNA on endogenous VRK1 and cell proliferation.(A). Proliferation of WS1 cells that were transfected with siRNA control or siRNA specific for VRK1. The total cell number in the dish was determined at different time points (top). The endogenous protein was detected in an immunoblot (bottom) (B) Photograph of the WS1 cell cultures treated with siRNA control (top) or siVRK1 (bottom). The proliferation is much slower in cells transfected with the specific siVRK1. These experiments were independently performed three times. (C). Effect on VRK1 RNA levels in WS1 cells transfected with either siControl or siVRK1. NTC: non transfected cells.
