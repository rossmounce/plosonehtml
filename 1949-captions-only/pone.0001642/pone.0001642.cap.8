Immunohistochemistry detection of p63 and VRK1 proteins in the pharynx. The arrows indicate cells (3 out of 56) in the basal layer with higher levels of VRK1. The p63 was detected with a monoclonal antibody. VRK1 was detected with the VC1 polyclonal antibody. (B). Immunofluorescence of p63 and VRK1 in the human pharynx epithelium. The arrows indicate cells (3 out of 57) in the basal layer that have higher levels of VRK1.</p>
