                Figure 1.  Ret activity is involved in RA-induced NB cell differentiation.(A) and (B) SK-N-BE (left panels), LAN-5 (middle panels) and SH-SY5Y (right panels) cells were either left untreated (lane 1) or RA-treated (lane 2); RA-treated cells were transfected with Ret specific siRNA (siRNARet in lane 4) or a non-silencing control siRNA (siRNAns in lane 3). C, mock-treated cells. (A) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet or anti-Ret antibodies. To confirm equal loading the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-αtubulin? antibodies, as indicated. Quantitations are done on the sum of the two Ret-specific enhanced chemiluminescence bands of 170 and 150 kDa corresponding to different glycosylation states of Ret. Intensity of bands have been calculated using the NIH Image Program on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition. Fold values are expressed relative to the reference points, arbitrarily set to 1 (labelled with asterisk). (B) To follow biochemical cell differentiation lysates were immunoblotted with anti-VGF, anti-GAP-43 or anti-tTG antibodies. The filters were blotted with anti-αtubulin? antibodies to normalize the loaded proteins, as indicated. Quantitation and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1 (see A). Blots shown in (A) and (B) are representative of at least four independent experiments.
