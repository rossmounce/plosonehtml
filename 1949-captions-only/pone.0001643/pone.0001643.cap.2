Samples loaded on the gel are as follows: lanes 1, 2 and 3 amplification of TrkB in SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and SK-N-BE, respectively; lanes 4, 5 and 6 amplification of BDNF in SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and SK-N-BE, respectively; lane 7 markers IX (Roche); lanes 8 to 13, RNA samples as in lanes 1 to 6 but in the absence of RT as negative controls. <em>Right</em>, Lysates from SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and SK-N-BE, left untreated or RA-treated, were immunoblotted with anti-TrkB antibodies against the extracellular domain of the receptor. The molecular weights of full-length TrkB and hypothetical TrkB.T1 isoform are indicated. The membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-Î±tubulin? antibodies to control equal loading. Blots shown are representative of at least five independent experiments. (B) SH-SY5Y (<em>left panels</em>), LAN-5 (<em>middle panels</em>) and SK-N-BE (<em>right panels</em>) cells were left untreated or treated with RA in the absence or in the presence of TrkB siRNA (siRNATrkB) or the negative control siRNAns, as indicated. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-panTrk antibodies and analysed by Western blotting with anti-pTyr or anti-TrkB antibodies. Blots shown are representative of at least four independent experiments. (C) RA-treated SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and SK-N-BE cells were left un-stimulated (lanes 1, 3 and 5) or stimulated with BDNF (lanes 2, 4 and 6). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-panTrk antibodies and immonoblotted with anti-pTyr or anti-TrkB antibodies. Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. In (A), (B) and (C), quantitation and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1 (see legend to <a href="#pone-0001643-g001">Figure 1A</a>).</p>
