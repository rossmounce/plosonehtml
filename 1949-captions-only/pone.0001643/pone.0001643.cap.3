                Figure 3.  TrkB mediates the RA-dependent differentiation in SH-SY5Y and LAN-5.SH-SY5Y (left panels), LAN-5 (middle panels) and SK-N-BE (right panels) cells were left untreated or treated with RA in the absence or in the presence of siRNATrkB or the negative control siRNAns, as indicated. (A) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GAP-43, anti-tTG or anti-VGF antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Î±tubulin antibodies. Quantitation and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1 (see legend to Figure 1A). Blots shown are representative of at least four independent experiments. (B) to (K): Following RA-treatment, the percentage of neurite outgrowth was calculated and reported as histogram (K). Data are percentage of neurite bearing cells/total cells analyzed. Columns, average of three independent experiments. Microphotographs of cells are shown (B to J).
