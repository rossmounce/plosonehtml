(A) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GAP-43, anti-tTG or anti-VGF antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Î±tubulin antibodies. Quantitation and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1 (see legend to <a href="#pone-0001643-g001">Figure 1A</a>). Blots shown are representative of at least four independent experiments. (B) to (K): Following RA-treatment, the percentage of neurite outgrowth was calculated and reported as histogram (K). Data are percentage of neurite bearing cells/total cells analyzed. Columns, average of three independent experiments. Microphotographs of cells are shown (B to J).</p>
