C is referred to untreated cells (lane 1). Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-TrkB, anti-pRet, anti-Ret, or anti-GAP-43 antibodies, as indicated. The equal protein loading has been confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-atubulin? antibodies. (B) RA-treated LAN5, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE cells were left un-treated (lanes 2, 5 and 8, respectively) or treated with BDNF (lanes 3, 6 and 9, respectively). Lanes 1, 4 and 7 are mock-treated cells. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet or anti-Ret antibodies. To confirm equal loading the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-Î±tubulin? antibodies. In (A) and (B), quantitation and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1 (see legend to <a href="#pone-0001643-g001">Figure 1A</a>). Blots shown in (A) and (B) are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>
