                Figure 5.  The RA-induced stimulation of Ret activity is GDNF-independent in SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells.(A) SK-N-BE (left panels), SH-SY5Y (middle panels) and LAN-5 (right panels) cells were left untreated (lane 1) or treated for the indicated incubation times with RA either in the absence (lane 2) or in the presence of D4 (lane 3) or D4sc (lane 4). Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet, anti-Ret, anti-tTG or anti-VGF antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-αtubulin antibodies. (B) SK-N-BE (left panels), SH-SY5Y (middle panels) and LAN-5 (right panels) cells were incubated either in the absence (lane 2) or in the presence of ECRetwt (lane 3) or EC-Ret1-387 (lane 4) as indicated. Lanes 2 to 4, treatment with RA. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet or anti-Ret and and to confirm equal loading the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-αtubulin? antibodies. In (A) and (B), quantitations were done as reported in legend to Figure 1A and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1. Blots shown in (A) and (B) are representative of at least three independent experiments.
