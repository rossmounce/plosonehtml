Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet, anti-Ret, anti-tTG or anti-VGF antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-αtubulin antibodies. (B) SK-N-BE (<em>left panels</em>), SH-SY5Y (<em>middle panels</em>) and LAN-5 (<em>right panels</em>) cells were incubated either in the absence (lane 2) or in the presence of ECRet<sup>wt</sup> (lane 3) or EC-Ret<sup>1-387</sup> (lane 4) as indicated. Lanes 2 to 4, treatment with RA. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pRet or anti-Ret and and to confirm equal loading the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-αtubulin? antibodies. In (A) and (B), quantitations were done as reported in legend to <a href="#pone-0001643-g001">Figure 1A</a> and relative abundances are expressed relative to controls, arbitrarily set to 1. Blots shown in (A) and (B) are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>
