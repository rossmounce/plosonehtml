Differentiated cultures were either harvested after 2 DIV for total RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis or fixed after 10 DIV and processed for indirect immunocytochemistry. (A) Differentiated hNSCs expressed the neural-specific transcripts nestin and Notch1 as well as transcripts: for neurons (β-tubulin class III, MAP-2, NCAM and medium-size neurofilament, NF-M), for astrocytes (GFAP) and for oligodendrocytes (MBP). The hNSCs expressed transcripts for GAD, but not for TH. B, C &amp; D, morphology of NSC-derived progeny differentiated into GFAP+ astrocytes (B), GC-expressing oligodendrocytes (C) and TuJ1+ neurons (D), DAPI (blue) show life cell nuclei. (E) Photo showing cultures double-immunostained for TuJ1 (green) and nestin (red) (DAPI, blue). (F) Quantitative analysis of immunostained 10 day-old cultures for the 3 neural cell types. Results are mean±s.e.m. of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Bars: (c) 20 µm; (d, e) 10 µm.</p>
