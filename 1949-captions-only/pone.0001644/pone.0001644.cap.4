                Figure 4.  Transplantation of NSCs improves sensorimotor function of the stroke-disabled forelimb.Forelimb use during spontaneous lateral exploration was measured in the cylinder test (see Method and Results sections for details). Groups of vehicle injected (n = 7) and hNSCs (n = 10) transplanted are represented. The animals were tested as described in Method section. Note the significant increase in the independent use of the impaired contralateral forelimb at 4 and 8 weeks post transplantation (P&lt;0.05 vs pre-transplant group). The contralateral forelimb remained impaired in the vehicle treated group at 4 and 8 weeks post-injection. Bars represent percentagesÂ±s.e.m. of steps taken by the ipsilateral, contralateral and both forelimbs simultaneously. *P&lt;0.05 vs pre-transplant group; #P&lt;0.05 vs vehicle groups.
