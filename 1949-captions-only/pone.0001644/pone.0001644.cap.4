Groups of vehicle injected (n = 7) and hNSCs (n = 10) transplanted are represented. The animals were tested as described in <a href="#s4">Method</a> section. Note the significant increase in the independent use of the impaired contralateral forelimb at 4 and 8 weeks post transplantation (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 vs pre-transplant group). The contralateral forelimb remained impaired in the vehicle treated group at 4 and 8 weeks post-injection. Bars represent percentagesÂ±s.e.m. of steps taken by the ipsilateral, contralateral and both forelimbs simultaneously. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 vs pre-transplant group; <sup>#</sup><em>P</em>&lt;0.05 vs vehicle groups.</p>
