In this study, bait protein fused with tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag was co-translated with the IVV library in a wheat germ extract cell-free translation system. Complexes of bait protein and target IVV molecules were captured with affinity beads (IgG agarose) <em>via</em> the added TAP-tag. The RNA portion of the captured IVVs was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified. Finally, screened cDNA libraries were labeled and hybridized with tiling arrays as an alternative to cloning and sequencing (conventional IVV method).</p>
