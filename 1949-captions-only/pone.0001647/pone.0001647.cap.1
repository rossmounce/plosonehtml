The cells were fixed either immediately (A, B) or after cell division (C, D). The injected antibodies (A, C) and the Golgi marker GM130 (B, D) were stained. The microinjected cells divided into two daughter cells, each of which has a reformed Golgi ribbon. Bar, 15 µm. (E–H) NRK cells in metaphase were microinjected with anti-GRASP65 (E, F), G2A GRASP65 protein (G), or non-specific rabbit IgGs as a control (H). FITC-labeled dextran was co-injected as a marker. Once cell division was complete, all non-injected cells were removed and the remaining injected cells were processed for EM. Shown are EM micrographs of the reassembled Golgi in the injected cells. Note that in control IgG injected cells, the Golgi stacks are properly reassembled. In cells injected with either anti-GRASP65 or G2A GRASP65, however, cisternae appear disorganized and poorly aligned. In close proximity to the cisternae, there are a large number of vesicles and budding profiles, which appear to be coated. Bar, 0.5 µm.</p>
