                Figure 2.  CD8 transport assay.(A) A plasmid encoding the plasma membrane protein CD8 was microinjected together with Texas-Red dextran (top left panel, red) into NRK cells. After 45 min, a fluorescently labeled antibody against the luminal domain of CD8 was added to the medium. The recruitment of the antibody onto the cell surface was analyzed by time-lapse microscopy in 2 min intervals over 70 min (Supplemental Movie S1). The fluorescence intensity on the cell surface increased over time, representing the arrival of CD8 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Bar, 15 Âµm. (B) Quantitation. To validate the transport assay, a peptide (N73) that inhibits intra-Golgi transport, or a control peptide (wt), were co-injected into NRK cells along with the CD8 plasmid and Texas-Red dextran and assayed for CD8 transport as in (A). The mean fluorescence intensity of the cells in each frame was quantified and plotted (red curve: control, n = 10; black curve: N73 peptide, n = 6); it decreased from 9.7 per min for control-injected cells to 2.4 per min for N73-peptide injected cells. CD8 transport was therefore inhibited by 75%.
