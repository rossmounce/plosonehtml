After cell division, CD8 was expressed in the daughter cells and transported to the plasma membrane. 45 min before fixation, cycloheximide was added to inhibit protein translation. Cells were double labeled with a monoclonal antibody against CD8 and the microinjected polyclonal antibodies against GRASP65. Note that CD8 was transported to the cell surface in cells where Golgi stack formation was inhibited by the injected GRASP65 antibodies. Bar, 15 µm. (B) Metaphase NRK cells were injected with G2A GRASP65 protein together with a CD8 plasmid and Texas-Red dextran as a marker. At the end of mitosis, a fluorescently labeled antibody against CD8 was added to the medium. The fluorescence increase was followed by time-lapse microscopy in 2 min intervals over 70 min (<a href="#pone.0001647.s002">Movie S2</a>). Bar, 15 µm. (C) Quantitation. The mean fluorescence intensity of the cells in each frame was quantified and plotted (red curve: G2A GRASP65 injection, blue curve: control injection). The data shown were obtained from one pair of divided cells for each condition. Note the increased rate of transport in cells injected with G2A GRASP65. (D) The transport rate of CD8 to the plasma membrane increased two-fold in cells with unstacked Golgi cisternae. Quantitation from three independent experiments (mean±SD; p&lt;0.05). Appearance of CD8 per minute at the cell surface was stimulated by 90% in G2A GRASP65 injected cells (n = 34) compared to control cells (n = 44).</p>
