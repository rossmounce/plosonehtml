Representative EM micrographs of the membranes are shown in (A). Incubation with mitotic kinases led to unstacking of Golgi cisternae (cdk1/cyclin B1+plk1), and the subsequent reformation of stacks upon treatment with interphase cytosol was inhibited by antibodies against GRASP65. Bar, 0.5 µm. (B, C) Quantitation of (A) by the intersection method (mean±SD). Upon treatment with mitotic kinases, membranes in stacks were reduced to 11%, compared to 71% for untreated Golgi membranes. When interphase single cisternae were generated in the presence of GRASP65 antibodies and interphase cytosol, the percentage of membranes in stacks remained unchanged (B). During this process, the single cisternal membranes remained intact and did not vesiculate, as the percentage of membranes in vesicles was unchanged between all groups (C). Statistical significance was assessed by a two-tailed Student's <em>t</em> test.</p>
