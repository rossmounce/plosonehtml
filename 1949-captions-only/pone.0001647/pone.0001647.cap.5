                Figure 5.  Unstacking of Golgi cisternal membranes increases vesicle generation.(A–D) EM micrographs of untreated Golgi membranes (A), or interphase single cisternae (C) generated by sequential treatment with cdk1/cyclin B1 and plk1 and interphase cytosol in the presence of GRASP65 antibodies. Membranes in (A) and (C) were treated with coatomer and ARF1 to allow vesicles to form. Membranes were fixed at different time points and processed for EM. Shown in (B) and (D) are membrane profiles after 5 min incubation. Note that budding from single cisternae was increased compared to that from stacked membranes. Within 5 min, nearly all single cisternae were converted into vesicles (D), while budding from stacked cisternal membranes was less efficient (B). Bar, 0.5 µm. (E) Quantitation of (A–D). Untreated Golgi membranes as in A, or single cisternae as in C were incubated with coatomer and ARF1 and then analyzed by EM. Shown is the quantitation of EM micrographs by the intersection method. The rate of vesicle formation from single cisternae was doubled (t1/2 = 1.6 min) compared to stacked membranes (t1/2 = 3.5 min). 78.5% of the membranes from single cisternae were converted into vesicles with a half-time of 1.6 min. The formation of the same amount of vesicles from stacked membranes took 12.4 min. Statistical significance assessed by a two-tailed Student's t test showed that p&lt;0.01 for all time points except 0 min. (F) Untreated Golgi membranes (c, Golgi stacks) were treated with cdk1/cyclin B1 and plk1 followed by further incubation with interphase cytosol in the presence (a, unstacked cisternae) or absence (b, restacked cisternae) of GRASP65 antibodies. These membranes were incubated with coatomer and ARF1 for the indicated times followed by separation of the Golgi membranes (G) and vesicles (V) by centrifugation. Equal fractions of the samples were analyzed by Western blotting for ManII and Gos28. (G) Quantitation of (F). ManII was recruited more efficiently into the vesicle fractions from single cisternae compared to stacks or restacked membranes, whereas the t-SNARE Gos28 remained in the Golgi fraction. Results represent 3 independent experiments.
