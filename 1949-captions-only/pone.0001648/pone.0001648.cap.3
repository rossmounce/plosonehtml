                Figure 3.  Cells expressing mutant IRE1α resist both chemical- and glucose-induced Insulin mRNA degradation.(A) pTetRINS-1 832/13 cells (control) and pTetRINS-1832/13IRE1αKA cells (stably expressing tetracycline-responsive K599A mutant IRE1α) were treated with doxycycline for 24 hr with 5 mM glucose to induce mutant IRE1α. Cells were then treated with 5 mM, 11 mM, or 16.7 mM glucose with doxycycline for 72 hr. Degradation of mRNA was assessed by measuring the expression of Insulin 1 and Insulin 2 by real-time PCR (n = 3; values are mean±SEM). (B) pTetRINS-1 832/13 cells (control) and pTetRINS-1832/13IRE1αKA cells (stably expressing tetracycline-responsive K599A mutant IRE1α) were treated with doxycycline for 24 hr to induce mutant IRE1α. mRNA transcription was attenuated by treating cells with 100 µg/mL actinomycin D for 1 hr. To induce degradation of insulin mRNA, 1 µM thapsigargin was added to the medium for 0, 1, 3 and 5 hr. mRNA degradation was assessed by measuring expression of Insulin 1 and Insulin 2 by real-time PCR (n = 3; values are mean±SEM).
