Untreated wild-type mice (n = 5) are also included. A leukocyte was considered to be adherent if it remained stationary for more than 30 s, and was quantified as the number of adherent cells within a 100 µm length of venule during 5 min. Leukocyte migration was defined as the number of cells in the extra vascular space within a 200×300 µm area. All values are means±SE. * p&lt;0.05 compared to C57Bl/6 mice receiving similar treatment at the same time-point.</p>
