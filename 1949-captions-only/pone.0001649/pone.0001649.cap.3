The arrowheads mark the junctions seen in A, the thin endothelial sheet that covers the transmigrating cells is marked with *, e1, e2 and n represent individual endothelial cells and neutrophils respectively. The arrows in B mark gaps in the endothelium, and en marks the endothelial nucleus. Scale bars correspond to 1 Âµm. The images represent 1 out of 40 analyzed wild-type and 1 out of 24 Mac-1-/- neutrophils. In panel C are presented the percentages of the adherent neutrophils that were covered by endothelial dome-structures.</p>
