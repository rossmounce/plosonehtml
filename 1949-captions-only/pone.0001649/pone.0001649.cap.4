                Figure 4.  Endothelial dome formation using spinning disk confocal microscopy.Spinning disk confocal images of MIP-2 superfused cremaster muscle of mice with GFP positive endothelium (green) and GR-1 Alexa Fluor 555 stained neutrophils (red). Panels A and B show adherent neutrophils that have been covered by endothelium. By following the same vessel with two adherent neutrophils over time, dynamic formation of endothelial domes was revealed.
