The 5′- and 3′-sequences flanking the main structure are shown in open conformation. The stable structural element at the stem base (stem section 1) and adjacent regions, are enlarged and their sequences shown (these sequences substitute one another in the CaMV-RTBV chimeric leader and virus). The nucleotide numbering is from the pgRNA 5′-end (cap-site). The 5′-proximal short ORF (sORF 1) is boxed. The AUG start codons and the non-AUG initiating codons in the shunt landing site are in bold. (B) Polycistronic expression controlled by the wild type and chimeric CaMV-RTBV leaders (shown on the left) in <em>O. violaceous</em> protoplasts. Relative expression levels of the CAT reporter gene fused to the first (ORFVII::CAT) or the second (ORFVII-ORFI::CAT) viral ORF downstream of the leader in the absence (−TAV) or the presence (+TAV) of the TAV expressing plasmid are given. Expression of ORFVII::CAT downstream of the wild type CaMV leader in the absence of TAV is set to 100%.</p>
