                Figure 2.  Serial passages of the CaMV-RTBV chimeric virus in turnip plants.The experimental scheme of serial passages for the early harvest (1 and 2) and the late harvest (1′ and 2′) progenies stemming from two initially infected plants (N1 and N2) is depicted. For each progeny, a delay (in days) in symptom development for the chimeric virus versus the wild type virus is given. Samples taken for PCR amplification and sequencing of viral DNA are indicated by circles (for the detailed sequencing data, see Data S1).
