The junction between CaMV and RTBV sequences is indicated by bent arrows (two non-viral nucleotides are in lower case). For each sequence, sORF is boxed and the encoded peptide indicated (altered amino acids are in bold). Nucleotide substitutions in the progeny viruses are shown in bold, low case. The middle panel also shows alterations in stem section 1 (Stem) and the shunt landing site (Land) regions dominating in the respective progenies. The nucleotide numbering is from the pgRNA 5â€²-end. (B) A complete collection of the sORF1 peptide and nucleotide sequence variants found in the sequenced clones for each progeny, both initially and on passage (for details, see <a href="#pone.0001650.s001">Data S1</a>). The RTBV splice donor and the consensus spliced donor sequences are aligned below. (C) The MFold-predicted local secondary structure for the wild type, the chimeric and the dominant progeny leader sequences preceding the central stem structure are depicted. The stability of each structure in kcal per mole is indicated.</p>
