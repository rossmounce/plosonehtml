                Figure 4.  Alterations near the shunt landing region of the CaMV-RTBV chimeric virus.(A) The nucleotide sequences of the original CaMV-RTBV chimeric leader (top), the wild type CaMV strain CM4-184 (bottom) and the revertants obtained in the four progenies (middle panel) are shown. The junction between CaMV and RTBV sequences is indicated by bent arrows (three non-viral nucleotides are in lower case). Nucleotide substitutions in the progeny viruses are shown in bold, low case. (B) The MFold-predicted local secondary structure for the wild type (right), the chimeric (left) and the dominant progeny leader sequences (middle) located downstream of the central stem-loop structure are depicted. The stability of each structure in kcal per mole is indicated.
