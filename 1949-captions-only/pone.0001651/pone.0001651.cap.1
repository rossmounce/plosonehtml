                Figure 1.  Comparison of gene expression differentiating current from never smokers (C/N) and gene expression differentiating former from never smokers (F/N) in early stage tumor tissue (T) using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).Left: Running Enrichment Score (y axis) is calculated by walking down the entire list of probes from Affymetrix HG-U133A chip (numbered from 1 to 22,283 in the x axis) ordered by the ANOVA coefficients divided by the standard error values from the Former/Never (F/N) smoking comparison. This running-sum statistic increases when a given probe is in the Current/Never (C/N) Gene Set of interest and decreases when the probe is not in the C/N Gene Set, with the magnitude of increment depending on the strength of the correlation between the probe and the F/N comparison. The Enrichment Score (ES) is the maximum deviation of the Running Enrichment Score from zero encountered in the random walk and reflects the degree to which the Gene Set is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked probe list. We report results for two different C/N Gene Sets: on the top, the 64 up-regulated probes, with ES = 0.87 and, on the bottom, the 98 down-regulated probes, with ES = âˆ’0.90. A leading edge subset of the Gene Set is defined as those probes in the Gene Set that appear in the probes ranked list at, or before, the point where the running sum reaches its maximum deviation from zero. The leading edge for the Gene Set of the C/N up-regulated probes contains 58 probes over 64 and the leading edge for the Gene Set of down-regulated probes contains 90 over 98 probes. This confirms that among the 64 up-regulated probes from the C/N comparison, 58 are also found in the F/N comparison; and among the 98 down-regulated probes from the C/N comparison, 90 are also found in the F/N comparison. Right: distributions of ES values created using a permutation procedure for (top) the Gene Set of up-regulated probes in C/N and (bottom) the Gene Set of down-regulated probes in C/N. These distributions are used to calculate the statistical significance (nominal p-value) of the observed ES values (p-value&lt;0.002 in both cases).
