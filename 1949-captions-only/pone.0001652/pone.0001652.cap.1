                Figure 1.  The contribution of pCSCs to tumor vasculogenesis.The pCSCs (clone 2C4 or 2C4G2) were inoculated s.c. or i.p. (5×106/mouse; n = 10/group) into SCID mice. About 40~100% of the mice developed tumors, which grew so fast once they were palpable that the mice had to be sacrificed within 7 d of the palpation [15]. The tumors were harvested and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS. The sections were stained with H &amp; E, and subjected to microscopic analysis simultaneously under the bright (A &amp; E) and fluorescent fields (B &amp; F), respectively (A &amp; B). To verify the results from fluorescent microscopy, successive sections were subjected to IHC staining with rabbit mAb to GFP (1:300 dilution) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (C, D, G &amp; H). The data shown are a representative of tumor micrographs. A–D, A tumor from a mouse inoculated with GFP-expressing cells (2C4G2); the insets in C were enlarged as shown in D, demonstrating GFP-positive TVECs and RBCs. E–H, A tumor from a mouse transplanted with non-GFP-expressing cells (2C4), and the insets in G were enlarged as shown in H, demonstrating GFP-negative TVECs and RBCs. C and G are successive sections of A and E, respectively, and were stained with the same rabbit mAb to GFP. Arrows in A and E indicate the same blood vessels in B and F, respectively, which were GFP-positive or GFP-negative.
