Control cultures were absent from exogenous cytokines. The cells were harvested 3 days later, stained with FITC-conjugated rat mAb to murine CD133 and PE-conjugated mAb to murine Flk-1 (VEGFR-2), and analyzed by flow cytometry <a href="#pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</a>. A, Data shown are contour plots of a representative experiment. The numbers in quadrants indicate the percentage of each subpopulation. B, Shown is the percentage of Flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells of pCSCs derived from four independent experiments. **, p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05, compared to the cultures without exogenous cytokines.</p>
