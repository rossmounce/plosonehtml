                Figure 2.  The effect of cytokines on VEGFR-2 expression in pCSCs.The pCSCs (2C4 clone) were cultured in 2.0 ml of R10F (1Ã—105 cells/well) in 24-well plates in the presence of cytokine IL-3 (50 ng/ml), IL-4 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml); IL-7 (50 or 100 ng/ml), IL-13 (50 ng/ml), GM-CSF (40 ng/ml), or FL (200 ng/ml) alone or in combination (GM-CSF+IL-4; FL+IL-13; IL-3+IL-6). Control cultures were absent from exogenous cytokines. The cells were harvested 3 days later, stained with FITC-conjugated rat mAb to murine CD133 and PE-conjugated mAb to murine Flk-1 (VEGFR-2), and analyzed by flow cytometry [15]. A, Data shown are contour plots of a representative experiment. The numbers in quadrants indicate the percentage of each subpopulation. B, Shown is the percentage of Flk-1+ cells of pCSCs derived from four independent experiments. **, p&lt;0.01; * p&lt;0.05, compared to the cultures without exogenous cytokines.
