                Figure 3.  Differentiation of pCSCs in responding to hypoxia.The pCSCs (clone 2C4; 5Ã—104/well) were cultured in 0.5 ml (hypoxia) or 2.0 ml (normoxic) of R10F medium or Matrigel. From day 3~4 of cultures, the cells in the suspension medium or Matrigel are morphologically altered in the hypoxic culture but not in normoxic cultures (A). The cells were harvested on day 4 of cultures, enumerated (B), and analyzed for CD31 and CD45 expression by flow cytometry (C), or harvested on day 1, 2, 3 and 4 for angiogenic factor expression revealed by RT-PCR (D, day 1~3) or real-time PCR (E, day 4). A, the phase contrast microphotographs of cell morphology of pCSCs cultured in Matrigel-containing or suspension medium under the normal or hypoxic condition, which were taken at day 4 of culture. Arrows indicate apoptotic cells. B, Hypoxia inhibited proliferation of pCSCs. Data shown are pooled results from two of four reproducible experiments (n = 4 well/group/expt). C, phenotypic analysis of the pCSCs cultured in the hypoxic condition using flow cytometry. The number in each quadrant represents the percentage of the gated live cells. D and E, Expression of vascular growth factor and endothelial cell marker genes in the pCSCs responding to hypoxia. The cells were harvested at day 1, 2, and 3 of cultures and analyzed by RT-PCR (D), or harvested at day 4 and analyzed by real-time PCR (E). Data shown are representatives from 3~4 experiments, and the data of D was also quantitated and shown in Fig. S3.
