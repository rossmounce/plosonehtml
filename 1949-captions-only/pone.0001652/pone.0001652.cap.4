                Figure 4.  Comparison of vasculogenic capacity between pCSCs and TMCs.SCID mice were inoculated s.c. with pCSCs (2C4) at left groin and TMCs (3B11) at right groin (5×106/mouse). Tumor incidence and size were monitored every other day (A), and pCSC- or TMC-derived blood vessels were analyzed by H &amp; E and IHC staining of paraffin-embedded tumor sections (B), and the blood vessels in each section were counted under high power microscopy (C). Constitutive expression of angiogenesis-related genes between pCSCs and TMCs was compared before inoculation. A, tumor incidence and size: *, p&lt;0.05; when compared between male (n = 5) and female (n = 5) mice. B, Analysis of pCSC- or TMC-derived tumor vasculature: upper panel: H. &amp; E staining; middle panel: IHC staining specific for neomycin; and bottom panel: IHC staining controls with normal rabbit IgG as primary antibody. Arrows in the middle and bottom panels indicate neomycin-positive or negative TVECs or blood vessels at various developing stages. C, Comparison of the numbers of neomycin+ blood vessels between pCSC- and TMC-derived tumors: Neomycin+ blood vessels were counted under the 400× field of light microscope, and expressed as the number of per high-power field (HPF). Each tumor was counted for three successive sections, and 5 tumors were counted per group (**, p&lt;0.01, as compared between pCSC and TMC-derived tumors). D, Constitutive expression of angiogenesis-related genes between pCSCs and TMCs: The 2C4 and 3B11 cells were harvested at log-phase of growth and analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR for 25, 30 and 35 cycles, respectively (Lane 1, 2C4; lane 2, 3B11).
