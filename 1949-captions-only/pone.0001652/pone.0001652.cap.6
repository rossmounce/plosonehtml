                Figure 6.  Defective phenotype and function of human TVECs.The sections of human cervical (n = 25) and breast cancer (n = 5) specimens were stained immunohistochemically with mAbs to CD45, CD31, CD34, or VWF. None of the cases examined demonstrated normal profile of endothelial cell markers, and none of the markers examined was detected in all tumor blood vessels. The insets indicate CD45+ endothelial-like cells within blood vessels; and arrow heads indicate that the endothelial-like cells lining upon blood vessels did not express relevant markers examined. The data shown are representative micrographs of human cervical and breast cancer. Original magnification: ×400; final magnification shown: ×72.
