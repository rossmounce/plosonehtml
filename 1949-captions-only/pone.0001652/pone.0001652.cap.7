                Figure 7.  The putative cellular mechanism for tumor vasculogenesis.TVPCs within tumor cell aggregates line-up along the branching lumen (A, circles), and form tubes (A &amp; B, green arrows). The tubes are extended, elongated, and become neo-vasculatures (C, green arrow). The newly formed vasculature (neomycin+; red arrow) merged with host blood vessels (neomycin−; green arrow) to form the neo-vasculature networks (D). E, A schematic process of tumor vasculogenesis illustrated based on A~D. The figure A is derived from a 3B11 tumor. Original magnification of micrographs: ×600.
