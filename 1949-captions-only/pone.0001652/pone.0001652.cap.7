The tubes are extended, elongated, and become neo-vasculatures (C, green arrow). The newly formed vasculature (neomycin<sup>+</sup>; red arrow) merged with host blood vessels (neomycin<sup>−</sup>; green arrow) to form the neo-vasculature networks (D). E, A schematic process of tumor vasculogenesis illustrated based on A~D. The figure A is derived from a 3B11 tumor. Original magnification of micrographs: ×600.</p>
