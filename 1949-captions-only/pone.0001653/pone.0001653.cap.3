                Figure 3.  Purkinje cell ectopia is aligned with parasagittal organization in the aporER2 null cerebellum.A series of transverse cryosections through adult wild type (A–C) or Apoer2 null (D–R) cerebella immunostained with antibodies against calbindin (CaBP-A, D, G, J, M, P), zebrin II (ZII-B, E, H, K, N, Q) or phospholipase Cß4 (PLCß4-C, F, I, L, O, R). Sections from the Apoer2 null cerebellum are serial (zebrin II-calbindin-PLCß4). Boxes in D–I indicate areas where higher-magnification photomicrographs are presented below as indicated by the label. High power views of anterior cerebella immunostained with CaBP (M) reveal that ectopic Purkinje cells are restricted to discrete parasagittal domains. Immunostaining with ZII and PLCß4 in neighboring sections reveals that these ectopic cells are composed of discrete and non-overlapping stripes of ectopic Purkinje cells (N, O). Ectopic Purkinje cells in the PZ (lobules VIII and dorsal IX) are from the zebrin II-negative subset (compare Q, R). Purkinje cell ectopia in the nodular zone (NZ) is limited to ZII positive Purkinje cells (S–U). Dotted line in panel T marks the approximate dorsoventral boundary within lobule IX between the posterior zone (including the dorsal half of lobule IX) and nodular zone (ventral IX and X). The transition between PZ and NZ in lobule IX highlights the differing characteristics of ectopic Purkinje cells in the NZ (misaligned ZII-positive) and PZ (ectopic clusters of ZII-negative Purkinje cells). P1+ and P2+ denote zebrin II-positive/PLCß4-negative Purkinje cell stripes, while P1- and P2- label zebrin II-negative/PLCß4-positive Purkinje cell stripes. Roman numerals indicate lobules. Scale bar in R = 1 mm for A–I and 250 µm for J–R.
