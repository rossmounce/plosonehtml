All four markers reveal that some Purkinje cells are correctly located within the Purkinje cell monolayer at the cerebellar cortex (e.g. between arrows–4D) as well as ectopically within the cerebellar white matter (e.g. 4D, G–dotted circles). The transition from posterior zone ( = PZ-lobule VIII and dorsal IX-<a href="#pone-0001653-g004">Fig. 4J</a>) into nodular zone ( = NZ-ventral IX and X–<a href="#pone-0001653-g004">Fig. 4J</a>) is revealed in the form of Purkinje cell ectopia (J, K). In the dorsal aspect of lobule IX Purkinje cells are restricted to a monolayer, with some ectopic cells located in the lobule white matter (J, K). In the ventral aspect of IX, the area of transition between the PZ-&gt;NZ, is highlighted by Purkinje cells misalignment and this misalignment extends the length of the NZ to include lobule X (<a href="#pone-0001653-g004">Fig. 4M, N</a>). Roman numerals denote putative lobule assignments. Scale bar = 1 mm for A–C and 250 µm for D–O.</p>
