                Figure 6.  PLCß4 immunostaining in Vldlr null whole mounts reveal patterning changes.Whole cerebella from wild type (WT-A, D, G, J), Vldlr null (Vldlr−-B, E, H, K) or Apoer2 null (ApoER2−-C, F, I, L) cerebella immunostained with anti-PLCß4 antibodies. P1+, and P2+ mark zebrin II-immunopositive/PLCß4-immunonegative stripes while P1-, and P2- mark immunonegative/PLCß4-immunopositive stripes. The stripes are subtly altered in more dorsal lobules of the Vldlr- cerebellum. Specifically, as the P1- stripes enter putative lobule VI they narrow to ~400 µm, while the P3- stripe remains roughly the same width as the AZ (~600 µm) but veers sharply towards the hemispheres (E). PLCß4 whole mount immunostaining of the Apoer2 null cerebellum (C, F, I, L) reveals a parasagittal stripe pattern that is largely reminiscent of wild type and relatively unchanged despite the Purkinje cell ectopia observed inside the cerebellum (Fig 2, 3). Roman numerals (I–X) indicate lobules. Scale bar in L = 200 µm and applies to A–C, and G–I;  = 500 µm for G–F, and J–L.
