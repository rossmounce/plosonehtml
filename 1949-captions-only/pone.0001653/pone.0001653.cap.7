Merged images reveal that ectopic Purkinje clusters lie near to, but outside of the deep cerebellar nuclei in both <em>Apoer2</em> (A-/-) and <em>Vldlr</em> (V-/-) null mice. KLC-immunopositive cerebellar nuclear neurons are surrounded by the calbindin-immunoreactive axons of the Purkinje cells and these observations are consistent with previous studies of deep cerebellar nuclear neuron labeling (Chung et al., 2006). Wild type littermates (WT) have few ectopic Purkinje cells. Scale bar = 250 µm.</p>
