                Figure 8.  Cerebella from mice heterozygous for the Apoer2 and Vldlr deletions have Purkinje ectopia restricted to a small subset of zebrin II-immunonegative Purkinje cells.Serial sagittal sections from adult cerebella immunoreacted with anti-calbindin (CaBP -A, E), anti-zebrin II (ZII-B, F), or anti-phospholipase C ß4 (PLCß4-C, G) antibodies reveal the presence of a small cluster of Purkinje cells (e.g. dotted circle–D) that fail to express zebrin II but do express PLCß4 (F). Roman numerals denote putative lobule assignments. Boxes in A–D indicate magnified areas. Scale bar in F = 1mm for A–C and 250 µm for D–F.
