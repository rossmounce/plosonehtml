After 48 h, cell extracts were obtained and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-M2 (A) or anti-Vav1 (B) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blot with the indicated antibodies (right side of panels). Aliquots of the TCL used in the immunoprecipitations were analysed in parallel to confirm expression of the appropriate proteins (bottom panel). −, without; +, with; α, anti; IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, western blot.</p>
