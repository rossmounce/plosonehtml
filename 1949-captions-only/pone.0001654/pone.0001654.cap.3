                Figure 3.  Increased association of Fyn and Vav1 to phosphorylated M2 does not involve phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes.(A,B) COS1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteins. After 48 h, cell extracts were obtained and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-M2 (A) or anti-Vav1 (B) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blot with the indicated antibodies (right side of panels). Aliquots of the TCL used in the immunoprecipitations were analysed in parallel to confirm expression of the appropriate proteins (bottom panel). −, without; +, with; α, anti; IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, western blot.
