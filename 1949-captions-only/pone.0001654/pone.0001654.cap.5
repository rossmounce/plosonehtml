                Figure 5.  Activation of Vav proteins is necessary to the establishment of normal levels of latency in spleen.Balb/c mice were intranasally infected with viruses of the indicated viral genotypes and latent load quantified by ex-vivo reactivation. Each point represents the infectious center titre from an individual mouse. Horizontal bars indicate arithmetic means. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection of the assay.
