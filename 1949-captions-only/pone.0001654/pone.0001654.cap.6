                Figure 6.  Modulation of Vav activity is required for normal kinetics of latency in GC B cells.Balb/c mice were intranasally infected with viruses of the indicated viral genotypes. Spleen sections were processed for in situ hybridization with miRNA riboprobes. (A) Representative spleen sections from each group of animals. Dark staining indicates cells positive for viral encoded miRNAs. All sections are magnified at ×200 and counter stained with haematoxylin. (B) Mean percentage ± SEM of miRNA+ follicles (filled bars) and positive follicles with large clusters of miRNA-positive cells (open bars). Six sections per mouse and at least four mice per group were counted at each time point. Follicles were scored positive if they contained at least one positive miRNA cell and positive for expansion if they contained more than ten miRNA positive cells.
