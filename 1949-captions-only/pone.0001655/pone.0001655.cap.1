Colors correspond to the boxes in the upper righthand corner of the spectrograms in a and b. AMs were normalized to have a minimum amplitude of 0 and a maximum amplitude of 1. e,f) The power spectra of the AMs in the sounds shown in a and b in the carrier frequency band around 6.5 KHz, with the gray band denoting the 20–120 Hz frequency range. AMs were normalized as in c and d. g) The parameter values that provided the optimal fits for the average amplitude distribution of the AMs in each sound ensemble for a range of carrier frequencies (exponential distribution for vocalizations, Rayleigh distribution for ambient noises). Each sound ensemble was divided into 10 segments, and the error bars in panel g denote one standard deviation of the distribution of optimal parameter values across these segments. h) The value of <em>α</em> that provided the best fit of the function 1/<em>f<sup>α</sup></em> to the average power spectra of the AMs in each sound ensemble in the 20–120 Hz frequency range for a range of carrier frequencies.</p>
