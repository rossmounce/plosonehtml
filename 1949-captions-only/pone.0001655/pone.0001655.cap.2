The V stimulus was a pure tone at the neuron's preferred frequency that was modulated by a signal with the same amplitude distribution and power spectrum as the AMs in the ensemble of vocalizations. The VN stimulus was the V stimulus added to broadband noise that was modulated by a signal with the same amplitude distribution and power spectrum as the AMs in the ensemble of ambient noises. The SNR in the VN stimulus was −10 dB. The gray lines represent the actual stimulus waveform and the black lines represent the AMs of the vocalization stimulus. b) The responses of two typical cells to repeated presentations of the V and VN stimuli. For each repetition of the VN stimulus, the vocalization signal was the same, while the ambient noise signal was different. The preferred frequencies of the cells were 2.5 KHz and 16.7 KHz, respectively. The boxes indicate the colors used to identify the mean firing rates and SNRs of these two cells in the scatter plots shown in c and d. c) The mean firing rates for a population of cells during non-repeating 40 second segments of the V and VN stimuli. The crosses denote the population mean±one standard deviation. The blue and green circles correspond to the cells for which responses are shown in b. d) The SNRs of the responses of a subset of cells to short repeated segments of the V and VN stimuli (3 seconds, 100 repetitions). SNR was calculated for firing rate responses in 1 ms bins as described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>.</p>
