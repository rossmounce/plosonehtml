The preferred frequency of the cell was 12.7 KHz. The error bars represent 95% confidence bounds. The RFs were normalized to have the same peak value for plotting. b) The MTFs corresponding to the RFs in a. MTFs were obtained by computing the power spectrum of the RF. Before computing the power spectrum, RFs were normalized such that the variance of the result of the convolution of the RF with the vocalization signal was one. c,d) RFs and MTFs for two additional cells with preferred frequencies of 2.5 and 12.5 KHz, respectively. RFs and MTFs were normalized as described in a and b. e) The area above the MTF corresponding to the attenuation of low frequencies was measured on logarithmic axes, from the lowest non-zero frequency measured (20 Hz) to the peak. Before calculation of the LF area, the MTF was normalized to have a peak value of one. The LF area was zero for those neurons whose MTFs were monotonically decreasing. f) The LF area of the V and VN MTFs for the population of 63 cells. The crosses denote the population mean±one standard deviation. The colored circles correspond the RFs and MTFs shown in a–d as indicated by the colored boxes. g) A histogram showing the percent changes between the LF areas in f.</p>
