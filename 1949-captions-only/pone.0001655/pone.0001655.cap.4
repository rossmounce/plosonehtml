                Figure 4.  Rapid changes in temporal processing are evoked by the onset or offset of ambient noise.a) A schematic illustration of the stimulus, which switched between V and VN every 3 seconds. The gray line represents the actual stimulus and the black line represents the vocalization modulation signal. b) The temporal RFs of a typical cell estimated just before and just after noise onset and offset. The preferred frequency of the cell was 6.7 KHz. The error bars represent 95% confidence bounds. The RFs were normalized to have the same peak value for plotting. The colors of the RFs correspond to the time intervals marked in a. c) The MTFs corresponding to the RFs in b. Before computing the MTFs, RFs were normalized such that the variance of the result of the convolution of the RF with the vocalization signal was one. d) The LF area of the MTFs for a sample of 6 cells, estimated at 200 ms intervals after noise onset and offset. The colored circles correspond to the time intervals marked in a. The results for each cell were normalized such that the LF area just before noise offset was 0 and the LF area just before noise onset was 1. The error bars represent one standard deviation of the distribution of normalized LF areas across the sample of cells.
