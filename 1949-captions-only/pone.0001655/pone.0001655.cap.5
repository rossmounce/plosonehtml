The preferred frequency of the cell was 10.1 KHz. The error bars represent 95% confidence bounds. The RFs were normalized to have the same peak value for plotting. Before computing the MTFs, RFs were normalized such that the variance of the result of the convolution of the RF with the vocalization signal was one. d) The LF areas of the V and VN MTFs at a range of intensities for the cell whose RFs and MTFs are shown in a–c. The error bars represent 95% confidence bounds. e) The percent change in LF area evoked by the addition of noise to the vocalization stimuli for a range of overall stimulus intensities for a sample of 8 cells. The error bars represent one standard deviation of the distribution of percent changes in LF area across the sample of cells.</p>
