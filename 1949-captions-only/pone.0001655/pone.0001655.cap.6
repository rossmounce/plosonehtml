                Figure 6.  Actual and predicted responses of auditory neurons to naturalistic stimuli.a) A model of temporal processing in the auditory pathway. The vocalization signal (with or without additive noise) is passed through either the V or VN RF, and the result is fed into an integrate and fire mechanism to generate spikes. b) The temporal RFs estimated from responses to the V (black) and VN (red) stimuli for two cells with preferred frequencies of 12.5 and 3 KHz, respectively. The RFs were normalized to have the same peak value for plotting. c,d) The actual and predicted responses to repeated presentations of the V and VN stimuli for the two cells for which RFs are shown in b. The correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual responses are shown. The correlation coefficients were calculated for responses to novel stimuli (those not used to fit the model) for firing rate in 2 ms bins averaged over 100 repetitions.
