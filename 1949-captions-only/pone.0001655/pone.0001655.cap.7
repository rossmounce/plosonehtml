The gray band denotes the 20–120 Hz frequency range. The calculation of the signal and noise components of the responses is described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. b) The mutual information rate between the stimulus and the responses of the model with the V and VN RFs. The blue circle corresponds to the cell for which response spectra are shown in b. The crosses denote the sample mean±one standard deviation. c) A histogram showing the percent changes between the information rates shown in b (change from the responses of the VN model to the responses of the V model). d,e) Power spectra and information rates presented as in a and b for responses to the vocalization stimulus with ambient noise. f) A histogram showing the percent changes between the information rates shown in e (change from the responses of the V model to the responses of the VN model).</p>
