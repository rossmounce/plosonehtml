                Figure 7.  Context-dependent changes in temporal processing promote efficient coding.a) The power spectrum of the signal (thick lines) and noise (thin lines) in the responses of the model with the V (black) and VN (red) RFs to the vocalization stimulus alone for a typical cell (the same cell for which RFs and MTFs are shown in figures 3a and b). The gray band denotes the 20–120 Hz frequency range. The calculation of the signal and noise components of the responses is described in the Materials and Methods. b) The mutual information rate between the stimulus and the responses of the model with the V and VN RFs. The blue circle corresponds to the cell for which response spectra are shown in b. The crosses denote the sample mean±one standard deviation. c) A histogram showing the percent changes between the information rates shown in b (change from the responses of the VN model to the responses of the V model). d,e) Power spectra and information rates presented as in a and b for responses to the vocalization stimulus with ambient noise. f) A histogram showing the percent changes between the information rates shown in e (change from the responses of the V model to the responses of the VN model).
