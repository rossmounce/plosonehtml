Graphs depict the running sum statistics when applying gene set enrichment analysis. The running sum (<em>y</em>-axis) is shown as a function of the index in the list (<em>x</em>-axis) of genes ranked in ascending order according to their factor loadings within TSR. The red vs. green graphs show the biological coherence of opposing regulated gene clusters controlled by TSRs.</p>
