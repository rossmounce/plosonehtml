                Figure 4.  Similarities in transcriptional system regulation between human and mouse.Panels A and B show the results of gene set enrichment analysis for six biological processes for human TSR1 and mouse TSR2, respectively. Graphs show the running sum statistics. The running sum (y-axis) is shown as a function of the index in the list (x-axis) of genes ranked in ascending order according to their factor loadings with a TSR. The red vs. green graphs show the biological coherence of regulated gene clusters controlled by TSRs in both species.
