Graphs show the running sum statistics. The running sum (<em>y</em>-axis) is shown as a function of the index in the list (<em>x</em>-axis) of genes ranked in ascending order according to their factor loadings with a TSR. The red vs. green graphs show the biological coherence of regulated gene clusters controlled by TSRs in both species.</p>
