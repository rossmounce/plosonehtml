                Figure 6.  Heat map examples of gene clusters based on factor loadings with the first 50 transcriptional system regulators (TSRs).Each box in the heat map represents the factor loading of a gene with one of the TSRs (negative = red; positive = green). The first row shows the average factor loadings for the depicted cluster.
