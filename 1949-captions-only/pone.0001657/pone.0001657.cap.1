                Figure 1.  Average Salmonella enterica populations in soil and on leaves, stems, and roots of tomato.Tomato seeds were sown at weekly intervals in S. enterica irrigated soil and S. enterica populations were enumerated at the seedling stage. Phyllosphere and rhizoplane populations were from seedlings planted one week before sampling. Averages from two experiments were calculated from log transformed data and error bars represent standard deviations. T-tests were preformed to determine average population changes over time for each type of sample. Different letters represent significant population changes (p&lt;0.03).
