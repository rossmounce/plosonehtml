Phyllosphere and rhizoplane populations were from seedlings planted one week before sampling. Averages from two experiments were calculated from log transformed data and error bars represent standard deviations. T-tests were preformed to determine average population changes over time for each type of sample. Different letters represent significant population changes (p&lt;0.03).</p>
