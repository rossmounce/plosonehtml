                Figure 2.  Average Salmonella enterica populations in the tomato phyllosphere.S. enterica populations are from plants with (white square) or without (black diamond) inoculation of tomato seed with Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. Autoclaved soil was irrigated with S. enterica 24 h prior to seed sowing. Averages from two experiments were calculated from log transformed data and error bars represent standard deviations.
