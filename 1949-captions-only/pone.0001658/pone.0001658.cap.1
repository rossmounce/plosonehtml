Two-hybrid tests. Three Corto sub-fragments comprising amino-acids 1 to 324 (C1/324), 325 to 550 (C325/550), and 127 to 203 (C127/203) (chromodomain) were fused with LexA DNA binding domain. B42AD-CycG was isolated from an embryonic library using LexA-C1/324 as bait. Interaction was observed only between LexA-C1/324 and B42-CycG. Negative controls: LexA <em>versus</em> B42AD-CycG and LexA-C1/324 <em>versus</em> B42AD. Positive control: LexA53 (LexA/p53 fusion) <em>versus</em> B42AD-T (B42AD/large T-antigen fusion). B. GST pull-down assays. Top: Coomassie staining of fusion proteins (shown by arrows). Middle: Autoradiography. Input (CycG-<sup>35</sup>S) shows two isoforms (asterisks). Bottom: schematic representation of Corto full-length and truncated forms (black box: chromodomain). C. GST pull-down assays. Top: Coomassie staining of the fusion proteins (shown by arrows). Middle: Autoradiography. Input (Corto <sup>35</sup>S). Bottom: schematic representation of CycG full-length and truncated forms (grey box: cyclin domain).</p>
