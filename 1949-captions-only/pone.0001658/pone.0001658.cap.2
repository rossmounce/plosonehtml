                Figure 2.  Alignment of cyclin domains of Drosophila and mammalian CycG proteins.A. Alignment of the cyclin domains of Drosophila CycG (NM 524609), human CycG1 (NP 954854), mouse CycG1 (NP 033961), rat CycG1 (NP 037055), human CycG2 (NM 004345), mouse CycG2 (NP 031661) and rat CycG2 (NP 446451) (dark grey: identical amino-acids, light grey: similar amino-acids). B. Developmental Northern blot. Poly(A+) RNA from w1118 embryos, third instar larvae (LIII) and adult flies were probed with 32P-labelled CycG cDNA (left). Arrows point to five mRNA species ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 kb in size that may correspond to CG11525 RA-RE transcripts predicted in Flybase. The same filter was hybridized with 32P-labelled 18S and 28S probes (right) for loading control. C. Total protein (left) and chromatin (right) extracts were prepared from w1118 0â€“14 h embryos and analysed using rabbit anti-CycG antibodies.
