Alignment of the cyclin domains of <em>Drosophila</em> CycG (NM 524609), human CycG1 (NP 954854), mouse CycG1 (NP 033961), rat CycG1 (NP 037055), human CycG2 (NM 004345), mouse CycG2 (NP 031661) and rat CycG2 (NP 446451) (dark grey: identical amino-acids, light grey: similar amino-acids). B. Developmental Northern blot. Poly(A<sup>+</sup>) RNA from <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em> embryos, third instar larvae (LIII) and adult flies were probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled <em>CycG</em> cDNA (left). Arrows point to five mRNA species ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 kb in size that may correspond to CG11525 RA-RE transcripts predicted in Flybase. The same filter was hybridized with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled <em>18S</em> and <em>28S</em> probes (right) for loading control. C. Total protein (left) and chromatin (right) extracts were prepared from <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em> 0â€“14 h embryos and analysed using rabbit anti-CycG antibodies.</p>
