Validation of <em>RNAi</em> efficiency by <em>in situ</em> hybridization. Leg imaginal discs from <em>ptc::Gal4&gt;UAS::dsCycG3</em> third instar larvae were hybridized using <em>CycG</em> as a probe. Expression of the <em>CycG</em> mRNA was specifically reduced in the <em>ptc</em> expression domain along the antero-posterior border (arrow). B. Validation of <em>RNAi</em> efficiency by immuno-labelling. Leg imaginal discs from <em>en::Gal4&gt;UAS::dsCycG3</em> were immuno-labelled using rabbit anti-CycG antibodies. The expression of CycG was specifically reduced in the <em>en</em> expression domain <em>i.e.</em> in the posterior compartment (arrow), whereas it was ubiquitous in the control (<em>UAS::dsCycG3</em>).</p>
