                Figure 3.  CycG is an essential gene in Drosophila.A. Validation of RNAi efficiency by in situ hybridization. Leg imaginal discs from ptc::Gal4&gt;UAS::dsCycG3 third instar larvae were hybridized using CycG as a probe. Expression of the CycG mRNA was specifically reduced in the ptc expression domain along the antero-posterior border (arrow). B. Validation of RNAi efficiency by immuno-labelling. Leg imaginal discs from en::Gal4&gt;UAS::dsCycG3 were immuno-labelled using rabbit anti-CycG antibodies. The expression of CycG was specifically reduced in the en expression domain i.e. in the posterior compartment (arrow), whereas it was ubiquitous in the control (UAS::dsCycG3).
