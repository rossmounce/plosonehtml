                Figure 5.  Corto, CycG and PH partially co-localize in vivo.Simultaneous detection of Corto (red) and CycG (green) (A), PH (red) and CycG (green) (B), PH (red) and Corto (green) (C) on polytene chromosomes stained with DAPI (blue). Close-ups of chromosome 3 L ends showing 3 loci simultaneously bound by PH (Red) and CycG (green) (D), and the same 3 loci simultaneously bound by PH (red) and Corto (green) (E). Overlaps appear yellow.
