Anti-Ubx antibody staining of <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em> embryos, or embryos depleted of maternal and zygotic Corto. Upper row, lateral view and lower row, dorsal view. (B) Dorsal view. In wild-type embryos (left), <em>Ubx</em> is expressed from parasegment PS5 to PS12 with a higher expression in PS6. In <em>corto</em> embryos (right), the anterior boundary of <em>Ubx</em> is not modified but <em>Ubx</em> is strongly downregulated in PS11 and PS12 (arrowheads) . Parasegment numbers are indicated in white and the anterior border of <em>Ubx</em> expression by arrows. B. Anti-AbdB antibody staining of <em>w<sup>1118</sup></em> embryos, or embryos depleted of maternal and zygotic Corto. Upper row, close-ups of the ventral nerve chord. In wild-type embryos (left), <em>Abd-B</em> is expressed in a decreasing gradient from PS13 to PS10. In <em>corto</em> embryos (right), this gradient extends anteriorly to PS9 and PS8. Moreover, expression of <em>Abd-B</em> seems to be higher in PS13 to PS10. Lower row, dorsal view of whole mount embryos showing ectodermal <em>Abd-B</em> expression; note ectopic expression of <em>Abd-B</em> in anterior parasegments in <em>corto</em> mutant embryos (arrows).</p>
