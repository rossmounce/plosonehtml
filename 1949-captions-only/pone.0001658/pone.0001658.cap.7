                Figure 7.  Corto and CycG bind the iab-7 PRE and the promoter of Abd-B.Schematic representation of the Abd-B locus (numbers and transcript names refer to SEQ89/U31961) [44]. Corto or CycG XChIP was performed using total chromatin from 0â€“14 h embryos. Fragments around 500 bp from the iab-7 PRE (p9, p8) and overlapping the iab-7 PRE (p7) or the Abd-B B promoter (p10) were amplified with specific primers using the immuno-precipitated DNA [42], [45]. A fragment from the rp49 gene was used as a negative control. The 31st, 33rd and 35th PCR cycle samples are shown. Relative enrichment was estimated for the 33rd PCR cycle sample from the ratio between Corto or CycG immunoprecipitations and mock signals from three independent experiments. The input track shows amplification of DNA from total chromatin with the same primers (Mock: rabbit preimmune serum, Corto: rabbit anti-Corto, CycG-R: rabbit anti-CycG, CycG-GP: guinea-pig anti-CycG). The iab-6, iab-7 and iab-8 cis-regulatory domains are indicated.
