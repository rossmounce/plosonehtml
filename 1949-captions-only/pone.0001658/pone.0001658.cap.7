Corto or CycG XChIP was performed using total chromatin from 0â€“14 h embryos. Fragments around 500 bp from the <em>iab-7</em> PRE (p9, p8) and overlapping the <em>iab-7</em> PRE (p7) or the <em>Abd-B</em> B promoter (p10) were amplified with specific primers using the immuno-precipitated DNA <a href="#pone.0001658-Breiling1">[42]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001658-Breiling2">[45]</a>. A fragment from the <em>rp49</em> gene was used as a negative control. The 31<sup>st</sup>, 33<sup>rd</sup> and 35<sup>th</sup> PCR cycle samples are shown. Relative enrichment was estimated for the 33<sup>rd</sup> PCR cycle sample from the ratio between Corto or CycG immunoprecipitations and mock signals from three independent experiments. The input track shows amplification of DNA from total chromatin with the same primers (Mock: rabbit preimmune serum, Corto: rabbit anti-Corto, CycG-R: rabbit anti-CycG, CycG-GP: guinea-pig anti-CycG). The <em>iab-6</em>, <em>iab-7</em> and <em>iab-8 cis</em>-regulatory domains are indicated.</p>
