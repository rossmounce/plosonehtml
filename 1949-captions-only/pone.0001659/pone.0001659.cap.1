                Figure 1.  The expected FOF plotted against experimental observations.Both axes are in logarithmic scale to make FOF data more legible. The expected FOFs under BB (A) and GP (B) models are plotted against the experimentally observed FOF from Lib843. The expected FOF under GIGP model is plotted against the experimental observations from Lib843 (C) and the pooled library (D).
