A virtual transcriptome is generated with <em>S</em> = 77,152 according to the fitted RAD. With the same sample size as the pooled library, the simulated FOF data is plotted against the experimental observation. The simulation based on the fitted RAD and estimated transcriptome diversity <em>S</em> exactly replicates the SAGE experiment.</p>
