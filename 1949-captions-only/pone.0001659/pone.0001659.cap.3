The probability density of the fitted generalized inverse Gaussian distribution is plotted (mode: 4.11e-7, mean: 1.30e-5, and median: 1.65e-6). The 75% confidence interval (CI) with minimum length is at [1.00e-7, 4.80e-6]. It is highly skewed toward zero and has a long tail. Inset: the distribution function of RAD, showing that 90% of the transcripts have relative abundances less than 1.66e-5.</p>
