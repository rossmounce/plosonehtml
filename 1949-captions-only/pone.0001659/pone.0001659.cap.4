                Figure 4.  Mean and median copy numbers of detected transcripts at different sampling stages.Monte Carlo simulation is done with the fitted RAD and estimated transcriptome diversity S of the pooled library. Assuming there are 1,000,000 copies of transcript per cell, the mean and median copy numbers of all detected transcripts at each sampling stage are plotted.
