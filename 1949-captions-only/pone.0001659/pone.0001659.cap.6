                Figure 6.  Sampling growth curve and transcriptome diversity estimation.Number of unique transcripts (solid square) identified in Lib843 (A) and the pooled library (B) as well as the sampling histories (red open circle) and predicted growth curve (blue solid line) are plotted. Blue-shaded areas divide the estimated transcriptome diversity S (black dashed line) into four quarters.
