                Figure 7.  Monte Carlo simulation of a deep transcriptome sampling.Monte Carlo simulation is done with the fitted RAD and estimated transcriptome diversity S of the pooled library, for a deep sampling that ranges from 0 up to 3,000,000 with step length of 120,000. The predicted growth curve (blue solid line) aligns well with the simulation (red open circle). Both the simulated and the predicted growth curves intercept at the data point for the original library (solid square). Blue-shaded areas divide the estimated transcriptome diversity S (black dashed line) into four quarters.
