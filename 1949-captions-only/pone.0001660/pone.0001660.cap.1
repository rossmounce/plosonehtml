HeLa cells were transfected with three shRNA constructs specific for human VRK2 or the mixture of them (sh-VKR2-pool), cloned in plasmid pSuperior-Retro-puro and targeting the indicated positions. As control a shRNA construct for VRK1 cloned in pSuperior-Retro-puro was used. Then the cells were processed for Western blotting with a specific polyclonal antibody against human VRK2 which recognizes both VRK2A (upper band) and VRK2B (lower band) isoforms. The initial level of VRK2 proteins in non-transfected cells is also shown (control). (B). Effect of shVRK2 on the transcriptional response to IL-1β. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.2 µg of reporter pAP1-luc, 10 ng of pRL-tk, and 6 µg of the plasmids expressing shRNA constructs. Four hours after transfection the cells were maintained in DMEM with 0% FBS to reduce background activity and at 40 hours the cultures were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β (right side), or without IL-1β (left side). Extracts were collected six hours after stimulation processed for dual luciferase determination. The results from six experiments are shown. ** P&lt;0.001, *** P&lt;0.0005.</p>
