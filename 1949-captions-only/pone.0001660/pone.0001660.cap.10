Cos1 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of plasmids pCEFL-HA-VRK2A and the kinase-dead form (KD: K169E), in the presence of pEBG-GST-JIP1(3 µg), pCMV-HA-TAK1(50 ng) plus de pCMVT-Flag-TAB1(50 ng) and pFlag-JNK(4 µg). The proteins were detected with the corresponding antibody specific for actin, the epitopes GST, HA or Flag, and for the specific phosphorylation in Thr183 and Tyr185 of JNK (p-JNK).</p>
