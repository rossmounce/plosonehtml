The signalosome containing VRK2 proteins that interact with both TAK1 and JIP1 has a different conformation and the signal is blocked and ca not be transmitted. This conformation does not interact with JNK. The two alternative conformations might be in different proportions in the cell depending on the relative concentration of their components as well as their subcellular localization.</p>
