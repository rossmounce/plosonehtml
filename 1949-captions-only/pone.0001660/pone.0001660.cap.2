Exogenous VRK2 protein level modulates the activation of AP1-dependent transcription induced by IL-1β. The dose response effect of the wild type VRK2 proteins, the kinase-dead VRK2 proteins (K169E), or the recovery of the response by shRNA specific for VRK2 was studied in the activation of transcription by IL-1β. Cos1 cells were transfected with 0.8 µg of pAP1-luc, 10 ng of pRL-tk, pHA-TAK1 (50 ng)/pFlag-TAB1 (50 ng), and the indicated amounts of the corresponding wild-type kinase (pCEFL-HA-VRK2A or pCEFL-HA-VRK2B) or kinase dead (pCEFL-HA-VRK2A/B(K169E). The shRNA was induced using the indicated amounts of p-Superior-shRNA-VRK2-230 plasmid. 24 hours after transfection the cells were placed in serum-free media and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) were added to the culture for six hours. The results are the mean of six experiments. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.005. The activity in the presence of IL-1β and TAK1/TAB1 and in the absence of any VRK2 plasmid was used as reference (First shaded box) for statistical analysis. (B). Effect of VRK2 levels on AP1-dependent transcription mediated by TAK1 activation of the endogenous JIP1-JNK signaling complex. Cos1 cells were transfected with 0.8 µg of the reporter pAP1-Luc plasmid, 10 ng of pRL-tk, pHA-TAK1 (50 ng) and pFlag-TAB1 (50 ng) and the indicated amount of plasmids expressing the VRK2 isoforms, active (pCEFL-HA-VRK2A or pCEFL-HA-VRK2B) or kinase-dead variants (with the K169E substitution) and plasmid pSuperior-shRNA-VRK2-230 for RNA interference. The correct expression of the proteins was first determined by immunoblot analysis (not shown). The value used as reference was the maximal activity obtained when stimulated with TAK1/TAB1. The results from six experiments are shown. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.005, *** P&lt;0.0005. The minor differences between VRK2A and VRK2A(K169E) were not statistically significant. The activity in the presence of TAK1/TAB1 and absence of any VRK2 plasmid was used as reference for statistical analysis.</p>
