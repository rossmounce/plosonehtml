Effect of siRNA specific for JIP1 on its level. HeLa cells were transfected with two different siRNA specific for JIP1; 48 hours after transfection the level of endogenous JIP1 protein was determined with a specific antibody. The siRNA-2, but not siRNA-1, was able to knock down JIP1 protein levels. (B) Effect of siRNA for JIP1 on the transcriptional response to IL-1β. HeLa cells were firstly transfected with 100 pmoles of siRNA-2 for JIP1 and 100 pmoles of siRNA control as indicated. 24 hours after, cells were retransfected with 0.2 µg of reporter pAP1-luc and 10 ng of pRL-tk. Four hours after the second transfection the cells were maintained in DMEM with 0% FBS to reduce background activity and at 40 hours the cultures were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β, or without IL-1β. Extracts were collected six hours after stimulation and processed for dual luciferase determination (top) and western blot analysis of JIP1 levels (bottom). Results are the means of three experiments. Blots were quantified in the linear response range.</p>
