Cos1 cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in the corresponding lane. The expression of the proteins was determined by western blot (bottom panel). The different lysates were pulled down with Glutathione-Sepharose to bring down the GST-JIP1 protein and associated molecules. The pull-down proteins were detected with antibodies that recognize the HA epitope in the VRK2 proteins. The constructs derived from VRK2 includes the two isoforms expressed from plasmids pCEFL-HA-VRK2A and pCEFL-HA-VRK2B as well as their catalytically inactive kinase-dead (KD) variants containing the K169E substitution. JIP1ΔJBD lacks the JNK binding domain (residues 127-282). (G). In vitro interaction between human VRK2 and JIP1 proteins. The human VRK2 protein was in vitro transcribed-translated and labeled with 35S methionine. This protein was used for a pulldown assay with bacterially expressed GST-JIP1 constructs. (F). Schematic representation of the GST-JIP1 proteins used in the pull-down assay and the interacting region with VRK2. (H). Binding of endogenous VRK2A to GST-JIP1. Cos1 cell were transfected with pCEFL-GST or pEBG-GST-JIP1, and the proteins in the pull-down were identified with a specific polyclonal antibody for VRK2 and GST. (I). Binding of endogenous JIP1 protein to GST-VRK2A. Cos1 cells were transfected with pCEFL-GST or PCEFL-GST-VRK2A. The JIP1 protein in the pull-down was detected with a specific polyclonal antibody.</p>
