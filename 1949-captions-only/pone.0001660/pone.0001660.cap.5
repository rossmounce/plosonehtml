Association of endogenous JIP1 with the endoplasmic reticulum. JIP1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody and as secondary a Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antibody was used (red). Calnexin was detected with a monoclonal antibody and a Cy-2-labeled anti-mouse antibody (green). (B) Association of endogenous JIP1 with mitochondria. JIP1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody and as secondary antibody a Cy2-labeled anti-rabbit antibody was used (green). Mitochondria were detected with the MitoTracker Red CMXRos reagent (red). Nuclei were identified with DAPI staining. The bar indicates 50 µm. (C). Colocalization of endogenous JIP1 and transfected HA-VRK2A. The Cos1 cell line was transfected with plasmid, pCEFL-HA-VRK2A and pCEFL-HA-VRK2B, expressing each of the VRK2 isoforms. The endogenous JIP1 protein was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (red) and the transfected VRK2 proteins with a monoclonal antibody specific for HA epitope (green). Nuclei were identified with DAPI staining. The bar indicates 50 µm. (D). The expression of the four human JIP (1–4) genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR in RNA extracted from HeLa cells as described in <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>. The profile of amplification (upper panel) as well as the quantification (lower panel) by the Bio-Rad iCycler iQ5 Software is shown. (E). Detection of endogenous JIP1 protein in HeLa and Cos1 cells by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody against JIP1.</p>
