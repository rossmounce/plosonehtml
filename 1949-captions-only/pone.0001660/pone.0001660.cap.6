                Figure 6.  Individual VRK2 interactions with MAP kinases.(A). Interaction of TAK1/TAB1 with VRK2 isoforms. (B) Interaction between MKK7 and VRK2. (C). Interaction between JNK and VRK2. Cos1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. pT7-JIP1(4 µg), pCMV-HA-TAK1(20 ng) plus de pCMVT-Flag-TAB1(20 ng), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A or pCEFL-GST-VRK2B(4 µg), pFlag-MKK7 (0,5 µg) or pFlag-JNK (5 µg). The pull-down and immunoblots were performed as described in the methods section and the proteins were detected with antibodies against VRK2, JIP1 and Flag and HA epitopes.
