                Figure 7.  Effect of VRK2 on the interaction of JIP1 with different MAP kinases and detection of JIP1 signalosome.(A). Effect of VRK2A and B on the JIP1-JNK interaction. The plasmids used were pEBG-GST-JIP1(3 µg), pFlag-JNK(3 µg) and pCEFL-HA-VRK2A or pCEFL-HA-VRK2B wild-type or kinase-dead (5 µg). The proteins were detected with antibodies for actin and the corresponding epitopes, HA, GST, and Flag. (B). Effect of VRK2A orVRK2B on the TAK1-JIP1 interaction. The plasmid used in Cos1 cell transfections were pEBG-GST-JIP1(3 µg), pCMV-HA-TAK1(50 ng) plus de pCMVT-Flag-TAB1(50 ng) and de pCEFL-HA-VRK2A/B wild-type or kinase-dead (5 µg). The proteins were detected with antibodies for actin and the corresponding epitopes, HA, GST, and Flag. (C). Effect of VRK2A orVRK2B on the MKK7β1-JIP1 interaction. Cos1 cells were transfected with pEBG-GST-JIP1(3 µg), pFlag-MKK7β1(1 µg) and pCEFL-HA-VRK2A/B wild-type or kinase-dead(5 µg). The proteins were detected with antibodies for actin and the corresponding epitopes, HA, GST, and Flag.
