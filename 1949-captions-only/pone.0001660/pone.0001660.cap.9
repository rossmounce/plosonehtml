Effect of shRNA on VRK2 endogenous levels in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected as indicated in the <a href="#s4">methods</a> section with a shControl (pSuperior-shVRK1) or a specific shVRK2 (pSuperior- shVRK2-230+pSuperior-shVRK2-1335) plasmids. The endogenous protein in the whole cell extract was determined in an immunoblot with an anti-VRK2 monoclonal antibody. (B) Fractionation by HPLC and detection of endogenous proteins from HeLa cells transfected with shControl (pSuperior-shVRK1). (C). Fractionation and detection of endogenous proteins from HeLa cells transfected with specific shVRK2 (pSuperior- shVRK2-230+pSuperior-shVRK2-1335) plasmids. All the proteins determined correspond to the endogenous proteins.</p>
