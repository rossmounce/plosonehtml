                Figure 9.  The loss of endogenous VRK2 by shRNA induces an increase in JNK incorporated in the HeLa cells endogenous signalosome.(A). Effect of shRNA on VRK2 endogenous levels in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected as indicated in the methods section with a shControl (pSuperior-shVRK1) or a specific shVRK2 (pSuperior- shVRK2-230+pSuperior-shVRK2-1335) plasmids. The endogenous protein in the whole cell extract was determined in an immunoblot with an anti-VRK2 monoclonal antibody. (B) Fractionation by HPLC and detection of endogenous proteins from HeLa cells transfected with shControl (pSuperior-shVRK1). (C). Fractionation and detection of endogenous proteins from HeLa cells transfected with specific shVRK2 (pSuperior- shVRK2-230+pSuperior-shVRK2-1335) plasmids. All the proteins determined correspond to the endogenous proteins.
