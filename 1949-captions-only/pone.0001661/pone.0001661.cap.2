The murine β-globin locus is depicted on top of each graph. X-axis shows position in the locus. Black shading shows the position and size of the ‘fixed’ HindIII fragment. Grey shading indicates position and size of other HindIII fragments analyzed. Standard-error-of-mean is indicated. Cross-linking frequencies are normalized to the highest interaction within an experiment and give an arbitrary value of 1. (A) Cross-linking frequencies for a restriction fragment containing the β-globin promoter. High crosslinking frequencies with restriction fragments containing the hypersensitive sites of the LCR are observed in all samples, indicating close proximity between the β-globin promoter and LCR (B) Cross-linking frequencies for a restriction fragment containing HS2 of the β-globin LCR. High crosslinking frequencies with the restriction fragment containing the β-globin promoter is observed in all samples, indicating close proximity between HS2 of the LCR and the β-globin promoter. (C) Bar graphs of cross-linking frequencies for a restriction fragment containing the CTCF-binding HS4/5 of the β-globin LCR with other selected CTCF-binding sites within the β-globin locus (i.e. HS-85.5, HS-62.5/-60.7 and 3′HS1). Blue bars depict untreated samples, red bars DRB treated samples and green bars α-amanitin treated samples. Cross-linking frequencies are normalized to the highest interaction within the experiment and give an arbitrary value of 1. Error bars indicate standard error of mean.</p>
