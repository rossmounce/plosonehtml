                Figure 3.  The tissue specific β-globin locus does not switch its nuclear environment upon transcription inhibition.(A) Running mean data for two untreated fetal liver (blue) and α-amanitin treated fetal liver (green) samples are shown. Peaks of interaction of the β-globin promoter that are above the threshold (dashed line) with several regions on chromosome 7 are observed. (B) Zoom in of the running mean data plotted along a 12-Mb region centered around 114.5 MB on chromosome 7. False discovery rate was set at 5% (dashed line). Highly reproducible clusters of interactions with the β-globin locus are observed in the two untreated fetal liver samples and the two α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. Vertical bars indicate interactions that reach threshold levels in both duplicates. Chromosomal positions were based on National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) build m34. (C) Indicated are the percentages of interacting regions on chromosome 7 observed for the β-globin locus in untreated fetal liver that are identified in both, a single or none of the α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. (D) Schematic representation of cryo-FISH results. Grey shading indicates the regions identified (positive in both replicates) in untreated fetal livers, black shading indicates the regions identified (positive in both replicates) in α-amanitin treated fetal liver cells. Percentages of interaction with β-globin are indicated above the chromosome for untreated fetal liver cells or below the chromosome for α-amanitin treated fetal liver cells (black numbers indicate interacting, red non-interacting). Green bars indicate regions that are identified to be positive in both replicates by 4C technology. Red bars indicate regions identified to be negative in both replicates. Regions that are identified to be positive in only one replicate are indicated by a combined red and green bar. (E) Regions that score single positive after treatment while being double positive in untreated samples represent genuine interacting regions. Box plots representing our collective cryo-FISH data obtained for negative, single positive and double positive 4C regions for 102 different loci in different cell types scoring a total of 26733 alleles. Left panel depicts data obtained for interactions in Cis, right panel depicts data obtained for interactions in Trans. Horizontal bars represent the 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th and 90th percentiles, and p values for pairs of samples are indicated. The p value for a pair of samples was determined by an independent samples t-test for equality of means. Circles represent single values identified as outliers.
