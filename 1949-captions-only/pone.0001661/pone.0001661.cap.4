                Figure 4.  The housekeeping gene Rad23a does not switch its nuclear environment upon transcription inhibition.(A) Running mean data for two untreated fetal liver (blue) and α-amanitin treated fetal liver (green) samples is shown. Peaks of interaction of the Rad23a promoter above the threshold (dashed line) with several regions on chromosome 8 can be observed. False discovery rate was set at 5% (dashed line). Chromosomal positions were based on NCBI build m34. (B) Indicated are the percentages of interacting regions observed for Rad23a in cis on chromosome 8 in untreated fetal liver that are identified in both, a single or none of the α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. (C) Indicated is the percentages of trans-interacting regions observed for Rad23a in untreated fetal liver that are identified in both, a single or none of the α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples.
