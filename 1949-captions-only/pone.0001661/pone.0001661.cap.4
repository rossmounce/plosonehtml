Peaks of interaction of the <em>Rad23a</em> promoter above the threshold (dashed line) with several regions on chromosome 8 can be observed. False discovery rate was set at 5% (dashed line). Chromosomal positions were based on NCBI build m34. (B) Indicated are the percentages of interacting regions observed for <em>Rad23a</em> in <em>cis</em> on chromosome 8 in untreated fetal liver that are identified in both, a single or none of the α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. (C) Indicated is the percentages of <em>trans</em>-interacting regions observed for <em>Rad23a</em> in untreated fetal liver that are identified in both, a single or none of the α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples.</p>
