                Figure 5.  Key erythroid transcription factors remain bound to regulatory sites of the β-globin locus.Binding of (A) EKLF, (B) GATA-1, (C) NF-E2 and (D) CBP at β-globin regulatory elements. Blue bars depict untreated fetal liver samples, red bars DRB treated fetal liver samples and green bars α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. Enrichment is relative to amylase.
