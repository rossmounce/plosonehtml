(D) Detection of histone depleted chromatin at regulatory elements of the β-globin locus using FAIRE. Enrichment is relative to amylase. Grey bars depict fetal brain samples, blue bars depict untreated fetal liver samples, red bars depict DRB treated fetal liver samples and green bars α-amanitin treated fetal liver samples. Error bars indicate standard error of mean.</p>
