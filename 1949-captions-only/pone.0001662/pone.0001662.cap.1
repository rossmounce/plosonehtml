Photograph of a 48.48 dynamic array chip showing the position of the sample inlets and the detector inlets in which the gene expression assay reagents are added. The check valves allow pressure to be applied and released. The accumulators provide reservoirs to hold the pressure and keep the valves closed during the reaction. The integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) is in the center of the chip. This is a network of fluid lines, NanoFlexâ„¢ valves and reaction chambers. The insert shows a blow-up of a portion of the IFC with one of the 2304 individual reaction chambers (RC) and the associated containment valves (CV) and interface valve (IV) There are two containment valves and one interface valve associated with each reaction chamber. B. A computer generated image (heat map) of a 48.48 dynamic array chip obtained after thermal cycling of the chip. Each of the squares represents 1 reaction chamber from the chip. The color indicates the C<sub>T</sub> value according to the legend shown on the right. Black chambers indicate a C<sub>T</sub>&gt;40.</p>
