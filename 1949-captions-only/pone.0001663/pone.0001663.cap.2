                Figure 2.  Steady state expression of FLO11 and trehalose accumulation at different concentrations of ammonium sulphate.(a) Fractional expression of FLO11 with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate, when cells are precultured in nitrogen rich medium (solid line) and nitrogen starved medium (dashed line). (b) Fractional accumulation of trehalose with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate, when cells are precultured in nitrogen rich medium (solid media) and nitrogen starved medium (dashed line).
