(b) Fractional expression of <em>FLO11</em> with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate obtained using the network comprising of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways. Dose response was evaluated for K = 2 µM (Km for ammonium) (solid line), K = 16 µM (dashed line) and without the first term (dotted line) in Equation 4. The experimental values for the expression of <em>FLO11</em> with cells precultured in nitrogen rich medium (▴) and nitrogen starved medium(x) are indicated. It can be noted that the simulation matched the data obtained from preculturing in nitrogen rich medium (▴), while not able to simulate the data for preculturing in nitrogen starved medium (x).</p>
