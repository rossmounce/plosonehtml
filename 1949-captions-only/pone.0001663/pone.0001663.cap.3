                Figure 3.  Fractional activation of FLO11 by cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways.(a) Dose response curve for the expression of FLO11 with respect to the upstream component, Mep2 under wild type (solid line), Δgpa2 mutant (dotted line) and Δgpa2ras2 mutant (dashed line) conditions. (b) Fractional expression of FLO11 with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate obtained using the network comprising of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways. Dose response was evaluated for K = 2 µM (Km for ammonium) (solid line), K = 16 µM (dashed line) and without the first term (dotted line) in Equation 4. The experimental values for the expression of FLO11 with cells precultured in nitrogen rich medium (▴) and nitrogen starved medium(x) are indicated. It can be noted that the simulation matched the data obtained from preculturing in nitrogen rich medium (▴), while not able to simulate the data for preculturing in nitrogen starved medium (x).
