                Figure 4.  Sensitivity analysis for the fractional activation of Tor with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate.Surface plot with varying values of Hills coefficient, nH4 and half saturation constant, K4 (Equation 5) at ammonium sulfate concentration of (a) 50 µM and (b) 200 µM. The fractional activation of Tor is shown as colour bar. Region 1 represents the activity of Tor greater than 80% (red), region 2 represents the activity of Tor less than 20%( blue) and region 3 represents the activity of Tor between 30-70%. The region over which Tor operates to regulate the filamentous growth is for nH4 value less than 0.3(below the white line).
