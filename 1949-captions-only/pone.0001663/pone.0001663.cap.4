The fractional activation of Tor is shown as colour bar. Region 1 represents the activity of Tor greater than 80% (red), region 2 represents the activity of Tor less than 20%( blue) and region 3 represents the activity of Tor between 30-70%. The region over which Tor operates to regulate the filamentous growth is for nH4 value less than 0.3(below the white line).</p>
