                Figure 5.  Cln1/2 synthesis with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate.The dose response for the fractional concentration of Cln1/2 at 90%(dotted line), 50%(dashed line) and 10%(solid line) concentration of Clb2. The experimental observation of FLO11 expression over a concentration range of ammonium sulphate is indicated using dotted lines (marked as region 1).
