The effect of negative feedback on the bistable response for (b) K<sub>5</sub> = 5 nM (solid line), 6 nM (dotted line) and 7nM (dashed line) and for (c) nH5 = 3 (solid line), 2.5 (dashed line) and 2(dotted line) in Equation 2. The experimental observation of <em>FLO11</em> expression over a concentration range of ammonium sulphate is indicated using dotted lines (marked as region 1).</p>
