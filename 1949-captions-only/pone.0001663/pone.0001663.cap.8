                Figure 8.  Simulated dose response for a network comprising of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways with negative feedback on Tor included.(a) A simplified network comprising of different components of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways considered for the simulation are shown (b) Bistable response of FLO11 expression over an inducing concentration range of ammonium sulfate. FLO11 expression exists in two stable states, i.e. either high or low based on the preculturing condition. The intermediate state is unstable, which is shown as dashed line. The experimental values for the expression of FLO11 with cells precultured in nitrogen rich medium (â–´) and nitrogen starved medium (x) are indicated.
