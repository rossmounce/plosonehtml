The fifth column shows the integrated z-map over the three time windows (with Z&gt;3.1) with all active brain regions listed in <a href="#pone-0001664-t001">Table 1</a>. In order to see the extent of the spread of activity over the fusiform cortices elicited by faces, the group activity is superimposed on a ventral view of the human brain (with the cerebellum removed).</p>
