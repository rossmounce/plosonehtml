                Figure 4.  Augmented vascular regeneration by intra-arterial transplantation of human VPC-derived vascular cells in a murine hindlimb ischemia model.a) Serial LDPI analysis in hindlimb ischemia mice. At day 14, the blood flow of ischemic limbs in all cell transplanted groups increased significantly compared to the control group (white arrowhead). After 42 days, significant blood flow recovery was observed in the uEPC and human VPC-derived EC and/or MC-transplanted groups (red arrowhead), but not in pEPC. b) Quantitative analysis of hindlimb blood flow by calculating the ischemic/normal limb perfusion ratios after the induction of hindlimb ischemia. *P&lt;0.05 vs. control, †P&lt;0.05 vs. pEPC, ††P&lt;0.05 vs. uEPC, ‡P&lt;0.05 vs. MC, §P&lt;0.05 vs. EC.
