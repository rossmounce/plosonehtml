Scale bar: 500 µm. b, c) Immunostaining of frozen sections harvested from ischemic limb tissues at day 14. Fluorescence staining of GSL I-isolectin B4 (green) and human CD31 (blue) with nuclear staining (red) in human VPC-derived EC+MC (b), pEPC, and uEPC (c) transplanted mice. Scale bar: 20 µm. d) Immunostaining of αSMA (green)/human SM1 (blue) with nuclear staining (red) in human VPC-derived EC+MC-transplanted mice at day 14. Scale bar: 20 µm.</p>
