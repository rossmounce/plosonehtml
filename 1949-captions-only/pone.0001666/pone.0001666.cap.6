                Figure 6.  Immunohistochemical analysis of human VPC-derived vascular cells-transplanted murine hindlimb tissues.a) Representative fluorescent photographs of ischemic hindlimb stained for human (red) and mouse (green) CD31 at day 42. Overlapped-stained capillaries are shown in arrowhead. Scale bar: 100 µm. b) Quantitative analysis of the endothelial cell marker positive capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs at day 42. c) Representative αSMA immunostaining (brown) of ischemic hindlimbs at day 42. Scale bar. 100 µm. d) Quantitative analysis of αSMA positive capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs at day 42. e) Quantitative analysis of αSMA positive arterioles (black arrowhead) at day 42. *P&lt;0.05 vs. control, †P&lt;0.05 vs. pEPC, ††P&lt;0.05 vs. uEPC, ‡P&lt;0.05 vs. MC, §P&lt;0.05 vs. EC.
