Node A is duplicated to generate node A′. Each of the links to node A′ is removed with a uniform probability <em>α</em> (left). Note that this method is based on completely asymmetric divergence <a href="#pone.0001667-Ispolatov3">[44]</a>, in which only one (A′) of the duplicated nodes is the target of removal of links. An HD link between node A and node A′ is attached with a uniform probability <em>β</em> (middle). (B) Evolutionary distance. When a node is duplicated, the evolutionary distance between each of the duplicated nodes and each of the other nodes in a network is assumed to increase by one due to mutations occurring in the duplicated nodes during the divergence process. Suppose that the evolutionary distance between node A and node B is <em>d</em> (left). After the duplication of node A to generate node A′ and the divergence of them, the evolutionary distance between nodes A and B, and that between nodes A′ and B become <em>d</em>+1 whether a link between nodes A and B and that between A′ and B are present or not (middle). (A dashed line indicates absence of a link.) The evolutionary distance between nodes A and A′ is defined to be 1 regardless of the presence of a link between them. After that, if node A′ is duplicated to create node A”, the evolutionary distance between nodes A and B continues to be <em>d</em>+1, while the evolutionary distances between nodes A and A′, A and A″, B and A′, and B and A″ become 2, 2, <em>d</em>+2, and <em>d</em>+2, respectively (right). (C) NHD model. In this model, the probability that a link is added between A and A′ is proportional to the number (<em>n</em><sub>N</sub>) of common neighbors shared by these nodes.</p>
