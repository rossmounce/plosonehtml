                Figure 1.  Simulation.(A) HD model. Node A is duplicated to generate node A′. Each of the links to node A′ is removed with a uniform probability α (left). Note that this method is based on completely asymmetric divergence [44], in which only one (A′) of the duplicated nodes is the target of removal of links. An HD link between node A and node A′ is attached with a uniform probability β (middle). (B) Evolutionary distance. When a node is duplicated, the evolutionary distance between each of the duplicated nodes and each of the other nodes in a network is assumed to increase by one due to mutations occurring in the duplicated nodes during the divergence process. Suppose that the evolutionary distance between node A and node B is d (left). After the duplication of node A to generate node A′ and the divergence of them, the evolutionary distance between nodes A and B, and that between nodes A′ and B become d+1 whether a link between nodes A and B and that between A′ and B are present or not (middle). (A dashed line indicates absence of a link.) The evolutionary distance between nodes A and A′ is defined to be 1 regardless of the presence of a link between them. After that, if node A′ is duplicated to create node A”, the evolutionary distance between nodes A and B continues to be d+1, while the evolutionary distances between nodes A and A′, A and A″, B and A′, and B and A″ become 2, 2, d+2, and d+2, respectively (right). (C) NHD model. In this model, the probability that a link is added between A and A′ is proportional to the number (nN) of common neighbors shared by these nodes.
