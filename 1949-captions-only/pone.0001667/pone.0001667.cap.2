                Figure 2.  Properties in the networks by the HD and NHD models.Black squares, red diamonds, and green crosses show the values for the yeast PIN, the network generated by the NHD model, and the network by the HD model, respectively. The results for the HD and NHD models were obtained by taking the average among 100 networks generated by simulations. (A) Degree distribution P(k). The dashed line represents (k0+k)−γe−k/kc with γ = 2.7, k0 = 3.4, and kc = 50. (B) Distribution of the average cluster coefficient &lt;C(k)&gt;. Dashed lines in red and green indicate k−0.68 and k−0.90, respectively. (C) Distribution of &lt;Knn(k)&gt; indicating a disassortative structure. Dashed lines in black, red, and green represent k−0.47, k−0.18, and k−0.14, respectively. (D) Distribution of PT(nT), the probability that a given link is contained in nT triangles.
