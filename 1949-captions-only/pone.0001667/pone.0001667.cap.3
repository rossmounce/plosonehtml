                Figure 3.  HD links in the yeast PIN and in the networks by simulations.Black squares, red diamonds, and green crosses show the values for the yeast PIN, the network generated by the NHD model, and the network by the HD model, respectively. (A) Distribution of PHD(nN), the probability that an HD link exists between two homologous proteins when they share nN common neighbors (for dT = 3). The slopes of the dashed lines are 0.028 (red) and 0 (green). The result for dT = 4 is nearly identical to this result (data not shown). (B) Distribution of &lt;kHP(nN)&gt;, the average degree of proteins that are connected by HD links and share nN common neighbors with their homologous proteins. The dashed line is a regression line (r = 0.73).
