(A) Distribution of <em>P</em><sub>HD</sub>(<em>n</em><sub>N</sub>), the probability that an HD link exists between two homologous proteins when they share <em>n</em><sub>N</sub> common neighbors (for <em>d</em><sub>T</sub> = 3). The slopes of the dashed lines are 0.028 (red) and 0 (green). The result for <em>d</em><sub>T</sub> = 4 is nearly identical to this result (data not shown). (B) Distribution of &lt;<em>k</em><sub>HP</sub>(<em>n</em><sub>N</sub>)&gt;, the average degree of proteins that are connected by HD links and share <em>n</em><sub>N</sub> common neighbors with their homologous proteins. The dashed line is a regression line (<em>r</em> = 0.73).</p>
