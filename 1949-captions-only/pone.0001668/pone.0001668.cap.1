                Figure 1.  Principal component analysis (PCA) in inbred mice fed control (CHD) or high fat diet (HFD).PCA was carried out with classical physiological data (glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, BW, BMI and adiposity indices) collected in eight week old mice fat fed for three weeks and controls. Prior to PCA, phenotypic variables were mean centered and reduced to a variance of 1. Phenotypes contributing to separation between models are described in Figure S1.
