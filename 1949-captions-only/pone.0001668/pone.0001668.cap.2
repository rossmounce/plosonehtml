                Figure 2.  Effects of high fat diet (HFD) on plasma lipids in inbred mouse strains.The effects of fat feeding on total cholesterol (T-C) (A), HDL-C (B), LDL-C (C) and triacylglycerol (D) are shown. Values are expressed as meansÂ±SEM. Data were obtained from over 8 mice of each group. Differences between groups were assessed by Fisher's LSD and Tamhane's T2 post hoc tests. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, significantly different to CHD fed mice of the same strain.
