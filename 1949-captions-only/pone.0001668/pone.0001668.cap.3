                Figure 3.  Glucose tolerance (A) and glucose induced insulin secretion in vivo (B) in inbred mouse strains.Data are derived from 8 week old mice fed CHD or HFD for three weeks. Data shown are meanÂ±SEM (n = 9 to 86 mice per group). Differences between groups were assessed by Fisher's LSD and Tamhane's T2 post hoc tests. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, significantly different to CHD fed mice of the same strain.
