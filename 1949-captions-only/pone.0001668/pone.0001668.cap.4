Effects of high fat diet (HFD) on cumulative glycemia (A) and insulinemia (B) in mice.Values of cumulative glycemia (CumG) and insulinemia (CumIRI) are expressed as meansÂ±SEM. Data are derived from 15 to 40 mice per group. Differences between groups were assessed by Fisher's LSD and Tamhane's T2 post hoc tests. ***p&lt;0.001, significantly different to CHD fed mice of the same strain.
