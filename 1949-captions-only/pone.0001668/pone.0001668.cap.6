                Figure 6.  1H NMR metabonomics derived metabotypes supporting classification of 5 inbred mouse strains.O-PLS-DA model coefficients were used for differential analysis between diets and strains in C3H (a), Dba2 (b), BALB/c (c), 129S6 (d) and C57Bl/6 (e). Global clustering analysis (f) uses a scale which corresponds to the Euclidean distance between strains and depends on the dynamic range of the variables.
