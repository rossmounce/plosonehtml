                Figure 7.  Genetic and functional relationships between inbred mouse strains.Phylogenetic relationships between the five strains used in the study (a) derive from published data of over 10,000 SNP [27] available at http://gscan.well.ox.ac.uk/gs/strains.cgâ€‹i. 1H NMR metabonomic data were used for clustering analysis of inbred strains fed carbohydrate diet (CHD) (b) or high fat diet (HFD) (c). The scale corresponds to the Euclidean distance between strains used to grow the clustering tree, which is dependent of the dynamic range of the variables.
