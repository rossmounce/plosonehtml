Control = secondary antibody only (solid lines). “gH+gL ORF” used the full-length genomic ORF47; “gH+gL” used the RACE-mapped gL, which starts at the 5th in-frame ORF47 AUG codon <a href="#pone.0001669-ShannonLowe1">[9]</a>; “gH+gL-GPI” used a GPI-linked form of the RACE-mapped gL. In each case, gH was expressed from the full-length genomic ORF22. nil = untransfected. B. 293T cells were transfected with diferent gH expression plasmids or left untransfected (nil), and 48h later analyzed for gH expression with mAb 8C1 (short dashes, white arrow) and for gH/gL expresion with mAb 7E5 (long dashes, grey arrow), as in A. Solid lines/black arrow = secondary antibody only. gHL-GPI and gHL-Fc are the same fusion protein with either a C-terminal GPI anchor or human IgG<sub>1</sub>-Fc. Each histogram shows 10,000 cells. Both gH-specific and gH/gL-specific staining was significantly increased after gHL-Fc transfection compared with controls (p&lt;0.00001 by Student's t test). Equivalent results were obtained in a repeat experiment.</p>
