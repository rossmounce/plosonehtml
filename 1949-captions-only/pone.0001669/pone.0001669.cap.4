Gp70-SCR12-Fc (dashed lines) = SCR domains 1+2 of gp70. gHL-Fc (solid lines)  = gH fused to C-terminal gL. Each Fc fusion protein was preincubated or not with mAbs as indicated and then used to stain BHK-21 cells. The filled histogram (nil) shows secondary antibody only staining. Similar data were obtained in 2 repeat experiments. B. Further gH-specific mAbs (see main text) were tested for their capacity to block gHL-Fc binding to BHK-21 cells.</p>
