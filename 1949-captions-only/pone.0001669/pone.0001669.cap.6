EGFP-expressing wild-type or gp150 knockout virions were incubated with mAbs as shown, then used to infect GAG<sup>+</sup> and GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells. Infection was assayed 18h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression, counting the %eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in a gate where uninfected cells (no virus) were &lt;0.2% eGFP<sup>+</sup>. A log scale is used to encompass the large differences in infection between gp150<sup>+</sup> and gp150<sup>−</sup> viruses and between GAG<sup>+</sup> and GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells. Each point represents 10,000 cells. Equivalent data were obtained in a repeat experiment. B. gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> versions of the same viruses, which have eGFP<sup>+</sup> virions, were incubated with GAG<sup>+</sup> and GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells (2h, 37°C) to allow binding/endocytosis. The cells were then washed x3 in PBS and assayed for eGFP uptake by flow cytometry. Each point represents 3,000 cells. Equivalent data were obtained in a repeat experiment. We compared viruses and cell types by taking the reduction in infectivity for each point of each of the 2 experiments (total n = 6). We then compared the reductions using Student's t test. This showed that mAb 230-4A2 and the double antibody treatment both neutralized wild-type MuHV-4 significantly better than the gp150 knockout, and that neutralization of the wild-type was significantly better with GAG<sup>+</sup> CHO cells than with GAG<sup>− </sup>(p&lt;0.01).</p>
