EGFP-expressing wild-type or gp150<sup>−</sup> virions were incubated with different heparin concentrations, then used to infect GAG<sup>+</sup> and GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells. Infection was assayed 18h later by flow cytometry of viral eGFP expression, counting the %eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in a gate where uninfected cells (no virus) were &lt;0.2% eGFP<sup>+</sup>. Each point represents 10,000 cells. The bars show infection levels without heparin. nil = no virus. Equivalent data were obtained in a repeat experiment. B. gM-eGFP<sup>+</sup> versions of the same viruses were incubated with GAG<sup>+</sup> and GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells, with or without added heparin (2h, 37°C), then washed x3 in PBS and assayed for eGFP uptake by flow cytometry. Again, the bars show eGFP uptake without heparin, and nil = no virus. Equivalent data were obtained in a repeat experiment. The minor increases in gp150<sup>−</sup> binding to and infection of GAG<sup>−</sup> CHO cells at low heparin dose were quite variable between experiments; the reductions, particularly in wild-type MuHV-4 infection of and binding to GAG<sup>+</sup> CHO cells, were not.</p>
