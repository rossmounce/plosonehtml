                Figure 1.  FOXO1a knockdown in human HepG2/C3A liver cells.A. FOXO1a Western blots are shown for one of the three siRNA biological replicates, indicating that the level of the FOXO1a protein is dramatically reduced. B. Zoom into a picture of a cDNA microarray co-hybridization of RNA from one biological replicate of cells treated with FOXO1a siRNA (Cy3 - green) and RNA from untreated cells (Cy5 - red). The circle marks the cDNA probe for FOXO1a. As can be seen, FOXO1a mRNA levels are reduced following the knockdown. We note that this microarray result was validated by using quantitative RT-PCR. C. A volcano plot for results of the comparison of gene expression profiles following FOXO1a knockdown to the control siRNA treatment. The eight confirmed direct transcriptional target of FOXO1a are indicated by arrows. In the plot, all P-values smaller than 10−9 are plotted as P = 10−10 (P-values ranged from 1 to 10−43).
