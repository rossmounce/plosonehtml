B. Zoom into a picture of a cDNA microarray co-hybridization of RNA from one biological replicate of cells treated with <em>FOXO1a</em> siRNA (Cy3 - green) and RNA from untreated cells (Cy5 - red). The circle marks the cDNA probe for <em>FOXO1a</em>. As can be seen, <em>FOXO1a</em> mRNA levels are reduced following the knockdown. We note that this microarray result was validated by using quantitative RT-PCR. C. A volcano plot for results of the comparison of gene expression profiles following <em>FOXO1a</em> knockdown to the control siRNA treatment. The eight confirmed direct transcriptional target of <em>FOXO1a</em> are indicated by arrows. In the plot, all <em>P</em>-values smaller than 10<sup>−9</sup> are plotted as <em>P</em> = 10<sup>−10</sup> (<em>P</em>-values ranged from 1 to 10<sup>−43</sup>).</p>
