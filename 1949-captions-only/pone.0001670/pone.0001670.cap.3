                Figure 3.  Quantitative RT-PCR results.Mean fold differences (y-axis) and standard errors for six biological replicates (different individuals) are given for either the human (dark bars) or chimpanzee (clear bars) liver RNA samples. For each gene (x-axis), results were standardized based on the species with the lower expression level (set to 1). Stars indicate gene that are differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee at either P&lt;0.1 (*) or P&lt;0.05 (**) (see text).
