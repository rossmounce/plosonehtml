System 1 is composed of an autoinducer, HAI-1 (triangles) and its cognate sensor, LuxN. System 2 is composed of autoinducer-2 (pentagons) and the sensor, LuxPQ. System 3 is composed of an intragenera signal, CAI-1 and its cognate sensor, CqsS. At low cell densities, autoinducer signals and phosphate (P) flow act in a negative manner to repress autoinducer genes, and at high cell densities the phosphate flow is reversed and signals act in a positive manner to activate some of the quorum-dependent genes e.g. luciferase.
