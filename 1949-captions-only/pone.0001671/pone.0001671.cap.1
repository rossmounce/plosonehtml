                Figure 1.  The overall structure of the Vh quorum sensing circuit showing quorum genes mutated in this work.Vh has three quorum sensing systems that regulate the genes specifying biofilm formation, a type III secretion system, a secreted metalloprotease, bioluminescence (luxCDABE) and other quorum sensing activated- and repressed-genes. System 1 is composed of an autoinducer, HAI-1 (triangles) and its cognate sensor, LuxN. System 2 is composed of autoinducer-2 (pentagons) and the sensor, LuxPQ. System 3 is composed of an intragenera signal, CAI-1 and its cognate sensor, CqsS. At low cell densities, autoinducer signals and phosphate (P) flow act in a negative manner to repress autoinducer genes, and at high cell densities the phosphate flow is reversed and signals act in a positive manner to activate some of the quorum-dependent genes e.g. luciferase.
