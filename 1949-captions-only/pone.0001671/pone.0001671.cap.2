                Figure 2.  Bioluminescence-growth relationships for the Vh strains that served as wild type references for comparison with mutants in quorum sensing and bioluminescence.The isogenic, wild type Vh strains, (A) BB120, growth rate (□) and RLU or relative light units expressed as counts per second/OD (v) and (B) BB866 (WT::Tn5) in the absence (growth rate (□) and relative light units, (v)) and presence of the antibiotic, kanamycin (growth rate, ⋄ and Relative Light Units, ⧫).
