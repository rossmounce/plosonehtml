                Figure 3.  (A) Bioluminescence-growth relationships of wild type Vh (BB866, WT::Tn5, ○) and a BB151120 (luxCDABE::Tn5) mutant inactivated for all bioluminescence-associated genes.Vh strains were grown in the presence of antibiotics (see Materials and Methods). (B) The BB151120 mutant was further analyzed under different conditions.(▵) line 1, chromosomal mutation; (▿) line 2, strain carrying pLAFR2 vector control and (▴) line 3, strain carrying pLAFR2 with the cloned luxCDABE genes.
