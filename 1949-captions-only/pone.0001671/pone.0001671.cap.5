                Figure 5.  The influence of inoculation dilution and cell-free culture fluids from Vp cultures on Vp growth rates.Cultures were grown in pre-warmed MB at 37 °C. Representative graphs: (A) UM4552 culture was diluted and growth curves are starting at different cell densities. The dilutions are: (▪) 1:10, (•) 1:102, (▴) 1:103, (♦) 1:104, (▾) 1:105 and (Open Square with Diagonal Line Running from Upper right corner to Lower left corner) 1:106. (B) UM4552 culture was diluted and growth curves are starting at different cell densities. The dilutions are the same as in panel A. The table shows the corresponding growth rates for each of the dilutions.
