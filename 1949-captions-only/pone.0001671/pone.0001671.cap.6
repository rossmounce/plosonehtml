                Figure 6.  (A) Cell-free culture fluid from Vibrio parahaemolyticus influenced the growth rates of Vibrio harveyi.In these experiments, Vh BB120 served as the wild-type reference strain. BB120, WT in MB (○); BB120, WT in 10% Vp UM4552 cell-free culture fluids (•) (B) Vh bioluminescence phenotypes in the absence (white bars) and presence (gray bars) of Vp cell-free culture fluids. Strain designations are: BB120 (WT); BB170 (luxN); BB886 (luxPQ); JMH598 (cqsS) and JMH628 (luxN, luxPQ, cqsS). The accompanying table shows growth rates for each Vh strain in the absence and presence of 10% Vp (UM4552) cell-free culture fluids.
