Nodes denote threshold functions (1), representing the switching behavior of regulatory proteins. Thresholds for the specific nodes are chosen as described in the text. Arrows represent interactions between proteins as defined in the interaction matrix <em>a<sub>ij</sub></em> of the model (with <em>a<sub>ij</sub> = +1</em> for green/solid arrows and <em>a<sub>ij</sub> = âˆ’1</em> for red/dashed arrows).</p>
