                Figure 2.  Network state space.State space of the 1024 possible network states (green circles) and their dynamical trajectories, all converging towards fixed point attractors. Each circle corresponds to one specific network state with each of the ten proteins being in one specific activation state (active/inactive). The largest attractor tree corresponds to all network states flowing to the G1 fixed point (blue node). Arrows between the network states indicate the direction of the dynamical flow from one network state to its subsequent state. The fission yeast cell-cycle sequence is shown with blue arrows.
