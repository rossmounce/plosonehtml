                Figure 3.  Budding yeast model.Budding yeast cell cycle network model [13] for comparison with our model of fission yeast. This network relies on transcriptional regulation more than the fission yeast network. Note that some homologues corresponding to the latter do not have to be included here. Note also the difference in circuitry.
