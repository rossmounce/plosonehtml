Micrographs show trachea and lung tissue sections stained for the presence of the LacZ marker (blue; frozen sections). A. Mock-infected 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse. LacZ expression is observed in individual bronchial (arrow) and alveolar (arrowheads) epithelial cells. C: bronchial cartilage. Bar = 40 µm. B. 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse, day 1 post infection. A large patch of tracheal epithelial cells exhibit LacZ staining (arrows). Bar = 20 µm. C. 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse, day 1 post infection. Several alveoli exhibit LacZ staining of all epithelial cells (arrows), in others only occasional cells, often with the morphology of type II alveolar epithelial cells (arrowhead) are positive. Bar = 40 µm. D. 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse, day 1 post infection. Higher magnification of Panel C, showing staining for LacZ in numerous alveolar epithelial cells. A positive syncytial cell is also seen (arrow). Bar = 10 µm.</p>
