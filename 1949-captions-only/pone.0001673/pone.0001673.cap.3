                Figure 3.  Immunohistological detection of SP expression in respiratory tissue.Groups of 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mice (Panels A-E) and BALB/c mice (Panels F-H) were infected with MHV-68 or mock-infected and euthanized at various time-points post-infection. Micrographs show airway and lung tissue sections stained for the presence of SP (brown; frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue sections, peroxidase anti-peroxidase method, anti-SP, Papanicolaou's haematoxylin counterstain). A, B. Mock-infected 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse. SP expression is seen as very weak cytoplasmic staining of occasional bronchial epithelial cells (arrow) or alveolar epithelial cells (arrowheads). Bars = 20 µm. C, D. 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse, day 1 post infection. Numerous alveolar epithelial cells stain positive for SP (arrows); some of these can be identified as type II pneumocytes (arrowheads). C: PFA-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded tissue section, D: Frozen section. Bars = 20 µm. E. 143-YAChPPT-ALacZ mouse, day 1 post infection. No reaction is seen in the negative control section, where the primary antibody was replaced by tris-buffered saline. Bar = 20 µm. F. Mock-infected BALB/c mouse. SP expression is seen as cytoplasmic staining of occasional alveolar epithelial cells (arrowheads). Bar = 20 µm. G. BALB/c mouse, day 2 post infection. Numerous bronchial respiratory epithelial cells exhibit moderate to intense staining for SP (arrows). Bar = 20 µm. H. BALB/c mouse, day 1 post infection. Numerous alveolar epithelial cells stain positive for SP; many of these can be identified as type II pneumocytes (arrowheads). Bar = 20 µm.
