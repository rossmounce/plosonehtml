                Figure 4.  Immunohistological detection of MHV-68 antigen in respiratory tissue.Groups of BALB/c mice were infected with MHV-68 and euthanized at various time-points post-infection. Micrographs show airway and lung tissue sections stained for the presence of MHV-68 antigen ((brown; paraffin-embedded tissue sections, peroxidase anti-peroxidase method, anti-MHV-68, Papanicolaou's haematoxylin counterstain). A. BALB/c mouse, day 3 post infection. MHV-68 antigen is expressed by an individual type II alveolar epithelial cells (arrow). Bar = 20 µm. B. BALB/c mouse, day 7 post infection. MHV-68 antigen is expressed by several individual and small groups of alveolar epithelial cells (arrows). Bar = 20 µm. C. BALB/c mouse, day 7 post infection. No reaction is seen in the negative control section, where the primary antibody was replaced by tris-buffered saline. Bar = 20 µm.
