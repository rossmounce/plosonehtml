Treatment had a significant effect on cell-mediated immune function (ANOVA, <em>F</em><sub>2, 32</sub> = 12.16, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001). Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests showed that the immune function of males in both chemically dosed groups (E2 or mixture) was significantly lower than that of the control males (E2 versus control <em>P</em>&lt;0.001, mixture versus control <em>P</em> = 0.001) but there was no significant difference between males in the E2 and mixture groups (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05). (b) The secondary humoral response following an intraperitoneal injection of sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Treatment had a significant effect on the secondary humoral response to SRBC (ANOVA, <em>F</em><sub>2, 32</sub> = 10.98, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001). Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests showed that the mean response of the males in both dosed groups (E2 or mixture), was significantly lower than the mean of the control males (E2 versus control <em>P</em>&lt;0.001, mixture versus control <em>P</em> = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the E2 treated and the mixture treated males (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05). Graphs show means+s.e.m. ** indicates <em>P</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
