                Figure 1.  Immune function in male starlings exposed to chemicals.The immune function of male starlings in three treatment groups; control (open bars); E2 dosed (hatched bars); and the chemical mixture dosed (black bars) (a) Cell-mediated immune function was measured as wing web swelling of both wings, 24 hours after injection with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Treatment had a significant effect on cell-mediated immune function (ANOVA, F2, 32 = 12.16, P&lt;0.001). Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests showed that the immune function of males in both chemically dosed groups (E2 or mixture) was significantly lower than that of the control males (E2 versus control P&lt;0.001, mixture versus control P = 0.001) but there was no significant difference between males in the E2 and mixture groups (P&gt;0.05). (b) The secondary humoral response following an intraperitoneal injection of sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Treatment had a significant effect on the secondary humoral response to SRBC (ANOVA, F2, 32 = 10.98, P&lt;0.001). Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests showed that the mean response of the males in both dosed groups (E2 or mixture), was significantly lower than the mean of the control males (E2 versus control P&lt;0.001, mixture versus control P = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the E2 treated and the mixture treated males (P&gt;0.05). Graphs show means+s.e.m. ** indicates P&lt;0.001.
