(b) Number of song bouts per hour. (c) Song bout duration (s) d) Repertoire size. Graphs show means+s.e.m. There was a significant effect of the experimental manipulation on the time spent singing between the treatment groups (ANOVA, <em>F<sub>2, 24</sub></em> = 6.15, <em>P</em> = 0.007). Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests showed that the males that received the mixture of chemicals spent significantly longer singing than the control males (<em>P</em> = 0.009) and the E2 group (<em>P</em> = 0.028). There was a significant effect of treatment on the number of song bouts sung by the males (ANOVA, <em>F<sub>2, 23</sub></em> = 9.16, <em>P</em> = 0.001). Males in the mixture treatment group sang more song bouts than the control males (<em>P</em> = 0.004) and the E2 males (<em>P</em> = 0.002). Mean song bout duration was significantly longer for males in the mixture treatment group compared to the control males (ANOVA, <em>F<sub>1, 11</sub></em> = 5.842, <em>P</em> = 0.034). Finally, there was a significant effect of the experimental manipulation on the repertoire size of male starlings (ANOVA <em>F<sub>2, 16</sub></em> = 4.39, <em>P</em> = 0.030). The males in the mixture group had significantly greater repertoire size than males in the control group (Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests <em>P</em> = 0.042). * = <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; ** = <em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
