HVC volume of the males in the mixture group was significantly larger than in males in the control group (Bonferroni pairwise comparison post-hoc tests <em>P</em> = 0.032), but there were no significant differences in the HVC volume between males in the E2 and control groups (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05) or between males in the E2 and mixture groups (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05) * = <em>P</em>&lt;0.05. b) Photomicrograph of an HVC from (i) a chemical mixture treated male and (ii) a control male. Arrows indicate the borders of HVC. Scale bar = 200 Âµm.</p>
