Playback from the mixture group was preferred over playback from E2 dosed males (<em>t</em><sub>10</sub> = 2.42, <em>P</em> = 0.035); Playback from the mixture group was preferred over song from control males (<em>t</em><sub>9</sub> = 2.57, <em>P</em> = 0.029). There was no significant preference between control and E2 dosed playback (<em>P</em>&gt;0.05); Graphs show mean+s.e.m. * = <em>P</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
