                Figure 4.  Song preferences in female starlings.The percentage of time spent by females on the perch adjacent to song playback from male starlings in the three treatment groups; control (open bars); E2 dosed (hatched bars); and chemical mixture dosed (black bars). Playback from the mixture group was preferred over playback from E2 dosed males (t10 = 2.42, P = 0.035); Playback from the mixture group was preferred over song from control males (t9 = 2.57, P = 0.029). There was no significant preference between control and E2 dosed playback (P&gt;0.05); Graphs show mean+s.e.m. * = P&lt;0.05.
