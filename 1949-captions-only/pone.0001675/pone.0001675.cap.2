Right display: reaction times. Results from schematic line drawings (Set A) are represented by gray bars. Results from colored, more detailed images (Set B) are represented by white bars. Note, that the accuracy benefit from the additional information contained in stimuli from Set B is much more pronounced for delayed responses. Note also, that reaction times in the speeded task refer to stimulus onset, while in the delayed task reaction times refer to the onset of the response screen which appeared 1000 ms after stimulus onset.</p>
