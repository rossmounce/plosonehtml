Stimulus onset is at 0 ms. Time courses have been normalized by subtracting the average potential from the last 200 ms before stimulus onset. Right: topographic map of averaged activity from all conditions between 250 and 400 ms after stimulus onset. Data from both stimulus sets have been averaged in this figure. Note, that the clear late negative deflection is observed for object stimuli only. The asterisk indicates a significant difference that is described in the text.</p>
