                Figure 2.  Formation of ThT-binding structures when apo SOD1 mutants and WT are incubated at 37°C.Fluorescence due to ThT binding to SOD1 mutants (presented as arbitrary units, A.U.) for apo T54R SOD1 (•); apo L67V SOD1 (Δ), apo D90A SOD1 (∇), apo I113F SOD1 (□), apo V87M SOD1 (▾), apo WT SOD1 (O), apo L144F SOD1 (▪), apo I35T SOD1 (▴), apo V97M SOD1 (▴), apo G93A SOD1 (◊), apo I113T SOD1 (♦), during the incubation of the samples at 37°C. Apo G93D SOD1 mutant is not reported because the oligomeric species formed precipitates after about 30 hours of incubation.
