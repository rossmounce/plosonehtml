                Figure 3.  Formation of oligomeric structures when apo I113T SOD1 mutant is incubated at 37°C.(A) Fluorescence due to ThT binding to SOD1 mutants (presented as arbitrary units, A.U.) for apo I113T SOD1 during the incubation of the samples at 37°C. Panels (B) and ( C ) shows the size exclusion chromatograms on a G2000SWXL and a G4000SWXL Tosoh columns respectively, corresponding to the samples analyzed by light scattering. The void volume is labeled V0. (D) Variation in species distribution during incubation of apo I113T SOD1. Each curve shows the molecular weight distribution detected by light scattering for the sample after different incubation times at 37°C. In all four panels the samples can be identified according to the following colors: before incubation (—), after 16 hours (—), 40 hours (—), 62 hours (—), 4 days (—) and 6 months (—) of incubation at 37°C.
