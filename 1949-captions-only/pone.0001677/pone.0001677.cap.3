Panels (B) and ( C ) shows the size exclusion chromatograms on a G2000SW<sub>XL</sub> and a G4000SW<sub>XL </sub>Tosoh columns respectively, corresponding to the samples analyzed by light scattering. The void volume is labeled V<sub>0</sub>. (D) Variation in species distribution during incubation of apo I113T SOD1. Each curve shows the molecular weight distribution detected by light scattering for the sample after different incubation times at 37°C. In all four panels the samples can be identified according to the following colors: before incubation (—), after 16 hours (—), 40 hours (—), 62 hours (—), 4 days (—) and 6 months (—) of incubation at 37°C.</p>
