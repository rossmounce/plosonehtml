Panels (B) and ( C ) shows the size exclusion chromatograms on a G2000SW<sub>XL</sub> and a G4000SW<sub>XL </sub>Tosoh columns respectively, corresponding to the samples analyzed by light scattering. The void volume is labeled V<sub>0</sub>. In all four panels the samples can be identified according to the following colors: before incubation (—), after 66 hours (—), 4.8 days (—), 6.8 days (—),7.5 days (—), and 13 months (—) of incubation at 37°C. In panel (B) the zinc reconstituted sample (—) is also reported.</p>
