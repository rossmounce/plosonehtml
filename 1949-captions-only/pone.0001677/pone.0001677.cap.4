                Figure 4.  Formation of oligomeric structures when apo T54R SOD1 mutant is incubated at 37°C.(A) Fluorescence due to ThT binding to SOD1 mutants (presented as arbitrary units, A.U.) for apo T54R SOD1 during the incubation of the samples at 37°C. Panels (B) and ( C ) shows the size exclusion chromatograms on a G2000SWXL and a G4000SWXL Tosoh columns respectively, corresponding to the samples analyzed by light scattering. The void volume is labeled V0. In all four panels the samples can be identified according to the following colors: before incubation (—), after 66 hours (—), 4.8 days (—), 6.8 days (—),7.5 days (—), and 13 months (—) of incubation at 37°C. In panel (B) the zinc reconstituted sample (—) is also reported.
