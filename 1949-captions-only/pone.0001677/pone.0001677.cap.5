                Figure 5.  Correlation between percentage of aggregated species and ThT-binding fluorescence.Percentage of aggregated species (non-dimer), determined by light scattering measurements, vs ThT-binding fluorescence for apo WT SOD1 (O) and apo I113T SOD1 (♦) during the incubation of the samples at 37°C. Error bars are derived from the molecular mass errors of the light scattering experiments.
