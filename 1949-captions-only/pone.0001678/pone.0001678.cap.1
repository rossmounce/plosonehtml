                Figure 1.  Production of MHC-I heavy chains.Clones of Escherichia coli were selected for high expression of HLA-A*0201-HAT-BSP HC and BirA enzyme and the HLA-A*0201-HAT-BSP product was tested for biotinylation efficiency. In A) Samples of the clone were withdrawn before and after IPTG induction and analyzed on reducing SDS-PAGE. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µL MgCl2/SDS lysis buffer to solubilize heavy-chain inclusion bodies. After centrifugation at 20,000 g for 2 min, 15 µL of the supernatant was loaded directly on the gel. Lane 1, protein marker; lane 2, before induction; and lane 3 after induction with IPTG. Positions of HC monomer and BirA are shown with arrows. In B) HLA-A*0201-HAT-BSP was tested for biotinylation efficiency by a streptavidin gel-shift assay. Purified in vivo biotinylated HLA-A*0201-HAT-BSP incubated for 20 min with either no SA, equal amount of SA, or SA in 2-fold excess. The samples were diluted in 2×Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. For the purpose of quantitative densitometric analysis the HC sample without SA was applied to the SDS-PAGE in 3 different amounts (undiluted, 5-fold, and 25-fold diluted). The percentage of biotinylated HC was determined from the ratio of density of the monomer HC band in the sample with excess SA compared to the band in the diluted sample without SA.
