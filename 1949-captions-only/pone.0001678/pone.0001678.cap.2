The HLA-A*0201 peptide binding affinities of a panel of pox peptides ranging from god binders (0–10 nM) over intermediary (10–100 nM) to non-binders (&gt;1 µM) were determined in a quantitative ELISA <a href="#pone.0001678-SylvesterHvid1">[14]</a>. The HC were folded with various concentrations of peptide and excess of hβ<sub>2</sub>m. The K<sub>D</sub> values for each peptide MHC combination were calculated and the results presented as means of two independent experiments with the corresponding confidence intervals.</p>
