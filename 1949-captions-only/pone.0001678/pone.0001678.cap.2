                Figure 2.  Peptide binding affinity of biotinylated HLA-A*0201 versus non-biotinylated.The peptide binding affinities of the biotinylated HLA-A*0201-HAT-BSP was compared to the standard truncated HLA-A*0201 molecule. The HLA-A*0201 peptide binding affinities of a panel of pox peptides ranging from god binders (0–10 nM) over intermediary (10–100 nM) to non-binders (&gt;1 µM) were determined in a quantitative ELISA [14]. The HC were folded with various concentrations of peptide and excess of hβ2m. The KD values for each peptide MHC combination were calculated and the results presented as means of two independent experiments with the corresponding confidence intervals.
