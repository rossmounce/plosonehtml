These complexes were reacted with SA at various different molar ratios in order to produce MHC-I tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers. The various SA-MHC-I complexes were run on a calibrated SEC column. The eluate fraction of the SA-MHC-I complexes was determined through radioactivity measurements. (A) Size exclusion chromatogram of 6 different stoichiometric mixtures of SA to HLA-A*0201-peptide complex. In (B) is listed the calculated MW's corresponding of the individual peaks of the chromatogram.</p>
