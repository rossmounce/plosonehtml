                Figure 4.  Tetramer staining comparison to pentamer.PBMC from a healthy donor were stimulated for 8 day with the pp65495–503 peptide and stained with APC labeled anti-CD8 and PE-labeled HLA-A*0201-pp65495–503 tetramer (right panel) or with PE-labeled HLA-A*0201-pp65495–503 pentamer (left panel). The dot plot shows the gated CD8 T cells. Numbers in the upper right quadrant of each plot are the percentage of epitope specific CD8 T cells. The fluorescence intensity (FI) of the staining of the positive and negative population is given in the upper and lower right quadrant, respectively.
