                Figure 5.  Titration of complex concentration for tetramer production.Three different concentrations of HLA-A*0201-pp65495–503 complexes were folded (50, 100, and 200 nM) and tetramers were produced from these. PBMC from a CMV pp65495–503 responsive donor (3.5% specific CD8 T cells) were stained with a titration of each of the three tetramer productions. The x-axis is the actual calculated concentration of tetramers in the cell staining reaction. The results are depicted as the relative fluorescence intensity (FI signal of the positive population/FI signal of the negative population).
