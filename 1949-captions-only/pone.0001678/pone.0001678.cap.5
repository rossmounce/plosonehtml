PBMC from a CMV pp65<sub>495–503</sub> responsive donor (3.5% specific CD8 T cells) were stained with a titration of each of the three tetramer productions. The x-axis is the actual calculated concentration of tetramers in the cell staining reaction. The results are depicted as the relative fluorescence intensity (FI signal of the positive population/FI signal of the negative population).</p>
