                Figure 6.  Unreacted monomers do not inhibit tetramer staining.PBMC from a healthy donor was re-stimulated for 8 day with the CMV pp65495–503 peptide. They were washed and adjusted to a final concentration of 2.5 million cells/ml containing the indicated concentration of CMV pp65495–503/HLA-A*0201 monomer. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, a final concentration of 5 nM CMV pp65495–503/HLA-A*0201 tetramer was added. The cells were further stained for CD8 and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods.
