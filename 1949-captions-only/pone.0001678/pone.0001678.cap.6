They were washed and adjusted to a final concentration of 2.5 million cells/ml containing the indicated concentration of CMV pp65<sub>495–503</sub>/HLA-A*0201 monomer. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, a final concentration of 5 nM CMV pp65<sub>495–503</sub>/HLA-A*0201 tetramer was added. The cells were further stained for CD8 and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in <a href="#s3">materials and methods</a>.</p>
