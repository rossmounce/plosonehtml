                Figure 7.  HLA-A*0201-tetramer screening of EBV reactive donors.PBMC from four healthy donors were each re-stimulated for 8 day with three different EBV peptides, LMP1125–133, LMP2356–364, or LMP2416–424, and stained with both HLA-A*0201-LMP1125–133 (top panel, HLA-A*0201-LMP2356–364 (middle panel) and HLA-A*0201-LMP2416–424 tetramers (bottom panel). The dot plot shows gated CD8 T cells and the percentage of tetramer labeled CD8 T cells are given in the upper right quadrant of each plot.
