                Figure 9.  Double staining with tetramer and IC-IFNγ.Τhree donors responding to either HLA-A*0101 restricted pp65363–373, HLA-A*0201 restricted pp65495–503, or HLA-B*4401 restricted EBV EBNA3b657–666, were restimulated with the respective peptides for 3 h in the presence of Brefeldin A. The cells were stained with the relevant tetramers, HLA-A*0101-pp65363–373, HLA-A*0201-pp65495–503, or HLA-B*4401-EBNA3b657–666, prior to the staining for CD8 and intracellular IC-IFNγ. The dot plot shows the gated CD8 T cells.
