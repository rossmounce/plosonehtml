Cro66 indicates the fluorophore. (B) Chemical structures of proline and the two proline analogs, (2<em>S</em>,4<em>S</em>)-4-fluoroproline ((4<em>S</em>)-FPro), and (2<em>S</em>,4<em>R</em>)-4-fluoroproline ((4<em>R</em>)-FPro). (C) Expression profile of EGFP and its 4-FPro variants in <em>E. coli</em>. EGFP and (4<em>S</em>)-FPro-EGFP are predominantly soluble, whereas (4<em>R</em>)-FPro-EGFP is insoluble. Purified EGFP was applied as the molecular weight marker (M) and is indicated by the arrow; S, soluble protein fraction; I, insoluble protein fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue.</p>
