                Figure 1.  Fluoroproline variants of EGFP.(A) Characteristic Î²-barrel structure of EGFP with the 10 Pro residues highlighted. Cro66 indicates the fluorophore. (B) Chemical structures of proline and the two proline analogs, (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline ((4S)-FPro), and (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline ((4R)-FPro). (C) Expression profile of EGFP and its 4-FPro variants in E. coli. EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP are predominantly soluble, whereas (4R)-FPro-EGFP is insoluble. Purified EGFP was applied as the molecular weight marker (M) and is indicated by the arrow; S, soluble protein fraction; I, insoluble protein fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue.
