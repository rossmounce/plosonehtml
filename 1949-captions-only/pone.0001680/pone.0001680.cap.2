                Figure 2.  Stereo image of the crystal structure of (4S)-FPro-EGFP.All Pro residues were replaced by (4S)-FPro. Fluoroprolines (13, 54, 56, 58, 75, 89, 187, 192, 196, 211) as well as the C- and N-termini (C, N) are indicated. The chromophore is shown in green and fluorines in cyan. Note that all fluorinated Pro residues except (4S)-FPro56 exhibit a Cγ-endo pucker. Only (4S)-FPro56 shows a Cγ-exo puckered pyrrolidine ring.
