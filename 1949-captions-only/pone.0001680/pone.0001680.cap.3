Fluorescence emission profiles of (A) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro-EGFP and (B) EGFP upon excitation of the chromophore at 488 nm before denaturation and after 24 h refolding at room temperature. (4<em>S</em>)-FPro-EGFP recovers more than 95% of its fluorescence before denaturation, whereas EGFP recovers only up to 60% of its initial fluorescence (this is in agreement with literature data). (C) The refolding kinetics of both proteins starts with an initial fast phase that is followed by a slow refolding phase. (4<em>S</em>)-FPro-EGFP refolds approximately 2 times faster than EGFP. The percentage of refolding was calculated on the basis of the final constant amount of fluorescence, corresponding to 100% of refolding. Normalized fluorescence in arbitrary units (au) was plotted against time.</p>
