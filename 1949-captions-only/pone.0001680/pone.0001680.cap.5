                Figure 5.  Local microenvironments of the fluorinated prolines in (4S)-FPro-EGFP.The high resolution (2.1 Å) X-ray crystallographic structure of (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed identification of new interactions introduced by 4S-fluorination. The fluorine atoms are characterized by well defined electron densities at the H→F replacement sites and facilitated unambiguous determination of the conformation of the pyrrolidine rings (see also Fig. 2). Fluorines are cyan, the new interactions are shown in yellow except one repulsive interaction, which is indicated in grey. All images were prepared with PYMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/). (A) (4S)-FPro13 interacts with the backbone -NH- of Asp117 (3.46 Å) and with Oγ2 of Thr118 (3.03 Å) on the neighboring strand. (B) The fluorinated PVPWP motif: the 4S-fluorine of (4S)-FPro56 is in a stereochemically unfavored position; it is most probably involved in a repulsive interaction with the backbone carbonyl group of Asn153 on the neighboring strand (measured crystallographic distance: 3.07 Å). The other two fluorinated prolines are involved in dipole interactions with neighboring backbone -NH- groups: (4S)-FPro54 with Val55 (3.40 Å) and (4S)-FPro58 with Thr59 (3.17 Å). (C) (4S)-FPro75 interacts with the backbone -NH- of Met78 (3.32 Å) and establishes a contact (~3.4 Å) with the -NH- of the His77 imidazole ring. (D) (4S)-FPro196 interacts with the backbone -NH- of the adjacent Ala154 (3.43 Å), and (E) (4S)-FPro89 with that of the succeeding Glu90 (3.46 Å). Finally, (F) (4S)-FPro211 interacts with both, the backbone -NH- (3.40 Å) and Nб (3.06 Å) of the succeeding Asn212. In total, the fluorine atoms in (4S)-FPro-EGFP establish 12 novel interactions that are absent in EGFP.
