The fluorine atoms are characterized by well defined electron densities at the H→F replacement sites and facilitated unambiguous determination of the conformation of the pyrrolidine rings (see also <a href="#pone-0001680-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Fluorines are cyan, the new interactions are shown in yellow except one repulsive interaction, which is indicated in grey. All images were prepared with PYMOL (<a href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">http://pymol.sourceforge.net/</a>). (A) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro13 interacts with the backbone -NH- of Asp117 (3.46 Å) and with Oγ2 of Thr118 (3.03 Å) on the neighboring strand. (B) The fluorinated PVPWP motif: the 4<em>S</em>-fluorine of (4<em>S</em>)-FPro56 is in a stereochemically unfavored position; it is most probably involved in a repulsive interaction with the backbone carbonyl group of Asn153 on the neighboring strand (measured crystallographic distance: 3.07 Å). The other two fluorinated prolines are involved in dipole interactions with neighboring backbone -NH- groups: (4<em>S</em>)-FPro54 with Val55 (3.40 Å) and (4<em>S</em>)-FPro58 with Thr59 (3.17 Å). (C) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro75 interacts with the backbone -NH- of Met78 (3.32 Å) and establishes a contact (~3.4 Å) with the -NH- of the His77 imidazole ring. (D) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro196 interacts with the backbone -NH- of the adjacent Ala154 (3.43 Å), and (E) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro89 with that of the succeeding Glu90 (3.46 Å). Finally, (F) (4<em>S</em>)-FPro211 interacts with both, the backbone -NH- (3.40 Å) and Nб (3.06 Å) of the succeeding Asn212. In total, the fluorine atoms in (4<em>S</em>)-FPro-EGFP establish 12 novel interactions that are absent in EGFP.</p>
