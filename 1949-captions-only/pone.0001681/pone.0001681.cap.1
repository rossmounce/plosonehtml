                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of dietary intervention.Wild-type and PPARα −/− mice fasted for 4 hours were given a single oral dose of different synthetic triglycerides composed of one single unsaturated fatty acid (400 µl), or one of the PPARα agonists WY14643 or fenofibrate (4 mg). After 6h, the livers were used for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Microarrays (~45000 probesets) on biological replicates. CMC = carboxymethyl cellulose.
