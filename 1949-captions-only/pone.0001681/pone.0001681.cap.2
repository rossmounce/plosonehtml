The number of probesets regulated by unsaturated fatty acids in a PPARα-dependent manner (light bars, not changed in the PPARα −/− mouse), or PPARα-independent manner (dark bars, changed in wild-type and PPARα −/− mice) are shown, with percentage PPARα dependence indicated. Probesets were considered statistically significantly regulated if P&lt;0.01.</p>
