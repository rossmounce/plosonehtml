Genes were considered statistically significantly regulated if P&lt;0.01. (B) Scatter plots demonstrating similarities in gene regulation between C22:6 and WY14643. Graphs show fold change in gene expression after treatment with WY14643 compared to C22:6 and C18:1. Genes that are upregulated disproportionally strongly by WY14643 (<em>Cd36</em>, <em>Fabp4</em> (<em>aP2</em>), and <em>Cpt1b</em>), or by C22:6 (<em>Prlr</em> and <em>Txnip</em>) are marked. In constructing the scatter plots, all probesets left after IQR-filtering were used. (C) Overlap in overrepresented Gene Ontology classes between C22:6, C18:1, and WY14643, based on a functional class score (FCS) method. The GO class unique to C22:6 and C18:1 is GO:0016070 (RNA metabolism), whereas the GO classes unique to C18:1 are GO:0007409 (axonogenesis) and GO:0016072 (rRNA metabolism).</p>
