                Figure 4.  Differential induction of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation between various dietary fatty acids.(A) Genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. (B) Genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. The heatmaps were generated directly from the microarray data, using for each probeset the mean signal from 4–5 biological replicates. The grayscale represents fold-induction relative to wild-type control, which was set at 1. Only probesets showing significant (P&lt;0.01) upregulation by WY14643 were included in the analysis. A list of probesets belonging to the functional class of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation can be found at http://nutrigene.4t.com/microarray/ppar2​007.
