                Figure 5.  Close agreement between fatty acid-dependent gene regulation in vivo and in vitro.mRNA expression of three genes (Pdk4, Ehhadh and Cyp4A14) was determined in mouse liver and in rat hepatoma FAO cells using quantitative real-time PCR. Results are shown as fold-change compared to control group. Error bars represent SD.
