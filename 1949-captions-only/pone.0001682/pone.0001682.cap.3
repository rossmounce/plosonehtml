Sample numbers and symbols as in <a href="#pone-0001682-g001">Figure 1</a>. Color of symbol corresponds to the substrate on which the sample was growing: limestone = yellow, serpentine = dark red and magnesit = green. Branch color corresponds to the character state reconstructed using a maximum parsimony approach. The pie charts represent the likelihood of substrate preference for branches with a putative switch between limestone, magnesit, or serpentine substrates, shown as either limestone versus non-limestone or serpentine versus non-serpentine.</p>
