                Figure 3.  Consensus phylogram obtained using Bayesian inference of phylogeny analyses for the A. viride DArT marker data set rooted with A. trichomanes.Posterior probabilities (0.XX), maximum parsimony bootstrap values (M XX), and bootstrap values for a neighbor joining distance analyses with Nei-Li distances (N XX) are given above branches if they are &gt;0.75 for posterior probabilities or &gt;50% for bootstrap values. Sample numbers and symbols as in Figure 1. Color of symbol corresponds to the substrate on which the sample was growing: limestone = yellow, serpentine = dark red and magnesit = green. Branch color corresponds to the character state reconstructed using a maximum parsimony approach. The pie charts represent the likelihood of substrate preference for branches with a putative switch between limestone, magnesit, or serpentine substrates, shown as either limestone versus non-limestone or serpentine versus non-serpentine.
