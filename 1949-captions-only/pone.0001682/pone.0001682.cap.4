                Figure 4.  Two-dimensional PCO scatter plot of the Garovaglia elegans DArT marker data set superimposed with the phylogenetic tree obtained based on cpDNA.Garovaglia powelli is included to root the phylogenetic tree. Triangles correspond to single species samples, whereas the star corresponds to a mixed sample that includes individuals of G. elegans and G. powellii.
