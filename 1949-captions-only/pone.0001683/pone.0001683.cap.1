                Figure 1.  Time evolution of the distribution of number of citations of the papers published in a given academic journal.(A) Probability density function , where Y is a year in the period 1998–2004, J is the Journal of Biological Chemistry, and ℓ≡log10(n) where n is the number of citations accrued by a paper between its publication date and December 31, 2006. Because the papers published in those years are still accruing citations by December 2006, the distributions are not stationary, but instead “drift” to higher values of ℓ. (B)  for the Journal of Biological Chemistry and for Y in the period 1991–1993. For this period, the distributions are essentially identical, indicating that  has converged to its steady-state form . The steady-state distribution is well described by a normal with mean 1.65 and standard deviation 0.35 (black dashed curve). (C) Time dependence of  for three journals: Astrophysical Journal, Ecology, and Circulation. As for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, we find that after some transient period,  reaches a stationary value  (see Methods). The orange region highlights the set of years for which we consider that  is stationary. The time scale τ(J) for reaching the steady-state strongly depends on the journal: τ(Astrophysical Journal) = 18 years, τ(Ecology) = 12 years, and τ(Circulation) = 9 years. Significantly, we find no correlations between τ(J) and , whose values are 1.44 for Astrophysical Journal, 1.70 for Ecology, and 1.66 for Circulation. (D) Pairwise comparison of citation distributions for different years for a given journal. We show the matrices of p-values obtained using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [29] for the Astrophysical Journal, Ecology, and Circulation. We color the matrix elements following the color code on the right. p-values close to one mean that it is likely that both distributions come from a common underlying distribution; p-values close to zero mean that is it very unlikely that both distributions come from a common underlying distribution. We then use a box-diagonal model [28] to identify contiguous blocks of years for which the p-value is large enough that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The white lines in the matrices indicate the best fit of a box-diagonal model. We identify the first box with more than 2 years for which  to be the steady-state period (see Methods).
