                Figure 2.  Modeling the steady-state distributions of the number of citations for papers published in a given journal.(A) Our model assumes that the “quality” of the papers published by a journal obeys a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. The number of citations of a paper with quality qЄN(μ,σ) is given by Eq. (3). Because the quality is a continuous variable whereas the number of citations is an integer quantity, the same number of citations will occur for papers with qualities spanning a certain range of q. In particular, all papers for which q&lt;log10(1+γ) will receive no citations. In the panel, the areas of differently shaded regions yield the probability of a paper accruing a given number of citations. (B) Scatter plot of the estimated value of σ versus  for all 2,267 journals considered in our analysis (see Methods and Appendices S1 and S4 for details on the fits). Notice that σ is almost independent of . The solid line corresponds to σ = 0.419, the mean of the estimated values of σ for all journals (see Methods). (C) Scatter plot of the estimated value of γ+1 for versus . Notice the strong correlation between the two variables. The solid line corresponds to  (see Methods for details on the fit). (D) Fraction of uncited papers as a function of . For this and all subsequent panels, solid lines show the predictions of the model using , σ = 0.419, and a value of μ for each  (see Methods). (E) Variance of ℓ as a function of . (F) Skewness of ℓ as a function of . The skewness of the normal distribution is zero. (G) Kurtosis excess of ℓ as a function of . The kurtosis excess of the normal distribution is zero. Note how, for the case of , the moments of the distribution of citations for cited papers deviate significantly from those expected for a normal distribution. In contrast, for , only a small fraction of papers remains uncited, so deviations from the expectations for a normal distribution are small.
