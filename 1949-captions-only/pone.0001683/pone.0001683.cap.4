Though there are clear correlations between the two rankings, deviations can be extremely large. (B) Probability density function of ΔR(<em>i</em>) = R<sup>JIF</sup>(<em>i</em>)−R<sup>AUC</sup>(<em>i</em>). Positive values of ΔR indicate under-rating of the journal. (C) Probability density function of change in the median ranking of the journals primarily classified in a given field, for fields with at least two journals. The papers published in journals classified in fields that are over-rated tend to get cited quickly (probably because of faster publication times), whereas papers published in journals in under-rated fields take longer to start accruing citations. <a href="#pone.0001683.s005">Table S1</a> lists the median change of rank for each field.</p>
