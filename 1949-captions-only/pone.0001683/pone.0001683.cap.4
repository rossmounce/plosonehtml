                Figure 4.  Effect of JIF biases on the ranking of journals.(A) Comparison of the rankings of journals obtained using the JIF and the AUC statistic. Though there are clear correlations between the two rankings, deviations can be extremely large. (B) Probability density function of ΔR(i) = RJIF(i)−RAUC(i). Positive values of ΔR indicate under-rating of the journal. (C) Probability density function of change in the median ranking of the journals primarily classified in a given field, for fields with at least two journals. The papers published in journals classified in fields that are over-rated tend to get cited quickly (probably because of faster publication times), whereas papers published in journals in under-rated fields take longer to start accruing citations. Table S1 lists the median change of rank for each field.
