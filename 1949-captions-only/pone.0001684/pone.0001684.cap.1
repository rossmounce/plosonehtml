Expression vectors for GABA-α6-tTA (upper panel) and tetO-NR2B (low panel). pA: poly-A signal; int: artificial intron. B and C. Granule cell specific expression. LacZ staining reveals that blue stain is exclusively observed in the cerebellar cortex (B) and is restricted to granule cells only (C). D and E. Distribution of the NR2B transgene in the cerebellum. <em>in situ</em> hybridization shows that the expression of the NR2B transgene is exclusively observed in the cerebellar cortex of tg (E), but not of control mice (D). F. Expression level of the NR2B transgene. Western blot shows the expression of NR2B protein (180 kDa) in the cerebella of tg mice, but not of control (cont) mice. ß-actin blot (42 kDa) shows the relative amount of protein loading. G–I. Synaptic localization of NR2B protein. EM immunocytochemistry shows positive gold-particles in many mossy fiber/granule cell synapses of tg (H and I), but not of control mice (G). The immunoreactivity in tg mice is associated within the “active zone” (postsynaptic density and synaptic cleft, arrow heads) of the synapse (H; arrowhead) or is associated throughout the spinous cytoplasmn and neuropil of spine head (I; arrow). ax: axon; den: dendrite; sp: spine. Scale bars in I = 0.3 µm.</p>
