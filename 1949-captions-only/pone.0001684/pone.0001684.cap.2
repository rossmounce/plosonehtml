Representative current traces elicited by NMDA (300 µM) alone (black lines), NMDA with 10 µM ifenprodil (red line), and after ifenprodil washout (gray line). Application of NMDA with 10 µM glycine in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solution triggered robust NMDA-current in control and tg cells, while no significant difference in current peak or decay time was found between them. Vertical scale bar, 150 pA for control and tg cells, 300 pA for tg cells-treated with doxy; horizontal scale bar, 400 msec. B. Whole-cell responses to NMDA normalized by kainate were not significantly different between control and tg cells. C. Fractional block of NMDA responses by ifenprodil. Application of ifenprodil partially blocked the current in control cells and almost completely blocked the current in tg cells. When tg cells were treated with doxycycline, the blocking effect of ifenprodil returned to the level of control cells. *: p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by <em>Fisher's PLSD</em> test. Data are expressed as mean±SD.</p>
