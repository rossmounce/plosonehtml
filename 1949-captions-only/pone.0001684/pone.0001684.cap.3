                Figure 3.  Enhanced NMDAR function in cerebellar granule cells of tg mice.A–F. Representative Ca2+ imaging microphotos from before the NMDA (0.1 µM together with glycine 10 µM) application (A and D), the maximal [Ca2+]I responses (B and E), and returned to the basal level (C and F) in control cell (A–C) and tg cell (D–F), respectively. G. Representative time courses for the changes of [Ca2+]i in single granule cells of three groups of mice tested during a typical 5-minute experimental period, during which 500 image frames were collected. H. Quantitative analysis of [Ca 2+]i. Data is expressed as mean±SD. ***, p&lt;0.001, post-hoc analysis with Fisher's PLSD test in comparison between tg neurons-treated with vehicle and control neurons and between tg neurons-treated with vehicle and tg neurons-treated with doxy, respectively. Bar in F represents 20 µm. Data are expressed as mean±SD.
