Nissl straining of sagital sections from control (A) and tg (B) mice. No observable difference, either in general morphology of granule cells or cell number in granule cell layer, was found between them. C and D. Immunohistological staining with DK-28 (Sigma). No obviously morphological changes could be found in the Purkinje cell layer and the molecular cell layers between control (C) and tg mice (D). E. A typical glomerulus from cerebellar section from a tg mouse. The bar in left corner was 1 µm. F. Quantitative analysis of number of mossy fiber/granule cell synapses. No significant difference was found between control and tg mice. Data are expressed as mean±SD.</p>
