Motor learning in fixed-speed rotorod test. Two speeds, 20 rpm and 25 rpm, were used. Although a tendency of less total time required to reach the learned criterion is shown in tg mice (n = 8), this tendency does not reach statistical significance, when compared to control mice (n = 11) either in 20 rpm or 25 rpm fixed-speed test. B. Motor learning in an accelerated-speed rotorod test. The performance in both control (n = 10) and tg (n = 9) mice is better following trials and one-way ANOVA analysis reveals a significant difference in either control [F(2,27) = 9.98, p&lt;0.001] or tg mice [F(2,24) = 10.23, p&lt;0.001]. However, no significant difference in either the learning curve or in each training session can be found between control and tg mice. Two different sets of mice were respectively used for fixed- and accelerated-speed rotorod tests. Data are expressed as meanÂ±SD.</p>
