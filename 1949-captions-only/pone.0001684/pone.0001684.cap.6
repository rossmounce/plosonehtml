A typical circadian running behavior in a 1-week period from a tg mouse. Two circadian phases are clearly shown within every 24 hrs. Running phase was generally from 19:00 PM to 07:00 AM and non-running phase was from 07:00 AM to 19:00 PM. A low running activity was still observed in both control and tg mice during the non-running-phases. No any significant difference in this circadian pattern was found between control and tg mice. B. A typical running curve in a 1 hr-duration during a running phase from a tg mouse. C. Average running speed in cycles per minute. There was no significant difference between naïve control and naïve tg mice, between trained control and trained tg mice, and between trained and naïve mice. D. Maximal running speed in cycles per minute. There is no significant difference between naïve control and naïve tg mice, between trained control and trained tg mice, and between trained and naïve mice. E. Number of cycling bouts per 24 hrs. There was no significant difference between naïve control and naïve tg mice, between trained control and trained tg mice, and between trained and naïve mice. F. Running duration per bout. There was no significant difference between naïve control and naïve tg mice. However, a significant prolonged duration was observed in trained control mice, when compared to naïve control mice (#, p&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test), and in trained tg mice, when compared to either trained control mice (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test) or naïve tg mice (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test). G. Total running distance in cycles per 24 hrs. There is no significant difference between naïve control and naïve tg mice. Similar to running duration, there was a significant difference in total running distance between naïve control and trained tg mice (#, p&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test), between trained control and trained tg mice (*, p&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test), between naïve tg and trained tg mice.
