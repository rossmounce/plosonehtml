                Figure 7.  Interaction between NR2B expression and VMT in motor learning.A. VMT significantly enhances motor learning in fixed-speed rotorod in B6/CBA F1 mice. The average time required to reach the learned criterion from both 20 rpm and 25 rpm tests was significantly decreased (p&lt;0.001, Students t test) in trained B6/CBA F1 mice (n = 9), compared to naïve B6/CBA F1 mice (n = 12). B. VMT significantly enhances motor learning in accelerated-speed rotorod in B6/CBA F1 mice. The average latency to falling down from the rod from 9 trials was significantly increased (p&lt;0.001, Students t test) in trained B6/CBA F1 mice (n = 9), in comparison to naïve B6/CBA F1 mice (n = 10). C. The effect of GEI on motor learning in fixed-speed rotorod. Four groups of mice, trained control-vehicle (n = 12), trained control-doxy (n = 8), trained tg-vehicle (n = 10), and trained tg mice-treated with doxy (n = 12) were examined with two fixed-speed rotorod tests at 20 rpm and 25 rpm, respectively. A significant difference was observed between trained tg-vehicle mice and either trained control-vehicle or trained control-doxy, but not between trained control-vehicle and trained control-doxy, in either 20 rpm or 25 rpm tests (p&lt;0.01, Students t test, respectively). When trained tg mice were treated with doxy, the performance was returned to the level of trained-control mice. D. The effect of GEI on motor learning in accelerated-speed rotorod. Four groups of mice, trained control-vehicle (n = 12), trained control-doxy (n = 11), trained tg-vehicle (n = 12), and trained tg mice-treated with doxy (n = 9) were examined with accelerated-speed rotorod. In addition to a highly significant difference in trained-tg-vehicle mice over other groups, post-hoc analysis with Fisher's PLSD test revealed a significant difference between trained tg-vehicle mice and any group of the three control groups (p&lt;0.01, respectively). Data are expressed as mean±SD. TC: trained control; TT: trained tg.
