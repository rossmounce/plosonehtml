                Figure 1.  Types of colony morphology of P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 mini-Tn5 transposon mutants on LB agar with Congo red (1), blood agar (2), LB agar (3), LB agar supplemented with 4 mM FeSO4 (4):WT, TBCF10839 strain; A, shiny autolysis; B, white colony on blood agar and iron supplemented media, on Congo red agar the colour is concentrated in the center of colony; C, light rose or colourless on Congo red agar; D, soft autolysis, no shine; E, non mucoid structure at room temperature; F, orange pigment in the center of colony; G, small colony size; H, highly mucoid. Transposon insertions into the TBCF10839 homolog of PA2028 (A), PA1003 (B), PA2579 (C), PA4554 (D), PA0415 (E), PA2388 (F), PA4640 (G), GC low region at pos. 3291786â€“3291972 in a genomic island of the P. aeruginosa 2192 genome (H).
