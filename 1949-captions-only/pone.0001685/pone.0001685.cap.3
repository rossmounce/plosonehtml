                Figure 3.  Total CFU of P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 STM colony morphology mutants recovered from murine organs 48 h after intratracheal instillation of up to 25 differentially tagged mutants.Each data point represents the recovery of bacteria from one organ of one animal. Different test sets of TBCF10839 STM mutants are differentiated by symbol. The in total 55 different mutants were first tested in different combinations in a series of four separate experiments (closed square, closed circle, closed triangle, open triangle) whereby each mutant per test set haboured a different oligonucleotide tag. After the abundance of individual mutants had been semiquantitatively evaluated by dot-blot hybridizations (see Figure 4), the mutants with the lowest (closed diamonds, 10 mutants) and highest survival (open diamonds, 10 mutants), respectively, were pooled and tested again.
