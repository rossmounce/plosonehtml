Different test sets of TBCF10839 STM mutants are differentiated by symbol. The in total 55 different mutants were first tested in different combinations in a series of four separate experiments (closed square, closed circle, closed triangle, open triangle) whereby each mutant per test set haboured a different oligonucleotide tag. After the abundance of individual mutants had been semiquantitatively evaluated by dot-blot hybridizations (see <a href="#pone-0001685-g004">Figure 4</a>), the mutants with the lowest (closed diamonds, 10 mutants) and highest survival (open diamonds, 10 mutants), respectively, were pooled and tested again.</p>
