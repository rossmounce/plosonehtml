                Figure 4.  Dot blot hybridization of oligonucleotide signature tags to determine the survival of individual P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 colony morphology mutants in competition experiments.DIG-labeled, HindIII-digested signal sequences isolated from bacteria not subjected to selection (control, co) or from bacteria recovered from organs after murine infection experiments (lung, lu; spleen, spl; and liver, li) were hybridized onto dot blots of the signal sequences of the pTnModOGm SigTag. The recovered bacteria had been either cultured on solid LB agar (designated ‘agar’ in the Figure) or in LB broth (designated ‘liquid’ in the Figure). Experiments are numbered as in Figure 3. First, the total pool of colony morphology variants was tested in different combinations in experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4. Ten mutants each with the lowest and highest survival were then retested in experiments 5 and 6, respectively. The PA number of the transposon-inactivated gene that carries the signature tag complementary to the oligonucleotide on the dot blot is given in Table S2. Mutants were arranged as indicated in the master template.
