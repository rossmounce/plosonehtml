The recovered bacteria had been either cultured on solid LB agar (designated ‘agar’ in the Figure) or in LB broth (designated ‘liquid’ in the Figure). Experiments are numbered as in <a href="#pone-0001685-g003">Figure 3</a>. First, the total pool of colony morphology variants was tested in different combinations in experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4. Ten mutants each with the lowest and highest survival were then retested in experiments 5 and 6, respectively. The PA number of the transposon-inactivated gene that carries the signature tag complementary to the oligonucleotide on the dot blot is given in <a href="#pone.0001685.s003">Table S2</a>. Mutants were arranged as indicated in the master template.</p>
