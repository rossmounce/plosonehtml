                Figure 5.  (A) Survival of mice whose airways had been inoculated at day 0 with 7.5×106 CFU of P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 (closed square) or of the isogenic transposon mutants P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 Tn5::PA4640(mqoB) (closed circle), P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 Tn5::PA3194(edd) (closed triangle) or P. aeruginosa TBCF10839 Tn5::PA4954(motC) (closed diamond).(B) CFU recovered from murine organs 48 h after intracheal instillation of TBCF10839 (closed square), Tn5::PA4640 (closed circle), Tn5::PA3194 (closed triangle) or Tn5::PA4954 (closed diamond). (C, D, E, F, G) Lung histology 48 h after infection with Tn5::PA4640 (C), Tn5::PA3194 (D), Tn5::PA4954 (E), TBCF10839 wild type (F) or vehicle control (30 µL PBS) (G). Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification×200, bar 50 µm. b, bronchus; v, vessel. The photomicrographs show normal tissue with a few alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (C), minimally intense peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation (D), moderate inflammation (alveoli filled with inflammatory cells, but only few inflammatory cells within bronchi) (E), profound inflammation (infiltration of bronchi with leukocytes, destructed lung tissue) (F) and normal lung parenchyma (G).
