                Figure 7.  Growth of P. aeruginosa strains TBCF10839 (open bar), PAO1 (grey bar) and TBCF10839 Tn5::TBmotC (A, dashed bar), TBCF10839 Tn5::TBmqoB (B, dashed bar), TBCF10839 Tn5::TBedd (C, dashed bar) at 37°C in standard minimal mineral medium supplemented with the indicated nutrients as carbon or nitrogen source.The ordinate indicates the optical density at 490 nm. The number below the triple bars indicates the time of culturing of 12 h (left), 18 h (middle) and 24 h (right). The initial bacterial inoculum had an OD578 of 0.02 in 100 µL minimal medium supplemented with the indicated carbon or nitrogen source. All growth experiments were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates.
