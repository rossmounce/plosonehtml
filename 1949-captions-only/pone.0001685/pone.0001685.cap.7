The number below the triple bars indicates the time of culturing of 12 h (left), 18 h (middle) and 24 h (right). The initial bacterial inoculum had an OD<sub>578</sub> of 0.02 in 100 µL minimal medium supplemented with the indicated carbon or nitrogen source. All growth experiments were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates.</p>
