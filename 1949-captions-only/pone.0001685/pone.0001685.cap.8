                Figure 8.  Central carbohydrate pathways in P. aeruginosa.An Edd knock-out is typically not able to grow on glucose as sole carbon source underpinning the dominant role of the Entner Douderoff pathway for sugar catabolism in P. aeruginosa. Carbohydrates are on the other hand no major preferred nutrients for P. aeruginosa [1] and knock outs in the central carbohydrate pathways do not appear as auxotrophic organisms, albeit they are compromised in their metabolic capacity and grow more slowly than the wild type. Consistent with the subordinate role of sugars as carbon source, the genes of sugar dissimilation are only weakly or moderately expressed (source: transcriptome data of strains PAO1, LES400, LES431 and TBCF10839 [39], [96]). Enzyme abbreviations: Ald, aldolase; Edd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; GapA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Glk, glucokinase; GlnK, gluconokinase; KdpA, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase; Kgk, 2-ketogluconate kinase; Pgi, phosphoglucoisomerase; Zwf, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
