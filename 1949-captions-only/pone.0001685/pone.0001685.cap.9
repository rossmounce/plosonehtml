A knock-out of MqoB impairs the biosynthesis of sugars and amino acids. <em>P. aeruginosa mqoB<sup>−</sup></em> mutants cannot grow on C2- (ethanol, acetate) or C4-compounds (malate, fumarate) as sole carbon sources indicating that the alternative pathways do not compensate the loss of MqoB. Faint fonts designate genes that were not expressed by strains PAO1 and TBCF10839 during growth in LB medium <a href="#pone.0001685-Salunkhe1">[39]</a>. Enzyme abbreviations: MalE (PA3471), malic enzyme; MDH (PA1252), L-malate dehydrogenase; MqoA (PA3452), malate:quinone oxidoreductase; MqoB (PA4640), malate:quinone oxidoreductase; Pca (PA1400), pyruvate carboxylase; PckA (PA5192), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Ppc (PA3687), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PpsA (PA1779), phophoenolpyruvate synthetase.</p>
