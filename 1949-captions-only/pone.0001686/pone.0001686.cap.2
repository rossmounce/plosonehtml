                Figure 2.  Visual haplotype graph and network for sequence data around the TRPV6 locus in 6 populations.A) Visual haplotype graph of sequence data generated for four populations (New Guinea highlanders, the Pathan of Pakistan, Han Chinese, and the Karitiana of Brazil), compared to the European and African sequences from the Seattle SNPs dataset. B) A network of the sequence data from the Karitiana, Pathan, New Guinea highlanders, Han Chinese, Europeans, and Africans.
