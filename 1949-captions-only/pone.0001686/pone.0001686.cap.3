                Figure 3.  EHH decay plots for sequence data and HapMap data.A) An EHH decay plot with the C157R mutation as the core SNP from sequence data generated for the Karitiana, Han Chinese, New Guinea highlanders, and Pathan, along with data for Europeans and Africans (light green is the ancestral allele, dark green is the derived allele) from the SeattleSNPs dataset. Only the derived allele is plotted for each non-African population. B) EHH decay plot from HapMap data with the M378T mutation as the core. For the Yoruba, light green indicates the ancestral haplotype and dark green indicates the derived haplotype.
