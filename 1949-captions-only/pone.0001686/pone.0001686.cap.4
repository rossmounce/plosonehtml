Note the strong inward rectification and the shift of the reversal potentials when Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ba<sup>2+</sup> are the charge carriers (DVF: divalent free solution, Ca<sup>2+</sup>: 30 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> with NMDG<sup>+</sup> as substitute for Na<sup>+</sup>, see <a href="#s3">methods</a> for details). B) IV curves for the ancestral form, using the same protocol as in A. C) Current activation for the derived <em>TRPV6</em> form by voltage steps from +70 mV to −100 mV as shown in the inset. Note the fast initial inactivation when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the charge carrier and the absence of current decay in DVF conditions and with Ba<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier. D) Current activation for the ancestral <em>TRPV6</em> form, with the same protocol as in C.</p>
