                Figure 4.  Current–voltage relationships (IV curves) for the derived (CMM) and ancestral (RVT) forms of TRPV6.A) IV curves for the derived form obtained from the voltage ramps shown in the inset. Note the strong inward rectification and the shift of the reversal potentials when Ca2+ or Ba2+ are the charge carriers (DVF: divalent free solution, Ca2+: 30 mM CaCl2 with NMDG+ as substitute for Na+, see methods for details). B) IV curves for the ancestral form, using the same protocol as in A. C) Current activation for the derived TRPV6 form by voltage steps from +70 mV to −100 mV as shown in the inset. Note the fast initial inactivation when Ca2+ is the charge carrier and the absence of current decay in DVF conditions and with Ba2+ as the charge carrier. D) Current activation for the ancestral TRPV6 form, with the same protocol as in C.
