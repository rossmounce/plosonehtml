Bars denoted DVF indicates superfusion of the cell with a divalent free solution; bars above the time course indicate changes to NMGD<sup>+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Note the typical large currents in DVF, the complete inhibition of inward current with NMDG<sup>+</sup>, the relatively stable current in Ba<sup>2+</sup>, and the fast decay with Ca<sup>2+ </sup>as the charge carrier. Also note the slow recovery from Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent inactivation. B) IV curves from the time course shown in A, measured at the times which are indicated by solid points (red DVF, blue Ba<sup>2+</sup>, green Ca<sup>2+</sup>). C and D) Identical experiments as in A and B, respectively, with the ancestral <em>TRPV6</em> form.</p>
