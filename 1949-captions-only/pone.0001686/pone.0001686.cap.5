                Figure 5.  Time course of TRPV6 currents with changing extracellular ionic conditions.A) Current density for the derived TRPV6 form at âˆ’100 mV obtained from voltage ramps. Bars denoted DVF indicates superfusion of the cell with a divalent free solution; bars above the time course indicate changes to NMGD+, Ba2+ and Ca2+. Note the typical large currents in DVF, the complete inhibition of inward current with NMDG+, the relatively stable current in Ba2+, and the fast decay with Ca2+ as the charge carrier. Also note the slow recovery from Ca2+ dependent inactivation. B) IV curves from the time course shown in A, measured at the times which are indicated by solid points (red DVF, blue Ba2+, green Ca2+). C and D) Identical experiments as in A and B, respectively, with the ancestral TRPV6 form.
