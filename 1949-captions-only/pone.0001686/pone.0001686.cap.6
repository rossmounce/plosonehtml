                Figure 6.  Analyses of three key feature of TRPV6: current density, Ca2+ dependent inactivation and block by Mg2+.Data from between 3 and 5 cells for all graphs (except where stated otherwise) with p values are indicated. A) Current density was measured at −150 mV under three ionic conditions for derived TRPV6 and for ancestral TRPV6. DVF: divalent free (13 derived and 12 ancestral cells measured); Ba2+, Ca2+ refer to these divalent cations as the only charge carrier for the inward currents. Note that high current densities have been measured indicating high functional expression of the channels. B) Data were taken only from the same cells in which all three condition (DVF, Ba2+, Ca2+) could be measured (see protocol panel A). Current densities were normalized to the current in DVF solution at −150 mV. C) Ca2+ dependent inactivation was estimated by the ratio of the currents at the end of the 400 ms voltage step and the maximal inward current during the step (I400ms,−100mV/Imax). Eleven derived and 13 ancestral alleles were tested for the effect in which Ca2+ has on Ca2+ dependent inactivation D) Block of TRPV6 by Mg2+ was estimated from step protocols. I1Mg2+,−100mV/IDVF,−100mV is the ratio of the maximal inward current measured from the same cell after changing from DVF to addition of 1 mM Mg2+. (1-ratio) gives the inhibition.
