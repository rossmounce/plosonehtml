Selection gradients indicate directional selection towards higher reproductive effort in high densities (closed circles and solid line: β±SE = 0.60±0.15, <em>P</em> = 0.004) but not in low densities (open circles and dashed line: β±SE = −0.08±0.21, <em>P</em> = 0.726) (Standardized RE * Density interaction: <em>F</em><sub>1,14</sub> = 7.34, <em>P</em> = 0.017). The selection gradient among common tactics was non-significant (β±SE = 0.33±0.44, <em>P</em> = 0.453) and density-independent (Standardized RE * Density interaction: <em>F</em><sub>1,50</sub> = 0.02, <em>P</em> = 0.904).</p>
