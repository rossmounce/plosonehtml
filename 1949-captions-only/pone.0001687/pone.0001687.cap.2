                Figure 2.  Density-dependent selection for reproductive effort among rare tactics.In the analyses of selection gradients, the relative fitness (number of offspring weaned/mean number of offspring weaned in the population) was estimated in relation to standardized reproductive effort ((REi–REmean)/RESD). Selection gradients indicate directional selection towards higher reproductive effort in high densities (closed circles and solid line: β±SE = 0.60±0.15, P = 0.004) but not in low densities (open circles and dashed line: β±SE = −0.08±0.21, P = 0.726) (Standardized RE * Density interaction: F1,14 = 7.34, P = 0.017). The selection gradient among common tactics was non-significant (β±SE = 0.33±0.44, P = 0.453) and density-independent (Standardized RE * Density interaction: F1,50 = 0.02, P = 0.904).
