                Figure 3.  Change in frequencies of low and high RE tactics in the different treatment populations during the breeding season.Frequency of high RE tactics increased significantly when densities were high and initial frequency was low (rare tactic), which simultaneously decreased the frequency of low RE (common tactic). Open circles: low RE; Closed circle: high RE. N = number of replicates (populations).
