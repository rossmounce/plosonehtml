                Figure 1.  Bacterial loads at injection site and in draining lymph node.Data are means of log10 of cfu numbers recovered from 77 mice infected over six independent experiments. Bars = Standard Errors. Stars indicate that the data are significantly different between the two Yersinia species (pâ‰¤0.0001). The dashed line shows the detection limit (10 cfu). The cross symbol indicates that most Y. pestis-infected mice died between days 2 and 3.
