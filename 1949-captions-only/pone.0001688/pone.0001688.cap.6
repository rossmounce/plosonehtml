Sections were stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), and by antibodies specific to <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> or to <em>Y. pestis</em> (Bact), to PMNs and to B lymphocytes (BL). Immunostainings give a brownish color. Arrowheads on the HE-stained sections indicate the border of the inflammatory front. Bacteria (arrows) are present as tiny bacterial foci at the periphery (type 1), well delimited patches (type 2) or flame-like formations (type 3). The BL staining shows that the overall structure of the type 1, but not of the type 3, lymph node is preserved, while, in the type 2 lymph node, the inflammatory reaction forced B lymphocytes to the central part of the organ. Bar = 100 Âµm.</p>
