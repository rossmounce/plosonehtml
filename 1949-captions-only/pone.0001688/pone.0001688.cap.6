                Figure 6.  Examples of the three histopathological types of the draining lymph nodes.Lymph nodes were taken 24 h (type 1) and 72 h (type 2 and 3) after inoculation of ~4500 cfu of Y. pseudotuberculosis (types 1 and 2) or Y. pestis (type 3). Sections were stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), and by antibodies specific to Y. pseudotuberculosis or to Y. pestis (Bact), to PMNs and to B lymphocytes (BL). Immunostainings give a brownish color. Arrowheads on the HE-stained sections indicate the border of the inflammatory front. Bacteria (arrows) are present as tiny bacterial foci at the periphery (type 1), well delimited patches (type 2) or flame-like formations (type 3). The BL staining shows that the overall structure of the type 1, but not of the type 3, lymph node is preserved, while, in the type 2 lymph node, the inflammatory reaction forced B lymphocytes to the central part of the organ. Bar = 100 Âµm.
