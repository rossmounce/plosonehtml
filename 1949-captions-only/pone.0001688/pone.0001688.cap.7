Top scale = % similarity. As compared to <a href="#pone-0001688-g005">Figure 5</a>, an extended range of infective-loads was used, and hence more DLNs were included in the analysis (see the Result section). The seven last profiles in the dendrogram correspond to completely destroyed lymph nodes.</p>
