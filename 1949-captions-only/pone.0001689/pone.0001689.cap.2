                Figure 2.

Depicted are medians, 25th and 75th percentiles (boxes), 10th and 90th percentiles (whiskers) and 5th and 95th percentiles (dots). Coloured patches that have been shown to be sexually selected or indicators of quality are written out in upper case font (see Table 1 for more information). The dotted horizontal line indicates the 1 jnd discriminability threshold.
