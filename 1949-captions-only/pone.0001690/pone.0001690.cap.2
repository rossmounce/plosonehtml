The fact that the two solutions agree reflects that the algorithm contains the least possible information compatible with the constraints: b) The same thing for the blind watchmaker version of the CBB-model. In this case the variational solution is <em>n</em>(<em>k</em>) = <em>A</em> exp(−<em>bk</em>)/<em>k</em><sup>2</sup> and the agreement again reflects that no additional information is contained in the algorithm. The two curves in the panel corresponds to <em>N = 1000</em> and <em>M/N = 2</em> and <em>4</em>, respectively. As seen the distribution becomes more power law like with increasing ratio <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001690.e024&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> : c) The corresponding network solution. The most unbiased solution in this case gives the blind watchmaker network structure. The variational solution cannot be simply obtained for the network case because of the network constraints. By contrast these constraints are easily incorporated into the algorithm method. The panel shows the average solution for <em>M/N = 4</em> and <em>N = 1000</em>. The solution has a fat tail power law <em>n</em>(<em>k</em>)~<em>k<sup>−γ</sup></em> with <em>γ</em>≈2.1 : d) A real network is just one representation <em>n(k)</em> and not an average <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001690.e025&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>. The panel shows a single network for <em>N = 1000</em> and <em>M/N = 4</em>. A single network always contain large split-off nodes.</p>
