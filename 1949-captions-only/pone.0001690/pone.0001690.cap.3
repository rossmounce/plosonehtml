[ma03a][ma03b]): Panel a) shows the average distribution <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001690.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> over 107 metabolic networks. This average distribution has a fat power-law tail <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001690.e002&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> with <em>γ</em>≈2.2. Note that the nodes with only one link are fewer (by roughly a factor of <em>5</em>) than the nodes with two links. The average size of these 107 networks is <em>N</em>≈640 and <em>M/N</em>≈5.35 b) the specific metabolic network distribution <em>n(k)</em> for the E.Coli bacteria (<em>N</em>≈970 and <em>M/N</em>≈5.8). This network has 6 nodes with more than 100 links. Panel c) makes a direct comparison between the 107 metabolic networks in Panel a and 107 blind watchmaker networks with the same <em>N</em> and <em>M</em>. The agreement implies a common origin. Panel d) makes the same comparison between the E.Coli network and a single random blind watchmaker network for the same <em>N</em> and <em>M</em>. Apart from a general agreement (modulo the larger statistical spread inherent in comparing single networks) , the distribution of the split-off nodes are similar. Panel e) compares the average of the metabolic networks with the corresponding average of the blind watchmaker networks <em>including</em> a constraint decreasing the abundance of the single link node to the same average number, <em>n(1)</em>, as for the metabolic networks (<em>a = 0.07</em>). The agreement is extraordinary. Panel f) makes the same comparison for the E. Coli. network (<em>a = 0.08</em>) again with a striking agreement.</p>
