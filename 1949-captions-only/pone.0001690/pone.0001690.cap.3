                Figure 3.  Metabolic networks and the blind watchmaker network.The first two panels show the data for real metabolic networks (the data is taken from Ref. [ma03a][ma03b]): Panel a) shows the average distribution  over 107 metabolic networks. This average distribution has a fat power-law tail  with γ≈2.2. Note that the nodes with only one link are fewer (by roughly a factor of 5) than the nodes with two links. The average size of these 107 networks is N≈640 and M/N≈5.35 b) the specific metabolic network distribution n(k) for the E.Coli bacteria (N≈970 and M/N≈5.8). This network has 6 nodes with more than 100 links. Panel c) makes a direct comparison between the 107 metabolic networks in Panel a and 107 blind watchmaker networks with the same N and M. The agreement implies a common origin. Panel d) makes the same comparison between the E.Coli network and a single random blind watchmaker network for the same N and M. Apart from a general agreement (modulo the larger statistical spread inherent in comparing single networks) , the distribution of the split-off nodes are similar. Panel e) compares the average of the metabolic networks with the corresponding average of the blind watchmaker networks including a constraint decreasing the abundance of the single link node to the same average number, n(1), as for the metabolic networks (a = 0.07). The agreement is extraordinary. Panel f) makes the same comparison for the E. Coli. network (a = 0.08) again with a striking agreement.
