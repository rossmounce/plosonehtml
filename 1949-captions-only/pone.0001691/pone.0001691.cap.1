                Figure 1.  In vivo expansion of endogenous and transgenic glycoprotein B-specific CD8+ T cells following footpad infection with recombinant influenza WSN-gB.Endogenous gB-specific CD8+ T cells were tracked by staining with gB498–505 MHC class I tetramers conjugated to the fluorescent dye, phycoerythrin. A, The number of gB-specific CD8+ T cells were analysed in the popliteal lymph node and B, spleen five, seven and ten days after s.c. infection via footpad injection with 400 PFU of recombinant influenza, WSN-gB. Data are pooled from two independent experiments and show the mean of four to six mice at each time point. C, 5×104 Ly5.1 gBT-I-specific T cells were adoptively transferred by tail vein injection into naïve C57BL/6 mice one day prior to s.c. infection with 400 PFU of recombinant influenza, WSN-gB. Five and seven days after infection, the number of Ly5.1 gBT-I cells in the spleen was enumerated by flow cytometry by staining for surface expression of CD8α and CD45.1. Data are pooled from two independent experiments and show the mean±SEM of eight to twelve mice at each time point. D, Influenza viral antigen stimulates naïve gBT-I CD8+ T cells for several days after infection. 2×106 purified CFSE-labelled Ly5.1gBT-I CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into naïve C57BL/6 mice at various times after s.c. footpad infection with influenza WSN-gB. Proliferation of transferred Ly5.1gBT-I CD8+ T cells was assessed in the draining popliteal lymph node 72 h after transfer by evaluating loss of CFSE fluorescence. Data are pooled from two independent experiments and show the mean±SEM. The number of mice examined at each time point are indicated by n. E. Naïve CFSE-labelled gBT-I CD8+ T cells were transferred into mice infected subcutaneously one to six days earlier with WSN-gB. T cell proliferation in the popliteal lymph node was analysed by flow cytometry three days after transfer. The percentage of proliferated cells is shown in the upper left hand corner of each graph. Profiles show representative CFSE proliferation from data shown in D.
