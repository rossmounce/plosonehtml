                Figure 2.  DC were isolated from the popliteal lymph node or spleen of mice and flow cytometrically purified into DC subsets according to one of three sorting protocols.A. In the first approach, CD11c+ cells were sorted from the popliteal lymph node or spleen into CD8α+ (CD8α) DC, CD8α+/−CD45RA+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and CD8α−CD45RA− double negative (DN) DC. B. In the second approach, CD11c+ cells from popliteal lymph node were further dissected into CD8−CD205high Langerhans cells, CD8α−CD205int dermal DC, CD8α−CD205− DN DC and CD8α+CD205int DC. C. In the third approach, CD11c+ cells were sorted from light density cells isolated from spleen into CD8α+CD4−, CD8α−CD4+ and CD8α−CD4− DC.
