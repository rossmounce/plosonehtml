                Figure 3.  CD8α DC dominate antigen presentation to naïve gBT-I CD8+ T cells following s.c. infection.C57BL/6 mice were infected with WSN-gB by s.c. injection into the footpad. 48 and 72 h after infection, the popliteal lymph node were isolated and non-DC lineages were removed by antibody depletion. A,B. CD11c+ DC subsets were purified by flow cytometric sorting into DN DC, CD8α DC and pDC before culturing titrating numbers of each subset with 5×104 CFSE-labelled gBT-I CD8+ T cells. Proliferation was analysed at 60 h of culture. Data show the mean and SEM of three independent experiments. C,D. Lymph node-resident CD8α DC and not skin-derived trafficking DC, prime naïve CD8+ T cells following s.c. infection with WSN-gB. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 400 PFU by s.c. injection into the footpad. At 48 h (C) and 72 h (D) following infection, DC were enriched from popliteal lymph node and flow cytometrically sorted into Langerhans cells (CD205+CD8α+/−), dermal DC (CD205intCD8α−), CD8α DC (CD205+CD8α+) or DN DC (CD205−CD8α−). Titrating numbers of purified DC subsets were cocultured with 5×104 CFSE-labelled gBT-I CD8+ T cells. The x-axis shows the range of DC used as stimulators over different experiments. Proliferation was analysed at 60 hr of culture. Data are pooled from three independent experiments and show the mean and SEM. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in T cell proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.
