C57BL/6 mice were infected with 400 PFU by s.c. injection into the footpad. At 48 h (<em>C</em>) and 72 h (<em>D</em>) following infection, DC were enriched from popliteal lymph node and flow cytometrically sorted into Langerhans cells (CD205<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+/−</sup>), dermal DC (CD205<sup>int</sup>CD8α<sup>−</sup>), CD8α DC (CD205<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>) or DN DC (CD205<sup>−</sup>CD8α<sup>−</sup>). Titrating numbers of purified DC subsets were cocultured with 5×10<sup>4</sup> CFSE-labelled gBT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The x-axis shows the range of DC used as stimulators over different experiments. Proliferation was analysed at 60 hr of culture. Data are pooled from three independent experiments and show the mean and SEM. Significant differences (<em>p</em>≤0.05) in T cell proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.</p>
