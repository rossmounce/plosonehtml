                Figure 4.  Highly efficient antigen presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is limited to the early phase of infection following s.c. viral infection.2×106 CFSE-labelled purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for the HA epitopes of influenza were adoptively transferred into naïve BALB/c mice infected on days 1 to 5 respectively with PR8 influenza virus. Proliferation of T cells in the popliteal lymph node was indicated by dilution of the CFSE stain 3 days after transfer. A. Data show representative flow cytometric profiles of T cell proliferation from popliteal lymph node from one of two similar experiments and B, Histogram shows the mean number of dividing T cells in popliteal lymph node±SEM 3 days after transfer. Data are pooled from two experiments showing 5 mice for HNT CD4+ expansion and 6 mice for CL4 CD8+ expansion.
