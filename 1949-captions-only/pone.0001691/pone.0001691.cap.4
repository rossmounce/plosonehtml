Proliferation of T cells in the popliteal lymph node was indicated by dilution of the CFSE stain 3 days after transfer. <em>A.</em> Data show representative flow cytometric profiles of T cell proliferation from popliteal lymph node from one of two similar experiments and <em>B,</em> Histogram shows the mean number of dividing T cells in popliteal lymph node±SEM 3 days after transfer. Data are pooled from two experiments showing 5 mice for HNT CD4<sup>+</sup> expansion and 6 mice for CL4 CD8<sup>+</sup> expansion.</p>
