                Figure 5.  Multiple subsets of DC present influenza HA antigen to T cells in BALB/c mice infected with PR8 virus by s.c. injection into the footpad.The popliteal lymph nodes were isolated and non-DC lineages were removed by antibody depletion. CD11c+ DC subsets were purified by flow cytometric sorting into DN DC, CD8α DC and pDC before culturing titrating numbers of each subset with 5×104 CFSE-labelled influenza-specific CD8+ T cells (A,C) or CD4+ T cells (B,D) 48 (A,B) and 72 (C,D) h after infection. The x-axis shows the range of DC used as stimulators over different experiments. Proliferation was analysed at 60 h of culture. Data are pooled from (A–C) three and four (D) independent experiments and show the mean and SEM. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.
