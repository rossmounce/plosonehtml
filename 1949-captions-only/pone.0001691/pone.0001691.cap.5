CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC subsets were purified by flow cytometric sorting into DN DC, CD8α DC and pDC before culturing titrating numbers of each subset with 5×10<sup>4</sup> CFSE-labelled influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<em>A,C</em>) or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<em>B,D</em>) 48 (<em>A,B</em>) and 72 (<em>C,D</em>) h after infection. The x-axis shows the range of DC used as stimulators over different experiments. Proliferation was analysed at 60 h of culture. Data are pooled from (<em>A–C</em>) three and four (<em>D</em>) independent experiments and show the mean and SEM. Significant differences (<em>p</em>≤0.05) in proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.</p>
