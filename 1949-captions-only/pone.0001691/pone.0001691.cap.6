                Figure 6.  Lymph node-resident and tissue-derived trafficking DC prime naïve influenza HA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells following s.c. infection with influenza PR8.Naïve BALB/c mice infected with influenza virus (PR8) by s.c. injection. 48 (A,B) or 72 h (C,D) after infection, DC were enriched from the popliteal lymph nodes and flow cytometrically purified into Langerhans cells (CD11c+ CD205+), dermal DC (CD11c+ CD205int), CD8α (CD11c+ CD8+) DC or DN (CD11c+CD8−CD205−) before culturing titrating numbers of purified DC with 5×104 CFSE-labelled CD8+ (CL4) or CD4+ (HNT) T cells specific for the HA epitopes of influenza. The x-axis shows the range of DC used as stimulators over different experiments (A,B) or the number of DC (C,D) used in each well. Proliferation was analysed at 60 hr of culture. Data represent the mean±SEM of four (A,B) and three (C,D) independent experiments.
