                Figure 7.  Dendritic cell subsets mediating MHC class I and class II-restricted antigen presentation differ following intravenous infection.A,B, 24 h after infection with PR8 virus, non-DC were depleted from spleens and the remaining cells were purified by flow cytometry into CD8α DC (CD8α+CD45RA−), CD4 DC (CD4+CD45RA−), and pDC (CD8α−CD4−CD45RA−); or C,D alternately, CD8α DC (CD8α+CD4−), CD4 DC (CD8α−CD4+) or DN DC (CD8α−CD4−) subsets. Titrating numbers of each subset was cocultured with 5×104 CFSE-labelled HA-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells and the amount of proliferation was measured at 60 h of culture by the loss of CFSE fluorescence. Data show the mean±SEM of three (A,C) to four (B,D) independent experiments. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.
