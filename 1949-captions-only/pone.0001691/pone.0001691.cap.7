Titrating numbers of each subset was cocultured with 5×10<sup>4</sup> CFSE-labelled HA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the amount of proliferation was measured at 60 h of culture by the loss of CFSE fluorescence. Data show the mean±SEM of three (A,C) to four (B,D) independent experiments. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in proliferation induced by different DC populations are indicated by an asterisk.</p>
