The IdeS cleavage sites are indicated. (B) The following samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. <span class="underline">Lane 1</span>: Five µg of human polyclonal IgG in 10 µl PBS. <span class="underline">Lane 2</span>: Five µg of human polyclonal IgG and 1 µg of IdeS in 10 µl PBS (IgG and IdeS were preincubated for three hours at 37°C before SDS-PAGE). <span class="underline">Lane 3</span>: Ten µl of plasma from human blood diluted 1:50 in PBS <span class="underline">Lane 4</span>: One hundred µl of human blood was preincubated with 1 µg of IdeS for three hours at 37°C. The plasma from this sample (containing approximately 20 µg/ml) was diluted 1:50 in PBS, and 10 µl of this material was separated in lane 4. The asterisk indicates the IgG heavy chain.</p>
