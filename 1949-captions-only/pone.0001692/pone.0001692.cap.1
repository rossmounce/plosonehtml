                Figure 1.  IdeS cleaves IgG in human blood.(A) Structure of IgG. The IdeS cleavage sites are indicated. (B) The following samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Lane 1: Five µg of human polyclonal IgG in 10 µl PBS. Lane 2: Five µg of human polyclonal IgG and 1 µg of IdeS in 10 µl PBS (IgG and IdeS were preincubated for three hours at 37°C before SDS-PAGE). Lane 3: Ten µl of plasma from human blood diluted 1:50 in PBS Lane 4: One hundred µl of human blood was preincubated with 1 µg of IdeS for three hours at 37°C. The plasma from this sample (containing approximately 20 µg/ml) was diluted 1:50 in PBS, and 10 µl of this material was separated in lane 4. The asterisk indicates the IgG heavy chain.
