                Figure 3.  Invivo cleavage and removal of IgG from the blood circulation of rabbits injected with IdeS.(A) SDS-PAGE of rabbit polyclonal IgG (5 µg in 10 µl PBS) alone (lane 1), or preincubated with IdeS (5 µg IgG and 1 µg IdeS in 10 µl PBS) for three hours at 37°C (lane 2). Bands corresponding to IdeS (61 kDa), IgG heavy chains (Hc, 56 kDa), IdeS-generated Hc fragments (31 kDa) and IgG light chains ( Lc, 25 kDa), are indicated. (B) Levels of IgG (grey bars) and IdeS (⋄) in serum samples from a rabbit injected i.v. with IdeS (5 mg diluted in 2.5 ml PBS). IgG was determined by ELISA and IdeS by Western blotting and chemoluminescence in a Chemidoc XRS Imaging system. Samples were analyzed three times and mean values±SD are indicated.
