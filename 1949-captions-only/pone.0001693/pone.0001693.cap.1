                Figure 1.  State-space model for the regulatory gene network responding to silica stimulation in cultured human fibroblasts.The numbers next to the edges are the coefficients in the state-space equations for the normal (black color) and SSc (red color) fibroblasts, respectively. The numbers in the boxes denote the mean expression values of the genes in normal (black color) and SSc (red color) fibroblasts.
