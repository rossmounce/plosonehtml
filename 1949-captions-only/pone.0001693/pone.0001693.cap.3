<h4>Root-Locus Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>The performance of the gene networks under the design for stability, time response and reliability can be studied by analysis of their corresponding closed-loop system. The basic features of the stability and transient response of the closed-loop system are largely determined by the location of the closed-loop poles, which in turn is related to the value of the loop gain <a href="#pone.0001693-Ogata1">[13]</a>. The roots of the characteristic equation of a system which is derived from the denominator of transfer function of the closed-loop system are the system's closed-loop poles. In general, the poles are complex variable and can be represented on the complex plane which is called s-plane. (Negative real) poles on the left hand side of the complex plane cause the response to decrease, while poles on the right hand side cause it to increase. Consequently, if the poles of the closed-loop system lie in the left half s plane, the system is stable. If any of these poles lies in the right-hand side of the s-plane, then the system is unstable. In this case, with increasing time, the transient response of the system will increase monotonically or oscillate with increasing magnitude <a href="#pone.0001693-Ogata1">[13]</a>. As the loop gain changes the location of the closed-loop, poles will also changes. A root locus is defined as the locus of the poles of a transfer function of a closed-loop as a specific parameter (generally, loop gain) is varied from zero to infinity. The locus of the poles will be plotted on the complex plane (s-plane) as the system gain is varied on some interval. Since the location of the poles will change as the gain changes a system that is stable for gain K<sub>1</sub> may become unstable for a different gain K<sub>2</sub>. We often observe that the root-locus will move from the left-hand of the s-plane to the right-hand of the s-plane, which implies that stable system becomes unstable as the system gain changes from one region to another region.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2"></a><p>The root-locus plots the locations of the poles of the closed-loop single input and single output system (SISO) as the system gain varies. We use the symbol “x” to denote the poles of the closed-loop SISO and the symbol circle “o” to denote the zeros of the open-loop SISO. If the pole and zero coincide then the symbol : will be used to represent this situation. To study the dynamic behavior of the five genes to respond to the perturbation of silica, we consider the SISO system which takes one of the five genes as the output and silica as the input.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3"></a><p><a href="#pone-0001693-g004">Figures 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E</a>, and <a href="#pone-0001693-g005">Figures 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E</a> show the root-locus plot of <em>SPARC</em>, <em>TIMP3</em>, <em>COL3A1</em>, <em>CTGF</em>, and <em>COL1A2</em> with silica as the input in the normal and SSc fibroblasts, respectively. We noted that three remarkable features emerged from two panels of the Figures. First, all poles of the closed-loop SISO systems for five genes in the normal cell lines lie in the left hand side of the s-plane, but their corresponding poles in the SSc fibroblasts lie in the right hand side of the s-plane. This indicates that the expressions of all five genes to respond to the disturbance of the environmental silica in normal fibroblasts are stable, but become unstable in the SSc fibroblasts, which confirms the previous stability assessment. Second, although all poles of the closed-loop SISO for five genes in the normal fibroblasts are on the left hand side of the s-plane, the <em>SPARC</em>, <em>COL3A1, CTGF and COL1A2</em>, each has at least one branch of the root-locus plot which will enter the right-hand side of the s-plane. This indicates that the system becomes unstable as the increasing system gain reaches the some range. This may imply that the regulations of these four genes are sensitive to the changes of the system. Third, the poles and zeros of the SISO on the right hand sides of the s-plane for the <em>SPARC</em> and <em>TIMP3</em> in the SSc fibroblasts have the same location, i.e., the poles and zeros are cancelled out. This shows that the expressions of <em>CTGF</em>, <em>COL1A2</em> and <em>COL3A1</em> in response to the perturbation of the silica are more unstable than that of <em>SPARC</em> and <em>TIMP3</em>. Differential regulations of <em>CTGF</em>, <em>COL1A2</em> and <em>COL3A1</em> in response to the perturbation of silica between the normal and SSc fibroblasts may imply that the interactions of these three genes with the silica may be involved in the pathogenesis of the SSc. Forth, these Figures also demonstrate that when normal fibroblasts were changed to SSc fibroblasts, the root-locus will be moved toward the right-half s-plane. Classical control theory indicates that moving of the root-locus toward the right-half s-plane will reduce stability and increase response time of the system.</p>
