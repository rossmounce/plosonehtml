<h4>Controllability</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Changes in expression levels of genes and proteins in the regulatory networks will lead to status transition of the cells from normal cells to abnormal cells. One way to correct molecular changes is to transform cells from an undesirable state to a desirable one by altering gene or protein expressions. Now the question is whether we can use potentially therapeutic interventions to change gene or protein expressions from undesired states to desired states. This important issue can be addressed by examining the controllability of gene regulatory networks.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>The fundamental controllability in gene regulation is associated with two questions. The first question is whether an input (therapy) can be found such that the system states can be driven from the undesired initial value to the desired values in a given time interval. The second question is how difficult it may be to change the system from undesired states to the desired states if the system is controllable.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3"></a><p>The system (regulatory network) is called controllable, if for any state of the system, there exists a finite time and an admissible control function such that the system can achieve the desired state transition. In other words, the state controllability indicates that we can find an input to change the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time. The controllability provides a binary information about whether the system is controllable or not, but it does not provide a quantitative measure to quantify the amount of control effort needed to accomplish the control task. It has been recognized that to get into insides of controllability of the system it is indispensible to define a quantity to measure how the system is controllable. In other words, we need to develop a measure to evaluate the amount of control efforts required to change the system from the initial state to the desired state <a href="#pone.0001693-Vinson1">[39]</a>. The test for controllability is that the controllability matrix (see <a href="#s4">methods</a>) has full rank, i.e., the rank of the controllability matrix is equal to the number of the state variables of the system. To assess how difficult to achieve control goal, we calculated the conditional number of the controllability matrix which measures the degree of difficulty to change the state of the system (or gene expression in our problem) by the external forces such as treatments. The larger the conditional number of controllability matrix, the more control efforts required to accomplish control task.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4"></a><p>The rank of controllability matrix of the system in the state-space model of this partial TGF-β pathway under perturbation of silica in both normal and SSc fibroblasts is equal to 5 which is the number of the state variables in the model. Thus, TGF-β pathway is controllable in both normal and SSc fibroblasts. However, the conditional numbers of the controllability matrix of the system for normal and SSc fibroblasts were 80 and 398, respectively, which showed that the conditional number of the controllability matrix for the SSc fibroblasts is much larger than that for normal fibroblasts. Therefore, much more control efforts are required to change gene expressions to desired levels for the SSc fibroblasts than that for the normal fibroblasts. This implies that the controllability of this network between the normal and SSc fibroblasts are differentiable.</p>

<div id="section3" class="section"><a id="s3" name="s3" toc="s3" title="Discussion"></a><h3>Discussion</h3><a id="article1.body1.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.p1"></a><p>In the past, large efforts have been devoted to studying the function of individual genes and static properties of biological pathways. However, the molecular concentrations and activities in living organisms are in constant change as a result of their interactions. The pathogenesis of disease involves evolution and temporal process. The functions of the cells, tissues and entire organisms are not only due to the steady states of the biological pathways, but also due to the dynamic interactions of biological pathways with the external environments. Although investigation of the function of individual genes, proteins and steady-states of the biological pathways is still valuable, it is time to devote more efforts and resources to study dynamic behaviors and properties of the biological pathways. It is dynamic properties that play a central role in giving rise to the function of cells and organisms <a href="#pone.0001693-Wolkenhauer2">[40]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>To exemplify this principle, we studied the differential dynamic properties of a partial TGF-β signaling network under perturbation of silica between normal and SSc fibroblasts. We took this network as a dynamic system and performed dynamic system analysis. Investigation of differential dynamics of this network between the normal and SSc fibroblasts consisted of three steps. The first step was to use the EM algorithm and Kalman filter to estimate the parameters in the state-space model of this TGF-β signaling network. The second step was to study stability, the transient response and controllability of the system, and to perform root-locus analysis based on the identified state-space model of the gene network. The third step was to assess whether the dynamic properties of this network between the normal and SSc fibroblasts were different.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>Our study in dynamic analysis of these gene regulations addressed several remarkable issues. First, the stability analysis may be used as a powerful tool for identifying biological pathways that are associated with the diseases. The stability is one of systems-level principles underlying complex biological pathways <a href="#pone.0001693-Aldana1">[41]</a>. The stability of the system is the ability of the system to return to the equilibrium states after perturbation of the internal and external stimuli. The requirements for stable biological pathways are necessary conditions for the normal operations of the cells and organisms. The unstable biological pathway will inevitably lead to the malfunction of cells or even death of the living organism. Our results showed that a gene network in responding to perturbation of silica is relatively stable in the normal fibroblasts, but unstable in the SSc fibroblasts. This assessment of differential stability of biological pathway between normal and abnormal cells represents a novel approach in study associations of biological pathways with human diseases.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4"></a><p>Second, root-locus analysis can provide valuable information for finding genes that show strong differential dynamics between normal and abnormal cells. Not all genes in the unstable pathway show unstable dynamics. Expressions of some genes in the unstable pathway may be stable themselves. Our task is to distinguish the genes that show stable expressions from those show unstable expressions in the unstable pathway. The state transition matrix of the state-space model of the studied gene network in the SSc fibroblasts has three poles that were in the right hand sides of the complex s-plane (<a href="#pone-0001693-g003">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#pone-0001693-g004">4</a>), which implies that this network in the SSc fibroblasts is unstable. The zeros of the genes of SPARC and TIMP3 in SISO system coincided with three poles. Therefore, although this gene network was unstable in the SSc fibroblasts, the expressions of the genes of SPARC and TIMP3 were stable. At least one branch of the root locus plots of other three genes (<em>CTGF</em>, <em>COL1A2</em> and <em>COL3A1</em>) were on the right hand sides of the s-plane. This indicates that the responses of the genes of CTGF, COL1A2 and COL3A1 to the perturbation of silica in the SSc fibroblasts were unstable no matter how the system gains were changed. These findings can be confirmed by the transient response analysis of the genes. The poles and zeros of characteristic equations of the SISO systems of the genes in response to the perturbation of internal and external signals are intrinsic properties of the gene regulations and are largely not affected by the expressions of other genes. Unlike the concept of differential expressions of the genes where the differentially expressed genes may be just consequences of differential expressions of other genes lying up in the pathway, the differential stability of the response of the genes to the perturbation of the signal between normal and abnormal tissues may be involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Therefore, the genes showing differential stability are supposed to be associated with the diseases. The root-locus analysis and the transient response will provide new tools for identifying the genes that are associated with the diseases. The differential stability and the transient response of the gene in the response to perturbation of the environment between the normal and abnormal cells characterize the interaction between the genes and environments. Therefore, the root-locus analysis and the transient response analysis also provide a powerful tool for detection of the gene-environment interaction.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.p5"></a><p>Third, the controllability of biological pathway is an important property of the system. Germline or somatic mutations lead to the subsequent transcriptional and translational alterations which will finally cause diseases. Therapeutic interventions such as radiation, drug and gene therapy are intended to alter gene expressions from an undesired state to a desired or normal state. Gene regulation is a complex biological system. Theoretic and practical analyses in modern control theory demonstrate that there exist systems which we are not able (or find difficult) to change from undesired states to desired states of gene regulation. Now the question arises: are all biological pathways controllable? Are degrees of controllability of the biological pathways different between normal and abnormal Cells? The controllability measures the ability to move a system around in its entire state space using certain admissible intervention. In this report, we developed a conditional number of controllability matrix, to measure the degree of controllability of the system. Our results show that although a gene expression network responding to silica in both normal and SSc fibroblasts is controllable, the degree of controllability of this regulatory network between the normal and SSc fibroblasts is different. This regulatory network in the SSc fibroblasts has a low degree of controllability. In other words, adjustment of regulation of genes in the network by external intervention in the SSc fibroblasts is more difficult than that in the normal fibroblasts. We suspect that the degree of controllability is correlated with the severity of the diseases. When the diseases are at the initial stages, the biological systems are easy to move from abnormal states to the normal states. The degree of controllability of the system will provide valuable information on the curability of the diseases. Although in the past a number of authors have studied dynamic properties of biological networks, their studies have mainly used kinetic data or artificial data and nonlinear models <a href="#pone.0001693-Steuer1">[28]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001693-Chen1">[35]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001693-Binder1">[37]</a>. Due to limitation of experiments, many kinetic parameters in the genetic regulation have not been available in practice. Large-scale kinetic analysis of biological networks is infeasible. Here we use gene expressions and linear models to study dynamic properties of genetic networks. The results of this report showed that the dynamic properties of genetic network between normal and abnormal cells were differential.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p6" name="article1.body1.sec3.p6"></a><p>In summary, dynamic properties of the biological systems are intrinsic system properties. The gene expressions are the phenotype of the cells. Their changes are governed by the hidden dynamic properties of the gene regulatory systems. It is dynamic properties that determine the phenotypes of the cells. This report represents a paradigm shift from the studies of individual components and static properties of the system to the studies of dynamic properties of the system consisting of individual components.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7"></a><p>Although the preliminary results are appealing, they suffer from several limitations. First, sample sizes were small. Small sample size will limit the accuracy of the state-space models for biological pathways, which in turn affect estimation of dynamic properties of the systems. No much attention in control theory has been paid to investigation of impact of uncertainty inherent in dynamic systems on dynamic properties of the system. We will treat biological networks as stochastic dynamic system and study dynamic properties of stochastic dynamic systems in the future. Second, the quantities to characterize the dynamic properties are essentially random variables. Their distributions are unknown. We have not developed statistical methods to test significant differences in the dynamic properties of the pathways between the normal and abnormal cells. Third, the relations between the dynamic properties of the genes and their genotypes have not been investigated. Fourth, we have not performed large-scale dynamic analysis of the biological pathways. More theoretical development and large-scale real data analysis for the dynamic properties of the biological pathways are urgently needed.</p>

<h4>Dermal fibroblast cultures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1"></a><p>Skin biopsies of clinically uninvolved skin (3 mm punch) were obtained from 5 patients with SSc and 5 normal controls after informed consent was granted. All five patients fulfilled American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc <a href="#pone.0001693-Subcommittee1">[42]</a>. All five had diffuse skin involvement as defined by LeRoy et al <a href="#pone.0001693-LeRoy2">[43]</a>, and disease duration of less than five years. Skin biopsies from five normal controls with no history of autoimmune diseases undergoing dermatologic surgery were matched for age (+/− 5 years) and sex. The study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2"></a><p>The skin sample was transported in Dulbecco's Modified Essential Media (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (supplemented with an antibiotic and antimycotic) for processing the same day. The tissue sample was washed in 70% ethanol, PBS, and DMEM with 10% FCS. Cultured fibroblast cell strains were established by mincing tissues and placing them into 60 mm culture dishes secured by glass cover slips. The primary cultures were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS and supplemented with antibiotic and antimycotic.</p>


<h4>Silica stimulation on fibroblasts</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec2.p1"></a><p>The 5th passage of fibroblast strains were plated at a density of 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells in a 35 mm dish and grown until 80% confluence. Culture media then were replaced with FCS–free DMEM containing different doses (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 µM) of silica particles obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO. After 24-hour culture at this condition, the fibroblasts were harvested for extraction of RNA. The RNAs were examined with RT-PCR for gene expression of <em>COL1A2, COL3A1, TGFBRII, CTGF, SPARC</em> and <em>TIMP3</em>. The results from this dose-response assay provided an optimal dose (10 µM) in a time-dependent exposure for fibroblasts, in which 24-, 48-, 72-, 96- and 120-hour exposure of silica were assayed in cultured fibroblasts.</p>


<h4>Quantitative RT-PCR</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec3.p1"></a><p>Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using an ABI 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The specific primers and probes for each gene were purchased through Assays-on-Demand from Applied Biosystems. As described previously (19), total RNA from each sample was extracted from cultured fibroblasts described above using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technology) and treated with Dnase I (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technology). Synthesized cDNAs were mixed with primers/probes in the 2× Taqman universal PCR buffer, and then assayed on an ABI 7900. The data obtained from assays were analyzed with SDS 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The amount of total RNA in each sample was normalized with 18 S rRNA transcript levels.</p>


<h4>State-Space Model and Parameter Estimation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p1"></a><p>A biological pathway is taken as a dynamic system. The biological system is modeled by linear state-space equations defined as<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001693.e004&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(2)</span></span><br>where <em>x<sub>k</sub></em> is a vector of state variables at the time <em>k</em> that determine the dynamics of the regulation and unobserved, <em>u<sub>k</sub></em> is a vector of input variables at the time <em>k</em> such as drugs, environmental forces, and other state variables that lie outside the model, <em>y<sub>k</sub></em> are observed variables at the time , for example, the gene expressions, <em>A, B, C,</em> and <em>D</em> are matrices called state matrix, input matrix, output matrix and direct transmission matrix, respectively, <em>w</em> and <em>v</em> are noises assumed to be white Gaussian noise with zero means and variance <em>Q</em> and <em>R</em> respectively, and they are independent of each other.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec4.p2"></a><p>A fundamental and widely applicable parameter estimation method is Maximum Likelihood (ML) method that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data with respect to parameters. However, the state-space models involve unobserved state variables that are unavailable. It makes calculation of the likelihood in the setting of state-space models very difficult. To solve this problem, we use expectation-maximization (EM) Algorithm that is widely used iterative parameter estimation method <a href="#pone.0001693-Dempster1">[15]</a>. Specifically, we first assume that the state variables are available and then calculate the likelihood of both the observed data and hidden state variables which will be maximized with respect to the parameters in the models. After the estimated parameters are in our hands we then specify new state space models using the estimated parameters.</p>

<h4>Transient-Response Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p1"></a><p>Response of a biological pathway to perturbation of internal and external stimuli has two parts: the transient and the steady state response. The time varying process generated in going from the initial state to the final state in the response to the perturbation of the internal and external stimuli is called transient response. Steady-state response studies the system behavior at infinite time. Transient-response analysis of biological pathways can be used to quantify their dynamics. It can reveal how fast the biological pathways respond to perturbation of environments and how accurately the pathways can finally achieve the desired steady-state values. It can also be used to study damped vibration behavior and stability of the biological pathways.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p2"></a><p>The transient response of the dynamic systems depends on the input signals. Different signal will cause different response. There are numerous types of signal in practice. For the convenience of comparison, we consider two types of signals: (i) unit-step signal and (ii) unit-impulse signal as shown in <a href="#pone-0001693-g002">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.p3"></a><p>The transient response of dynamic systems can be studied by transfer function that is used to characterize the input-output relationships of a linear, time-invariant, differential equation system. The transfer function is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output to the Laplace transform of the input under the assumption of zero initial conditions. The transfer function of the response of the biological pathway to unit-step and unit-impulse input signals are given by <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001693.e023&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> and <em>Y</em>(<em>s</em>) = <em>G</em>(<em>s</em>) respectively, where <em>G</em>(<em>s</em>) is the transfer function of the biological pathway. The transient-response analysis of the biological pathway can be performed by inverse Laplace transformation. We performed the transient-response analysis with MATLAB <a href="#pone.0001693-Ogata1">[13]</a>.</p>


<h4>Stability Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec8.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec8.p1"></a><p>The most important dynamic property of biological pathways is concerned with stability. Dynamic systems are called stable if their variables such as gene expressions return to, or towards, their original or equilibrium states following internal and external perturbations. For any practical purpose, the biological pathways must be stable. Unstable gene regulations will lead to the malfunction or even the death of the cells. A biological pathway will remain at steady state until occurrence of external perturbation. Depending on dynamic behavior of the system after perturbation of environments, the steady-states of the system are either stable (the system returns to the initial state or changes to other steady-states) or unstable (the system leaves the initial equilibrium state).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec8.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec8.p2"></a><p>One of the methods for assessing the stability of the linear dynamic systems is to analyze eigenvalues of the state transition matrix <em>A</em> of the linear dynamic systems. For a continuous linear dynamic system, if real parts of all eigenvalues of the transition matrix <em>A</em> are strictly negative then the system is stable. For a discrete linear system, if the norm of all eigenvalues of the state transition matrix <em>A</em> is less than 1 then the system is stable.</p>


<h4>Root-Locus Analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec9.p1"></a><p>Open and close loop poles and zeros largely determine the stability and performance of the open and close systems. They provide valuable information on how to improve stability and transient response of the systems. Root-locus analysis, in which the roots of the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system are plotted for all values of a system parameter, is a powerful tool for study and design of dynamic pathway. The loop gain is often chosen to be the parameter. Varying the gain value will change the location of the closed-loop poles.</p>
