The following proteins are shown: GALA4 from <em>R. Solanacearum,</em> strain GMI1000 GenBank accession number <span class="underline">CAD15502</span>; GALA protein from <em>Legionella pneumophila</em> subsp.pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1, <span class="underline">AAU27032</span>; hypothetical protein from <em>Arabidopsis thaliana,</em> <span class="underline">AAF82144</span>; putative regulatory subunit from <em>Gemmata sp. Wa1-1</em>, <span class="underline">AAX07517</span>; hypothetical protein from <em>Parachlamydia sp. UWE25</em>, <span class="underline">CAF23996</span>; hypothetical protein from <em>Parachlamydia sp. UWE25,</em> <span class="underline">CAF24006</span>. (B) Alignment of some known (indicated by *) and newly identified LRR consensus sequences. (C) A consensus sequences of an updated CC-LRR. The boxes over the alignment outline known or putative α-helical and β-structural regions. Bold uppercase and lowercase letters indicate more than 60% and 20% identity, correspondingly. “O” denotes an apolar residue, “x” denotes any residue, “-“ is a position of a gap. Numbers below the GALA-LRR consensus sequence show the positions of conserved residues (see also <a href="#pone-0001694-g002">Figure 2A</a>).</p>
