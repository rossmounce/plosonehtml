                Figure 1.  Specific consensus patterns of GALA-LRRs and GL-LRRs.(A) An arrangement of LRRs (rhombs), F-boxes (rectangles) and BTB domain (ellipse) within new representative proteins of CC-LRR subfamily. The following proteins are shown: GALA4 from R. Solanacearum, strain GMI1000 GenBank accession number CAD15502; GALA protein from Legionella pneumophila subsp.pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1, AAU27032; hypothetical protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, AAF82144; putative regulatory subunit from Gemmata sp. Wa1-1, AAX07517; hypothetical protein from Parachlamydia sp. UWE25, CAF23996; hypothetical protein from Parachlamydia sp. UWE25, CAF24006. (B) Alignment of some known (indicated by *) and newly identified LRR consensus sequences. (C) A consensus sequences of an updated CC-LRR. The boxes over the alignment outline known or putative α-helical and β-structural regions. Bold uppercase and lowercase letters indicate more than 60% and 20% identity, correspondingly. “O” denotes an apolar residue, “x” denotes any residue, “-“ is a position of a gap. Numbers below the GALA-LRR consensus sequence show the positions of conserved residues (see also Figure 2A).
