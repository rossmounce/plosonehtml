                Figure 2.  Structural model of GALA-LRR.(A) CÎ±-trace superposition of a modeled GALA-LRR and the known CC-LRR from human Skp2 protein [10] and RI-LRR from porcine ribonuclease inhibitor [46]. GALA-LRR model is shown in a ball-and-stick representation, CC-LRR is shown by a blue trace and RI-LRR by a magenta trace. Numbering of the conserved GALA-LRR residues is taken from Figure 1. Numbers in red point to positions inferred to be under positive selection. The carbon atoms are in green, oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue. (B) A ribbon diagram of a structural model of the C-terminal LRR domain of GALA4 type III effector protein from R. solanacearum (strain MolK2, region 170 to 460, accession code ZP_00946474). The figure was generated with Pymol [47]. The atomic coordinates of the model are available on request.
