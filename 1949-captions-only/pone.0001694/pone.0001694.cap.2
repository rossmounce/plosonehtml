GALA-LRR model is shown in a ball-and-stick representation, CC-LRR is shown by a blue trace and RI-LRR by a magenta trace. Numbering of the conserved GALA-LRR residues is taken from <a href="#pone-0001694-g001">Figure 1</a>. Numbers in red point to positions inferred to be under positive selection. The carbon atoms are in green, oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue. (B) A ribbon diagram of a structural model of the C-terminal LRR domain of GALA4 type III effector protein from <em>R. solanacearum</em> (strain MolK2, region 170 to 460, accession code ZP_00946474). The figure was generated with Pymol <a href="#pone.0001694-DeLano1">[47]</a>. The atomic coordinates of the model are available on request.</p>
