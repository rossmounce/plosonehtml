                Figure 3.  Side-by-side packing of LRRs having different consensus sequence motifs.“Knobs-into-holes” packing of GALA-LRRs against CC LRRs (contoured by a thin line box) and “knobs-into-knobs” packing of PS-LRRs, RI-LRRs, SDS22-LRRs, typical LRRs, bacterial LRRs against CC-LRRs. The CC-LRR-domain is in blue color. The side-chains that are involved in the inter-domain packing are shown by ball-and-stick representation. Arrows point at the clash sites where Cα and (or) Cβ atoms have distances between of 2.1–2.7 Å.
