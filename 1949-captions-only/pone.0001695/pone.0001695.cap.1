                Figure 1.  Test paradigm for crayfish visual recognition.(a) Fights between size-matched crayfish to familiarize opponents. These fights occurred, one pair at a time, in the central area of the tank shown. The tank was cleaned between encounters. (b) Winners and losers were transferred to the test arena with a pen and choice area at each end. The focal losing crayfish could spend time in any of the three areas, two of which would indicate preference for proximity to a specific animal. The figure shows a focal crayfish visiting the familiar animal from the previous encounter. Features, for example facial width and color, were varied between the stimulus animals in the pens. The window prevents chemical and mechanical cues from passing but does not interfere with vision.
