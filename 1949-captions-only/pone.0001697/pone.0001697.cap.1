Orange vectors are statistically significant (α = .05) under an upper-tail Monte Carlo test of 10,000 trials and a sparse false discovery rate (sFDR) correction. Non-significant vectors are color-coded by Monte Carlo <em>P</em> value: the brighter the yellow, the greater the support. Quintiles are defined by breaks in ranked <em>P</em> values of more than .01, except within the final quintile. The map is based on satellite photos made available in World Wind 1.4 (<a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/">http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/</a>).</p>
