                Figure 1.  H5N1 Migration as Inferred by Parsimony.Map of H5N1 migration events inferred by parsimony through maximum likelihood phylogeny for 481 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences sampled across 28 Eurasian and African localities 1996–2006 (2≤n≤65 isolates per locality). Orange vectors are statistically significant (α = .05) under an upper-tail Monte Carlo test of 10,000 trials and a sparse false discovery rate (sFDR) correction. Non-significant vectors are color-coded by Monte Carlo P value: the brighter the yellow, the greater the support. Quintiles are defined by breaks in ranked P values of more than .01, except within the final quintile. The map is based on satellite photos made available in World Wind 1.4 (http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/).
