Rectangle represents the hypothesized ancestral genotype. All genotypes, except two, are represented by a single isolate. The exceptions are represented by two isolates (‘2’). Squares represent significant nested clade distances and triangles significant within clade distances as determined by nested clade analysis. Black shapes represent nodes at which subclades express significantly greater distances than expected by chance begin and extend to the tips of the branch. Gray shapes represent the starting node of a subclade of lesser distance than expected by chance. d) Migration events through section of H5N1 maximum likelihood tree showing 49 samples of a single clade 2.3 H5N1 strain circulating in southern China 2004–2006 and sister group to the 67 isolates shown in (a). e) The migration events for the 49 isolates mapped onto a World Wind satellite photo.</p>
