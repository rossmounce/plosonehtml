Localities in red are situated in southern China, in dark red southwestern China (Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi), in pink northern China, in green in nearby Asian countries (Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam), and in olive green regions reached by the Qinghai-like strain (e.g., Mongolia, Crimea, Iraq, Africa). Localities referred to in the text include FJ = Fujian, GD = Guangdong, HK = Hong Kong, HU = Hunan, IN = Indonesia, IT = Italy, JA = Japan, TH = Thailand, VN = Vietnam.</p>
