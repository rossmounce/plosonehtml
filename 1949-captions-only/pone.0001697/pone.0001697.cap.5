                Figure 5.  Generalized Mantel Test Across H5N1 Distance Matrices.Pairwise Mantel test for correspondence based on Spearman correlation ranks for six distance matrices defined for H5N1 phylogeny of 481 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences across 28 Eurasian and African localities: 1) migration events through the phylogeny symmetricized across the migration matrix diagonal (SME), 2) differences in isolates sample size (SS), 3) geographic distances (Geo), 4) UniFrac distances, 5) mean phylogenetic distances (MPD), and 6) mean nearest neighbor distances (MNND). Correlations are blocked out in color and upper-tail P values in gray scale. P values for pairwise comparisons between localities significant under false discovery rate correction are boxed in gold borders.
