                Figure 2.  Silencing of the VILIP-1 gene in human lung cancer cell lines.A. Western blot result from normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and 12 NSCLC cell lines. VILIP-1 was identified as 22 kDa. Glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as loading control. B. Northern blot of total RNA extracted from NHBE and 12 NSCLC cell lines probed with VILIP-1 full-length cDNA. Immunohistochemistry of VILIP-1 in subcutaneous tumors derived from the NSCLC cell lines, C: NCI-H520, D: Calu1, E: Calu6, and F: A549. ×100. Effect of methylation on VILIP-1 promoter activity (G). pGL4.10 vector containing in vitro methylated (filled circles) or nonmethylated (no circles) VILIP-1 promoter fragment was transfected into NCI-H520 or NCI-H522 cells. Transfection efficiency was normalized to the cotransfected pGL4.73 vector. The data presented as mean±SD (bars) of triplicate experiments.
