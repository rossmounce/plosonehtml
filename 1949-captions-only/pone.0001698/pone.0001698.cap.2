Western blot result from normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and 12 NSCLC cell lines. VILIP-1 was identified as 22 kDa. Glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as loading control. B. Northern blot of total RNA extracted from NHBE and 12 NSCLC cell lines probed with <em>VILIP-1</em> full-length cDNA. Immunohistochemistry of VILIP-1 in subcutaneous tumors derived from the NSCLC cell lines, C: NCI-H520, D: Calu1, E: Calu6, and F: A549. ×100. Effect of methylation on VILIP-1 promoter activity (G). pGL4.10 vector containing <em>in vitro</em> methylated (filled circles) or nonmethylated (no circles) VILIP-1 promoter fragment was transfected into NCI-H520 or NCI-H522 cells. Transfection efficiency was normalized to the cotransfected pGL4.73 vector. The data presented as mean±SD (bars) of triplicate experiments.</p>
