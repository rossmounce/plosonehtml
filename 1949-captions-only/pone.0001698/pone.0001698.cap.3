Schematic map of VILIP-1 2kb promoter and CpG islands around exon1. Filled boxes, CpG islands. Open boxes, exons. Vertical ticks, CpG sites on the expanded axis. Start of exon 1 is marked at +1. TSS, translation start site (ATG start codon). B. MSP analysis of cell lines. Bands in lanes M are methylated, bands in lanes U are unmethylated. H<sub>2</sub>O: water was added instead of DNA; Untreated DNA: genomic DNA without treatment with sodium bisulfite; NHBE 1 and NHBE 2: DNA from two different individuals. C. Representative results of bisulfite sequencing of the second CpG island of VILIP-1 promoter in VILIP-1-expressing cell lines (+) and VILIP-1-nonexpressing cell lines (−). Open and filled squares indicate unmethylated and methylated CpG sites, respectively. Six to eight clones of PCR products amplified from bisulfite-treated genomic DNA were sequenced for each cell line. D. Reactivation of VILIP-1 expression by 5′-Aza-dC treatment in cell lines. VILIP-1 protein expression was determined by immunoblot analysis. GAPDH was included as a control for equal loading.</p>
