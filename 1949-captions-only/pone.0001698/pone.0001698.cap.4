Induction of VILIP-1 expression by treatment with histone deacetylation inhibitor TSA in 6 cancer cell lines. Cells were treated for 20 hr with TSA at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ng/ml before lysis. VILIP-1 expression was detected by Western blot. GAPDH was used as loading control. B. Effect of TSA treatment on the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 at the second CpG island of <em>VILIP-1</em> promoter in A549, Calu1, NCI-H460, HOP62, H522 and HOP92 cells. Cells were treated with TSA (200 ng/ml) for 20 hr and histone acetylation status was analyzed using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Amplification of DNA before precipitation (1% of the total sample) was used as input. VILIP-1 immunohistochemistry of bronchial epithelium showing positively stained cells (arrows): Normal mucosa (C), regular metaplasia exhibiting positive immunostain in basal and parabasal layers (D), metaplasia with dysplasia has little to no VILIP-1 expression (E). Panel F shows a SCC without VILIP-1 expression, whereas in panel G the protein is expressed abundantly in approximately 50% of tumor cells. Adenocarcinoma (H) shows no VILIP-1 immunostain, note that the covering bronchial epithelium in this panel shows a few positive basal cells (arrow). Ã—100.</p>
