                Figure 2.  Results Representational limits in VSTM.A. Capacity of iconic memory depends on strength of after-image; unlimited for strong after-images and lower, but still high for weak after-images. B. Capacity of fragile VSTM not dependent on strength of after-image; capacity high for both kinds of stimuli. C. Capacity of robust VSTM not dependent on strength of after-image; capacity more or less limited to about 4 figures. Data are plotted as mean Cowan's K+SEM.
