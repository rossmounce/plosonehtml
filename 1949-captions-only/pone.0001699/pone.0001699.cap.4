                Figure 4.  Results Stability of VSTM representations.A. Iconic memory is overwritten by presenting a light mask. B. Fragile VSTM is not influenced by the presence of a light mask, but a pattern mask erases fragile VSTM representations leading to drop-off in performance to robust VSTM levels. Data are plotted as mean Cowan's K+SEM.
