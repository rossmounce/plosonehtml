Identical perceptual organization between memory and probe array. B. Perceptual organization is absent in probe array. C. Perceptual organization is disrupted between memory and probe array. D. A change in perceptual organization between memory and probe array does not influence the capacity of fragile VSTM, but it slightly reduces capacity of robust VSTM. Data are plotted as mean Cowan's K+SEM.</p>
