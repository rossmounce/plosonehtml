                Figure 6.  Capacity of VSTM for complex objects.A. Memory array with alphanumeric stimuli. B. Memory array with horoscope stimuli. C. Cue display. D. Retro-cue condition measuring fragile VSTM E. Post-cue condition measuring robust VSTM. F. Capacity of fragile VSTM is about twice the capacity of robust VSTM regardless of stimulus complexity. Rectangle data are adopted from Exp. 1 with set size 8. Data are plotted as mean Cowan's K+SEM.
