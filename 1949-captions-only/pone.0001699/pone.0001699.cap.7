                Figure 7.  Lifetime of VSTM representations.A. Memory array. B. Cue display. C. Retro-cue condition measuring fragile VSTM with variable blank interval of 1000, 2500, 4000 or 5500 ms until cueing. D. Post-cue condition measuring robust VSTM with variable blank interval of 900, 2400, 3900 or 5400 ms until cueing. E. High-capacity, fragile VSTM decays linearly over time, whereas limited-capacity, robust VSTM is more or less durable. Data are plotted as mean Cowan's K+SEM.
