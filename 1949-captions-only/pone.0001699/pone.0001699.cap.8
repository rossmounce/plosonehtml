                Figure 8.  Phosphor persistence of CRT monitor.Phosphor persistence lasts approximately 6.4 ms after peak amplitude. Data are averages of 100 trials of single frame presentations of pure white light (87.66 cd/m2) presented at a refresh rate of 100 Hz. Each single frame presentation of light was followed by a 200-ms blank period.
