The two stress response pathways monitored in our experiments, sporulation and synthesis of the degradative enzyme subtilisin, are denoted by bold-faced ovals. The fluorescent reporters (GFP and DsRed) fused to the respective promoters P<em>spoIIE</em> and P<em>aprE</em> are indicated (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>).</p>
