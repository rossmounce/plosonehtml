                Figure 2.  An ‘adaptive’ memory experiment.In an adaptive memory experiment, each (identical) sample of a biological system is subjected to one of several conditions prior to time t0, and then observed in a common condition after t0. If different past histories lead to different short-term behaviors in current conditions, the system can be said to exhibit short-term memory. If different past histories lead to different long-term behaviors, the system can be said to exhibit long-term memory.
