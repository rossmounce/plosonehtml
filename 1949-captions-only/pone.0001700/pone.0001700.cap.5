The 10 cell histories tested consisted of growth in either rich LB medium or poorer GM medium to one of five densities D, −1, −2, −3, −4, (see experimental overview section and <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> for details). Fluorescent intensities in (a–b) were divided by OD600 (c) and then normalized to a [0 1] scale by dividing by the maximum. The error bars show standard deviation over replicates at each time point.</p>
