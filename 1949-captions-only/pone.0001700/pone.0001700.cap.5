                Figure 5.  B. subtilis memory data compendium.These plots show the dynamics of the sporulation initiation reporter PspoIIE-gfp expression (a), the degradative enzyme synthesis reporter PaprE-dsred expression (b), and cell growth (c) of B. subtilis KEE after the onset of starvation (resuspension in SM) as a function of cell history prior to starvation, as measured by fluorescence (GFP, and DsRed) and OD600 time series measurements taken every 15 minutes for 24 hours, respectively. The 10 cell histories tested consisted of growth in either rich LB medium or poorer GM medium to one of five densities D, −1, −2, −3, −4, (see experimental overview section and Materials and Methods for details). Fluorescent intensities in (a–b) were divided by OD600 (c) and then normalized to a [0 1] scale by dividing by the maximum. The error bars show standard deviation over replicates at each time point.
