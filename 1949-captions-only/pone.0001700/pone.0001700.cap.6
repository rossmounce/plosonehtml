This figure shows the heat maps for each signal in <a href="#pone-0001700-g005">Figure 5</a> (dark red indicates maximum, and dark blue minimum), the number of behavioral classes for each signal, and which subset of the ten cell histories in our test set corresponds to each cluster. For example, the asymptotic sporulation initiation signal from P<em>spoIIE</em>-<em>gfp</em> fusion clustered into two classes, one (top, 1) corresponding to a history of growth in rich LB medium to the three highest densities, D, −1, and −2, and the other class (bottom, 2) corresponding to all other cell histories.</p>
