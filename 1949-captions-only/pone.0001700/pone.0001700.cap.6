                Figure 6.  The map from cell history to B. subtilis stress response clusters.The transient dynamics and long-term levels of the sporulation initiation (PspoIIE-gfp expression), AprE synthesis (PaprE-dsred expression), and growth (OD600) signals were clustered using the automatic method in Materials and Methods. This figure shows the heat maps for each signal in Figure 5 (dark red indicates maximum, and dark blue minimum), the number of behavioral classes for each signal, and which subset of the ten cell histories in our test set corresponds to each cluster. For example, the asymptotic sporulation initiation signal from PspoIIE-gfp fusion clustered into two classes, one (top, 1) corresponding to a history of growth in rich LB medium to the three highest densities, D, −1, and −2, and the other class (bottom, 2) corresponding to all other cell histories.
