                Figure 2.  Cannabinoid receptor 2 and endocannabinoid levels in chronic pancreatitis.Using an anti-CB2 antibody, tubular complexes were strongly stained (A). Invading mononuclear cells were also immunopositive (B), whereas intrapancreatic nerves were mostly unstained or only faintly positive (B). Pancreatic stellate cells were immunopositive for CB2 (C). The endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 1+2-arachidonoylglycerol (1+2-AG) were lower in chronic pancreatitis (AEA: p = 0.14 and 1+2-AG: p = 0.0066; D). Cultured pancreatic stellate cells were faintly CB2-immunopositive (E). Original magnification: x20 (A, B), x40 (C), x80 (F). Insets: negative controls. Lower insets (A): CB2 in normal pancreas.
