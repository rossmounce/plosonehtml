(B) LDH in cell culture supernatants and the fraction of apoptotic cells as judged by the GuavaNexin™ test. AM251 significantly increased IL-6 (C) but decreased MCP-1 secretion (D); AM630 had no effect on IL-6 (C) but induced a tendency towards increased MCP-1 levels (D). CB1-/2-receptor antagonism did not affect TGFbeta (E). Data are shown as mean±SEM (*, p&lt;0.05).</p>
