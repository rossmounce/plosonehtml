                Figure 4.  Cannabinoid receptor blockade alters synthesis of ECM proteins.As assessed by immunoblot analysis of cell culture supernatants, AM251 and AM630 (at 2.5 µM) did not affect collagen and fibronection secretion. In PSC cell lysates, alphaSMA levels remain unchanged following CB1-receptor antagonism whereas AM630 induced increased alphaSMA protein levels. White bars: control; black bars: AM251; grey bars: AM630. Data are shown as mean±SEM.
