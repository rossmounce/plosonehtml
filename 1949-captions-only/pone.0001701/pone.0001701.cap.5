(B) MMP-2 levels were unchanged by antagonist treatment. (C&amp;D) AM251-treated pancreatic stellate cells were smaller and thinner, with a more stretched shape, an increased length, and a loss of intracellular fibres (control PSC: insets and <a href="#pone-0001701-g008">Figure 8C&amp;D</a>). Cells treated with AM630 (E&amp;F) closely resembled the control PSC (see insets C&amp;D and <a href="#pone-0001701-g008">Figure 8C&amp;D</a>). Original magnification: x 40 (C&amp;E), x 80 (D&amp;F). Nuclear stain: DAPI. White bars: control; black bars: AM251; grey bars: AM630. Data are shown as meanÂ±SEM.</p>
