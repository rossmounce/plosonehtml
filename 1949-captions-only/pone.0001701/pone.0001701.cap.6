(B&amp;C) While AM251 and AM630 alone were not effective, pre-treatment with a combination of AM251 and AM630 blocked WIN-induced growth inhibition (D). The reduction in proliferated cells was neither due to necrosis (unchanged LDH levels) nor to apoptosis (constant low number of apoptotic cells in treated versus control PSC; E). Data are shown as mean±SEM (* p&lt;0.05).</p>
