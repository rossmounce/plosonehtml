The reduction in IL-6 and MCP-1 levels was partially reversed by a combination of the CB1-receptor and CB2-receptor antagonists AM251 and AM630 (A). While control PSC secreted significant amounts of fibronectin and collagen 1 (as seen by an intense signal at 220 and 190 kDa, respectively), treatment with WIN reduced the signal at the respective molecular weights (B; immunoblots of cell culture supernatants, pooled from three independent experiments). AlphaSMA levels were also suppressed by WIN (B; immunoblot of PSC cell lysates; gamma-tubulin: equal loading control). A combination of both antagonists AM251 and AM630 partially reversed the suppressive effects elicited by incubation with WIN (B, immunoblots of fibronectin, collagen 1 and alphaSMA). White bars: control; black bars: WIN55,212-2±AM251/AM630. Data are shown as mean±SEM.</p>
