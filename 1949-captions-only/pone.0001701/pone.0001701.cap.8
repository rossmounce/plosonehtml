A near-complete reversal of the reduced invasiveness was seen when the cells were pre-incubated with AM251 or a combination of AM251 and AM630 (A). This was not found with AM630 alone (A). WIN induced a significant decrease in MMP-2 levels (p = 0.026; B) which was partially reversible by a combination of AM251 and AM630 (B). Actin cytoskeleton staining with phalloidin demonstrated that control PSC showed the normal cellular structure (C&amp;D) but that WIN induced a more round and smaller PSC phenotype (E&amp;F). Original magnification: x 40 (C&amp;E), x 80 (D&amp;F). Nuclear stain: DAPI. White bars: control; black bars: WIN55,212-2±AM251/AM630. Data are shown as mean±SEM.</p>
