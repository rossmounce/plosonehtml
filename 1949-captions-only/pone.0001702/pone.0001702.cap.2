                Figure 2.  Results of Experiment 1.Mean percent changes of log-transformed MEP amplitude from hand muscles (FDI and ADM) versus the control condition Basal (the 100% reference line). The condition “Neutral” (N) was similar to Basal. Sniffing unimodal olfactory (O), bimodal olfacto-gustative (OG), and natural odorants as coffee and mortadella increased MEPs' size. Such facilitation of corticospinal output disappeared when sniffing odorants with a trigeminal component (OT and OTG, grey area). Notably, no cognitive tasks except sniffing are required to subjects. Statistics are in the text.
