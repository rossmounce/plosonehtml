The condition “Neutral” (N) was similar to Basal. Sniffing unimodal olfactory (O), bimodal olfacto-gustative (OG), and natural odorants as <em>coffee</em> and <em>mortadella</em> increased MEPs' size. Such facilitation of corticospinal output disappeared when sniffing odorants with a trigeminal component (OT and OTG, grey area). Notably, no cognitive tasks except sniffing are required to subjects. Statistics are in the text.</p>
