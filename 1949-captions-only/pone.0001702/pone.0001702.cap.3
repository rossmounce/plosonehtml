                Figure 3.  Results of Experiment 2 (only food objects).Graphical representations of the main significant interactions: a) an higher MEP increase occurred in FDI than in ADM when the subjects observed a grasping movement; b) similarly, an higher MEP increase occurred in FDI than in ADM when the subjects smelled a food; c) even if “smelling” produces a lower MEP increase with, than without, concomitant grasping observation, a significant further facilitation (27% in the original µV scale) was found.
