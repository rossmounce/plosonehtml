Only the congruency between the odour of <em>bombolone</em> with the observation of grasping a <em>bombolone,</em> but not other food or non-food objects, produced a significant increase of MEP size, which selectively took place in the prime mover. No changes are observed in the ADM muscle. Statistics are in the text.</p>
