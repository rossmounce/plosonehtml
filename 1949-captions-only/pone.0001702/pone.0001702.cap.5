                Figure 5.  Results of Experiment 3.Mean percentual changes of MEP amplitude versus “Basal” in the FDI muscle, which was prime mover for the observed grasping action, and in the ADM muscle which has no functional role in grasping. Only the congruency between the odour of bombolone with the observation of grasping a bombolone, but not other food or non-food objects, produced a significant increase of MEP size, which selectively took place in the prime mover. No changes are observed in the ADM muscle. Statistics are in the text.
