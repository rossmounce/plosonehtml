B, Expression levels of Aβ in independent transgenic lines (W; weak, M; moderate, S: strong expression) at 1-2dae (top panel, Aβ42), when accumulation of each Aβ in the insoluble fraction was minimum, were compared, and relative ratios were shown below each lane and in <a href="#pone.0001703.s009">Table S1</a> (n = 3). Asterisks indicate the fly lines primarily used in this study. <em>elav-Gal4<sup>c155</sup></em> flies were used as control. Tubulin was used as a loading control (bottom panel: Tu). C, ImmunoEM detection of Aβ42 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, as well as a lysosome. Gold particles are absent in the control (Control). N: nucleus, Scale bar: 1 µm. Neurons in Kenyon cell region of Aβ42 fly brains at 25dae were analyzed. D, Detection of dimers (di), trimers (tri) and tetramers (tet) in fly brains. The level of each oligomer was shown as a ratio relative to that of Aβ42. Asterisks indicate significant differences from Aβ42 (n = 3, P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test). E, Age-dependent accumulation of Aβ peptides in detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions. The ages of the flies are indicated at the bottom.</p>
