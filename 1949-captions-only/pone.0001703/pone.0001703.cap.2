The percent of flies at the top (yellow), middle (magenta) or bottom (blue) of the vial at 10 seconds after knocking flies to the bottom are shown (average±SEM (n = 10)). B, Premature death. The percent survivorship was plotted against the age (dae). C and D, Memory defects. One hour memory was assessed by Pavlovian olfactory conditioning at 5 dae (C) and 10 dae (D). Asterisks indicate a significant difference from control (n = 6 or 8, α&lt;0.05, Tukey-Kramer significant difference). Average memory scores±SEM are shown.</p>
