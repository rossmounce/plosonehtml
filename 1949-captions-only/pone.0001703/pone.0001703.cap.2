                Figure 2.  Behavioral defects in Aβ42, Aβ42Arc, and Aβ42art flies.A, Locomotor dysfunction. The percent of flies at the top (yellow), middle (magenta) or bottom (blue) of the vial at 10 seconds after knocking flies to the bottom are shown (average±SEM (n = 10)). B, Premature death. The percent survivorship was plotted against the age (dae). C and D, Memory defects. One hour memory was assessed by Pavlovian olfactory conditioning at 5 dae (C) and 10 dae (D). Asterisks indicate a significant difference from control (n = 6 or 8, α&lt;0.05, Tukey-Kramer significant difference). Average memory scores±SEM are shown.
