                Figure 3.  Cell body and neuropil degeneration in Aβ42, Aβ42Arc, and Aβ42art flies.A–E, Neurodegeneration in Aβ flies at 25 dae. The cell body and neuropil region in the mushroom body are enlarged. Arrowheads indicate neurodegeneration (C to E). F, Percentage of the area lost in the cell body (green) and neuropil (magenta) regions are shown as averages±SEM (n = 7–9 hemispheres). Asterisks indicate significant differences from Aβ42 (P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test). G, Atrophy of Calyxes (dendrites) and Lobes (axons) in Aβ flies. H and I, Areas of Calyxes and Lobes were measured as indicated in (G) and presented as averages±SEM (n = 6 hemispheres). Asterisks indicate significant differences from control (P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test). The ages of the flies are indicated at the bottom.
