In (A), nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (magenta). B,D,F,H and J, Thioflavin S (TS) staining of brains of 25 dae flies. Arrowheads and arrows indicate TS-positive deposits and neurites, respectively. No signal was detected in the control (I, J). Scale bar in J: 50 µm. (C) and (D) are enlarged images of the boxed regions in (A) and (B), respectively. K, Numbers of TS-positive deposits and neurites were presented as averages±SD (n = 6 hemispheres). Asterisks indicate significant differences from Aβ42 (P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test).</p>
