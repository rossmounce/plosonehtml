                Figure 1.  Honeybees' responses to the test odors depended upon conditioning paradigm.The filled circles represent the mean response probabilities to the test odors; the error bars indicate the standard errors predicted by a binomial response distribution. The control condition (black circles) represented a situation where honeybees received conditioning with one odor (the Δph = 0.0) in association with sucrose reward (N = 60). The red line represents the (+ +) condition in which a honeybee was conditioned with two odors (Δph = 0.0 and Δph = 0.2) both in association with sucrose reward (N = 98). The green line represents the (+ −) condition in which a honeybee was conditioned with the same two odors, but Δph = 0.0 was associated with sucrose and Δph = 0.2 was associated with salt punishment (N = 69).
