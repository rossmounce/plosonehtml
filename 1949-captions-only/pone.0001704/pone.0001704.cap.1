The control condition (black circles) represented a situation where honeybees received conditioning with one odor (the Δ<em>p<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.0) in association with sucrose reward (N = 60). The red line represents the (+ +) condition in which a honeybee was conditioned with two odors (Δ<em>p<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.0 and Δ<em>p<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.2) both in association with sucrose reward (N = 98). The green line represents the (+ −) condition in which a honeybee was conditioned with the same two odors, but Δ<em>p<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.0 was associated with sucrose and Δ<em>p<sub>h</sub></em> = 0.2 was associated with salt punishment (N = 69).</p>
