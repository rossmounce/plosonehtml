                Figure 2.  Generalization gradients for honeybees as predicted from the logistic regression models fit to the data from Figure 1.Generalization gradients for the honeybee and their relative discrimination thresholds were generated by evaluating the models fitted by the logistic regressions and extrapolating them over a wider range of Δph values than could be used in the experiments. The dotted lines show d′ thresholds (see Methods) calculated for the three conditions using signal-detection theory; the horizontal bars visible at the extrema show standard deviations on these thresholds.
