                Figure 1.  A Principal Component Analysis of control and stressed plants.The 8 accessions from the central core-collection are in bold type. The Col-0 accession is indicated by a cross. 1A/Repartition of accessions on the first (PC1 and PC2 axis) and second PCA planes (PC3 and PC4 axis). PC1 explains 27% of the variation, PC2: 23%, PC3: 18% and PC4:7%. 1B/Plots of the first and the second PCA planes on correlation circles. The measured characters are indicated respectively for watered (c) and stress (s) plants: TLA = Total leaf area, EL = Electrolytes Leakage, RWC = Relative Water Content, WKA = Water Keeping Ability. TLAc and TLAs, WKAc and WKAs, RWCc and RWCs and MDRc and MDRs are plotted on the same area, on the circle of correlation corresponding to the first plane. The MDRc and MDRs are plotted on the same area, on the circle of correlation corresponding to the second plane.
