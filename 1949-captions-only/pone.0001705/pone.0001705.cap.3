                Figure 3.  Electrolyte Leakage (EL,%) in rosettes of 24 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, in watered (black bars) and water deficit (grey bars) conditions.Vertical bars are SE at the 95% confidence level (n = 3). Accessions are ordered on the X-axis, from left to right, according to increased reduction in EL following water deficit. The central core-collection accessions are in bold. Col-0 is indicated by a cross. * indicates a statistically significant difference between control and water deficit conditions at 95% confidence level, determined with a non parametric test (Kruskall-Wallis).
