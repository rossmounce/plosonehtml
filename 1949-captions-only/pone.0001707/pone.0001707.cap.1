                Figure 1.  Effects of conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve on the accumulation of BDNF-immunoreactivity (ir) in the injured spinal cord stumps.The spinal cord of adult Sprague-Dawley rats were crushed one week after sciatic nerve transection (conditioning lesion). Rats were allowed to survive 24 hours after spinal cord injury. The spinal cord sections were stained for BDNF. A and B: spinal cord sections rostral (A) and caudal (B) to the lesion site, respectively, from a rat without conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve. C and D: spinal cord sections rostral (C) and caudal (D) to lesion site, respectively, from a rat with conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve. More BDNF-positive fibres were found in the caudal stump of the injured cord from rats with conditioning lesion (D) than that from rats without conditioning lesion (B). BDNF-ir was significantly increased in the ipsilateral DRG as demonstrated by both the number of positive neurons and by the staining intensity (Fig. 1F and G ).** p&lt;0.01 compared with contralateral side DRG (n = 4). In the contralateral L5 DRG (Fig. 1E), BDNF positive neurons were mainly small and medium sized neurons. IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral. Scale bar: 100 Âµm applies to A, B, C, D, E and F.
