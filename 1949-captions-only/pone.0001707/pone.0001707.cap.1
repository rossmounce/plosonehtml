Rats were allowed to survive 24 hours after spinal cord injury. The spinal cord sections were stained for BDNF. A and B: spinal cord sections rostral (A) and caudal (B) to the lesion site, respectively, from a rat without conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve. C and D: spinal cord sections rostral (C) and caudal (D) to lesion site, respectively, from a rat with conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve. More BDNF-positive fibres were found in the caudal stump of the injured cord from rats with conditioning lesion (D) than that from rats without conditioning lesion (B). BDNF-ir was significantly increased in the ipsilateral DRG as demonstrated by both the number of positive neurons and by the staining intensity (<a href="#pone-0001707-g001">Fig. 1F and G</a> ).** p&lt;0.01 compared with contralateral side DRG (n = 4). In the contralateral L5 DRG (<a href="#pone-0001707-g001">Fig. 1E</a>), BDNF positive neurons were mainly small and medium sized neurons. IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral. Scale bar: 100 Âµm applies to A, B, C, D, E and F.</p>
