Panel A: Schematic diagram showing different regions of spinal cord tissues dissected for ELISA. Segments A, B, E are in ipsilateral side of the conditioning lesion. Segments C, D, F are in the contralateral side. Segments A and C are rostral to spinal cord lesion site and segments B, D are caudal to spinal cord lesion site. Segments E and F are in lumbar enlargement of spinal cord. Panel B shows BDNF levels in different regions of injured spinal cord after conditioning lesion. The columns A, B, C, D, E, and F are as indicated in Panel A; Control is the corresponding thoracic spinal cord segment from normal animals. Panel C: BDNF levels in DRG with or without preconditioning lesion. Data were expressed as MeanÂ±S.E.M. *P&lt;0.05 in panel B compared with normal spinal cord (control) and other segments around lesion site (A, C, D). ** P&lt;0.05 in panel B compared with that of the contralateral side ( F). *P&lt;0.05 in panel C compared with that in the contralateral and normal DRG (n = 8).</p>
