The section in <a href="#pone-0001707-g003">Fig. 3A, B, C</a> was triple-labeled with BDNF and p75NTR. Most FB+ neurons were immunoreactive for BDNF (arrows in A and C ,H). Most FB+ neurons did not express p75NTR but some were surrounded with p75NTR+ satellite glial cells (arrows, B, C and D). Neurons expressing significant level of p75NTR were not FB+ (arrowheads, B, C and D). A subpopulation of large sensory neurons was p-CREB+ (E, green). Most FB+ neurons were also p-CREB+ (E and G). H: Group data showed the colocalization percentage of FB+ neurons with BDNF, p-CREB or p75NTR, respectively (n = 5). Scale bar = 100 µm in D applies to A, B, C. Scale bar = 50 µm in G applies to E, F.</p>
