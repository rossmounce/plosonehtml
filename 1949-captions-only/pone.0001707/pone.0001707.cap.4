A: In the rats of the NSS treated group, CTB labeled axons (see double arrows) in dorsal column were detected in the spinal cord central and rostral to lesion site along the wall of the cyst resulted from spinal cord injury. B: In the rats of the BDNF antiserum treated group, axons stopped caudal to lesion site (see double arrows) and failed to regenerate into the cyst (see arrow). C: In the rats without spinal cord injury, CTB was transported transganglionically along dorsal column to label the terminals in the gracile nucleus. D: The measurement of the length of CTB positive axons detected beyond the caudal edge of the cysts. The enhanced axonal regeneration by sciatic nerve lesion was substantially blocked by the treatment of the BDNF antiserum. * P&lt;0.01 compared with the NSS group (n = 5/group). Scale bars: 100 µm, applies to A, B and C. Arrowhead: cavity of spinal lesion site. Arrow: rostral side. Double arrows: CTB labeled axons.</p>
