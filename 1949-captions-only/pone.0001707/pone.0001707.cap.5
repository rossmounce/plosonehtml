A: A section from a DRG ipsilateral to the sciatic nerve lesion in a rat treated with NSS. B A section from a DRG contralateral to the sciatic nerve lesion in the same rat as in A treated with NSS. C: A section from a DRG ipsilateral to the sciatic nerve lesion treated with the BDNF antiserum. D: A section from a DRG contralateral to the sciatic nerve lesion in a rat treated with the BDNF antiserum. E: A histogram shows the effects of BDNF antiserum treatment on the number of FB labeled neurons in DRG. Filled bar: DRG ipsilateral to the sciatic nerve lesion; Open bar: DRG contralateral to the sciatic nerve lesion; * p&lt;0.01 compared to normal sheep serum treated (NSS) rats (n = 10). IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral. Scale bar: 100 Âµm.</p>
