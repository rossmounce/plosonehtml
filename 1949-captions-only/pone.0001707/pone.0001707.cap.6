                Figure 6.  Effects of BDNF antiserum treatment on GAP-43 and p-Erk immunoreactivity in the DRG after preconditioning lesion.A, B, C, D: a DRG section from a rat treated with NSS. E, F, G, H: a DRG section from a rat treated with the BDNF antiserum. A and E, B and F, or C and G were stained with p-Erk (red), GAP-43( green), or DAPI (blue), respectively; D and H were merged images from A, B, C and E, F, G, respectively. p-Erk immunoreactivity was present in both nuclei and cytoplasm (A and E). A small subpopulation of neurons was GAP-43+ in the ipsilateral DRG (B and F). Some of GAP-43 positive neurons in the ipsilateral DRG were also p-Erk+ (D and H). Scale bar: 50 Âµm.
