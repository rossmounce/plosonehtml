Dissociated DRG neurons were cultured for 24 h and then immunostained for βШ-tubulin. Scale bar, 100 µm. E: group data and statistical analysis of neurite length. The length of neurites from cultures containing BDNF antiserum were significantly shorter than those of neurites from NSS -treated group in the ipsilateral side DRG (*<em>P</em>&lt;0.05, Student's <em>t</em> test; <em>n</em> = 5/group, E). IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral.</p>
