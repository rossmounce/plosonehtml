                Figure 7.  The effects of BDNF antiserum on the neurite outgrowth of DRG in vitro.Ipsilateral (B,D) and contralateral(A, C) DRG one week after the sciatic nerve lesion were dissected and cultured for 24 hours in the culture medium in the presence of NSS (A, B) or BDNF antiserum (C, D). Dissociated DRG neurons were cultured for 24 h and then immunostained for βШ-tubulin. Scale bar, 100 µm. E: group data and statistical analysis of neurite length. The length of neurites from cultures containing BDNF antiserum were significantly shorter than those of neurites from NSS -treated group in the ipsilateral side DRG (*P&lt;0.05, Student's t test; n = 5/group, E). IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral.
