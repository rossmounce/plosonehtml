A: More regenerating neurons in DRG can been seen in the section from the ipsilateral DRG in a BDNF delivered to footpad rat; B: A section from a DRG contralateral DRG in the same rat as in A treated with exogenous BDNF. A few of FB+ neuron was detected in the section from the contralateral DRG; C: A section from a ipsilateral DRG in a rat treated with the BSA to footpad; D: A section from a contralateral DRG in a rat treated with the BSA as in C. E: A histogram shows the effects of exogenous BDNF treatment on the number of FB labeled neurons in DRG. ** p&lt;0.01 compared to contralateral side (n = 5) and BSA rats (n = 6). Scale bar: 100 Âµm. F: Group data show the average number of Fast Blue labeled DRG neurons per section from the animals infused with exogenous BDNF and PBS into sciatic nerve respectively. * P&lt;0.01 compared with contralateral DRG in BDNF treated rat and in PBS treated rats (n = 5/group). IL: ipsilateral, CL: contralateral.</p>
