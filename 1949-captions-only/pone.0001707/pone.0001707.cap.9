                Figure 9.  Exogenous BDNF injected into the footpad improves the locomotion behavioral recovery after a contusion injury in rats.Graphs show the locomotor BBB scores in rats treated with BSA (n = 7) or BDNF (n = 7). There was significant improvement in the BBB scores for treated vs. control rats on days 14, 21 ,28, 35 and 42 post-injury (* p&lt;0.05, Student's t test). Values are meansÂ±SEM. The BBB scores were assigned by two blinded observers.
