Note that ANC28.1 only induces polyclonal T cell proliferation when applied in soluble form (in this case 10 µg/ml of soluble ANC28.1 were crosslinked in solution with 20 µg/ml of polyclonal goat-anti-mouse antiserum). All other stimulations (including stimulation of T cells with CD3ε mAb and ANC28.1; very right bar in <a href="#pone-0001708-g001">Fig. 1A</a>) were performed in wells that were pre-coated with polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum. Shown data are representative for at least 6 independently performed experiments. (B) 1×10<sup>6</sup> freshly prepared human T cells/lane were stimulated in solution with 10 µg/ml ANC28.1 followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum for the indicated periods of time. As a control, cells were activated with a 1:50 v/v dilution of ascites fluid of CD3ε mAb MEM92 (IgM) or were left untreated. Cell lysates were processed for western blotting using the indicated phosphospecific antibodies (Y<sup>319</sup> of ZAP70, Y<sup>171</sup> of LAT, and Y<sup>783</sup> of PLCγ1). Western blotting using an anti-actin antibody was performed as loading control.</p>
