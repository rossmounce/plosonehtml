                Figure 1.  The CD28 superagonist ANC28.1 induces polyclonal T cell activation in vitro and leads to ZAP70 independent phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1.(A) 5×104 freshly prepared human T cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with the indicated combinations of antibodies or were incubated in medium as a control. 72 hours after stimulation, cultures were pulsed with 3H-thymidine for 6 hours and harvested thereafter. Note that ANC28.1 only induces polyclonal T cell proliferation when applied in soluble form (in this case 10 µg/ml of soluble ANC28.1 were crosslinked in solution with 20 µg/ml of polyclonal goat-anti-mouse antiserum). All other stimulations (including stimulation of T cells with CD3ε mAb and ANC28.1; very right bar in Fig. 1A) were performed in wells that were pre-coated with polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum. Shown data are representative for at least 6 independently performed experiments. (B) 1×106 freshly prepared human T cells/lane were stimulated in solution with 10 µg/ml ANC28.1 followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum for the indicated periods of time. As a control, cells were activated with a 1:50 v/v dilution of ascites fluid of CD3ε mAb MEM92 (IgM) or were left untreated. Cell lysates were processed for western blotting using the indicated phosphospecific antibodies (Y319 of ZAP70, Y171 of LAT, and Y783 of PLCγ1). Western blotting using an anti-actin antibody was performed as loading control.
