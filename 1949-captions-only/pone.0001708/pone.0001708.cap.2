                Figure 2.  Induction of sustained calcium flux by human CD28 superagonistic antibody ANC28.1.(A) 1×106 freshly prepared Indo-1 loaded human T cells were stimulated with either a 1:50 v/v dilution of ascites fluid of CD3 mAb MEM92 (orange triangle), 10 µg/ml conventional CD28 mAb (CD28.2; blue triangle) followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum (black triangle) or 10 µg/ml ANC28.1 (red triangle) followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum (black triangle). Induction of the Ca++-response was monitored for approximately 75 minutes. Note that using another conventional anti-CD28 mAb (248.23.2; with or without crosslinking) no Ca++-flux was induced as well (data not shown). (B) Untreated (untreated T cells) or 2AD2A2 pre-treated (TCRdull T cells) human T cells were stimulated with ANC28.1 (red triangles) and subsequently crosslinked (black triangles) as described in (A) and induction of the Ca++-response was monitored for the indicated periods of time. To confirm proper loading of the cells with Indo-1, the Ca++-ionophore Ionomycin (10 µg/ml) was added at the end of the experiment (unfilled triangle). (C) Cells were treated with ANC28.1 (red triangles) followed by crosslinking (black triangles) as described in (A) in the absence (no inhibitor) or presence of the PI3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (0.2 µM) or the Src-kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 µM). (D) CD3 (orange triangle) or ANC28.1 (red triangle) stimulation plus crosslinking (black triangle) was performed as described in (A) in culture medium that was supplemented with 1 mM EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca++ ions (solid arrow). At the indicated time points CaCl2 was added at a final concentration of 2 mM (dashed arrow). (E) Cells were treated with ANC28.1 as described in Fig. 1A. Additionally, at about 1 h of Ca-flux, a 1:50 v/v dilution of ascites fluid of CD3 mAb MEM92 (orange triangle) was added. (F) CD8+, CD4+, CD4+/CD45RA+ naïve, and CD4+/CD45RO+ memory T lymphocytes were treated with ANC28.1 as described in (A) and induction of the Ca++-response was monitored for approximately 150 minutes.
