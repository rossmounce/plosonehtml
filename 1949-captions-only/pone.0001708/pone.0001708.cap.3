For crosslinking, 20 µg/ml of monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG<sub>4</sub> was used (black triangle) and induction of the Ca<sup>++</sup>-response was monitored. (B) 5×10<sup>4</sup> freshly prepared human T-cells/96-well were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of ANC28.1 or TGN1412 or were left untreated as a control. For crosslinking of ANC28.1, a polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum was used and crosslinking of TGN1412 was performed as described in (A). Concentrations for crosslinking were the following: 0.1–1.25 µg/ml primary Ab+2.5 µg/ml crosslinker; 2.5 µg/ml primary Ab+5 µg/ml crosslinker; 5 µg/ml primary Ab+10 µg/ml crosslinker; 10 µg/ml primary Ab+20 µg/ml crosslinker. 72 hours after stimulation, cultures were pulsed with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine for 6 hours, then harvested and proliferation analyzed by counts per minute [cpm]. (C) 1×10<sup>6</sup> freshly prepared human T cells/lane were left untreated or were stimulated with 10 µg/ml ANC28.1 (first and third panel) followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum or with 10 µg/ml TGN1412 (right panel) followed by crosslinking as described in (A) for the indicated periods of time. As a control, cells were activated with a 1:50 dilution of ascites fluid of CD3 mAb MEM92 (second panel). Postnuclear lysates were processed for western blotting using the indicated phosphospecific antibodies. Western blotting using an anti-actin antibody was performed as loading control.</p>
