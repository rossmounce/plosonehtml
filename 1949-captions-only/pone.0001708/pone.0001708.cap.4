                Figure 4.  Cytokine production upon conventional and superagonistic CD28 stimulation of human T cells.5×104 freshly prepared human T-cells/96-well were stimulated with the indicated combination of antibodies as described in Fig. 1A or were left untreated as controls. At 48 hours 50 µl culture supernatant was removed from each well. Supernatants obtained from 3 wells were pooled and cytokine content was determined using the Cytokine Bead Array from BD in signals per minute [spm] (black bars). Additionally, induction of T cell proliferation was monitored upon treatment with the indicated antibody combinations (gray bars). 72 hours after stimulation, cultures were pulsed with 3H-thymidine for 6 hours, then harvested and proliferation analyzed by counts per minute [cpm]. Data represent the mean of 5 individual experiments.
