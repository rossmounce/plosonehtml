At 48 hours 50 µl culture supernatant was removed from each well. Supernatants obtained from 3 wells were pooled and cytokine content was determined using the Cytokine Bead Array from BD in signals per minute [spm] (black bars). Additionally, induction of T cell proliferation was monitored upon treatment with the indicated antibody combinations (gray bars). 72 hours after stimulation, cultures were pulsed with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine for 6 hours, then harvested and proliferation analyzed by counts per minute [cpm]. Data represent the mean of 5 individual experiments.</p>
