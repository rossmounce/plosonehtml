At the indicated time points 50 µl of the supernatants were removed, diluted 1:3 v/v, and the concentration of secreted IFN-γ was determined using a commercially available ELISA. (B) Molecular requirements determining CD28SA-mediated IFN-γ production. T cells were pretreated for 30 minutes with the indicated substances prior to stimulation with ANC28.1. EGTA was used at 1 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> at 2 mM, cycloheximide at 50 µg/ml, CSA at 150 ng/ml, PP2 at 10 µM, Wortmannin at 0.1 µM, and Ly294002 at 20 µM. At the indicated time points cytokine production was determined as described in (A). (C) 1×10<sup>6</sup> freshly prepared human T cells/lane were stimulated with 10 µg/ml ANC28.1 followed by crosslinking with 20 µg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum with or without Wortmannin treatment. Western blotting was conducted as described in <a href="#pone-0001708-g003">Fig. 3</a>. Note that identical results were obtained when T cells were pretreated with LY294002 (data not shown). (D) Molecular requirements determining CD28SA-mediated IL-2 production. T cells were pretreated for 30 minutes with the indicated substances prior to stimulation with ANC28.1 as described in (B). 4 h after stimulation 50 µl of the supernatants were removed, diluted 1:3 v/v, and the concentration of IL-2 was analyzed in supernatants by an ELISA. (E) CD28SA-mediated IFN-γ and IL-2 production requires sustained Ca<sup>++</sup>-flux. T cells were stimulated with ANC28.1 as described above. At 15′, 30′, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h Ca<sup>++</sup>-flux was interrupted by addition of EGTA (1 mM) and the concentration of the cytokines in the supernatant was determined as described in (B) and (D). The concentrations of IL-2 and IFN-γ that were produced by ANC28.1-stimulated T cells following 6 hours of stimulation in the absence of EGTA were set to 100%. All data shown in <a href="#pone-0001708-g005">Fig. 5</a> are representative for three independently performed experiments.</p>
