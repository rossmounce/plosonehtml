                Figure 6.  Despite similar TGN1412 binding, Macaca derived T cells show reduced calcium flux upon TGN1412 stimulation when compared to human T cells.(A) MACS purified CD3+ human T cells (stained with an anti-CD3-APC antibody) and CD3+ monkey T cells (stained with an anti-CD3-PE antibody) were mixed 1:1 and then incubated with graded concentrations of Alexa 488 labeled TGN1412. Binding of TGN1412-Alexa 488 was monitored by FACS analysis. Numbers given indicate the mean fluorescence intensity of samples. (B) Ratio of CD4+ vs. CD8+ T cells (gated on CD3+ cells) of human and monkey blood samples was analyzed by FACS analyses. (C) 1×106 freshly isolated Indo-1 loaded M. fascicularis and M. mulatta T cells were treated as described in Fig. 2 using the superagonistic CD28 specific mAb TGN1412 (10 µg/ml; red triangle). For crosslinking, 20 µg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG4 was used (black triangle) and induction of the Ca++-response was monitored. To confirm viability of cells and proper loading with Indo-1, Ionomycin (10 µg/ml) was added at the end of the experiment (unfilled triangle).
