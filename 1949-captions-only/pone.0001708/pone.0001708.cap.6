Binding of TGN1412-Alexa 488 was monitored by FACS analysis. Numbers given indicate the mean fluorescence intensity of samples. (B) Ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup> vs. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (gated on CD3<sup>+</sup> cells) of human and monkey blood samples was analyzed by FACS analyses. (C) 1×10<sup>6</sup> freshly isolated Indo-1 loaded <em>M. fascicularis</em> and <em>M. mulatta</em> T cells were treated as described in <a href="#pone-0001708-g002">Fig. 2</a> using the superagonistic CD28 specific mAb TGN1412 (10 µg/ml; red triangle). For crosslinking, 20 µg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG<sub>4</sub> was used (black triangle) and induction of the Ca<sup>++</sup>-response was monitored. To confirm viability of cells and proper loading with Indo-1, Ionomycin (10 µg/ml) was added at the end of the experiment (unfilled triangle).</p>
