Genomic region and structure of targeting constructs (not to scale). Top: Location of BACs used for making constructs. Middle: Map of Prader-Willi syndrome critical region (Pwcr) on mouse chromosome 7C. Gray thin line with arrowhead, large transcript originating from the Snrpn promoter; short black bars, coding exons for Snrpn on the left, and for Ube3a on the right; short gray bars, non-coding exons; high black bars, snoRNAs (not representing accurate numbers of elements in clusters, there are at least 41 copies of Snord116). Bottom: Left, upstream construct; right, downstream construct. Thick lines represent mouse genomic sequence, and thin lines vector sequence. Black arrowheads, loxP sites; white arrowheads, Frt1 sites; grey arrowheads, Frt 5 sites. Neo, Puro, TK and DT boxes indicate location of PGK-Neo<sup>r</sup>, PGK-Puro<sup>r </sup>, HSV-TK and diphtheria toxin selection markers. Positions and direction of the genotyping primers PA, PB, PC and PD are indicated. B. Southern blots of targeted ES cell clones with probes from outside the targeting constructs. Lanes 1 and 2, <em>Nco</em>I digests were hybridized with probe UL located upstream of the upstream targeting construct. Lane 1, wild-type ES cells (WT); lane 2, a recombinant ES cell clone (B41) targeted with the upstream construct. The WT allele generates a 19.5 kb band, and the recombinant fragment is 9.5 kb. Lanes 3-6, <em>Stu</em>1 digested DNA was probed with probe DR located downstream of the downstream targeting construct. Lanes 3 and 5, clone B41; lane 4, C1, a recombinant clone after transfecting B41 with the downstream targeting construct; lane 6, clone D1, derived from C1 after Cre recombinase-mediated recombination. The WT allele, represented by the upstream targeted clone B41, generates a band of &gt;16 kb, and the recombinant fragments are 6.5 kb in C1 (a doubly-targeted 2-loxP clone) and 10 kb in D1 (a 1-loxP clone with the ~150 kb deletion), respectively. C. Genotyping of 1-loxP ES cells by multiplex PCR with primers PA, PC and PD. The WT band is 435 bp, the amplification product of primers PC and PD; and the deleted allele is 327 bp, a product of amplification between PA and PD. Lanes 1 and 2 represent two clones after Cre mediated deletion (D1 and D5); Lane 3, wild-type ES cells; lane 4, doubly targeted 2-loxP ES cell clone (C1). H<sub>2</sub>O: no template negative control; MW: molecular weight marker. D. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR study for expression of gene elements in PWS critical region. DNaseI treated total brain RNA from 4-week old mice (n = 9 WT, 7 Del) was used as template for qRT-PCR assays. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. <em>Gapdh</em> expression was used as internal control. The levels for each sample are normalized to the average of the WT samples. Error bars, standard error of the mean (SEM). Asterisks indicate significant differences; for <em>Snord64</em>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.0005; <em>Snord116</em>, <em>P</em>&lt;1 ×10<sup>−7</sup>, and <em>Snord115</em>, <em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
