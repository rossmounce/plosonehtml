                Figure 2.  Growth and somatic development of Snord116del mice.A. Daily weight curves for males (left) and weekly weight curves for males (middle) and females (right). The female weight curve in the first month (not shown) overlaps with the male curve. Error bars, standard deviations. Significant weight differences between Snord116del mice and their WT littermates ranged from P&lt;0.05 in young pups, after postnatal day 2 (P2), to P&lt;1 ×10−8 after 6 months (n = 15~20 in each sex/genotype group). Insert photo: Snord116del (top) and WT (bottom) pups at P14. B. Comparison of body and organ weights in Snord116del mice and WT littermates at P5 and P13 (P5: n = 27 WT, 24 Del; P13: n = 8 WT, 9 Del). Error bar: SEM. At P5, all differences were significant at P&lt;0.003 except for brain at P&lt;0.02. At P13, all differences were significant at P&lt;0.0001 except for stomach, P = 0.05. Bd: body, Br: brain, Lv: liver, St: stomach. C. Levels of Igf1 transcripts in liver and IGF-I protein in serum are reduced in deletion mice. Left: Liver RNA from 4-week old (n = 9 WT, 7 Del) and 8-week old (n = 8 WT, 8 Del) mice were assayed by qRT-PCR with Gapdh levels as internal control. WT levels were set at 1. Error bar: SEM. Asterisks: P&lt;0.05. Right: Serum levels of IGF-I protein from the same group of mice were measured by ELISA. Asterisks: P&lt;0.0005. D. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sagittal sections of the pituitary at E12.5 and E14.5 (left WT, middle Del) and coronal sections at E18.5 (right) revealed normal pituitary size and structure. E. Immunohistochemical staining for growth hormone (somatotrophs) revealed no detectable differences in WT (top) and Del (bottom) mice at 4 weeks of age.
