                Figure 3.  Neurobehavioral tests of Snord116del and WT littermates.A. Elevated plus maze. Mice were tested at 3 months of age (n = 15, both genotypes). Left panel: Snord116del mice spent more time in the closed arms (P&lt;0.05). Right panel: mutant mice made more entries to the closed arms (P&lt;0.02). B. Wire-hanging test. At 5 months of age, Snord116del mice were able to hang significantly longer than the WT littermates (P&lt;5 ×10−5, n = 17, both genotypes). At 2 months of age, the difference was not significant (n = 13 WT, 9 Del). C. Rotarod test of balance and motor learning. Mice were tested at 2 months (n = 18 WT, 10 Del). Two trials were done on each day for 6 consecutive days. Asterisks indicate significant differences between WT and deletion mice (P&lt;0.05). All error bars are SEM.
