                Figure 4.  Feeding and energy homeostasis regulation of Snord116del mice and their WT littermates.A. Daily food intake and response to High-Fat (HF) diet. The intake of rodent chow during the dark (black bars) and light cycles (open bars) were measured for five consecutive days at 7 weeks of age. Then, the mice were placed on HF diet, and their intake was measured daily for five consecutive days. Food intake was normalized to average body weight during the five days of measurement. The daily intake on regular chow diet was not different between WT (W) and Snord116del (D) mice. On HF diet, the daily intake of the deletion males (HD) was significantly lower than that of their WT littermates (HW) (P&lt;0.005). This was entirely due to decreased daytime intake. The deletion females on HF (HD) had lower intake in the dark (P&lt;0.05), which was compensated by increased daytime intake (P&lt;0.05), so that their total daily intake was not different from their WT littermates (HW). (Males, n = 16 WT, 16 Del; females n = 15 WT, 11 Del). B. Deletion mice gain less weight on HF diet. Eight-week old mice were put on HF for 4 months, and their body weight was measured twice per week and plotted as the ratio to their weight prior to HF diet. Differences between male WT (MW, n = 16) and male Snord116del (MD, n = 16) mice were significant at P&lt;0.01 except for the first week on HF. Differences between female WT (FW, n = 15) and female deletion (FD, n = 11) mice were significant at P&lt;0.05 after 7 weeks on HF. C. Deletion mice have less body fat on regular and HF diet. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure body composition of 5-months and 9-months old mice on rodent chow, and 6-months old mice that had been on HF diet for 4 months. The differences between WT and Snord116del mice are all significant, except for the 5-months old males on chow. Males, at 5 months (n = 13 WT, 9 Del; P = 0.07); at 9 months (n = 17, both genotypes, P&lt;2 ×10−7); at 6 months after 4 months on HF diet (n = 16, P&lt;0.0001). Females at 5 months (n = 12, both genotypes, P&lt;0.02), at 9 months (n = 14 WT, 10 Del; P&lt;0.007) and at 6 months after 4 months on HF diet (n = 15 WT, 10 Del; P&lt;0.02). D. Compensatory food intake after fasting. Mice at 3 months of age were fasted for 24 hr, and the ratio of their cumulative food intake to their average pre-fasting daily intake was computed. M1 and M2, cumulative intake ratios of males in the first 24 and 48 hr (n = 13 WT, 9 Del). F1 and F2, cumulative intake ratios of females in the first 24 and 48 hr (n = 12). The deletion mice were able to compensate within 48 hr for the missed feeding. The deletion males over-compensated compared to their WT littermates (P&lt;0.02). E. Maintenance of body temperature in cold environment. The core body temperature of 4 months old Snord116del (n = 9) and WT (n = 13) males in a 4°C cold room was measured with an anal probe. The mutants were better able to maintain their core temperatures over extended time. Asterisks indicate P&lt;0.05.
