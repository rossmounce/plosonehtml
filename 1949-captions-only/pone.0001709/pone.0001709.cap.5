Glucose tolerance test (GTT) for mice on regular diet (RD) at 6 months of age. Mice were injected with 1 g/kg glucose at time zero after 16 hr overnight fasting and serum glucose was measured for up to 2 h. n = 13 WT, 9 Del). Deletion mice were better able to clear the glucose that WT, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 at 30 min, and <em>P</em>&lt;0.001 at 60 and 90 min time points). B. Glucose tolerance test for mice after 4 months on HF diet (n = 16) starting from 8 weeks of age (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01 for all time points). C. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) for mice on regular diet (RD) at 6 months of age. Wild type (n = 13) and mutant (n = 9) mice were injected with 1.6 U/kg insulin at time zero after 5 hr fasting from the onset of the light cycle (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 at 60, 90 and 120 min). D. Insulin tolerance test for 6-months old mice after 4 months of HF diet. WT mice (n = 15) and deletion mice (n = 16) were injected with 2 U/kg insulin (<em>P</em>&lt;0.02 at time 0, and <em>P</em>&lt;0.0002 at all other time points). Deletion males were more sensitive to insulin than WT.</p>
