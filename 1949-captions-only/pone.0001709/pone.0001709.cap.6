                Figure 6.   Snord116del mice are hyperphagic and have altered metabolism.A. Daily food intake during 6 days in Oxymax metabolic chambers was normalized to body weight (n = 8 WT, 7 Del, all points P&lt;0.05). Error Bars: SEM. B. Average feeding bout duration of the same group of mice as in (A) during each 12 hr cycle. D, dark cycles; L, light cycles. Asterisks indicate P&lt;0.05. C. Daily food intake at different ages. Daily food intake was averaged over 5–7 consecutive days and normalized to body weight of each individual. At 7 week, males n = 16 both genotypes; females, n = 15 WT, 11 Del; at 3 months, males n = 13 WT, 9 Del, P&lt;0.04; females n = 12 WT, 12 Del; at 6–7 months, (males n = 15 both genotypes, P&lt;2 ×10−6; females n = 14 WT, 16 Del, P&lt;3 ×10−6, and at 10 months males n = 21 WT, 19 Del, P&lt;3 ×10−5; females n = 13 both genotypes, P&lt;2 ×10−5. D. Oxygen consumption rates (averaged over 2 hr time periods) on the second and third day in the metabolic chamber (n = 15 both genotypes). Bars at bottom indicate light and dark cycles. Asterisks, P&lt;0.05. E. Respiratory exchange rate (RER) averaged over 2 hr time periods for the same group of mice as in (D) during the same time in the metabolic chamber. Asterisks, P&lt;0.05. F. Weight change in mice food-restricted to 80% their normal daily intake. Males (n = 11 both genotypes) and females (n = 13 both genotypes) at 11 months of age. Asterisks indicate significant difference between WT and Del females with P&lt;0.05. G. Snord116del mice have increased ghrelin levels. Plasma ghrelin levels were measured in ad lib fed mice at 11 months of age (n = 12 both genotypes; P&lt;0.002) and 24 hr fasted mice (n = 13 both genotypes ; P&lt;0.0002)
