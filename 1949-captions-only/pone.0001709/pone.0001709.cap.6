Daily food intake during 6 days in Oxymax metabolic chambers was normalized to body weight (n = 8 WT, 7 Del, all points <em>P</em>&lt;0.05). Error Bars: SEM. B. Average feeding bout duration of the same group of mice as in (A) during each 12 hr cycle. D, dark cycles; L, light cycles. Asterisks indicate <em>P</em>&lt;0.05. C. Daily food intake at different ages. Daily food intake was averaged over 5–7 consecutive days and normalized to body weight of each individual. At 7 week, males n = 16 both genotypes; females, n = 15 WT, 11 Del; at 3 months, males n = 13 WT, 9 Del, <em>P</em>&lt;0.04; females n = 12 WT, 12 Del; at 6–7 months, (males n = 15 both genotypes, <em>P</em>&lt;2 ×10<sup>−6</sup>; females n = 14 WT, 16 Del, <em>P</em>&lt;3 ×10<sup>−6</sup>, and at 10 months males n = 21 WT, 19 Del, <em>P</em>&lt;3 ×10<sup>−5</sup>; females n = 13 both genotypes, <em>P</em>&lt;2 ×10<sup>−5</sup>. D. Oxygen consumption rates (averaged over 2 hr time periods) on the second and third day in the metabolic chamber (n = 15 both genotypes). Bars at bottom indicate light and dark cycles. Asterisks, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05. E. Respiratory exchange rate (RER) averaged over 2 hr time periods for the same group of mice as in (D) during the same time in the metabolic chamber. Asterisks, <em>P</em>&lt;0.05. F. Weight change in mice food-restricted to 80% their normal daily intake. Males (n = 11 both genotypes) and females (n = 13 both genotypes) at 11 months of age. Asterisks indicate significant difference between WT and Del females with <em>P</em>&lt;0.05. G. <em>Snord116del</em> mice have increased ghrelin levels. Plasma ghrelin levels were measured in <em>ad lib</em> fed mice at 11 months of age (n = 12 both genotypes; <em>P</em>&lt;0.002) and 24 hr fasted mice (n = 13 both genotypes ; <em>P</em>&lt;0.0002)</p>
