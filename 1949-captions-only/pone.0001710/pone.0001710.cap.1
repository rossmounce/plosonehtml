                Figure 1.  Changes of senescence-associated features in 2BS cells were induced by enforced expression of SIRT1.(A) Stable transfected 2BS cells expressing empty Vector, SIRT1 and H363YSIRT1 were passaged until one of them underwent senescence, then stained for SA-β-gal staining, a classical biomarker for senescence. Early passage (23 PDs) 2BS cells were showed as negative control. Late passage (60 PDs) 2BS cells were stained as positive control. (B) Senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), another classical marker of senescence, was showed in 2BS cell lines DNA foci accumulate was visualized by DAPI staining in 2BS cells. Scale bars were equal to 20 µm. (C) Enlarged images of DAPI staining are shown in the lower panels. Scale bars were equal to 8 µm.
