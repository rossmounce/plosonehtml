(B, C) 2BS cells and WI38 cells at 40 PDs were treated with solvent alone or 0.2 or 2 µM of resveratrol (Res) for 72 h. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blot with the same antibodies. (D, E, F) The quantitative protein expression was summarized in bar graphs (left) presented by mean values (±SEM) of 3 independent experiments. Error bars represent the S.D.
