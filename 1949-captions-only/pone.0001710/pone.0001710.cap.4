                Figure 4.  SIRT1-dependend phosphorylation of kinase was associated with the cell proliferation.(A) Transfected 2BS cell containing pcDNA3.1, pcDNA-SIRT1 and pcDNA-H363YSIRT1 were lysated and subjected to western blot analysis by using specific antibodies against Phospho-p44/42 ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), Phospho-AKT (Ser473), Phospho-p70 S6K1(Thr389), Phospho-p70 S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424)and p44/42 ERK. (B, C) 2BS cells and WI38 cells at 40 PDs were treated with solvent alone or 0.2 or 2 ÂµM of resveratrol (Res) for 72 h. Cell lysates analyzed by western blot, as described in Figure 4A.
