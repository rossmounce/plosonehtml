Following treatment, the cells were lysed and subjected to western analysis for determining phosphorylation of S6k1 and signaling associated with the cell cycle G1 arrest (Id1, p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, Rb and phosphorylated Rb). Transfected 2BS containing SIRT1 and Mock vector were also analyzed as a positive and a negative control. Levels of Î²-actin were used as a loading control.</p>
