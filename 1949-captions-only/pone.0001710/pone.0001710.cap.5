                Figure 5.  Inhibition of S6K1 activity led to increased p16/Rb pathway with Id1 suppression.SIRT1-transfected 2BS were treated for one day with increasing concentrations of Rapamycin (10nM and 20nM). Following treatment, the cells were lysed and subjected to western analysis for determining phosphorylation of S6k1 and signaling associated with the cell cycle G1 arrest (Id1, p16INK4A, Rb and phosphorylated Rb). Transfected 2BS containing SIRT1 and Mock vector were also analyzed as a positive and a negative control. Levels of Î²-actin were used as a loading control.
