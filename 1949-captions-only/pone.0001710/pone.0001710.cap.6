                Figure 6.  The alterations of SIRT1 expression and phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6K1 were determined in senescent 2BS Cells.The total cellular lysates from early passage (23 PDs) and late passage of 2BS (63 PDs) were prepared and subjected to western blot analysis by using specific antibodies against SIRT1,Î²-actin, Phospho-p44/42 ERK(Thr202/Tyr204), p44/42 ERK, Phospho-p70 S6K1 (Thr389), Phospho-p70 S6K1(Thr421/Ser424)and Phospho-AKT (Ser473).
