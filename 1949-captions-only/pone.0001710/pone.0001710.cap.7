                Figure 7.  Schematic model for a mechanism of Sirt1 activating ERK/S6K1 signaling pathway involved in cell senescence.The activation of SIRT1 in human lung fibroblasts suppressed p16INK4A/Rb pathway and provoked ERK/S6K1 signaling, which, in turn, may inhibit p16INK4A/Rb signaling via Id1 induction.
