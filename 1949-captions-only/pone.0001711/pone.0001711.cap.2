                Figure 2.  Comparison of three parametric forms of the incidence curve: log-logistic (A) gamma (B) and cubic spline (C).Incidence curves (blue line) and generated mortality curve (red line) was fitted to observed excess AIDS mortality (black points) and prevalence (orange shade). All assume median survival post infection is 11.3 years and stable non-AIDS mortality.
