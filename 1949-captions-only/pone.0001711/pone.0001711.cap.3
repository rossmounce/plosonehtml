                Figure 3.  Time trends of adult HIV prevalence (A&amp;B) projected from parameterised incidence curves (C&amp;D).Higher prevalence results assuming declining background mortality (orange lines) compared with stable (green lines) or increasing background mortality (blue lines). Darker shaded lines represent longer survival post-infection; lighter lines represent shorter survival. UNAIDS prevalence estimates are shown for comparison (symbol, ref). HIV incidence measured in Harare male factory workers (○[7]) and Harare post-natal women (□[27]) are plotted alongside modelled incidence in C&amp;D. Prevalence and incidence estimates from back-calculation are for 15 to 59 year olds, empirical and national estimates generally refer to 15 to 49 year olds.
