Darker shaded lines represent longer survival post-infection; lighter lines represent shorter survival. UNAIDS prevalence estimates are shown for comparison (symbol, ref). HIV incidence measured in Harare male factory workers (○<a href="#pone.0001711-Machekano1">[7]</a>) and Harare post-natal women (□<a href="#pone.0001711-Mbizvo2">[27]</a>) are plotted alongside modelled incidence in C&amp;D. Prevalence and incidence estimates from back-calculation are for 15 to 59 year olds, empirical and national estimates generally refer to 15 to 49 year olds.</p>
