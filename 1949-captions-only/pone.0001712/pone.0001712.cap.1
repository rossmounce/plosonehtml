(Bottom) To establish the baseline, we randomly resampled 10 million groups of five random SNPs on the same chromosome with replacements and computed H`<sub>EA</sub>, H`<sub>AA</sub> and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST </sub>(random values). (B) Determining observed and random distributions of H`<sub>EA,</sub> H`<sub>AA</sub> and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>: (Top) We built a frequency distribution for each chromosome using observed values; (Bottom) we built a frequency distribution and assigned fractional rank values to the distribution of random values. (C) Superimposing the distributions to derive fractional rank values: the two distributions were combined and each observed value assigned a fractional rank from the closest larger random value. The same computation was done for all 31 SNP window group sizes (N = 5, 7, 9 … 65) 100 times, and mean values were calculated. For each SNP, the lowest mean value (λ) for H`<sub>EA</sub> was chosen from the 31 windows of size 5 to 65, and plotted across the length of each chromosome in cM. Likewise, the same derivation was applied to H`<sub>AA</sub> and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>.</p>
