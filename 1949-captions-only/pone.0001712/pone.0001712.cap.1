                Figure 1.  A flow chart for analyzing regions for local heterozygosity in African Americans (H`AA) and European Americans (H`EA), along with the variance of FST (S2FST) to derive the lowest mean value fractional rank (λ) for each SNP.(A) Sampling and resampling process: (Top) We selected five adjacent SNPs at the beginning of a single chromosome and computed H`EA, H`AA and S2FST for the group, then moved the window sequentially to the right, one SNP at a time (observed values). (Bottom) To establish the baseline, we randomly resampled 10 million groups of five random SNPs on the same chromosome with replacements and computed H`EA, H`AA and S2FST (random values). (B) Determining observed and random distributions of H`EA, H`AA and S2FST: (Top) We built a frequency distribution for each chromosome using observed values; (Bottom) we built a frequency distribution and assigned fractional rank values to the distribution of random values. (C) Superimposing the distributions to derive fractional rank values: the two distributions were combined and each observed value assigned a fractional rank from the closest larger random value. The same computation was done for all 31 SNP window group sizes (N = 5, 7, 9 … 65) 100 times, and mean values were calculated. For each SNP, the lowest mean value (λ) for H`EA was chosen from the 31 windows of size 5 to 65, and plotted across the length of each chromosome in cM. Likewise, the same derivation was applied to H`AA and S2FST.
