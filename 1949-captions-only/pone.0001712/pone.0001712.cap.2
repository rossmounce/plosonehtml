                Figure 2.  (A) Evidence and types of selection: (Top) Schematic of the lowest mean value fractional rank value (λ) distributions for local heterozygosity in a sample of 45 European Americans λ(H`EA), 45 African Americans λ(H`AA), and variance of population divergence λ(S2FST) plotted across a chromosome.(Bottom) Four kinds of putative selection sites where one of the two populations has either lower values of heterozygosity as well as a rise in S2FST values at the same location, or a decreased local heterozygosity in both populations (see Table 1). (B) Three examples of known selection regions. CCR5 and FOXP2 genes have low values of heterozygosity in both Europeans and Africans, implying putative selection in the ancestral population (“old”; see Figure 2A, bottom). The region around IL-4 (which includes the IL-13 gene) shows a putative selection signature, as indicated by a decrease in H`EA and H`AA and increased S2FST. Values of HEA (blue), HAA (green), and FST (red) are plotted individually with most significant medians (H`EA and H`AA), and variance of FST (S2FST) across 31 sliding windows of size 5 to 65 loci. (Bottom) λ values derived from H`EA, H`AA, and S2FST based on the 5 to 65 loci sliding windows around CCR5, FOXP2 and IL4. (C) Similar plots of nine examples from 180 putative selection sites discovered in the current study (all plotted in Figure S3).
