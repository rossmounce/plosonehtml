(B) Three examples of known selection regions. <em>CCR5</em> and <em>FOXP2</em> genes have low values of heterozygosity in both Europeans and Africans, implying putative selection in the ancestral population (“old”; see <a href="#pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2A</a>, bottom). The region around <em>IL-4</em> (which includes the <em>IL-13</em> gene) shows a putative selection signature, as indicated by a decrease in H`<sub>EA</sub> and H`<sub>AA</sub> and increased S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>. Values of H<sub>EA</sub> (blue), H<sub>AA</sub> (green), and F<sub>ST </sub>(red) are plotted individually with most significant medians (H`<sub>EA </sub>and H`<sub>AA</sub>), and variance of F<sub>ST</sub> (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) across 31 sliding windows of size 5 to 65 loci. (Bottom) λ values derived from H`<sub>EA</sub>, H`<sub>AA</sub>, and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> based on the 5 to 65 loci sliding windows around <em>CCR5</em>, <em>FOXP2</em> and <em>IL4</em>. (C) Similar plots of nine examples from 180 putative selection sites discovered in the current study (all plotted in Figure S3).</p>
