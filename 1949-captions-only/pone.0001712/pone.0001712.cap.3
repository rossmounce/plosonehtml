                Figure 3.  SelSim simulation results summarizing the effect of selection on the estimates of (A) λ(H`D) and (B) λ(S2FST) among 100 replicate of 2.61 Mb simulated chromosomes of chromosomes for each of the four parameter combination with varying selection coefficient and recombination rate.These simulations were performed using SelSim [24], assuming equal sampling (48 chromosomes) and a complete separation between the two populations. Selection parameter (s) ranged from neutral to 0.3% to 3% (left to right) and recombination intensity per site (r) from 0.3 to 0.6 (from the top down), assuming 10,000 effective population size in each of the two simulated populations (See Materials and Methods).
