                Figure 4.  Scans for selected regions on chromosome 2 from this work and others [4], [9], [18], [20], [22], [23].(A) Our scan for putative selection regions. A putative selected site is identified as the locus of a peak in two of three tests (λ(H`EA), λ(H`AA), or λ(S2FST)) overlapped (as in Figure 2A) with ancestral selection (H`EA and H`AA, squares), along with recent selection in Europeans (H`EA and S2FST, triangles) and Africans (H`AA and S2FST, circles; see Figures 5 and 6 for a full genome scan). Locations, genes, and evidence strength (λ) for the putative selection peaks are in Table S3. (B) Locations of regions implicated as selected by our study compared to nine other recent genome scans for selection [4], [9], [17], [18], [20]–[23]. Solid figures indicate that selected regions detected in at least two of these studies are overlapping (cross-validated). Open symbols indicate that the peaks do not overlap. Our full genome scan (Figures 5 and 6) cross-validated 356 regions whose locations are listed in Table S4. Dotted lines indicate cross-verified for which evidence of a signal is apparent in regions from other studies, but did not pass our criteria for inclusion (See Materials and Methods and Figures 7 and 8).
