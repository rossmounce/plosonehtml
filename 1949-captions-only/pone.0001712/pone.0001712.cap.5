A putative selected site is identified where two of the peaks overlap (as in <a href="#pone-0001712-g001">Figure 1A</a>). Both peaks are identified with a consecutive letter. Locations, genes, and evidence strength (λ) for the putative selection peaks are listed in <a href="#pone.0001712.s004">Table S3</a>. For clarity, the figure shows half of the genome: chromosomes 1–5, 7–9, 15 and 16.</p>
