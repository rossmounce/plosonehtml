                Figure 5.  Scans for putative selection regions in the autosomes and X chromosome.Squares indicate the regions of the ancestral (old) selection, triangles indicate recent selection in Europeans, circles in Africans, and diamonds designate the new selection in both of these populations. A putative selected site is identified where two of the peaks overlap (as in Figure 1A). Both peaks are identified with a consecutive letter. Locations, genes, and evidence strength (λ) for the putative selection peaks are listed in Table S3. For clarity, the figure shows half of the genome: chromosomes 1–5, 7–9, 15 and 16.
