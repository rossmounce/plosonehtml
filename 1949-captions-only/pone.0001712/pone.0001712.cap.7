Open symbols indicate that the peaks do not overlap. Locations of regions included in the regions cross-validated by more than one study are listed in <a href="#pone.0001712.s005">Table S4</a>. Sequential numbers and locations of all the regions in this comparison are listed in <a href="#pone.0001712.s006">Table S5</a>. For clarity, the figure shows half of the genome: chromosomes 1–11.</p>
