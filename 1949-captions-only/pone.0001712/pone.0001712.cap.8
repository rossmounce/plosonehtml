                Figure 8.  Locations of regions implicated as selected by our study compared to six other recent genome scans for selection [4], [9], [17]–[23].Solid figures indicate that selected regions detected in at least two of these studies are overlapping. Open symbols indicate that the peaks do not overlap. Locations of regions included in the regions cross-validated by more than one study are listed in Table S4. Sequential numbers and locations of all the regions in this comparison are listed in Table S5. For clarity, the figure shows half of the genome: chromosomes 12–23, and chromosome X.
