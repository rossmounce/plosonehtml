                Figure 2.  Over expression of monomeric TRAP is associated with obesity in transgenic mice.(A) Growth curve of male obese TRAP+ (open square), lean TRAP+p (open circle) and WT (black square) mice. (B) Growth curve of female obese TRAP+ (open square), lean TRAP+p (open circle) and WT (black square) mice. (C) Relative lean and fat mass in male WT, TRAP+p and TRAP+ mice. (D) Relative lean and fat mass in female WT, TRAP+p and TRAP+ mice. (E) Expression of TRAP mRNA and enzyme activity in adipose tissue from WT, TRAP+p and TRAP+ mice. (F) Western blot of TRAP in adipose tissue from WT, TRAP+p and TRAP+ mice.
