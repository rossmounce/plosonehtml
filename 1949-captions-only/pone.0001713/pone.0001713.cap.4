Proliferation (BrdU) was assessed after 1 day (3T3-L1), 2 days (3T3-L1, hMSC), 3 days (3T3-L1) or 5 days (pre-adipocytes) after seeding. Differentiation (GPDH-activity) was measured 4 days (3T3-L1) or 12 days (hMSC, pre-adipocytes) after start of differentiation. hMSC were treated with TRAP either before (Pro) or at (Post) confluence. mTRAP = monomeric TRAP, cTRAP = proteolytically processed TRAP. Data are expressed as percentage of control. Statistical analysis was performed using T-test, * p&lt;0.05, comparing control cells with stimulated cells.</p>
