                Figure 5.  Macrophages are the primary source of monomeric TRAP in mouse and human adipose tissue.(A) mRNA expression of the monocyte/macrophage marker F4/80 and c-fms in adipose tissue of TRAP+ vs. WT mice. (B) Immunohistochemistry of mouse macrophage marker F4/80 in adipose tissue from TRAP+ compared to WT mice (C) mRNA for the myeloid lineage specific TRAP transcript 1C in adipose tissue of WT and TRAP+ mice. (D) Expression of monomeric TRAP in adipose tissue (T) and isolated adipocytes (Ad) from five subjects (Pat 1â€“5). (E) TRAP mRNA expression in human adipose tissue and in isolated adipocytes. (F) Co-localization between monomeric or total TRAP and the macrophage marker CD68 in subcutaneous human adipose tissue from a representative subject. (G) Monomeric TRAP is secreted from the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (lane 1), whereas proteolytically processed TRAP is not detectable (lane 2).
