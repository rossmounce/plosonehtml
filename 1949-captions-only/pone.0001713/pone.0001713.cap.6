                Figure 6.  Metabolic and inflammatory profile of adipose tissue from obese TRAP over expressing mice.(A) Levels of leptin and adiponectin mRNA and serum protein in WT and TRAP+ mice. (B) Inflammatory gene expression profile in the TRAP+ mice. (C) Noradrenalin-stimulated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes from TRAP+ and WT mice. (D) Insulin-inhibitable lipolysis in isolated adipocytes from TRAP+ and WT mice. (E) Insulin- stimulated lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from TRAP+ and WT mice. (F) Levels of blood glucose and insulin in TRAP+ mice.
