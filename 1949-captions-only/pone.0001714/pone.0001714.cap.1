                Figure 1.  Dye coupling was abolished in Cx57-deficient mice.(A) Neurobiotin-injected horizontal cells from wild-type mice showed extensive coupling. Note that coupling extended beyond the borders of the image. In total, 182 horizontal cells were coupled to this cell. (B) Horizontal cell from a Cx57-deficient mouse, injected under the same conditions. Coupling was abolished in these mice. Similar results have been shown before [27], [28]. Scale bar, 50 Âµm.
