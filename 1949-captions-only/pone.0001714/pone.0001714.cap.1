Note that coupling extended beyond the borders of the image. In total, 182 horizontal cells were coupled to this cell. (B) Horizontal cell from a Cx57-deficient mouse, injected under the same conditions. Coupling was abolished in these mice. Similar results have been shown before <a href="#pone.0001714-Hombach1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001714-Shelley1">[28]</a>. Scale bar, 50 Âµm.</p>
