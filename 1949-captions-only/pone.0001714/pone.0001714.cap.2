See <a href="#s4"><em>Methods</em></a>, for light intensities. Responses were normalized to the maximum firing rate. Each cell's tuning curve is presented at the right. (B, E) Average tuning curves (meanÂ±SEM) for all cells from wild-type (B) and Cx57-deficient (E) retinas, measured at the scotopic (grey) and the photopic (blue) light intensities. (C, F) Distribution of the center of mass values for all cells from wild-type (C) and Cx57-deficient (F) retinas measured at the scotopic (grey) and the photopic (blue) light intensities. No significant difference was observed between the two genotypes for the scotopic condition (<em>p</em>&gt;0.35, <em>n</em> = 196 cells for wild-type, <em>n</em> = 161 for Cx57-deficient, <em>KS</em> test) or the photopic condition (<em>p</em>&gt;0.18, <em>n</em> = 196 for wild-type, <em>n</em> = 161 for Cx57-deficient, <em>KS</em> test).</p>
