                Figure 2.  Ganglion cells from wild-type and Cx57-deficient mice showed the same shift in spatial tuning.(A, D) Representative ganglion cell responses from wild-type (A) and Cx57-deficient (D) mice to drifting sine wave gratings presented at two different light intensities: scotopic, grey, and photopic, blue. See Methods, for light intensities. Responses were normalized to the maximum firing rate. Each cell's tuning curve is presented at the right. (B, E) Average tuning curves (meanÂ±SEM) for all cells from wild-type (B) and Cx57-deficient (E) retinas, measured at the scotopic (grey) and the photopic (blue) light intensities. (C, F) Distribution of the center of mass values for all cells from wild-type (C) and Cx57-deficient (F) retinas measured at the scotopic (grey) and the photopic (blue) light intensities. No significant difference was observed between the two genotypes for the scotopic condition (p&gt;0.35, n = 196 cells for wild-type, n = 161 for Cx57-deficient, KS test) or the photopic condition (p&gt;0.18, n = 196 for wild-type, n = 161 for Cx57-deficient, KS test).
