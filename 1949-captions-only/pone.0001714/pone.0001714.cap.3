                Figure 3.  The distributions of surround sizes were the same for both genotypes.Ganglion cells from (A) wild-type and (B) Cx57-deficient mice (p&gt;0.64, n = 147 for wild-type, n = 125 for Cx57-deficient, t-test) had the same surround sizes [measured only at the photopic level, as there is little or no surround at the scotopic level for both genotypes (see text and Methods)].
