Contrast sensitivity in all mice showed an increase in amplitude and a broadening of spatial frequency profile with increases in light intensity. Note that these are threshold measurements, rather than averages, as described in <a href="#pone.0001714-Prusky1">[36]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001714-Douglas1">[37]</a>. With these measurements, animals are pushed to their best performance, which reduces animal-to-animal variability that arises from unrelated causes (e.g., differences in learning or inattention).</p>
