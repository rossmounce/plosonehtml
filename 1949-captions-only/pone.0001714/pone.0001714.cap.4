                Figure 4.  Visual performance, measured as contrast sensitivity, was the same for both genotypes.For (A) wild-type and (B) Cx57-deficient mice, measurements were taken at three different light intensities: blue, photopic, black, scotopic, red, low scotopic; see Methods for all light intensities (p&gt;0.25, low scotopic: p&gt;0.5, scotopic: p&gt;0.1, photopic, t-test, Bonferroni corrected). Contrast sensitivity in all mice showed an increase in amplitude and a broadening of spatial frequency profile with increases in light intensity. Note that these are threshold measurements, rather than averages, as described in [36], [37]. With these measurements, animals are pushed to their best performance, which reduces animal-to-animal variability that arises from unrelated causes (e.g., differences in learning or inattention).
