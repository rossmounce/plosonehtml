                Figure 5.  The shift produced by dopamine was the same for both genotypes.For (A) wild-type and (B) Cx57-deficient retinas, the center of mass values showed a shift in tuning towards higher spatial frequencies with the addition of dopamine (p&lt;0.0011 for wild type, n = 196 control, n = 87 dopamine; p&lt;0.0016 for Cx57-deficient, n = 161 control, n = 89 dopamine, KS test). Yellow lines indicate the mean of the distributions to clarify the shift. There were no significant differences between the two genotypes (p&gt;0.16 without dopamine, n = 196 wild-type, n = 161 Cx57-deficient; p&gt;0.77 with dopamine, n = 87 wild-type, n = 89 Cx57-deficient, KS test).
