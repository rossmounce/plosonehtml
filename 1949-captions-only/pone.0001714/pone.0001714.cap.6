                Figure 6.  The shift produced by cobalt was the same for both genotypes.For (A) wild-type and (B) Cx57-deficient retinas, the center of mass values showed a shift in tuning towards lower spatial frequencies with the addition of cobalt (p&lt;2×10−5 for wild type, n = 196 control, n = 130 cobalt; p&lt;0.0019 for Cx57-deficient, n = 161 control, n = 76 cobalt, KS test). Yellow lines indicate the mean of the distributions to clarify the shift. There were no significant differences between genotypes (p&gt;0.16 without cobalt, n = 196 wild-type, n = 161 Cx57-deficient; p&gt;0.66 with cobalt, n = 130 wild-type, n = 76 Cx57-deficient, KS test).
