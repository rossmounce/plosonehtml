                Figure 1.  Duration distortions in the right and left space.(a) Experiment 1: average bisection points when digit 9 was the test stimulus. (b) Experiment 2: average bisection points when digit 1 was the test stimulus. (c) Experiment 3: average bisection points when circles were used as reference and test stimuli. (d) Representative data from one participant in Experiment 1: Black continuous line and black triangles: test stimulus in right space; black dashed line and black circles: test stimulus in central position; grey line and white squares: test stimulus in left space.
