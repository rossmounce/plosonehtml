                Figure 1.  SKAP-55 deficient T-cells show enhanced anti-CD3 induced ERK activation.Panel A: FACS profile of T-cells from SKAP-55+/+, +/− and −/− mice stained with AlexaFluor647 labeled anti-pERK. T-cells from lymph-nodes were left unstimulated, or stimulated with anti-CD3-biotin (10 µg/ml) and streptavidin for 5 min. Upper panel: SKAP-55+/+; upper middle panel: SKAP-55−/+; lower middle panel: SKAP-55−/−; lower panel: comparison of anti-CD3 stimulated SKAP-55+/+, SKAP-55+/− and SKAP-55−/− cells vs. pervanadate treated cells. Right upper panel: histogram showing the difference in MFI values for SKAP-55+/+, SKAP-55+/− and SKAP-55−/− cells. Right lower panel: histogram showing the difference in the percentage of SKAP-55+/+, SKAP-55+/− and SKAP-55−/− cells staining for pERK. Panel B: Anti-pERK immunoblotting of anti-CD3 activated SKAP-55+/+ versus SKAP-55−/− T-cells. T-cells were activated with 5 µg/ml anti-CD3 for 1–30 minutes. Upper panel: anti-pERK blot; middle panel: anti-ERK blotting; lower panel: anti-SKAP-55 blot. SKAP-55+/+: lanes 1–7; SKAP-55−/−: lanes 8–14; Resting: lanes 1, 8; Stimulated: 1 min: lanes 2,9; 2 min: lanes 3, 10; 5 min: lanes 4,11; 10 min: lanes 5,12; 15 min: lanes 6, 13; 30 min: lane 7, 14. Panel C: SKAP-55 deficient T-cells have impaired adhesion to ICAM-1. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 followed by a measurement of binding to immobilized ICAM-1 on plates as described in Material and Methods.
