                Figure 3.  Hyper-activation of p21ras in SKAP-55 KD cells.Upper panel: WT, Z.21 and Z.23 cells were ligated with anti-CD3 for various times and lysates were subjected to a pull-down assay using GST-Raf-1-RBD and blotted with Ras specific antibody. Middle panel: Anti-Ras blotting of cell lysates. Lanes 1–3: WT; lanes 4–6: Z.21; lanes 7–9: Z.23. Untreated: lanes 1,4,7; anti-CD3 ligation: 2 min: lanes 2,5,8; 7.5 min: lanes 3,6,9. Lower panel: Histogram showing the relative intensity of signal in the blot.
