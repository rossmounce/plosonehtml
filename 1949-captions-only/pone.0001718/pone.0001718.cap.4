DC27.10 T-cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD18 (LFA-1) for 15 minutes. Cells were then lysed and subjected to precipitation with anti-SKAP-55 followed by anti-RasGRP1 blotting (lanes 1–9). Lanes 1–4: cell lysates; lane 9: rabbit anti-mouse control. Right panel: histogram showing the percent of RasGRP1 associated with SKAP-55 in resting and stimulated cells. Panel B: SKAP-55 partially co-localizes with RasGRP-1 in the TGN of DC27.10 cells. Cells were stained with anti-rabbit RasGRP-1/anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568 and anti-mouse Syntaxin6/anti-mouse AlexaFluor647 or anti-mouse SKAP-55/anti-mouse Alexa647. Upper panels: RasGRP-1 staining occurs in the TGN. Panel a: anti-RasGRP-1; panel b: anti-syntaxin 6; panel c: anti-RasGRP1/Syntaxin. Lower panels: panel d: anti-RasGRP1; panel e: anti-SKAP-55; panel f; anti-SKAP-55/RasGRP-1; panel g: anti-SKAP-55/RasGRP-1 staining of activated C57BL/6 primary T-cells. For analysis, at least 100 cells were counted.</p>
