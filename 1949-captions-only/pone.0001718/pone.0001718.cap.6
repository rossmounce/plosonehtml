Right panel: images of cells showing co-localization of RasGRP-1and TGN under resting and anti-CD3 activated conditions. For analysis, at least 100 cells were counted. Panel B: <em>SKAP-55 +/+</em> and <em>SKAP-55−/−</em> T-cells show equal amounts of RasGRP1. Upper panel: Cells were stained with anti-RasGRP1/anti-rabbit AlexaFluor647 and analysed by FACS. Lower panel: histogram showing the MFI values of <em>SKAP-55 +/+</em> and <em>SKAP-55−/−</em> T-cells.</p>
