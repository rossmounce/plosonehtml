                Figure 6.  Increased RasGRP1 in the trans-Golgi network of SKAP-55−/− T-cells.Left panel: histogram showing % of T-cells expressing RasGRP-1 in the TGN (i.e. co-localization with Syntaxin) in SKAP-55+/+ versus SKAP-55−/− T-cells. Right panel: images of cells showing co-localization of RasGRP-1and TGN under resting and anti-CD3 activated conditions. For analysis, at least 100 cells were counted. Panel B: SKAP-55 +/+ and SKAP-55−/− T-cells show equal amounts of RasGRP1. Upper panel: Cells were stained with anti-RasGRP1/anti-rabbit AlexaFluor647 and analysed by FACS. Lower panel: histogram showing the MFI values of SKAP-55 +/+ and SKAP-55−/− T-cells.
