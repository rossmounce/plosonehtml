VEGF expression was determined by ELISA. MiRNAs in group 1 were selected using a strict criteria: free energy less than −24 kcal/mol, nt2–7 perfectly pairing with the 5′-end of miRNAs, and sequence conservation of target sites across five vertebrate species. MiRNAs in group 2 were chosen from miRNAs that only met relatively relaxed criteria: free energy between −24 kcal/mol and −15 kcal/mol, and an elastic seed window tolerating one G:U wobble in successive 6-mers. Repressive ratio = (1–ELISA value of miRNA/ELISA value of blank)×100%. The blank is the sample from cells without transfection, providing a control for protein expression in the absence of regulation. A random sequence (NC), <em>miR-224</em>, mutated <em>miR-16</em> (<em>miR-16-M</em>), and <em>miR-20a</em> (<em>miR-20a-M</em>) that do not have MREs in the VEGF 3′-UTR were used as negative controls.</p>
