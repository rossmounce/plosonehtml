                Figure 1.  Validation of VEGF regulation by putative miRNAs.The effect of putative VEGF-regulative miRNAs on VEGF expression was tested in hypoxia-induced CNE cells by transfecting the cells with siRNA duplexes homologous in sequence to the miRNAs in group 1 (A) and 2 (B). VEGF expression was determined by ELISA. MiRNAs in group 1 were selected using a strict criteria: free energy less than −24 kcal/mol, nt2–7 perfectly pairing with the 5′-end of miRNAs, and sequence conservation of target sites across five vertebrate species. MiRNAs in group 2 were chosen from miRNAs that only met relatively relaxed criteria: free energy between −24 kcal/mol and −15 kcal/mol, and an elastic seed window tolerating one G:U wobble in successive 6-mers. Repressive ratio = (1–ELISA value of miRNA/ELISA value of blank)×100%. The blank is the sample from cells without transfection, providing a control for protein expression in the absence of regulation. A random sequence (NC), miR-224, mutated miR-16 (miR-16-M), and miR-20a (miR-20a-M) that do not have MREs in the VEGF 3′-UTR were used as negative controls.
