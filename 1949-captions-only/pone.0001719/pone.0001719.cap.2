                Figure 2.  Luciferase activity assay.COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector, which contained either the VEGF 3′-UTR fragment nt31-216 (pRL-VEGF-Con1) or nt703-944 (pRL-VEGF-Con2), and an miRNA which has a putative binding site in either pRL-VEGF-Con1 (A) or pRL-VEGF-Con2 (B). Luciferase activity was measured to determine the effect of these miRNAs on luciferase translation. All miRNAs have only one predicted MRE in the corresponding report vector. Repressive ratio = (1–LA value of miRNA/LA value of blank)×100%. LA: luciferase activity. The blank is the sample from cells without transfection, providing a control for protein expression in the absence of regulation. A random sequence (NC), miR-29b, miR-150, miR-106b, and miR-134 that do not have MREs in the VEGF 3′-UTR were used as negative controls.
