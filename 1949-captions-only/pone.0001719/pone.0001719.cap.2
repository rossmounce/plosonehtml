Luciferase activity was measured to determine the effect of these miRNAs on luciferase translation. All miRNAs have only one predicted MRE in the corresponding report vector. Repressive ratio = (1–LA value of miRNA/LA value of blank)×100%. LA: luciferase activity. The blank is the sample from cells without transfection, providing a control for protein expression in the absence of regulation. A random sequence (NC), <em>miR-29b</em>, <em>miR-150</em>, <em>miR-106b</em>, and <em>miR-134</em> that do not have MREs in the VEGF 3′-UTR were used as negative controls.</p>
