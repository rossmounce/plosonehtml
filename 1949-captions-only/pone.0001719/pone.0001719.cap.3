                Figure 3.  Correlation and linear regression analysis of central loops of miRNA:MRE duplexes.A, Central loops (or bulges) of miRNA:MRE duplexes were divided into three categories: standard loop, type I decentered loop, and type II decentered loop. Standard loops start at between nt9 and nt11 of the miRNA:MRE duplex counting from the 5′ end of the miRNAs. The type I decentered loop starts before nt9, with the type II decentered loop opening after nt11. The loop score is designated according to the algorithm introduced in the Methods. B–D, Relationship between miRNA repression efficiency and the central loop score (B), tail score (C), and minimum free energy (D). Compared with the tail score and minimum free energy, the central loop score has a closer correlative relationship with miRNA repression efficiency (r = 0.646, p&lt;0.001).
