                Figure 4.  Mutation assays.Site-directed mutagenesis of miR-17-5p (A) , miR-372 (B), pRL-VEGF-Con1 (D), and pRL-VEGF-Con2 (E) caused movement of the standard loops of miRNA:MRE duplexes, forming Type I and Type II decentered loops instead, while the free energy of miRNA:MREs was kept at similar levels. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild type or mutated miRNAs and different report vectors. The levels of luciferase activity decreased significantly due to the change in loop location (C and F).
