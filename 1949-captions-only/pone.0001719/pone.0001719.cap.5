These changes allowed us to compare miRNA:MRE duplexes bearing standard central loops (A and D) in miRNA:MRE duplexes with the ones bearing Type I (B) and Type II (E) decentered loops. Luciferase activity assays indicated that changes to Type I and Type II decentered loops decreased the repressive effect of miRNAs significantly (C and F).</p>
