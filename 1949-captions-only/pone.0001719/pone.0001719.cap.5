                Figure 5.  Effect of loop location on miRNA functioning.The insert fragments of the VEGF 3′-UTR in pRL-VEGF-Con1 and/or pRL-VEGF-Con2 were changed to fragments of the c-Met 3′-UTR or COX-2 3′-UTR to create pRL-CMET-Con3 and pRL-COX2-Con4. These changes allowed us to compare miRNA:MRE duplexes bearing standard central loops (A and D) in miRNA:MRE duplexes with the ones bearing Type I (B) and Type II (E) decentered loops. Luciferase activity assays indicated that changes to Type I and Type II decentered loops decreased the repressive effect of miRNAs significantly (C and F).
