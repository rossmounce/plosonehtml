                Figure 1.  Differential activation profiles of pDC and cDC by RSV.Bone marrow from BALB/c mice was cultured with Flt3L or GM-CSF for preferential expansion of pDC and cDC, respectively, as described. Isolated cell populations (1.106/ml) were subjected to RSV infection (MOI-2.0) for 24 hrs and the supernatants and cells were collected to assess cytokine levels by luminex (A) and surface activation markers by flow cytometry (B). The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was assessed using the entire cell population in control vs. RSV-infected cells. The data represent meanÂ±SEM of 4 repeat experiments.
