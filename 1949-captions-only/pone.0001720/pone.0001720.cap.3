Data are represented as mean airway resistance in cm H<sub>2</sub>O/ml/sec±SEM. (B) Lung lymph node T cell cytokine production in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. Eight days after infection, lung lymph nodes were isolated from control (Cont), RSV-infected (RSV), Flt3L treated and RSV-infected (Flt3L+RSV) and Flt3L treated, pDC depleted, RSV infected (Flt3L+120G8+RSV) mice and stimulated with anti-CD3 at a concentration of 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Data are represented as mean ng/ml±SEM. (C) Cytokine messenger RNA levels in the lungs of mice. Six days after infection, mRNA was isolated from lungs of control (Cont), RSV-infected (RSV), Flt3L treated and RSV-infected (Flt3L+RSV) and Flt3L treated, pDC depleted, RSV infected (Flt3L+120G8+RSV) mice and analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR by Taqman. Each sample was normalized using a GAPDH control and the data show average fold increase to control±SEM. * <em>P</em>&lt;0.01 compared to non-infected control mice, # <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 compared to RSV infected mice, n = 5 mice per group. This experiment was repeated twice with similar numbers of mice and displayed comparable results.</p>
