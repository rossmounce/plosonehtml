Shown are representative sections of control (Cont), RSV-infected (RSV), Flt3L treated and RSV-infected (Flt3L+RSV) and Flt3L treated, pDC depleted, RSV infected (Flt3L+120G8+RSV) mice in a 200× (H&amp;E) or 400× (PAS) magnification. (B) To quantify the mucus production in the lung, PAS sections were randomized, examined in a blinded fashion and scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1: representing no mucus cell content, 2: one airway with PAS staining, 3: Multiple airways with strong PAS staining, 4: Multiple airways with strong PAS staining and mucus filled airways. In addition, RNA was isolated from the lungs of control (Cont), RSV-infected (RSV), Flt3L treated and RSV-infected (Flt3L+RSV) and Flt3L treated, pDC depleted, RSV infected (Flt3L+120G8+RSV) mice and transcribed into cDNA. Samples were analyzed for Muc5ac and GOB-5 mRNA levels using quantitative real-time PCR by Taqman. Each sample was normalized using a GAPDH control and the figure shows average fold increase to RNA obtained before infection±SEM. * P&lt;0.05 compared to control mice, # P&lt;0.05 compared to RSV infected mice, n = 5–6 mice.</p>
