                Figure 6.  Selective expansion of cDC and pDC affects CD8+ T cell responses but not CD4+ T cell responses in the lung after RSV infection.Six days after infection, single cell suspensions of lungs from control (Cont), RSV-infected (RSV), Flt3L treated and RSV-infected (Flt3L+RSV) and Flt3L treated, pDC depleted, RSV infected (Flt3L+120G8+RSV) mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence or expression of (A) CD3+CD4+ T cells, (B) CD69 on CD4+ T cells, (C) CD3+CD8+ T cells, (D) CD69 on CD8+ T cells, (E) Intracellular IFN-γ expression in CD8+ T cells or (F) RSV M2 MHCI pentamer expression on CD8+ T cells. * P&lt;0.05 compared to non-infected control mice, # P&lt;0.05 compared to RSV infected mice, n = 4–6 mice per group.
