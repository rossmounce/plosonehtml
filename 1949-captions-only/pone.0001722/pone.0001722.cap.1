Positive values indicate the percentage of samples found with a gain. Negative values indicate the percentage of samples harboring a loss at the specified chromosome location. Genes in specified regions affected by copy number gain are indicated in green and genes affected by copy number loss are indicated in red. A selection of affected genes is indicated. The full list of 359 affected transcripts can be found in supplementary <a href="#pone.0001722.s001">table S1</a>.</p>
