                Figure 2.  Loss of 14q32.2-32.33 chromosomal region and HSP90 expression in relation with survival.(A) Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival are shown for 29 patients in relation to gene dosage in chromosome region 14q32.33. (B) Overall survival for 29 patients in relation to HSP90 expression. Low expression was defined as expression lower than the median of the total 32 samples, “normal” expression was defined as higher than the median of 32 samples. Three of 32 patients included in the analysis of gene dosage and expression were excluded from the survival analysis because of a survival time of less than 30 days.
