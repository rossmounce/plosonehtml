Cells were seeded at 105/well, and viable cell number was determined on subsequent days as described in <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. 17-AAG concentrations at (H441) or above (A549, H460 &amp; H157) 30 nM uniformly resulted in time-dependent loss of cell viability. The IC50 value of 17-AAG (continuous exposure for 72 h) for each cell line is as follows: H460 = 30 nM, H157 = 15 nM, H441 = 8 nM, and A549 = 20 nM.</p>
