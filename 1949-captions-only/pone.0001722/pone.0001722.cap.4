                Figure 4.  Sensitivity of a panel of wild type EGFR-expressing NSCLC cell lines to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG.(Aâ€“D) time- and dose-dependent inhibition of the in vitro growth of H460, H157, H441, and A549 NSCLC cell lines following exposure to 17-AAG. Cells were seeded at 105/well, and viable cell number was determined on subsequent days as described in Methods. 17-AAG concentrations at (H441) or above (A549, H460 &amp; H157) 30 nM uniformly resulted in time-dependent loss of cell viability. The IC50 value of 17-AAG (continuous exposure for 72 h) for each cell line is as follows: H460 = 30 nM, H157 = 15 nM, H441 = 8 nM, and A549 = 20 nM.
