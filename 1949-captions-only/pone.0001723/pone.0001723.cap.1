                Figure 1.  Comparison of A. euteiches sequences to the non redundant protein database at NCBI and proteomes of fully sequenced organisms.Unigene sequences were blasted using the BLASTX software to the nr database and to the proteome of P. sojae (Ps), A. thaliana (At), N. haematococca (Nh), T. pseudonana (Tp) and T. gondii (Tg). For each class of e-value the percentage of unigenes showing homology is indicated.
