                Figure 2.  Classification of unigenes based on eight functional categories involved in pathogenicity.A. euteiches unigenes (black bars) for which a putative function was assigned were classified into defined categories according to [17] and [16]. For each category the number of ESTs (A) and the number of unigene (B) is shown. For comparison to Phytophthora, analysis of a EST collection from P. sojae was added to the figure [16] (white bars).
