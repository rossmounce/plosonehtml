                Figure 3.  Protein domain organisation of cell surface proteins from oomycetes and apicomplexa.Two proteins from Phytophthora, CBEL and CAR which are localized at the cell surface [33], [37] are represented. CBEL contains two closely associated domains, a cellulose binding domain (CBD) and a N/apple PAN domain (PAN). CAR proteins are composed of a mucin-like region and a N-terminal region (CAR) with conserved cysteine residues. AMA1 is a P. falciparum protein with two PAN domains [39].
