CBEL contains two closely associated domains, a cellulose binding domain (CBD) and a N/apple PAN domain (PAN). CAR proteins are composed of a mucin-like region and a N-terminal region (CAR) with conserved cysteine residues. AMA1 is a <em>P. falciparum</em> protein with two PAN domains <a href="#pone.0001723-Bai1">[39]</a>.</p>
