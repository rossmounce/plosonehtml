A putative signal peptide (SP) and two domains similar to cystatin domain are shown. B, alignment of cystatin domains from <em>P. infestans</em> cystatins (EPIC1, EPIC2A, EPIC2B , EPIC3 and EPIC4) and from Ae_2AL5945. The active sites of cystatins, including the N-terminal trunk (NT), first binding loop (L1), and second binding loop (L2), are shown.</p>
