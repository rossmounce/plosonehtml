                Figure 5.  A cystatin-like protease inhibitor in A. euteiches.A, domain organisation of the deduced protein sequence of Ae_2AL5945. A putative signal peptide (SP) and two domains similar to cystatin domain are shown. B, alignment of cystatin domains from P. infestans cystatins (EPIC1, EPIC2A, EPIC2B , EPIC3 and EPIC4) and from Ae_2AL5945. The active sites of cystatins, including the N-terminal trunk (NT), first binding loop (L1), and second binding loop (L2), are shown.
