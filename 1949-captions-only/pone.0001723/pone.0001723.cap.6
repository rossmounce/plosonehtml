                Figure 6.  Identification of conserved amino acid residues at the N-terminal extremities of P. infestans and A. euteiches CRN sequences.A, multiple alignment of A. euteiches like CRNs and P. infestans CRNs (CRN1, CRN5, CRN11, CRN14) showing the highest homology to A. euteiches sequences. B, consensus sequence pattern calculated using Weblogo showing the most conserved amino acid residues.
