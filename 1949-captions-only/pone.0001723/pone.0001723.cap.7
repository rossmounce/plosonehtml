Trypanothione is synthesized from glutathione and spermidine either in two successive steps catalysed by glutathionyl spermidine synthase and trypanothione synthase. It has been shown in some cases that trypanothione synthase is able to catalysed the two reactions. Unigenes predicted to code enzymes belonging to this pathway are indicated. B, multiple alignment of gluthationyl spermidine synthetase from <em>E. coli</em> (GSP_ECOLI), from <em>Crythidia fasciculata</em> (TRYS CRIFA) and Ae_2AL7562.</p>
