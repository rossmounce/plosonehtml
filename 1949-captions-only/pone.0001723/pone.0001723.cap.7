                Figure 7.  Identification of A. euteiches genes putatively involved in trypanothione synthesis.A, trypanothione biosynthesis starts with the formation of glutathione catalysed by g-glutamyl synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Trypanothione is synthesized from glutathione and spermidine either in two successive steps catalysed by glutathionyl spermidine synthase and trypanothione synthase. It has been shown in some cases that trypanothione synthase is able to catalysed the two reactions. Unigenes predicted to code enzymes belonging to this pathway are indicated. B, multiple alignment of gluthationyl spermidine synthetase from E. coli (GSP_ECOLI), from Crythidia fasciculata (TRYS CRIFA) and Ae_2AL7562.
