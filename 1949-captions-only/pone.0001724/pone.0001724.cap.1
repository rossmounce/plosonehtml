                Figure 1.  OBF-1-null mice have severely impaired B cell responses to S. japonicum infection.(A–D) Sera were collected at the times indicated, and SEA- or SWA-specific IgG (1:50 dilution) and IgE (1:10 dilution) were measured by ELISA. Results are shown as the means±SD from six mice in each group. (E) Frozen spleen sections prepared from mice at 5 weeks post-infection were stained with biotinylated PNA followed by streptavidin-FITC to reveal GCs (arrow). Six mice in each genotype were examined. Similar results were obtained in each group. Representative pictures are shown. Magnification: 40×. (F) Splenocytes and splenic B cells from mice at 5 weeks post-infection were cultured with or without SEA or SWA for 3 days. Cell proliferation was determined as described in the Materials and Methods. Results represent the mean±SD of four mice for each genotype. Statistically significant differences are shown as p values.
