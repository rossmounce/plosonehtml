                Figure 2.  OBF-1-deficient mice fail to develop hepatic granulomas early in S. japonicum infection.(A) OBF-1 wild-type or null mice (seven mice for each genotype) were analyzed for granuloma pathology at 5 weeks after S. japonicum infection. Representative pictures of a liver from each genotype are shown. (B) Paraffin-embedded liver sections prepared from mice analyzed in (A) were stained with H&amp;E to reveal granulomas. The images shown for each genotype are of livers from two different mice. Magnification: 100× (upper), 400× (lower). (C) The number of granulomas containing a single S. japonicum egg or the total number of granulomas in 30 optical fields (100×) of paraffin-embedded liver sections was counted for each mouse. Results are presented as the mean±SD of seven mice for each genotype. p values for the compared groups are given. (D) OBF-1 wild-type (n = 6) and null mice (n = 7) were analyzed for granuloma pathology at 8 weeks post-infection. The number of liver granulomas was analyzed as in (C). (E) Liver eggs from seven mice in each genotype were analyzed at 5 weeks post-infection and expressed as egg number per gram liver or female worm. Bars indicate the mean±SD. Statistically significant differences between the compared groups are shown as p values.
