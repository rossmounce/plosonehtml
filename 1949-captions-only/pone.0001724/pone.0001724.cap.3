                Figure 3.  Defective granuloma pathology in OBF-1-null mice is associated with an altered accumulation of IgG and B220+ cells but not changes in the CD4+ or Th1 cell responses.(A) IgG deposition and B cell accumulation in the liver granulomas of OBF-1 wild-type and null mice was assayed at 5 or 8 weeks post-infection by immunohistochemical staining. Six or seven mice of each genotype were analyzed, and representative images are shown. Magnification: IgG (upper): 100×; B200 (lower): 200×. (B) CD4+ cell accumulation in liver granulomas was analyzed in six mice for each experimental condition. Representative images are shown. Magnification: 200×. (C) Splenocytes from 5 week post-infection mice were cultured with or without SEA or SWA for 7 days. Supernatants were collected, and the concentration of IFN-γ was determined by ELISA. Bars show the mean±SD of four mice for each genotype. (D) The mRNA expression of T-bet in splenic cells was measured by RT-PCR (upper). β-actin was used as an internal control. Relative T-bet mRNA levels are presented as a mean±SD (lower).
