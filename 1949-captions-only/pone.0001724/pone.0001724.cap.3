Six or seven mice of each genotype were analyzed, and representative images are shown. Magnification: IgG (upper): 100×; B200 (lower): 200×. (B) CD4<sup>+</sup> cell accumulation in liver granulomas was analyzed in six mice for each experimental condition. Representative images are shown. Magnification: 200×. (C) Splenocytes from 5 week post-infection mice were cultured with or without SEA or SWA for 7 days. Supernatants were collected, and the concentration of IFN-γ was determined by ELISA. Bars show the mean±SD of four mice for each genotype. (D) The mRNA expression of T-bet in splenic cells was measured by RT-PCR (upper). β-actin was used as an internal control. Relative T-bet mRNA levels are presented as a mean±SD (lower).</p>
