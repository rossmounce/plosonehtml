                Figure 4.  B cell-deficient µMT mice also show markedly impaired granuloma formation at 5 weeks post-infection.(A) Liver granulomas from µMT (n = 9) and C57BL/6 (n = 7) mice were analyzed as described in Fig. 2C. Bars indicate the mean±SD and p values for the compared groups are shown. (B) Liver eggs from mice analyzed in (A) were counted. Data are presented as the mean±SD, and the p values are given.
