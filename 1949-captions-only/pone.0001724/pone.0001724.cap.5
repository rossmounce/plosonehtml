Six OBF-1 wild-type mice (A) and three C57B/6 mice (B) were analyzed in each experiment. Representative images are shown. Magnification: 40×. (C) Paraffin-embedded spleen sections prepared from C56BL/6 mice of 8 weeks post-infection were stained with H&amp;E to reveal lymphoid follicles. Naïve mice were used as controls. Three mice in each group were analyzed. Magnification: 40×. (D) Splenic cells from naïve or infected OBF-1 wild-type mice (six mice for each group) were stained with anti-B220 or anti-CD3. Splenic B220<sup>+</sup> or CD3<sup>+</sup> cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. (E) Splenic cells from these mice (six mice for each group) were stained with Annexin V plus anti-B220 or anti-CD3. Apoptotic splenic B220<sup>+</sup> or CD3<sup>+</sup> cells are shown. Results are presented as a mean±SD. Statistically significant differences between the compared groups are given as <em>p</em> values.</p>
