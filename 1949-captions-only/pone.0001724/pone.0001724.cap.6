                Figure 6.  S. japonicum infection impairs the T-cell dependent antibody response.(A) Naïve or infected C57BL/6 mice were injected with 50 µg of OVA. Sera were collected at 12 days after OVA immunization. OVA-specific IgG in sera (1:50 dilution) was measured by ELISA. Data are presented as a mean±SD. p values are shown for the comparison between infected mice at each time point and the uninfected control group. (B) C56BL/6 mice, either uninfected or at 8 weeks post-infection, were challenged with OVA for 12 days. Frozen splenic sections were stained with biotinylated PNA followed by streptavidin-FITC to reveal GCs. Magnification: 40×.
