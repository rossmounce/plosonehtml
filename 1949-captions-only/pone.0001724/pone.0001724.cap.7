                Figure 7.  A working model for the function of B cells in granuloma pathology and the effect of lymphoid follicle disruption on down-regulation of the immune response and granulomas.At early stages of Schistosoma infection (5 weeks), B cell function is required for granuloma formation. Mice with B cell deficiencies fail to mount an effective inflammatory reaction. Meanwhile, deficient B cell function also affects liver egg burden and produces impaired granuloma pathology. At later stages (7â€“8 weeks), the Th2 response exerts a dominate effect on granuloma pathology (ref. 2) and is accompanied by both an accumulation of CD4+ cells and a reduction of B220+ cells and antibody in granulomas. Infection by Schistosoma destroys the lymphoid follicles at 8 weeks and degrades immune responses, such as the T helper cell-dependent B cell response to OVA. Finally, granuloma pathology diminishes after 12 weeks of infection.
