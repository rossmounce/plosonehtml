The trajectory demonstrates the sway present in the arm prior to committing to the movement, during latency. When the arm moves outside the 100-pixel escape region (dotted line), this provides the in-motion segment of the trajectory. The small dotted square is the location at which a button press is initiated. Right panel: The x- (green) and y-axis (blue) accelerometer data for that same trial. During latency, a resting voltage signal is present (the at-rest voltage generated by the accelerometers). This voltage is modulated (up or down, depending on direction of movement) when the Wiimote is displaced, shown between the two dotted boxes. This example trial has a brief in-motion segment. Acceleration range was computed by subtracting the mean latency acceleration from the absolute maximum acceleration during motion. The rightmost dotted box is the region in which perturbation of the remote is inspected for voltage range.</p>
