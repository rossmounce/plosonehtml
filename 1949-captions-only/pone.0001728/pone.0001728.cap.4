                Figure 4.  Presentation of the interaction between correct (green line) and incorrect (red points) trials and presentation order.Latency does not seem to index correct/incorrect trials across presentation order for each pair. However, in-motion time and x-flips drop relatively more for correct trials compared to incorrect trials, indicated by the significant interaction term (see text for details).
