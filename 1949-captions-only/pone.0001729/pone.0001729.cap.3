Positive Factor VIII stained blood vessels were located in the central regions of the pores within penetrated tissues. The blood vessels also permeated through the inter-openings between each pore. The group with 25 µg PDGF encapsulated in slow release PLGA microspheres had measurably more vascularization.</p>
