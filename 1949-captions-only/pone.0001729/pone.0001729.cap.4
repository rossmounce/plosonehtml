                Figure 4.  PDGF-containing microspheres in nanofibrous scaffolds increases angiogenesis in vivo.The blood vessel number was measured within each group using sections immunostained with Factor VIII antibody. Blood vessel number within both PDGF encapsulated, slow release groups was significantly greater that that in other groups. The blood vessel number of PDGF-encapsulated in the fast release PLGA group showed no difference from that in the NFS-only group. * indicates p&lt;0.01
