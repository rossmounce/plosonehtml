                Figure 1.  Phylogeny of LT cichlids reconstructed by Bayesian Inference and dated using a relaxed molecular clock (Yule speciation prior).Timescales for the two alternative calibrations are shown. The gray bars on each node indicate 95% credible intervals for the node ages. Black circle indicates the node used to date the tree. P = Principle lineage, C = C-lineage, L = L-lineage. Gray branches indicate non-endemic taxa. LM = Lake Malawi species.
