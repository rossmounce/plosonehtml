                Figure 2.  Average net diversification rates of LT cichlid clades (with missing species added) and the minimum rate estimate for LM and LV cichlid species flocks.Lines show the 95% confidence intervals incorporating both variation across sampled trees and the inherent stochasticity of the branching process.
