                Figure 3.  Lineage-through-time (LTT) plots, including missing species, based on 1000 sampled Bayesian trees: a) LT radiation (black); b) L-lineage (black) and C-lineage (gray); c) tribes: Lamprologini (purple), Ectodini (green), Tropheini (plum), Limnochromini (fawn), Cyprichromini (aqua), Bathybatini (yellow).A single LLT plot is highlighted for all tribes, but is only displayed for the latter three tribes for clarity. Timescales for the two alternative calibrations are shown.
