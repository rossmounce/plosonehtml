                Figure 4.  Net diversification rate through time fitted by General Additive Models (GAMs) for a) the entire flock and b) the L- (black) and C- (gray) lineages.Scale bars (x-axis) represent both 28 Myr and 12 Myr calibrations and the y-axis is the per lineage diversification rate in species per million years. Dashed lines show standard errors combining those across Bayesian samples and those due to uncertainty in the model in a), but only those across Bayesian samples in b). In the latter case, standard errors due to uncertainty in the model are extremely large.
