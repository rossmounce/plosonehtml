The sequence above the peak is the sequence to assay. The x axes are the dispensation nucleotides to the sequencing reaction based on the assayed sequences. The y axes show light emission obtained as relative light units. A: <em>ALVE</em> region1 in blood (the mean value of methylation percentage is 81.8±2.9 in line 7<sub>2</sub> and 13.2±1.2 in 6<sub>3</sub>); B: <em>ALVE</em> region2 in blood (the mean value of methylation percentage is 85±1.6 in line 7<sub>2</sub> and 47.6±2.3 in 6<sub>3</sub>); C: <em>ALVE</em> region3/4 in blood (the mean value of methylation percentage is 80.8±4.8 in line 7<sub>2</sub> and 68.8±6.7 in 6<sub>3</sub>); D: Promoter region of <em>TVB</em> in Hypothalamus (the mean value of methylation percentage is 45.7±14.8 in line 7<sub>2</sub> and 37.0±14.1 in 6<sub>3</sub>).</p>
