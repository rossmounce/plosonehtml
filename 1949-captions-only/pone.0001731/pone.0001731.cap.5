                Figure 5.  DNA sequencing of PPT region and partial U3 region of 3′ LTR in ALVE between line 63 and line 72.Brown box shows the PPT region. Brown arrow shows one variation located on PPT region changed from G in line 63 to A in line 72. Black arrow shows another variation located in U3 region of 3′ LTR changed from T in line 63 to C in line 72. n = 11 for each line.
