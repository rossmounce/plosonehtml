                Figure 1.  (A) Schematic representation of structure of PfAARP (Gene ID PFD1105w) gene showing location of signal sequence (SS) and trans-membrane (TM) region.The locations of asparagine rich region and conserved proline repeat region are also marked, respective amino acid positions are also indicated. (B) Amino acid sequence alignment of PfAARP with that of four homologs from P. berghei (PB402266.00.0) P. chabaudi (PC401501.00.0) P. vivax strain SaI-1 (Pv090210) and P. yoelii yoelii strain 17XNL (PY06454). Amino acids that are identical in at least three of five species (&gt;60%) are shown in dark, amino acids that are similar in at least three of five species (&gt;60%) or to those shown in dark, are shaded light grey. Transmembrane region is indicated by solid bar.
