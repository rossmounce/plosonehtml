(B) Amino acid sequence alignment of PfAARP with that of four homologs from <em>P. berghei</em> (PB402266.00.0) <em>P. chabaudi</em> (PC401501.00.0) <em>P. vivax</em> strain SaI-1 (Pv090210) and <em>P. yoelii yoelii</em> strain 17XNL (PY06454). Amino acids that are identical in at least three of five species (&gt;60%) are shown in dark, amino acids that are similar in at least three of five species (&gt;60%) or to those shown in dark, are shaded light grey. Transmembrane region is indicated by solid bar.</p>
