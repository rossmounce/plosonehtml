                Figure 2.  Stage specific expression of PfAARP in asexual blood stage parasites.(A) Relative transcription of PfAARP assessed by real-time-RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from tightly synchronized parasite cultures at early ring (ER), late ring (LR), trophozoite (T), early schizont (ES) and late schizont (LS) stages (8, 16, 30, 40 and 48 h after invasion). Stage specific expression of EBA-175 and Falcipain 2 was analyzed as controls. (B) Northern blot analysis of total RNAs isolated from synchronized parasite cultures at ring (lane 1), trophozoite (lane 2), and schizont (lane 3) stage hybridized with labeled PfAARP probe. Equal loading of RNA in all the wells was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of rRNAs in the gels (lower panel). (C) Western blots analyses of equal number of highly synchronized parasites at ring (lane 1), trophozoite (lane 2) and schizont (lane 3) with anti-PfAARP antibodies. Anti-HRPII antibodies were used to probe a blot ran in parallel to show equal loading in each wells (lower panel).
