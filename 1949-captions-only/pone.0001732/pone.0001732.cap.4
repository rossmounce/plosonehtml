                Figure 4.  Immunofluorescence assay to localize PfAARP by coimmuno-staining of P. falciparum parasites with anti-PfAARP (green) and anti-MSP-1 (red) antibodies.The parasite nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and slides were visualized by fluorescence microscope. The apical ends of the merozoites have dense structure. MSP-1 staining was found around the merozoites and the PfAARP was localized at the apex of the merozoites. MS, mid schizont; LS, late schizont and M, free merozoites.
