                Figure 5.  Spatial localization of PfAARP by co-immunostaining studies with microneme resident proteins AMA-1 (A) and EBA-175 (B).P. falciparum parasites were co-immunostained with anti-PfAARP (green) and anti-AMA-1 or anti-EBA-175 (red) antibodies. The parasite nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Both the microneme markers and PfAARP showed punctate staining in the schizonts. In the late schizonts and merozoites, AMA-1 was present over the entire surface of the merozoites but is most densely distributed at their apical tip, whereas EBA-175 staining was restricted to the apical ends. Enlarged image of selected individual merozoite is shown in the inset. MS, mid schizont; LS, late schizont and M, free merozoites.
