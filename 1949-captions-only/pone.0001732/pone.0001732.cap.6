The parasite nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Clag3.1 staining was present in the rhoptry bulb in the free and invading merozoites (lower panel). PfAARP was localized just above these two rhoptry bulbs towards the apex of the merozoites. Enlarged image of merozoite invading in the host erythrocyte is shown in the inset. LS, late schizont and M, free merozoites.</p>
