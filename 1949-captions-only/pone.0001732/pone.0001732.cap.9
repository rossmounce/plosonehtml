(B) Western blot of elutes from the RBC binding assays with the recombinant PfAARP-N protein pre-incubated in RPMI alone (lane 1) or with antibodies purified from pre-immune sera (100 µg, lane 2) and anti- PfAARP antibodies purified from rabbit immune sera (10, 25, 50 and 100 µg, lane 3–6). Equal amount of recombinant protein was used in each assay.</p>
