                Figure 1.  Phase-contrast (A, C, E) and fluorescence photomicrographs (B, D, F) of primary neuronal cultures to illustrate normal noninfected cell morphology (A, B) and cytopathic effects 3 days after inoculation of Curionopolis virus (C, D) and 4 days after inoculation of Itacaiunas virus (E, F).Arrows point to neurite fragmentation and circles indicate refringent points probably corresponding to apoptotic nuclei (A, C). Arrows and arrowheads indicate infected soma and dendrites, respectively (D, F). Neurons were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for anti-neurofilament antibodies. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate.
