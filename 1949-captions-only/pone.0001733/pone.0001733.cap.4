Apoptotic like-cells with nuclear pyknosis and cytoplasmic condensation were detected among tissue vacuolation (arrows) (D). Meningeal congestion and edema with lymphomononuclear cells (arrows) (E). Groups of pyknotic cells presenting cytoplasmic condensation (circles), mixed with normal cells and vacuolated parenchyma (stars) (F). Recent hemorrhagic points (presence of red blood cells) presenting parenchymatous edema (lozenge), mainly in the areas of worst cell damage (84 h post-inoculation) (G). Nuclear fragmentation or karyorrhexis (arrows) and edema (lozenge) (96 h post-inoculation) (H).</p>
