                Figure 5.  Transmission electron photomicrographs of ultrathin sections obtained from control (A) and mouse brain infected intracerebrally with Curionopolis for 36 (B,C), 60 (D) and 96 h (E), and with Itacaiunas for 24 (F), 60 (G), 72 (H), 96 (I) and 108 h (J).Normal tissue with intact neuronal soma and appendages (A); viral particles (arrow), interstitial edema (stars) and cellular rarefaction (lozenge) are seen 36 h post-inoculation (p.i.) (B, C); necrotic cells were observed at 60 h p.i. (D); intense perivascular edema (stars), hyperplastic endotheliocytes and reduced vessel luminal area (E); well-preserved brain parenchyma and vessels at 24 h p.i. (F); viral particles, endotheliocyte hyperplasia, and mild interstitial edema (stars) at 60 h p.i. (G); membrane viral budding in rich polyribosomes oligodendrocyte-like cell at 72 h p.i. (H); brain parenchyma at 96 h p.i. presenting a large number of viral particles (I); apoptotic features were more marked at 108 h p.i. (J). AC = apoptotic cell, M = mitochondria, OL = oligodendrocyte, EC = endothelial cells, VL = vascular lumen, N = cell nucleus, NC = necrotic cells.
