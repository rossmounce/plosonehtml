High power images illustrating isolated neurons of the olfactory bulb with immunolabeled soma (arrow) and other neuronal appendages (arrowheads) (C); immunolabeled meningeal cells are also indicated (arrow) (D); cortical (E) and thalamic (F) neurons immunostained with viral antigens distributed in the cell appendages. TUNEL-positive neurons in infected brain sections (TUNEL POD procedure) 6 days after inoculation with Curionopolis virus into the ventral olfactory bulb (G, H). The arrows indicate immunostained neuronal nuclei.</p>
