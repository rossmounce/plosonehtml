                Figure 6.  Bright-field (A, G) and interferential contrast (B–F, H) photomicrographs of infected mouse brain sections illustrating viral antigen-immunolabeled cells 2 (A–D) and 4 (E–G) days after inoculation with Curionopolis virus and TUNEL immunolabeling at 6 days (G, H).Low (square) (A), medium (B) and high (C) power photomicrographs of labeled olfactory bulb neurons. High power images illustrating isolated neurons of the olfactory bulb with immunolabeled soma (arrow) and other neuronal appendages (arrowheads) (C); immunolabeled meningeal cells are also indicated (arrow) (D); cortical (E) and thalamic (F) neurons immunostained with viral antigens distributed in the cell appendages. TUNEL-positive neurons in infected brain sections (TUNEL POD procedure) 6 days after inoculation with Curionopolis virus into the ventral olfactory bulb (G, H). The arrows indicate immunostained neuronal nuclei.
