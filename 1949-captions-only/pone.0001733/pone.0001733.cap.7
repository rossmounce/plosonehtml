                Figure 7.  Bright-field (A, D, F) and interferential contrast (B, C, E, G) photomicrographs of Itacaiunas virus-infected mouse brain at 4 (Aâ€“C), 6 (D, E) and 8 (F, G) days post-inoculation.Low (A) and medium (B) power photomicrographs of the olfactory neuronal group (smaller rectangle). Details of immunolabeled neurons of the frontal cortex (C) (arrows and arrowheads). Low (D) (rectangle) and medium (E) power photomicrographs of a group (arrows) of hippocampal neurons showing low viral antigen condensation (arrowhead). TUNEL-positive midbrain neurons of infected brain sections (TUNEL POD procedure) 12 days after inoculation with Itacaiunas virus (F, G). The arrows indicate immunostained neuronal nuclei.
