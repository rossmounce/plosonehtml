Merged brightfield and fluorescence images; original magnification 200×. (B) Human insulin concentration in 24 h conditioned media of primary hepatocytes electroporated with p3MTChins (2 µg/10<sup>6</sup> cells) in Amaxa or NC solutions (<em>p</em> = 0.0026). (C) Human insulin concentration in 24 h conditioned media of p3MTChins-electroporated hepatocytes. Thresholds for stimulating insulin secretion were 4 mM glucose (<em>p</em> = 0.0018 cf. 2.5 mM glucose) and 5 µM zinc (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 cf. no zinc). Data are means±s.e.m. of quadruplicate experiments. (D) Time course of insulin secretion by electroporated hepatocytes. Insulin secretion increased from 0.01 to 0.14 ng/10<sup>3</sup> hepatocytes/min (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001) after 5 min in 25 mM glucose but not in 2.5 mM glucose over 85 min. Data are means±s.e.m of quadruplicate experiments from 2 primary hepatocyte preparations. (E) Insulin mRNA, quantified by real time RT-PCR after subtracting a parallel minus-RT control and normalising to HPRT1 mRNA <a href="#pone.0001734-Chen1">[19]</a>, rose within 5 min in 25 mM glucose (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001) and fell within 10 min in 2.5 mM glucose (<em>p</em> = 0.0149). Values are mean±s.e.m. of triplicate experiments.</p>
