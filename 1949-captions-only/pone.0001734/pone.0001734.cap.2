Data are from 14 pigs. (B) Transcript analyses of islet hormones from pancreata of healthy, untreated diabetic (38–46 wk post-STZ) and treated diabetic (38–49 wk post-STZ) pigs (n = 2 per group) by real time RT-PCR as in <a href="#pone-0001734-g001">Fig. 1E</a>. Insulin mRNA was significantly decreased and glucagon mRNA significantly increased in both groups of diabetic pigs compared to healthy controls (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons). Both diabetic groups had similar expression of insulin and glucagon (<em>p</em> = 0.4041 and 0.2308, respectively). Somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide expression was not significantly different among all groups. (C) Insulin-positive cells in normal islets of a healthy pig cf. absent in diabetic pigs 38 wk post STZ.</p>
