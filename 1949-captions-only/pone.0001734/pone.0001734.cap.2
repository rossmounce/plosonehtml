                Figure 2.  Absence of insulin expression in pancreatic β cells of STZ-diabetic pigs.(A) Persistent abolition of IVGTT-induced rise in serum PCP in the late treatment phase (13–47 wk after hepatocyte transplantation). Data are from 14 pigs. (B) Transcript analyses of islet hormones from pancreata of healthy, untreated diabetic (38–46 wk post-STZ) and treated diabetic (38–49 wk post-STZ) pigs (n = 2 per group) by real time RT-PCR as in Fig. 1E. Insulin mRNA was significantly decreased and glucagon mRNA significantly increased in both groups of diabetic pigs compared to healthy controls (p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons). Both diabetic groups had similar expression of insulin and glucagon (p = 0.4041 and 0.2308, respectively). Somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide expression was not significantly different among all groups. (C) Insulin-positive cells in normal islets of a healthy pig cf. absent in diabetic pigs 38 wk post STZ.
