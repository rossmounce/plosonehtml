See Supporting <a href="#pone.0001734.s001">Table S1</a> for number of animals (N), separate analyses (n), means, s.e.m. and range for all biochemical tests performed. (A) Mean fasting glycemia in early and late treatment phases were significantly lower in treated pigs (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 for both phases). (B) Glycemic profiles during IVGTT in the 4 study phases. Pre- and post-STZ profiles are pooled data from all pigs. Profiles of treated and untreated pigs were from the late treatment phase. (C) Glycemic data from panel (B) expressed as AUC<sub>20–90BG</sub>. Implanted insulin-secreting hepatocytes improved glucose tolerance (*, <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001) with durable effect (<em>p</em> = 0.3481 early vs late treatment phase). (D) Serum HCP levels in treated pigs increased 5 min after intravenous glucose (<em>p</em> = 0.0124 and 0.0633 in the early and late treatment phases, respectively, cf. unstimulated HCP levels). (E) AUC<sub>20–90HCP</sub> of treated pigs was comparable in both treatment phases (<em>p</em> = 0.8279). (F) AUC<sub>20–90PCP</sub> confirmed β-cell ablation in STZ-diabetic pigs throughout the study (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 both treatment phases cf. pre-STZ phase); *, <em>p</em> = 0.8279. (G) Mean serum fructosamine levels were lower in treated pigs in the early and late treatment phases (<em>p</em> = 0.0014 and &lt;0.0001, respectively. cf. untreated pigs). Fructosamine levels did not rise significantly in treated pigs (<em>p</em> = 0.1500) but did increase among untreated pigs (<em>p</em> = 0.0015; early vs late treatment phase). (H) Body weight gain was higher among treated pigs (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 early treatment and <em>p</em> = 0.0002 late treatment phase). (I) Mean serum creatinine concentration in treated pigs during the late treatment phase was significantly higher than untreated diabetics (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001). (J) Total serum cholesterol was higher in untreated pigs during the early treatment phase (<em>p</em> = 0.0035). Treated pigs maintained normocholesterolemia during the late treatment phase. Reduced serum cholesterol levels in untreated pigs during the late treatment phase were associated with marked weight loss. (K) Hypertriglyceridemia developed acutely in all pigs after onset of diabetes (<em>p</em> = 0.0002). It declined significantly in treated pigs during the early phase (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 cf. untreated pigs). Marked reduction in serum triglyceride concentrations during the late treatment phase was associated with severe weight loss in untreated pigs. (L) Mean serum ALT activities in treated pigs during pre-STZ and late treatment phases were comparable (<em>p</em> = 0.8508) but were significantly higher in untreated pigs (<em>p</em>&lt;0.0001 pre-STZ vs both treatment phases). Serum ALT decreased in treated pigs (early vs. late treatment values, <em>p</em> = 0.0228) but rose significantly in untreated pigs over the same period (<em>p</em> = 0.0086). (M–Q) The number of transplanted hepatocytes correlated with percentage decrease in fasting hyperglycemia, decrease in AUC<sub>20–90BG</sub>, stabilization of serum fructosamine, rise in fasting serum HCP levels and AUC<sub>20–90HCP</sub>. (R, S) Serum bilirubin and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels did not correlate significantly with the number of implanted hepatocytes but (T) serum albumin levels correlated positively.</p>
