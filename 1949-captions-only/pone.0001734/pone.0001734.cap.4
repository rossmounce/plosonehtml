                Figure 4.  Engraftment of insulin-expressing autologous hepatocytes.Immunostained liver 36 wk after hepatocyte transplantation showed normal lobular architecture and insulin-producing hepatocytes engrafted around the portal triads (A) and central veins (B). Panels (B) and (C) show co-staining for insulin and mitotic markers, PCNA and Ki67, respectively. Mitotically positive cells were rare (arrowed). (D) Quantitative PCR using vector-specific primers detected p3MTChins in liver 3 and 8 mo after implantation. The amount of vector detected in each sample is expressed in ng plasmid DNA below the panel.
