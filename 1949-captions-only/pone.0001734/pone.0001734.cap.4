Panels (B) and (C) show co-staining for insulin and mitotic markers, PCNA and Ki67, respectively. Mitotically positive cells were rare (arrowed). (D) Quantitative PCR using vector-specific primers detected p3MTChins in liver 3 and 8 mo after implantation. The amount of vector detected in each sample is expressed in ng plasmid DNA below the panel.</p>
