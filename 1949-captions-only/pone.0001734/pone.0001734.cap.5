(B) Retinal fluorescein angiography showed normal capillary permeability. (C) TEM of retina showed thickened basement membrane of a choroidal capillary, duplicated basement membrane (red arrow) and an extra layer of cells in the capillary wall (blue arrow). (D) H&amp;E stained kidney sections showed enlarged glomeruli with mesangial expansion, and arteriolar wall thickening (arrow) in untreated diabetes. (E) TEM of untreated diabetic kidney showed thickening of glomerular basement membrane. (F) SEM showed abnormal endothelial surface structures only in carotid arteries of untreated diabetic pigs. (G) Increased intensity of PAS staining in untreated diabetic liver without fibrosis or cirrhosis. (H) Basement membrane thickness, measured in 20 choroidal capillaries and 20 renal glomeruli of each group (n = 2), was significantly greater in untreated diabetes cf. both treated and healthy animals. *, treated vs. untreated.</p>
