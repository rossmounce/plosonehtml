Genes â‰¥1.5-fold different in expression in pairwise comparisons were analysed by SAM (significance analysis of microarray) based on 1,000 permutations (false discovery rate &lt;1%). Shaded areas denote diabetes-affected genes. (B) Expression of diabetes-affected genes in untreated and treated pigs grouped in increasing order of differential expression relative to healthy pigs. Genes represented by multiple probe sets were merged and averaged. (C) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of diabetes-affected genes showed a distinct tendency for tissue transcriptomes of treated diabetic and healthy pigs to cluster together. Replicate transcriptional profiles of the same animal are designated 1 and 2, or 3 and 4 (i.e. 2 pairs of transcription datasets per group of 2 animals). Numbers on selected nodes of each dendrogram are the dissimilarity index (D.I.).</p>
