                Figure 1.  Conceptual framework of the study.The concept of local cortical (lateral) inhibition (left) is contrasted with that of global cortical inhibition (right), as illustrated by examples of a tonotopic and a periodicity map obtained by optical imaging in gerbil AI (A,B, cf. Ref. [17]) and by schematic drawings of the interconnectivity pattern (C,D). A: Different colors within the tonotopic map depict representations of different pure tone frequencies from low (blue) to high (red). B: Different colors within the periodicity map depict representations of different AM tone periodicities from low (blue) to high (red). The concept of local (lateral) inhibition proposes an inhibitory interconnection pattern, whereby any given unit (or stimulus representation) inhibits only its immediate neighbors within the parameter space (A,C: red projections), resulting in local contrast enhancement. The concept of global inhibition proposes an inhibitory interconnection pattern, whereby any given unit (or stimulus representation) inhibits all other representation within the parameter space (B,D: blue projections, inhibitory interneurons are not shown), resulting in the implementation of a “winner-take-all” algorithm, i.e. global contrast enhancement. Note that since any BP representation in a circular map has an eccentric location, projections from any BP representation within the map to all other locations of the map (blue lines) result in an asymmetric geometry of projections (cf. Fig. 6B). Gray lines: inactive projections. Black arrows: Thalamic input. E,F: Stimulation paradigms (schemes) used to test local (red) and global (blue) inhibitory concepts, respectively. E: Isointensity frequency response functions (light red curve) are usually obtained by plotting pure tone (vertical dark red line) evoked discharge rates as a function of tone frequency. F: Stimulation paradigm used here in the competitive interaction experiment. Two AM tone complexes were presented simultaneously (duration: 200 ms, 65 dB SPL). Spectra of both AM tone complexes (vertical dark blue lines) were entirely outside the frequency receptive field (FRF; light blue curve; cf. Ref. [33]) of the unit, which in our experiments always meant above the FRF, because all recorded units showed responses to low frequency pure tones. One of the complexes had a fixed fm (fc1/fm1) set to best periodicity of one of the units, the second had a different fc (fc2) and varied in fm (fm2). Note that fc2 could be higher or lower than fc1 in the experiments, but both AM spectra were always completely above the units' FRF.
