                Figure 2.  Competitive interactions in a cell pair recorded simultaneously in AI.Response plane histograms are shown for 2 units (A,C,E and B,D,F) with different best periodicities (600 and 900 Hz, respectively) and hence located in different areas of the circular periodicity map in AI (as schematically indicated by arrows from the periodicity map between left and middle column; numbers in map refer to BPs of the respective map area) which were recorded simultaneously during stimulation with either a single AM tone complex (A,B) or 2 concurrently presented AM tone complexes (C–F). Response plane histograms are arranged in panels where modulation frequency of AM tone complexes (in steps of 150 Hz) is plotted over time. Spikes per bin are color-coded according to the scale bar at the bottom right of each histogram, with the maximum number of spikes indicated in each case. Histogram binwidth: 5 ms. Vertical yellow lines mark onset and offset of stimulation. In the 2 AM tone condition in C,D, the best AM tone complex for each unit was fixed, while the concurrent AM tone complex was varied in fm (cf. Fig. 1F). In E,F the fixed AM tone complex was that of the other unit, that is, C,F and D,E (and A,B) were recorded simultaneously. The unit in A,C,E (the ‘loser’) responded only to the two AM tone complexes when the periodicities of both AM tone complexes fell within its periodicity receptive field. By contrast, the unit in B,D,F (the ‘winner’) always responded to its best AM tone complex irrespective of the periodicity of the concurrent AM tone complex. Note that the strength of the response to the best AM tone complex could be modulated by the second AM tone complex: Strongest responses were typically seen, when both AM tone complexes had similar periodicities, that is, when both periodicities were within the receptive field of the unit.
