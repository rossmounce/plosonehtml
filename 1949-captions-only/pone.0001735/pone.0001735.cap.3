                Figure 3.  Quantitative analysis of tuning properties of winner and loser responses.(A) Relationship between response range and range of presented stimuli. By definition, winner units respond to all stimulus combinations in two AM conditions. (B) Distribution of tuning sharpness (Q) during two AM conditions. Tuning of losers is significantly sharper than tuning of winners. Depending on BP, Q-values of winners may only range between 0 and 1, whereas those of losers may exceed 1. (C) Comparison of tuning sharpness (Q) between one and two AM conditions. Whereas there is no significant change in Q in losers, winners show significantly smaller Q-values during the two AM condition compared to the one AM condition. (D) Frequency distribution of tuning filter characteristics. Complex (CX) filter characteristics were most frequent in both winners and losers, but whereas only winners showed high-pass (HP), non-selective (NS) and band-suppression (BS) filter characteristics, band-pass (BP) and low-pass (LP) filter characteristics were only found in loser responses.
