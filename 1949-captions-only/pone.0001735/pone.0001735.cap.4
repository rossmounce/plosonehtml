                Figure 4.  Pharmacological manipulation of cortical competitive interaction.Responses plane histograms in response to two concurrently presented AM tone complexes are shown for the same unit in AI before (A), during (B), and after (C) iontophoretic application of BIC; ejecting current: 40nA. Conventions and layout as in Fig. 2C,D. The unit showed a ‘loser’-like response behavior in the pre-drug condition, but a ‘winner’-like response behavior during blockade of GABAA-mediated inhibition via iontophoresis of BIC.
