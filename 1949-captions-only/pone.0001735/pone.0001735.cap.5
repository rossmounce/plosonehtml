Winners (pink) always stayed winners under drug conditions. (B) BIC-effect on tuning sharpness. Q-values became significantly smaller in those units that changed from loser to winner response type (blue), but this effect was only a trend in the group of losers that stayed losers (red). Winners (pink) also showed significantly smaller Q-values during the BIC-condition because of a drop of BP. (C) A similar effect was seen with a modified Q-value where the BP of the control condition was also used to calculate the Q-value of the BIC-condition. With this analysis consequently tuning sharpness of winners did not change at all (pink).</p>
