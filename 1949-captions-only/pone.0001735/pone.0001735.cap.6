Panels C–E demonstrate direct contacts of biocytin-labeled terminations with parvalbumin-positive (i.e. GABAergic) interneurons. A: Single sagittal section through the auditory cortex processed for biocytin following an injection of biocytin (100 nl) into layers II–IV of AI. Labeled axons (stained brownish-yellow) expand from the injection site (red star, BF 1–2 kHz) to a large extent in dorsal direction, i.e. in a tonotopic manner within the dorsoventrally oriented 1–2 kHz isofrequency contour (schematically indicated by grey solid lines). Additionally, a substantial number of axon projections cross different frequency domains (i.e. are non-tonotopic), in this case predominately in ventrorostral and ventrocaudal directions (red arrows). Note, that these non-tonotopic, long-range projections spread asymmetrically from the injection site (indicated by different length of red arrows). Additionally, projections to the anterior and posterior auditory fields (AAF and DP) can be seen. B: Reconstruction of five consecutive sagittal sections through supragranular and granular layers of the gerbil's auditory cortex following an injection of biocytin (5 nl) into layers III–IV of AI (red star; BF 4 kHz). Red lines represent outlines of traced sections, green-shaded area corresponds to the auditory koniocortex (which comprises fields AI and AAF <a href="#pone.0001735-Chen1">[14]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001735-Budinger1">[28]</a>). Blue stars represent biocytin-filled neurons at the injection site (shown on microphotograph in the inset). Blue dots represent biocytin-labeled boutons. Note again the asymmetric distribution of labeled boutons of the non-tonotopic, long-range projections within AI (red arrows). C–E: Biocytin-labeled terminations (brownish stain) in contact with various PV-positive GABAergic interneurons (violet stain) in layers III/IV of AI. Arrows point to synaptic contacts at proximal dendritic aspects (C, D) and at cell somata (E). The distance of contacted PV-positive somata from the injection site is noted in the top right-hand corner of each panel. Section orientation in A applies to all panels. The experimental cases from which data are shown as well as the volume of biocytin injected are noted in the bottom left-hand corner of each panel.</p>
