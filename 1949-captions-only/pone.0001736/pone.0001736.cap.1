                Figure 1.  Diagram of Y choice apparatus used for larval and adult testing.Individual M. sexta were placed into a short “loading arm” attached to a 10cm diameter central chamber to which a vacuum was applied. Air was bubbled through 20 ml of EA and pulled through one of the two side arms, while ambient air was pulled through the other. Larvae and adults were allowed to move freely within the apparatus for ten minutes, at which time their position was scored as either the EA arm, ambient air arm, or no choice (defined as the loading arm or any portion of the central chamber).
