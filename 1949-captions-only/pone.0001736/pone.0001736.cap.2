Only larvae conditioned with shock+odor demonstrate a significant aversion to EA as larvae, and larvae trained at third instar recall the aversion at fifth instar, indicating retention of memory across molts. *** (p&lt;0.001) indicates values that differ significantly from random choice (dashed horizontal line) by a two-tailed binomial calculation. Values are meansÂ±SD.</p>
