Only individuals that received the shock+odor pairing as fifth instar caterpillars maintained odor avoidance as adults. While individuals trained at third instar demonstrated odor aversion at fifth insta (<a href="#pone-0001736-g002">Fig 2</a>.), the behavior was lost during pupation. ** (p&lt;0.01) indicates the value that differs significantly from random choice (dashed horizontal line) by a two-tailed binomial calculation.
