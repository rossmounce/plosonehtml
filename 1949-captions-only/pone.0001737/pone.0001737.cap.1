                Figure 1.  a. Comparison of the protein sequence of humanTTC4 (Hs) with its Drosophila (Dm) and S. Cerevisiae (Sc) orthologues.Areas of identity are shown in shading. The region of the protein containing the TPR domains is underlined. Point mutations of TTC4 which were tested for their interaction with hCDC6 and Hsp90 and 70 (Fig 6) are coloured in red a-42 (V to D), b-67(I to M),c-77 (E to A), and d-217(N to K). b. Phylogenetic tree showing a comparison between the TTC4 protein and a variety of other TPR containing proteins which interact with Hsp90 and/or Hsp70. Each protein is tagged with a prefix to show which species the protein is from h-human, Dm–Drosophila melanogaster, Sc–S. cerevisiae.
