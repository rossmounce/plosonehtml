                Figure 3.  TTC4 shows interaction with human HSP90, HSP70 and CDC6 by immunoprecipitation from Hela cells extract.a: TTC4 serum recognises a single band of 48 kDa in whole cell extracts (lane 1). The intensity of this band is greatly reduced upon competition with GST TTC4 (lane 2). Molecular weight standards are indicated on the left in kDa. b: HSP90, HSP70 and CDC6 co immunoprecipitate with TTC4. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as indicated in Materials and Methods. WCE: Whole cell extract, snt pre immune: supernatant after incubation with the pre immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, snt IP: supernatant after incubation with the anti TTC4 immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, pellet pre immune: eluate from the pre immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, pellet IP eluate from the anti TTC4 immune serum bound to protein A sepharose. For WCE, snt pre immune and snt IP: 40 Âµg were loaded on the gel. For pellet, pre immune and pellet IP: 1/5 of each eluate was loaded on the gel.
