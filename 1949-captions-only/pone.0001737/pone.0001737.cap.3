The intensity of this band is greatly reduced upon competition with GST TTC4 (lane 2). Molecular weight standards are indicated on the left in kDa. b: HSP90, HSP70 and CDC6 co immunoprecipitate with TTC4. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as indicated in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. WCE: Whole cell extract, snt pre immune: supernatant after incubation with the pre immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, snt IP: supernatant after incubation with the anti TTC4 immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, pellet pre immune: eluate from the pre immune serum bound to protein A sepharose, pellet IP eluate from the anti TTC4 immune serum bound to protein A sepharose. For WCE, snt pre immune and snt IP: 40 Âµg were loaded on the gel. For pellet, pre immune and pellet IP: 1/5 of each eluate was loaded on the gel.</p>
