The left panel of this Coomassie stained PAGE shows the purified proteins used in the assay (Inputs) and the right hand panel the glutathione beads resuspended in SDS PAGE loading buffer after co incubation of the proteins (pellets). Wt: wild type GST-TTC4, K: K152E GST-TTC4 mutant, R1 and R2: R156E GST-TTC4 mutant and RK: K152E, R156E GST-TTC4 mutant. More sample was loaded into the lanes with mutant proteins in an effort to detect faint interactions.</p>
