                Figure 6.  TTC4 is predominantly a nuclear protein.a. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of Hermes 3a and Nohm1 cells was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. In each case TTC4 is stained in red, tubulin in green and DNA in blue. b. Detail of the individual staining patterns of tubulin and TTC4 in Nohm1 cells. c. Immunoblot to show the location of TTC4 after fractionation of Hela cells into cytoplasmic (cyt), nucleoplasm (np) and chromatin associated (pellet) fractions as described in Materials and Methods. Alpha-tubulin (immunoblot) and Histones (Coomassie- blue staining) are shown as controls for the fractionation. Note that the coomassie stained band in the cytoplasmic lane of the histone panel is not histone related.
