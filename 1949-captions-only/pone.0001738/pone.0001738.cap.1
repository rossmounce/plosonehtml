The miRNA levels detected by real-time PCR are represented as a heat map. The intensity of yellow scale corresponds to the level of miRNA expression; black indicates that expression was undetectable. MiRNAs encoded in miR-17-92 and miR-290-295 clusters are marked with red and blue, respectively. (B-D) Alteration of miRNA expression during PGC development. The relative values of miRNA expression in male (solid line and open cycles) and female (broken line and closed circles) after E12.5 are shown. Until E11.5, the sex of PGCs was not determined. Relative values were calculated by dividing the raw value of the individual miRNA by that of the recombinant miR-16 as its levels were pre-determined in the samples.</p>
