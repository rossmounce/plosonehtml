                Figure 3.  Lower expression of IAP and LINE-1 in DicerCKO PGCs.(A) In situ hybridization analysis of LINE-1 expression in E13.5 gonads. The signal was presumably detected in both male (upper) and female (bottom) germ cells. (Bâ€“C) Real-time PCR analysis of IAP and LINE-1 expression in E13.5 PGCs (B) and in neonatal spermatogonia (C). Shown are relative values of transcript levels of LINE-1 or IAP in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. (D) Real-time PCR analysis of Gapdh expression in E13.5 PGCs (E13.5) and neonatal spermatogonia (3dpp) in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. Shown are relative values of transcript levels of Gapdh in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. Same number of sorted PGCs from control and mutant embryos (3000 PGCs) were subjected to cDNA synthesis, followed by Q-PCR analysis. The value for Gapdh transcripts was calculated by using a reference graph generated from serially diluted DNA samples. The mean values in DicerCKO cells were calculated from three independent experiments.
