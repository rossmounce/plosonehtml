The signal was presumably detected in both male (upper) and female (bottom) germ cells. (Bâ€“C) Real-time PCR analysis of IAP and LINE-1 expression in E13.5 PGCs (B) and in neonatal spermatogonia (C). Shown are relative values of transcript levels of LINE-1 or IAP in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. (D) Real-time PCR analysis of <em>Gapdh</em> expression in E13.5 PGCs (E13.5) and neonatal spermatogonia (3dpp) in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. Shown are relative values of transcript levels of <em>Gapdh</em> in DicerCKO, compared to those in littermate controls. Same number of sorted PGCs from control and mutant embryos (3000 PGCs) were subjected to cDNA synthesis, followed by Q-PCR analysis. The value for <em>Gapdh</em> transcripts was calculated by using a reference graph generated from serially diluted DNA samples. The mean values in DicerCKO cells were calculated from three independent experiments.</p>
