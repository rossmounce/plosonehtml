Right images show high magnification of white broken rectangles in left images. Scale bar: 50 µm (B) Biased inheritance of floxed <em>dicer</em> allele by progeny from DicerCKO males. Pie charts summerise percentages of genotypes of progeny from Dicer<sup>F/+</sup> TNAP-Cre (upper) and DicerCKO (bottom) males crossed with wild-type females. The number of progeny tested is shown in the center of the circles. Note that intact floxed <em>dicer</em> allele (F) is frequently inherited by progeny from DicerCKO males. Illustration in the right side of the pie charts estimates schematic ratio of <em>Dicer</em> excision in spermatogonia and spermatozoa, based on the percentages in the pie charts. Since floxed <em>dicer</em> allele is inherited by almost half of progeny from DicerCKO males, almost all fertile spermatozoa seems to be derived from Dicer<sup>F/+</sup> spermatogonia which had escaped from <em>Dicer</em> excision, indicating blockage of spermatogenesis of <em>Dicer</em>-deleted cells. (C) Expression levels of <em>Dicer</em> in neonatal spermatogonia and 14 dpp spermatocytes. Relative expression levels of <em>Dicer</em> were calculated by reference to the levels of <em>Gapdh</em>. (D) Representative colonies derived from neonatal testis after culture for 2 weeks. Scale bar; 50 µm (E) The list of miRNA highly expressed in neonatal spermatogonia. MiRNAs encoded in miR-17-92 and miR-290-295 clusters are marked with red and blue, respectively. The miRNA levels detected by real-time PCR are represented as a heat map. The intensity of yellow scale corresponds to the level of miRNA expression; black indicates that the signal below detection levels (see in <a href="#pone-0001738-g001">Figure 1A</a>).</p>
