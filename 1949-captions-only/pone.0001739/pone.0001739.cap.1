                Figure 1.  Estimates of heritability (a) and coefficients of variation from three variance components, phenotypic variance (b), additive variance (c) and environmental variance (d), for eight morphological traits.Each component was estimated from parent-offspring regression, mean traits animal model and repeated measures animal. WL = wing length; WP = wing projection; TL = tail length; BD = bill depth; BW = bill width; BL = bill length; SL = skull length; TR = tarsus length.
