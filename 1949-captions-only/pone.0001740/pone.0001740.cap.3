                Figure 3.  Hierarchical tree showing the sequential splits of the largest connected component of the tree/parasitic fungus network.Due to space constraints, only tree taxa are represented. Branches corresponding to the six network compartments (C1 to C6) are indicated. Tree leaf symbols correspond to tree phyla (gray squares: Magnoliophyta; black squares: Conipherophyta). R denotes tree species of the Rosaceae family.
