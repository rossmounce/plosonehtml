                Figure 4.  Comparison of the major pathogenic types (C: canker agents, OP: obligate biotroph parasites, RDF: root decay fungi, SDF: stem decay fungi, SF: strict foliar necrotroph parasites).Bars indicate standard errors of the means. (A) For the number of interactions per species. (B) For the number of tree groups linked together. Two tree taxa belong to the same group if they belong to the same network compartment. (C) For the rank in the network's largest connected component after rearrangement for nestedness.
