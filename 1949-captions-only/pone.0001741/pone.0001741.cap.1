                Figure 1.  EGF stimulation enhances S100A7 expression in breast cancer cells.70–80% confluent MCF-7 cells (A) and MDA-MB-468 cells (B) were washed twice and rinsed with PBS followed by 18 hrs of serum starvation. The cells were then stimulated with various concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 30 minutes at 37°C. The cells were lysed and S100A7 expression was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S100A7 antibody, as indicated. Equal protein loading in each lane was checked by stripping the blots and probing with β-Actin antibody (A and B, lower panels). The experiments were repeated thrice with identical results.
