The cells were then stimulated with various concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 30 minutes at 37°C. The cells were lysed and S100A7 expression was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S100A7 antibody, as indicated. Equal protein loading in each lane was checked by stripping the blots and probing with β-Actin antibody (A and B, lower panels). The experiments were repeated thrice with identical results.</p>
