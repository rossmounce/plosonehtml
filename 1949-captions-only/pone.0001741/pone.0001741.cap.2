                Figure 2.  S100A7 knocked-down MDA-MB-468 cells show a decrease in EGF-induced migration and invasion.(A) MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with vector control or S100A7-shRNA, as described in Materials and Methods. S100A7 expression in these cells was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S100A7 antibody (upper panel). Equal protein loading in each lane was checked by stripping the blot and probing with β-Actin antibody (lower panel). (B) Control and S100A7 shRNA-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells were subjected to a chemotaxis assay towards EGF (20 ng/ml) using the modified Boyden chamber assay, as described in Materials and Methods. The lower surface of the insert was stained with the Diff-Quik Stain kit and cells were counted in an average of 5 high-power fields (HPF; 20×). Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated three times with similar results. *p&lt;0.05 (C) Control and S100A7 shRNA-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells were subjected to an invasion assay using matrigel-coated transwell plates (BD Biosciences). Chemotaxis towards EGF (20 ng/ml) was then analyzed, as described in Materials and Methods. The cells on the insert were stained with the Diff-Quik Stain kit and total cell numbers were counted (10×). Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated thrice with similar results. *p&lt;0.05.
