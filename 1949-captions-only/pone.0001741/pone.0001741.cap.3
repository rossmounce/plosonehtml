                Figure 3.  S100A7 downregulation decreases the phosphorylation of EGFR/HER2, Src and SHP2 in MDA-MB-468 cell lines.Vector control and S100A7-shRNA stably-transfected MDA-MB-468 cell lines were starved overnight and stimulated with various concentrations of EGF (0 to 100 ng/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C. The cells were then lysed and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with p-EGFR Tyr1173/p-HER2 Tyr1248 (A, upper panel) or p-EGFR Tyr1173 (B, upper panel) antibodies. The protein levels were monitored by stripping the blots with anti-EGFR antibody (A and B, lower panels). Vector-transfected controls and S100A7 shRNA-transfected stable MDA-MB-468 cell lines were starved overnight for 17 hours and stimulated with various concentrations of EGF (0 to 100 ng/ml) for 15 minutes at 37°C. The cells were then lysed and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with p-Src Tyr416 (C, upper panel) or p-SHP2 Tyr542 antibody (D, upper panel). The protein levels were monitored by stripping the blots with total Src and SHP2 antibodies, as indicated (C and D, lower panels).
