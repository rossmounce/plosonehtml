After 4 weeks, one matrigel plug from each mouse injected with vector control or S100A7-shRNA cells was fixed in Tissue Tek and snap-frozen. The sections were stained for CD31 antibody by immunohistochemistry. (B) The other plug was grounded and the supernatant was analyzed for hemoglobin content using the Hemoglobin Assay Kit (Sigma Diagnostics). The results are interpreted as the blood volume per unit weight of matrigel (* p&lt;0.05).</p>
