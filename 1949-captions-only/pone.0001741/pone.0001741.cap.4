                Figure 4.  S100A7-downregulation decreases angiogenesis.(A) Effect of S100A7 on blood vessel formation in matrigel plugs containing MDA-MB-468 cell lines. 250 µl of Growth factor-reduced Matrigel Matrix High Concentration (BD Biosciences) was mixed with 6×106 cells (250 µl of vector control or 250 µl of S100A7-downregulated cells) and implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice (two sites per mouse). After 4 weeks, one matrigel plug from each mouse injected with vector control or S100A7-shRNA cells was fixed in Tissue Tek and snap-frozen. The sections were stained for CD31 antibody by immunohistochemistry. (B) The other plug was grounded and the supernatant was analyzed for hemoglobin content using the Hemoglobin Assay Kit (Sigma Diagnostics). The results are interpreted as the blood volume per unit weight of matrigel (* p&lt;0.05).
