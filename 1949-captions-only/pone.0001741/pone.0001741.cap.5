Micro-CT scanning of live mice was done using a GE eXplore Micro-CT scanner (GE Healthcare Ltd, UK) at 93 µm resolution, 6 weeks after injection. The tibias were dissected out and scout view radiographs were taken with a micro-CT40 scanner at 12 µm resolution obtained from SCANCO Medical AG (Switzerland). There were osteolytic lesions, destruction of the cortex and extension of the tumor into the soft tissue in the mice injected with the control S100A7 cells (Panels A1 and A2). The cortex of the mice injected with the S100A7-downregulated cells was intact (Panels B1 and B2). Tibias were excised and processed for conventional histological examination. S100A7 control mice showed tumor-induced osteolysis (Panel C1), and the osteolysis was evident in all three injected mice as compared to mice injected with the S100A7-downregulated cells (Panel C2) (H &amp; E staining, 20×). The letter ‘T’ in panel C1 represents tumor. The experiments were repeated twice with identical results.</p>
