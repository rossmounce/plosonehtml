(A) Inserts containing 5×10<sup>4</sup> vector control cells, the S100A7 shRNA (downregulated) cells or RANKL without breast cancer cells (internal positive control) were then placed on the wells and the numbers of TRAP+ multinucleated cells generated under each condition were counted at the end of 48 hours. Each culture was done in triplicate. The experiments were repeated thrice with similar results. (B) The number of multinucleated fused osteoclast cells (A) in an average of triplicate wells is represented in the histogram. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM (*p&lt;0.05). (C) Vector control and S100A7 shRNA-transfected stable MDA-MB-468 cell lines were grown to 80% confluence and supernatants were analyzed for IL-8 expression by ELISA. IL-8 expression was significantly less (*p&lt;0.02) in the S100A7-downregulated cells as compared to the vector-transfected controls.</p>
