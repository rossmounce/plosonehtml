                Figure 1.  The mass specific growth rate (Gw) of free-ranging and sea-caged N. coriiceps.A total of 21 immature adult N. coriiceps (4 recaptured twice) were tagged, released and then recaptured between 2nd Jan 2004 and 12th March 2005. The black crosses indicate the date of first and subsequent capture and the average Gw for an individual fish during its days at liberty indicated by the connecting black line. The red line connects calculations of Gw (n = 6) measured from sea-caged fish every 8 weeks. For clarity the standard error is not shown on the graph, which from May to Oct was &lt;0.003% bd. wt. d−1, and from Nov to Apr &lt;0.031% bd. wt. d−1).
