The black crosses indicate the date of first and subsequent capture and the average G<sub>w</sub> for an individual fish during its days at liberty indicated by the connecting black line. The red line connects calculations of G<sub>w</sub> (n = 6) measured from sea-caged fish every 8 weeks. For clarity the standard error is not shown on the graph, which from May to Oct was &lt;0.003% bd. wt. d<sup>−1</sup>, and from Nov to Apr &lt;0.031% bd. wt. d<sup>−1</sup>).</p>
