                Figure 2.  Seasonal home ranges of N. coriiceps.The precise locations of free-ranging fish were determined continually by acoustic telemetry throughout the year (n = 7). The 3-D spatial distribution plot was created by assigning positional data within 1 m2 cells over the range of the fish. The number of fixes per cell was calculated as a probability distribution of the total positional fixes for each 3 month period. The probability scale interval is 0.005, and purple areas indicate cells where the probability distribution was &gt;0.03, the black outline indicates the outer boundary of the home range.
