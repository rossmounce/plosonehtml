The 3-D spatial distribution plot was created by assigning positional data within 1 m<sup>2</sup> cells over the range of the fish. The number of fixes per cell was calculated as a probability distribution of the total positional fixes for each 3 month period. The probability scale interval is 0.005, and purple areas indicate cells where the probability distribution was &gt;0.03, the black outline indicates the outer boundary of the home range.</p>
