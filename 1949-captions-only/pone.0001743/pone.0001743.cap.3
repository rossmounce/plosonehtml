Fish were collected from sea-cages and immediately placed into a closed circuit respirometer, oxygen consumption and <em>f</em><sub>H</sub> were recorded simultaneously. ANOVA of fitted regression lines demonstrated that the slopes were not significantly different between summer and winter, and therefore a single regression line was fitted to explain the relationship between <em>f</em><sub>H</sub> and <em>M</em>O<sub>2</sub> throughout the year (0.148 <em>X</em>â€“0.14, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, N = 6 fish, n = 559 observations).</p>
