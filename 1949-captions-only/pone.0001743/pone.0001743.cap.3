                Figure 3.  The seasonal relationship between heart rate (fH) and oxygen consumption (MO2) in N. coriiceps.Data were recorded in June (winter, open circles), and January (summer, closed circles). Fish were collected from sea-cages and immediately placed into a closed circuit respirometer, oxygen consumption and fH were recorded simultaneously. ANOVA of fitted regression lines demonstrated that the slopes were not significantly different between summer and winter, and therefore a single regression line was fitted to explain the relationship between fH and MO2 throughout the year (0.148 Xâ€“0.14, r2 = 0.86, N = 6 fish, n = 559 observations).
