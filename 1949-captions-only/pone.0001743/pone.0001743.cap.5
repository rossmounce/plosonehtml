                Figure 5.  Summer and winter comparison of hourly activity and fH profiles in N. coriiceps.Panel A shows activity profiles from two separate fish remotely recorded by acoustic telemetry during summer months (black), and the activity profile for the same fish is also shown during winter months (red). The flat line indicates when the fish were sedentary. Panel B shows the mean hourly fH from two sea-caged N. coriiceps during summer (black) and fH for the same fish during winter (red).
