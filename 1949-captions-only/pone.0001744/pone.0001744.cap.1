                Figure 1.  Distribution of modern circumpolar Arctic tundra [15], Alaskan fires from CE 1950–2005, and sites referred to in the text.(A) Black rectangles indicate circumpolar regions showing recent increases in shrub densities and/or extent [10]. (B) Alaskan fires from CE 1950–2005 (red polygons) in tundra and boreal forest. Fires burned only 3% percent of Alaskan tundra, representing 6% of the total area burned in the state. Blue dots identify lakes used in this study: Ruppert (RP) and Xindi (XI) lakes contain records of fire and vegetation from the Shrub Tundra Zone; Ruppert, Code (CO), and Wild Tussock (WK) lakes contain records from the Boreal Forest Zone (5.5-0 ka BP). Sediment-charcoal records from Sithylemenkat Lake (1) [19] and Lost Lake (2) [18] also show qualitative evidence of increased fire activity within the Shrub Tundra Zone.
