(B) Alaskan fires from CE 1950–2005 (red polygons) in tundra and boreal forest. Fires burned only 3% percent of Alaskan tundra, representing 6% of the total area burned in the state. Blue dots identify lakes used in this study: Ruppert (RP) and Xindi (XI) lakes contain records of fire and vegetation from the Shrub Tundra Zone; Ruppert, Code (CO), and Wild Tussock (WK) lakes contain records from the Boreal Forest Zone (5.5-0 ka BP). Sediment-charcoal records from Sithylemenkat Lake (1) <a href="#pone.0001744-Earle1">[19]</a> and Lost Lake (2) <a href="#pone.0001744-Tinner1">[18]</a> also show qualitative evidence of increased fire activity within the Shrub Tundra Zone.</p>
