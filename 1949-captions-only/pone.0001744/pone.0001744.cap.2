Pollen percentage curves are smoothed to 500 years and color coded. CHAR records represent residuals after removing 500-year trends, and red lines around CHAR = 0 are thresholds identifying noise-related variations. Red plus marks identify CHAR peaks exceeding the positive threshold (and a minimum-count screening; see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>) and are interpreted as local fire events. At both sites CHARs and CHAR peaks increase distinctly with the rise in <em>Betula</em> pollen percentages, marking the transition from the Herb Tundra Zone to the Shrub Tundra Zone.</p>
