                Figure 2.  Fire and vegetation reconstructions from northcentral Alaska.Chronology, pollen stratigraphy, inferred vegetation, and high-frequency variations in charcoal accumulation rates (CHARs) from (A) Xindi Lake and (B) Ruppert Lake. Pollen percentage curves are smoothed to 500 years and color coded. CHAR records represent residuals after removing 500-year trends, and red lines around CHAR = 0 are thresholds identifying noise-related variations. Red plus marks identify CHAR peaks exceeding the positive threshold (and a minimum-count screening; see Materials and Methods) and are interpreted as local fire events. At both sites CHARs and CHAR peaks increase distinctly with the rise in Betula pollen percentages, marking the transition from the Herb Tundra Zone to the Shrub Tundra Zone.
