                Figure 3.  Fire return intervals (FRIs) from the Shrub Tundra Zone and the conifer-dominated Boreal Forest Zone (5.5-0 ka BP).FRIs from the Shrub Tundra Zone at (A) Xindi Lake and (B) Ruppert Lake with fitted Weibull models (blue lines). Weibull (Wbl) b (yr) and c (unitless) parameters, and the mean FRI (mFRI; yr) all include 95% confidence intervals. (C) Weibull models from the Shrub Tundra Zone (blue solid lines) and the Boreal Forest Zone (black dashed lines). All FRI distributions presented are statistically similar based on likelihood-ratio tests (p&gt;0.29; see Results). The Weibull b and c parameters, and mFRI for Ruppert (boreal forest), Code, and Wild Tussock lakes are 188 (147–239), 150 (123–178), and 149 (123–174); 1.53 (1.31–2.06), 1.85 (1.52–2.60), and 1.96 (1.61–2.75); 171 (135–216), 135 (113–160), and 135 (113–157), respectively.
