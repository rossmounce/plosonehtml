Mean June temperature and precipitation distributions associated with tundra vegetation and area burned are shown as histograms and box plots. For both temperature and precipitation, distributions of vegetation and area burned differ significantly based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with N<sub>fires</sub> = 232 degrees of freedom (p&lt;0.01). Most fires occurred in areas with a mean June temperature of 6–10°C and a mean June precipitation of 20–30 mm. The general bias towards warm and/or dry portions of the total climate space suggests an overriding importance of low effective moisture for facilitating tundra burning.</p>
