                Figure 6.  Within-family contrasts for fruit traits of megafauna and non-megafauna plant species.The pattern for fruit length was very similar to fruit diameter and has been omitted for clarity. Each line corresponds to the contrast (difference in mean trait value) between species of the same family with each syndrome.
