Transmembrane domains are indicated with striped boxes, the polyproline sequence (PPS) with an open box, and the foreign Flag epitope, appended to the N-terminus of CD3ε, with a dotted square. The relative positions of the ITAMs within the cytoplasmic tails are marked. (B) Addition of an anti-CD3 antibody that induces TCR conformational change protects the tail of CD3ε from trypsin proteolysis. The indicated concentrations of anti-CD3 (OKT3) or anti-Flag antibody were added to a detergent lysate of Jurkat cells transfected with Flag-CD3ε before incubation with trypsin. The bands corresponding to CD3ε and its degradation products were detected by immunoblotting first with anti-Flag antibody and second with the PPS-specific antibody APA1/1. The asterisk indicates the presence of a protein fragment in lane 1 that corresponds to the partial proteolysis of Flag-CD3ε, probably caused by cellular proteases contained in the cell lysate. The balance sheet indicates the percentages of protected CD3ε molecules, calculated by densitometry of the anti-Flag and APA1/1 immunoblots. (C) The CD3ζ tails becomes protected from proteolytic cleavage after TCR triggering. A Jurkat cell lysate was incubated with 10 µg/ml of either OKT3 or an isotypic control antibody (OKT8) before digestion with trypsin. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-CD3ζ antibodies reacting with the C-terminus (448) or the whole tail (anti-ζcit). (D) Tyrosine phosphorylation does not affect the sensitivity of CD3ε to trypsin proteolysis. A Jurkat cell lysate was incubated with 10 µg/ml of OKT3 in the presence of 20 µM of the src kinase inhibitor PP2 for 15 min at room temperature, before digestion with trypsin. Immunoblotting was performed with antibody APA1/1. (E) Protection against trypsin proteolysis is independent of TCR aggregation. A Jurkat cell lysate was preincubated with 50 µg/ml of Fab fragments of OKT3 or the isotypic control antibody 12CA5 (anti-HA), before digestion for 15 min at 37°C with the indicated concentrations of trypsin. Immunoblotting was performed with APA1/1 followed by reprobing with the 448 antiserum. The presence of immunoglobulin light chain (L) from the anti-HA Fab fragment in the APA1/1 immunoblot is indicated.</p>
