                Figure 2.  Stimulation of living T cells provokes the adoption of a protease-resistant conformation in CD3ε and CD3ζ.(A) CD3 ligation in living cells protects against proteolytic cleavage. Jurkat cells were unstimulated or stimulated for 5 min with 10 µg/ml of either anti-CD3 (OKT3) or an irrelevant antibody (HP2/6, anti-CD4). Detergent lysates were incubated with trypsin as in Fig. 1, and immunoblotting was performed with APA1/1, 448 and M20, an antibody specific for the C-terminal end of CD3ε. (B) Stimulation with certain anti-TCRα/β antibodies promotes the protease-resistant conformation in CD3ε and CD3ζ. Jurkat cells were stimulated for 5 min with the anti-Vβ antibodies BV8 (IgG2b) and C305 (IgM) or with the anti-Cβ antibody Jovi.1 (IgG1). Lysates were incubated with trypsin, and immunoblotting was performed as in A. (C) Differential capacity of the anti-TCRβ antibodies to induce the conformational change determined by the pull-down assay. Jurkat cells were stimulated with an irrelevant anti-CD4 antibody or with the indicated antibodies to the TCR complex, as in B. Lysates were subjected to pull-down with GST-SH3.1 (GST-Nck) or GST. The presence of the TCR in the precipitates was revealed by immunoblotting with anti-CD3ε (M20). TL, total cell lysate.
