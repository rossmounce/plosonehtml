The position of a Flag epitope appended to the C-terminal end of both constructs is indicated. (B) The presence of ζFlag or ζAFlag does not alter the ligation-induced conformational switch in the TCR. GST-SH3.1 pull-down was performed as in <a href="#pone-0001747-g002">Fig. 2C</a> with lysates of Jurkat cells transfected either with ζFlag (JkζFlag) or ζAFlag (JkζAFlag). (C) ITAM A is constitutively condensed. JkζFlag and JkζAFlag were stimulated with antibodies and the lysates digested with trypsin as in <a href="#pone-0001747-g002">Fig. 2C</a>. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-Flag antibody.</p>
