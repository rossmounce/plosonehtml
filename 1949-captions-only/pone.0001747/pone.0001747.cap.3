                Figure 3.  The membrane-proximal ITAM of CD3ζ is constitutively protected from limited trypsin digestion.(A) Cartoon showing the potential trypsin cleavage sites in CD3ζ and in a truncated CD3ζ lacking ITAMs B and C. The position of a Flag epitope appended to the C-terminal end of both constructs is indicated. (B) The presence of ζFlag or ζAFlag does not alter the ligation-induced conformational switch in the TCR. GST-SH3.1 pull-down was performed as in Fig. 2C with lysates of Jurkat cells transfected either with ζFlag (JkζFlag) or ζAFlag (JkζAFlag). (C) ITAM A is constitutively condensed. JkζFlag and JkζAFlag were stimulated with antibodies and the lysates digested with trypsin as in Fig. 2C. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-Flag antibody.
