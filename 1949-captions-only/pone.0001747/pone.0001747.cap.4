The PPS of CD3ε (pink square) is in a non-binding conformation for Nck. After TCR engagement with pMHC or with stimulatory antibodies, the CD3 ectodomains adopt an active conformation (symbolized with rectangular forms) that is transmitted to the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits via a rotation and/or scissor movement. The cytoplasmic tails close up to form a compact structure that is less sensitive to proteolytic attack. This conformation permits Nck-binding by CD3ε.</p>
