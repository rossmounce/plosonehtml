In trial three, the side of the optimal choice depended on a bird's choice in trial two. To control for any initial size preference not related to optimality, half of the birds (Experiment 1) were given symmetrical, narrow openings in trial four, while half (Experiment 2) were given symmetrical, wide openings. The comparison of trial two to trial three is a test of optimality, while the comparison of trial two to trial four is a test of side-bias.</p>
