Respective densitometries from 6–7 samples from separate experiments were obtained after digital image analysis and normalized to the actin band for cytosol fraction and to the complex IV subunit I band for mitochondria (Akt2 mitochondria: <em>F</em> = 39.03, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; p-Akt cytosol: <em>F</em> = 111.8, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; p-Akt mitochondria: <em>F</em> = 77.48, <em>DF</em> = 25, <em>P</em> = 0.000). Figure shows that after 12 hours increase of Akt2 and p-Akt2 is selectively confined to mitochondria. (B) Differential flow cytometry histograms of 100 µg of purified mitochondria isolated from controls (C) and insulin-treated animals were obtained with 1: 1000 fluorescent antibody anti-p-Akt in a mitochondrial population previously delimited with MitoTracker Red 580. Histograms show a kinetics similar to western blotting. (C) An Akt activity assay was performed three times by immunoprecipitation of mitochondria and cytosol proteins with anti-p-Akt antibody. After further immobilization, the proteins were detected with the anti-p-Ser21/9-GSK-3α/β antibody (1:1000). The assay confirms the insulin-induced kinetics of p-Akt in the fractions as in (A) and (B) (Cytosol: <em>F</em> = 8.46, <em>DF</em> = 15, <em>P</em> = 0.003, Mitochondria: <em>F</em> = 8.15, <em>DF</em> = 15, <em>P</em> = 0.003). (D) Western blot shows submitochondrial localization of p-Akt at the inner mitochondrial membrane, as controlled by duplicate with an antibody specific for subunit IV of cytochrome oxidase. Data are mean±SEM.; * p&lt;.05 respect to controls by ANOVA and Dunnett test.</p>
