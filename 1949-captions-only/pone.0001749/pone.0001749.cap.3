Western blots were performed with anti-His-tag (upper), anti-total Akt (middle) and anti-p-Akt antibodies (bottom). (B) To detect mitochondrial NO, flow cytometry histograms from isolated mitochondria (1 mg protein/ml) were obtained with DAF-FM in the same conditions of (A) and after incubating the organelles for 30 min a 37°C with recombinant phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Akt1 and Akt2 alone or plus 3 mM L-NMMA. The histograms were obtained in a mitochondrial population previously delimited as in <a href="#pone-0001749-g001">Figures 1</a> and <a href="#pone-0001749-g002">2</a>.</p>
