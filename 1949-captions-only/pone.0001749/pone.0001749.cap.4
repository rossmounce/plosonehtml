Mitochondria (2 mg of protein) were incubated in 50 MSHE with 2 mM of cold ATP and 2 mM of NADH and 10 mC of γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP with or without p-Akt2 or dephosphorylated Akt2 (*), as described in the legend of <a href="#pone-0001749-g003">Figure 3</a>. To the right, we show stable nNOS content in the same membrane of autoradiogram by western blot electrophoretic run. (B) Left panel: Autoradiogram of mitochondrial proteins isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle electroporated <em>in vivo</em> with empty pRNAT-U6.1/Neo vector (1) or with 10 µg of siARN nNOS (2) as compared with brain homogenate (3). Isolated proteins were processed as described in A; nNOS deficiency confirms insulin-induced mtNOS phosphorylation. Right panel shows a representative western blot of nNOS protein from the same electrophoresis.</p>
