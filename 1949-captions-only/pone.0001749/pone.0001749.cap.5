On the right, the signals of p-Akt and p-GSK-3 measured at 12 hours, which serve as controls, are controlled by western blotting and densitometry (n = 6; pAkt2: <em>t</em> = 8.4, <em>DF</em> = 10, <em>P</em> = 0.000; p-GSK3: <em>t</em> = 8.42, <em>DF</em> = 10, <em>P</em> = 0.001); The threshold for significance is the same as that described in <a href="#pone-0001749-g002">Figure 2</a>). (B) Kinetics of pure recombinant nNOS activity in a lipid phase with 10 µM of cholesterol and 20 µM of BH<sub>4</sub>; the dashed curve corresponds to non-phosphorylated nNOSα and the continuous curve to the cooperative shift of nNOSα phosphorylated by recombinant p-Akt2, as shown in intact mitochondria. Each point was done by duplicate/triplicate.</p>
