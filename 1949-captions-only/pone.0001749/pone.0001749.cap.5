                Figure 5.  Translocated p-Akt2 phosphorylates and activates NOS through positive cooperative effects.(A) Dependence of mtNOS phosphorylation on p-Akt2 pathway is demonstrated by measuring the mtNOS activity of mitochondria isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of rats treated with insulin at crescent siRNA Akt-2 (black bars), as compared with vehicle (grey bars), and muscle from non-inoculated animals (white) (n = 3; F = 66.55, DF = 11, P = 0.000; vehicle vs siRNA Akt-2 at 24 h: t = 18.05, DF = 4, P = 0.000). On the right, the signals of p-Akt and p-GSK-3 measured at 12 hours, which serve as controls, are controlled by western blotting and densitometry (n = 6; pAkt2: t = 8.4, DF = 10, P = 0.000; p-GSK3: t = 8.42, DF = 10, P = 0.001); The threshold for significance is the same as that described in Figure 2). (B) Kinetics of pure recombinant nNOS activity in a lipid phase with 10 µM of cholesterol and 20 µM of BH4; the dashed curve corresponds to non-phosphorylated nNOSα and the continuous curve to the cooperative shift of nNOSα phosphorylated by recombinant p-Akt2, as shown in intact mitochondria. Each point was done by duplicate/triplicate.
