(n = 6; densitometry: <em>t</em> = 6.55, <em>DF</em> = 10, <em>P</em> = 0.000; activity at 12 h: <em>t</em> = 6.07, <em>DF</em> = 10, <em>P</em> = 0.000; activity at 24 h: <em>t</em> = 2.22, <em>DF</em> = 10, <em>P</em> = 0.05) (B) To test the interdependence of oxidative and intermediary metabolism as related to activation of mtNOS, metabolic studies including oxygen uptake, glycogen synthesis, complete glucose oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, glucose uptake and glycogen synthase activity were performed in nNOS-silenced right gastrocnemius- and vector-administered left muscles of the same animal in parallel under the different conditions by radioactive methods (n = 6; vector: O<sub>2</sub> uptake, <em>F</em> = 10.47, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, <em>F</em> = 5.06, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.02; (U-<sup>14</sup>C)-glucose to glycogen, <em>F</em> = 8.61, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.006; 2-deoxyglucose uptake, <em>F</em> = 22.55, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; glycogen synthase, <em>F</em> = 3.59, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.032; with siRNAnNOS: O<sub>2</sub> uptake, <em>F</em> = 13.78, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O, <em>F</em> = 17.34, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, <em>F</em> = 4.25, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.034; (U-<sup>14</sup>C)-glucose to glycogen, <em>F</em> = 8.08, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.004; 2-deoxyglucose uptake, <em>F</em> = 12.90, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.000; glycogen synthase, <em>F</em> = 3.62, <em>DF</em> = 23, <em>P</em> = 0.031).
