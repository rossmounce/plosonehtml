                Figure 7.  Scheme of nNOS activation and the modulation of muscle metabolism.(A) A pendulous movement of the nNOS C-terminal tail (in blue) by opposed electrostatic interactions is suggested to explain cooperative positive modulation of nNOS phosphorylated by p-Akt2; nNOS (gi: 16258810) was represented with Pymol (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA). (B) Scheme of the modulation of mitochondrial respiration and glucose metabolism by the Akt2/nNOS couple in rat skeletal muscle.
