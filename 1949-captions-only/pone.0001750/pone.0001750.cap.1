                Figure 1.  GFP+ Merkel cells but not keratinocytes show cytoplasmic [Ca2+] increases in response to hypotonic solutions.(A) An epiflourescence micrograph shows GFP+ Merkel cells after two days in culture (scale bar: 20 µm). (B, C) Pseudocolor images of fura-2 fluorescence ratios (F340/F380) of cells just before perfusion (B) with a 20% hypotonic solution (232 mmol·kg−1), and 26 s after perfusion onset (C). Pseudocolor scale bar represents F340/F380 (range 0.3–3.0). (D) Plot of [Ca2+] in a keratinocyte (denoted by arrowhead in C, black) and a Merkel cell (arrow in C, green). (E) Plot of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] versus time for three representative Merkel cells perfused with bath solutions of decreasing osmolality. (F) Quantification of the proportion of total Merkel cells (N = 104) that responded to hypotonic solutions (see Methods, 10%: 263 mmol·kg−1; 20%: 232 mmol·kg−1: 30%: 203 mmol·kg−1).
