Shape changes were monitored with plasmalemma-bound fluorescent microspheres using confocal microscopy.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1"></a><p>(A) A three-dimensional plot of fluorescent microspheres (black spots) coating the surfaces of a representative Merkel cell and the coverslip. The surface of the Merkel cell was reconstructed from the location of the micropheres (topographic scalebar: navy blue denotes the coverslip surface; dark red = 6 µm above the coverslip). Areas of low bead density are keratinocytes, which are poorly bound by the beads. (B) Plot of cell volume versus time for the cell shown in (A). The 20% hypotonic solution was administered at t = 0. Double slash marks denote a transient focal-plane change during the solution change. (C) Projections of confocal z-series of cells membranes stained with fluorescent sphingolipids. Processes 1–8 µm in length jutted from Merkel cells' surfaces (arrowheads). By comparison, a keratinocyte showed a smooth cell surface (upper right).</p>
