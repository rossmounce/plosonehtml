Pseudocolor scale bar shows F<sub>340</sub>/F<sub>380</sub> and applies to (A–C). (C) Pseudocolor kymograph of the line shown in (A) and (B). Each pixel along the ordinate corresponds to a point on the line shown in (A) and (B). Pixels near the top and bottom of the kymograph show F<sub>340</sub>/F<sub>380</sub> near the plasmalemma, whereas pixels in the middle correspond to the interior of the process. Time proceeds along the abscissa. The time points of (A) and (B) are indicated by arrows pointing to the kymograph in (C). Black lines denote the beginning and end of hypotonic perfusion. (D) Plot of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] versus time for three positions along the cell process. Colored lines indicate the average of the corresponding colored box in (C). Red and green traces signify regions near the plasmalemma, whereas blue represents a region deeper in the cytoplasm.</p>
