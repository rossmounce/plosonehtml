                Figure 4.  Extracellular Ca2+ is required for hypotonic-triggered Ca2+ transients.These Ca2+ transients are composed in part by Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ released from internal stores. (A–C) Plots depict [Ca2+] versus time of representative cells. “Hypo” denotes perfusion of 20% hypotonic solution (232 mmol·kg−1). (A) Labeled boxes indicate the time period of perfusion. Bath Ca2+ was replaced with 10 mM EGTA. (B) Cells were depolarized with high-K+ solution (140 mM K+). The cocktail of VACC antagonists contained 10 µM nimodipine and 10 µM ω-conotoxin MVII-C. (C) Thapsigargin was used at 1 µM. The box labeled “Ion” indicates a 30-s wash with 10 mM EGTA, followed by 3 minute perfusion of 10 µM ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore. (D) Same protocol as in C, but without thapsigargin treatment. (E) Quantification of the effects of EGTA, VACC antagonists and thapsigargin upon peak hypotonic-induced Ca2+ influx (N = 3–5 experiments per group). Hypotonic responses of Merkel cells exposed to these compounds were normalized to control hypotonic responses. Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences between EGTA and VACC or thapsigargin treated responses (p≤0.04, paired Student's t test). The un-normalized EGTA, VACC and thapsigargin treated responses were significantly different from their respective controls (p≤0.05, Student's t test).
