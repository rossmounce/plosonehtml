                Figure 7.  A model of hypotonic-induced Ca2+ transients in Merkel cells.Hypotonic solutions stimulate water influx across the cell membrane, causing cell swelling. The increased tension on the membrane activates Ca2+ permeable channels. These channels both contribute to a rise in Ca2+ influx and depolarize the membrane, opening VACCs. VACCs and Ca2+ release from internal stores amplify Ca2+ signals.
