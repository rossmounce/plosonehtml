The inputs to PhysioNoise are represented by the blue arrow and the outputs from PhysioNoise are identified with the red arrows. (RW = Downsampled respiratory spline waveform; CPttl = Cardiac peak based on the TTL pulse from the scanner; CPd3 = Cardiac peak based on trough of the third derivative; CPd3R = Cardiac peak R-wave estimate based on small peak of third derivative preceding the CPd3; RVT = Respiratory volume over time based on peakdet peaks; RRT = Respiratory rate over time; CVT = Cardiac volume over time based on peakdet peaks; CRTttl = Cardiac rate over time based on the TTL pulse from the scanner; CRTd3 = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3; CRTd3R = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3R).</p>
