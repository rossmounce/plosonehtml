                Figure 3.  Cardiac Peaks.The CPpd, CPttl, CPd3, and CPd3R are displayed on the cardiac spline (black) and third derivative (cyan). The envelope of the third derivative peaks is shown in yellow. The plot also shows an example of the scanner TTL error of commission in which an extra CPttl was detected during one cardiac cycle. The differentiation method correctly produced one CPd3 peak (CPttl = Cardiac peak based on the TTL pulse from the scanner; CPd3 = Cardiac peak based on trough of the third derivative; CPd3R = Cardiac peak R-wave estimate based on small peak of third derivative preceding the CPd3).
