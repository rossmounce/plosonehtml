                Figure 5.  Cardiac and Respiratory Rates and Volumes over Time.Representative RVT, RRT, CVT, CRTttl, CRTd3, and CRTd3R waveforms are displayed in PhysioNoise. Note that the CRTd3 contains fewer outliers than the CRTttl and the CRTd3R. Dynamic visualization of these curves in PhysioNoise is possible using the zoom and scroll features (RVT = Respiratory volume over time based on peakdet peaks; RRT = Respiratory rate over time; CVT = Cardiac volume over time based on peakdet peaks; CRTttl = Cardiac rate over time based on the TTL pulse from the scanner; CRTd3 = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3; CRTd3R = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3R).
