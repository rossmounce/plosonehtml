Note that the CRTd3 contains fewer outliers than the CRTttl and the CRTd3R. Dynamic visualization of these curves in PhysioNoise is possible using the zoom and scroll features (RVT = Respiratory volume over time based on peakdet peaks; RRT = Respiratory rate over time; CVT = Cardiac volume over time based on peakdet peaks; CRTttl = Cardiac rate over time based on the TTL pulse from the scanner; CRTd3 = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3; CRTd3R = Cardiac rate over time based on CPd3R).</p>
