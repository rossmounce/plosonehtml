All photographs were taken at 40x except controls which are at 10x. A, SMA Cy3 shows exclusive staining of the smooth muscles cells within veins and arteries and does not overlap with CD31 FITC staining which is localized in the endothelial lining of vessels. B &amp; C, CD31 FITC positive vasculature is also positive for Sca-1 Texas Red and CD34 Alexa 594. Scale bar = 50 Âµm.</p>
