                Figure 2.  Flow-cytometry characterization of sorted EC.A, Stepwise selection for Sca-1+, CD31+, CD34dim and CD45− endothelial cells (EC) begins by first gating (pink box, left dot plot) on small and low granulated cells within a SSC-A and FSC-A dot plot. CD45+ cells are then identified and gated out by comparing the sample (green peak) with the unstained control (red peak) to reveal a Sca-1+ and CD31+ population of muscle EC within the CD45− population (pink bar, middle histogram). The Sca-1+ (vertical)/CD31+ (horizontal) endothelial population (pink oval, right dot plot) which is dim for CD34 can then be gated for further analysis or cell sorting. B, Endothelial CD31 FITC expression correlates with cell size as FSC-A comparison indicates larger cells (blue) express more CD31. C, 45% of EC are positive for ac-LDL rhodamine uptake (red) within the entire CD45− population (green) portrayed in Sca-1 APC (vertical) and CD31 FITC (horizontal). D, The endothelial cells defined as Sca-1+, CD31+ and CD34dim are homogeneously negative for CD45 PerCP, positive for Sca-1 APC and CD31 FITC, and dim for CD34 PE Cy7 (green peaks) vs. unstained controls (red peaks). Analysis of separate aliquots from the same muscle preparations revealed EC lack Syndecan 4 PE, AC133 FITC, NCAM PE and CXCR4 PE (green peaks EC samples, red peaks unstained control).
