                Figure 3.  Muscle EC abundance between gender, muscle goups and age.A, Gender comparison of the percentage (y-axis) of EC within the CD45− population between 2 MO mice (n = 3). * designates p&lt;0.05. B, The percentage of EC within the CD45− population among different skeletal muscles. C, Age comparison of the percentage of EC within the CD45− population between 1, 12 and 24 MO mice (n = 3). * designates p&lt;0.05 between 1 vs. 12 MO mice. ** designates p&lt;0.05 between 12 vs. 25 MO mice. P values calculated by student t-test.
