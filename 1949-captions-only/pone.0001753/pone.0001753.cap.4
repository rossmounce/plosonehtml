B, Vascular bundle formation occurs rapidly within 18 hrs of cells being seeded on pure matrigel vs. controls without matrigel. Photographs were taken at 1.5 hour intervals and after 4.5 hours left overnight in culture. C, Top panel shows endothelial specific NO production. Left, muscle EC can produce NO as detected by green fluorescence emission of DAF-2T. Middle, NO production was inhibited by L-NAME. Right, muscle EC stained with rabbit anti-eNOS followed by anti-rabbit Alexa 647 show strong staining in endothelial caveolae. Bottom panel shows other functional assays as well as maintenance of vWF expression. Left, cultured muscle EC uptake ac-LDL- rhodamine (red fluorescence). Middle, skeletal muscle derived EC in culture retain vWF expression for more than 80 days as portrayed by anti-vWF with Alexa 594. Right, 99.9% of freshly FACS-sorted muscle EC stained positive for vWF immunoperoxidase with DAB (brown). Scale bar = 50 Âµm.</p>
