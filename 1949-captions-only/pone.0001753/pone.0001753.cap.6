Staining for anti-CD31 and anti-vWF followed with a secondary Alexa 647 antibody highlight mature vessels formed within the matrigel by injected cells (PKH26<sup>+</sup>). C, Conjugated FITC anti-SMA staining indicates the recruitment of endogenous smooth muscle cells in the formation of microvessels. Scale bar = 50 µm.</p>
