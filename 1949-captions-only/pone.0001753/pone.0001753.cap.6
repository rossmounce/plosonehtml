                Figure 6.  EC of the skeletal muscle form microvessels in matrigel injected subcutaneously over the dorsum.A–B, Tissue sections of the matrigel plug recovered from the dorsal skin of C57BL6 mice analyzed 14 days post injection reveal microvessel formation. Staining for anti-CD31 and anti-vWF followed with a secondary Alexa 647 antibody highlight mature vessels formed within the matrigel by injected cells (PKH26+). C, Conjugated FITC anti-SMA staining indicates the recruitment of endogenous smooth muscle cells in the formation of microvessels. Scale bar = 50 µm.
