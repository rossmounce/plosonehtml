                Figure 7.  EC injected intramuscularly migrate, form new vessels and integrate with existing vasculature.Top, a montage of a region proximal to the injection site shows the needle track in the TA muscle. Bottom, a montage of a region approximately 80 µm distal to the injection site shows extensive migration beyond 1 mm from the needle track (white line). Montage represents an overlay of the PKH26 red fluorescence over bright field microscopy. Formation of new vessels and incorporation into existing vasculature is highlighted by anti-vWF staining in Alexa 647 (magenta). Green arrows point to areas where PKH26+ cells are making connections with or integrated into endogenous vessels. Scale bars = 50 µm.
