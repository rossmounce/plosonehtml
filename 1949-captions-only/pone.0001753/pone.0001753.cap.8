                Figure 8.  EC injected subcutaneously in matrigel migrate into the muscle.Top, a montage of the matrigel plug shows PKH26+ microvessels in the matrigel plug over the TA muscle. Bottom, A montage of an area approximately 80 µm distal shows migration of PKH26+ EC. EC invaded the TA from the matrigel plug and formed new microvessels along their migration path and also integrated into existing vessel. Staining with anti-vWF in Alexa 647 (magenta) highlights EC angiogenic capability within the matrigel plug and muscle. Scale bars = 50 µm.
