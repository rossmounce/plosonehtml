Bottom, A montage of an area approximately 80 µm distal shows migration of PKH26<sup>+</sup> EC. EC invaded the TA from the matrigel plug and formed new microvessels along their migration path and also integrated into existing vessel. Staining with anti-vWF in Alexa 647 (magenta) highlights EC angiogenic capability within the matrigel plug and muscle. Scale bars = 50 µm.</p>
