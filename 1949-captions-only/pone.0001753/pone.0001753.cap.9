Although freshly sorted EC did not migrate as far as cultured EC several PKH<sup>+</sup>/vWF<sup>+</sup> vessels highlighted by anti-vWF staining with Alexa 647 (magenta) were visible beyond the point of injection. B, Contrary to the capability of freshly sorted and cultured EC to form new vessels and integrate with existing ones, control cells sorted as Sca-1<sup>−</sup>, CD31<sup>−</sup> and CD45<sup>−</sup> injected under the same conditions did not exhibit any angiogenic potential. Scale bars = 50 µm.</p>
