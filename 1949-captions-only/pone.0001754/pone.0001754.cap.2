                Figure 2.  Construction of chimeric ‘tail-swap’ plasmids.A–construction of topoIIα+β tail. TopoIIα fragments 30–791 and 792–1244 and topoIIβ fragment 1263–1621 were generated using restriction digests as shown, then ligated to give the final construct shown. B–construction of topoIIβ+α tail. TopoIIβ fragments 46–899 and 900–1263 and topoIIα fragment 1244–1531 were generated with restriction digests as indicated, then ligated to give the final construct shown [32].
