                Figure 3.  Activity of recombinant proteins.A: Decatenation activity of all proteins, each column is the mean of at least two independent experiments. Standard errors are shown, with significant difference from full length enzyme marker with ‘***’. B: Representative cleavage experiment with 4.3 kb linearised pBR322 DNA with all proteins in the presence of mitoxantrone. TopoIIβ proteins in this case carry the S165R mutation.
