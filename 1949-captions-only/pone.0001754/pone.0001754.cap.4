Also shown are active site tyrosines (Y), known nuclear localisation sequences (NLS-dark grey) and known nuclear export sequences (NES–light grey). NLS sequences have been identified in human topoIIα (1259–1296, 1454–1497 <a href="#pone.0001754-Mirski2">[20]</a>), human topoIIβ (1294–1332, 1522–1548, 1538–1573 <a href="#pone.0001754-Mirski2">[20]</a>), <em>S. cerevisiae</em> topoII (1227–1242 <a href="#pone.0001754-Caron1">[38]</a>) and <em>S. pombe</em> (26–44, 1227–1242, 1322–1339, 1335–1357 <a href="#pone.0001754-Shiozaki1">[39]</a>). NES sequences have been identified in human topoIIα (1017–1028, 1054–1066 <a href="#pone.0001754-Mirski3">[24]</a>) and human topoIIβ (1034–1044 <a href="#pone.0001754-Mirski3">[24]</a>).</p>
