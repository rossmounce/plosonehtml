                Figure 4.  Schematic showing the position of the C-terminal domain of type II topoisomerases.Above each bar are the residue numbers at the start and end of the primary sequence, plus the point equating to the start of the C-terminal domain (indicated by arrows), as determined by limited proteolysis where known, and by alignment with this point where this is not known. Also shown are active site tyrosines (Y), known nuclear localisation sequences (NLS-dark grey) and known nuclear export sequences (NES–light grey). NLS sequences have been identified in human topoIIα (1259–1296, 1454–1497 [20]), human topoIIβ (1294–1332, 1522–1548, 1538–1573 [20]), S. cerevisiae topoII (1227–1242 [38]) and S. pombe (26–44, 1227–1242, 1322–1339, 1335–1357 [39]). NES sequences have been identified in human topoIIα (1017–1028, 1054–1066 [24]) and human topoIIβ (1034–1044 [24]).
