                Figure 3.  Secondary siRNAs in Hairpin-induced Silencing are Eliminated by dcl2 but greatly Increased by dcl4 Mutations.(A) Diagrams of the coding regions of the 6b4 GUS expressing locus and the ΔGUS-SUG hairpin show the regions and probes first described in Figures 1 and 2. The solid bar in the 6b4 GUS diagram corresponds to the 231-bp deletion in the ΔGUS-SUG hairpin construct. (B) Accumulation of GUS mRNA and siRNAs in wt and mutant lines transgenic for both 6b4 GUS and the ΔGUS-SUG hairpin was determined using RNA gel blot analysis with RNA probes. Line 6b4, which carries only the 6b4 GUS transgene, was used as a control. Probe 3* was used to detect GUS mRNA, while probes for GUS siRNAs all had sense polarity. Grouped lanes are all from the same gel, blot, and exposure. LMW RNA blots were successively stripped and hybridized with the indicated probes. The positions of 21- to 24-nt RNA size markers are indicated. Ethidium bromide stained rRNA and the major RNA species in LMW RNA are shown as loading controls.
