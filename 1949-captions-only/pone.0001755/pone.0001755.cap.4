                Figure 4.  P1/HC-Pro and P38 Enhance ΔGUS-SUG Loop mRNA and Primary siRNA Accumulation, but Eliminate Secondary siRNAs.(A) Gel blot analysis of HMW and LMW RNA is shown for progeny of crosses between the ΔGUS-SUG hairpin line 306-1 and lines expressing the indicated viral suppressors of silencing. All procedures and designations are as described in the legend to Figure 2. Grouped lanes are all from the same gel, blot, and exposure. (B) RNA gel blot analysis is shown for lines that express the indicated viral suppressors and are transgenic for both the ΔGUS-SUG hairpin and 6b4 GUS expressing locus. Controls that carry 6b4 GUS alone (lane 10) or ΔGUS-SUG alone (lanes 1, 2, 9) are also included. All procedures and designations are as described in the legends to Figures 2 and 3. A longer exposure of the loop band in lanes 7–9 is also shown. Accumulation of viral suppressor mRNA in lanes 1–6 is shown for a duplicate gel that was blotted to one membrane, cut into sections corresponding to the indicated viral suppressors, and hybridized with an RNA probe specific for that suppressor; otherwise, grouped lanes are all from the same gel, blot, and exposure. (C) RNA gel blot analysis is shown for progeny of crosses between the silenced L1 GUS line and lines expressing the indicated viral suppressor. All procedures and designations are as described in the legend to Figure 1 except that only RNA probes were used. Grouped lanes are all from the same gel, blot, and exposure.
