                Figure 1.  Localization of CheR.C. crescentus producing CheR(1–267)-GFP generated by insertion of mini-Tn5-GFP (A) or full-length CheR-GFP from a low copy-number plasmid (B) were imaged by epifluorescence (left panels) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (center panels). Schematic diagrams (right panels) indicate location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images like those shown in panel A indicated 47% of cells had a focus at the pole and 40% had a focus at mid-cell (n = 100). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
