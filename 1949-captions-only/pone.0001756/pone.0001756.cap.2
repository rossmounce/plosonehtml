                Figure 2.  Localization of AhpC.(A) C. crescentus producing AhpC(1–36)-GFP generated by insertion of mini-Tn5-GFP were imaged by epifluorescence (left panel) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (center panel). Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images like those shown in panel A indicated 70% of cells had a focus at the stalked pole and 30% had a focus at mid-cell (n = 129). (B) C. crescentus producing full-length AhpC fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG M2-Cy3 antibody (fuchsia) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
