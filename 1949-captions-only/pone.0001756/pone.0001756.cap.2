Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images like those shown in panel A indicated 70% of cells had a focus at the stalked pole and 30% had a focus at mid-cell (n = 129). (B) <em>C. crescentus</em> producing full-length AhpC fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG M2-Cy3 antibody (fuchsia) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
