Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images like those shown in panel A indicated 94% of cells had one focus at the stalked pole and one focus at mid-cell (n = 143). (B) <em>C. crescentus</em> producing full-length CC3691 fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG M2-Cy3 antibody (fuchsia) and DAPI (blue). Quantification of images like those shown in panel B indicated 98% of cells had one focus at the stalked pole and one focus at mid-cell (n = 80). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
