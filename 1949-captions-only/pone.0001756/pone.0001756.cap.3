                Figure 3.  Localization of CC3691.(A) C. crescentus producing CC3691(1–28)-GFP generated by insertion of mini-Tn5-GFP were imaged by epifluorescence (left panel) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (center panel). Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images like those shown in panel A indicated 94% of cells had one focus at the stalked pole and one focus at mid-cell (n = 143). (B) C. crescentus producing full-length CC3691 fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG M2-Cy3 antibody (fuchsia) and DAPI (blue). Quantification of images like those shown in panel B indicated 98% of cells had one focus at the stalked pole and one focus at mid-cell (n = 80). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
