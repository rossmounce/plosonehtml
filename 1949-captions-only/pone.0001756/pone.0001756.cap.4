                Figure 4.  Localization of CC0572.(A) C. crescentus producing CC0572(1–314)-GFP generated by insertion of mini-Tn5-GFP were imaged by epifluorescence (left panel) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (center panel). Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. (B) C. crescentus producing full-length CC0572 fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (green). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
