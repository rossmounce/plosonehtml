Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. (B) <em>C. crescentus</em> producing full-length CC0572 fused to M2 were imaged by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (green). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
