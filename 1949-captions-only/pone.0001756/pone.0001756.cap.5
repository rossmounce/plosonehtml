                Figure 5.  CC0572 is localized to a helix-like structure.(A) Confocal microscopy was used to acquire a Z-series of fluorescence images of C. crescentus producing CC0572(1â€“314)-GFP. Schematic diagrams indicate the relative position of the optical section. (B) Images from the Z-series were computationally reconstituted to produce a composite image.
