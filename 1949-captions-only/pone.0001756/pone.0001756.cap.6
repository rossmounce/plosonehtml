The time after synchronization is indicated. Schematic diagram indicates the stage of the cell cycle at each time point. Quantification of images like those shown indicated that 43% of cells had a focus at the cell pole at 0 min (n = 105); from 30–75 min a helix-like pattern was seen in 61% of cells (n = 176); and after 90 min, 47% of septating cells retained the helix-like pattern (n = 110). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
