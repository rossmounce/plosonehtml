                Figure 6.  CC0572 localization changes during the cell cycle.Swarmer cells were isolated from cultures of C. crescentus producing CC0572(1–314)-GFP and the cells were imaged by epifluorescence (left panels) and DIC microscopy (right panels) during synchronous growth in PYE medium. The time after synchronization is indicated. Schematic diagram indicates the stage of the cell cycle at each time point. Quantification of images like those shown indicated that 43% of cells had a focus at the cell pole at 0 min (n = 105); from 30–75 min a helix-like pattern was seen in 61% of cells (n = 176); and after 90 min, 47% of septating cells retained the helix-like pattern (n = 110). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
