                Figure 7.  Localization of CC0572 does not depend on the MreB helix.C. crescentus producing CC0572(1–314)-GFP or GFP-MreB were incubated without A22 (top) or with A22 (bottom) for 30 min and imaged by epifluorescence (left panels) and DIC microscopy (right panels). Under these conditions, the GFP-MreB helix was completely disrupted, but the CC0572(1–314)-GFP helix was still present. Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
