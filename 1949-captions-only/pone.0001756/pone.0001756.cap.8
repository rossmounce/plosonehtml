                Figure 8.  Localization of CC2233.(A) C. crescentus producing CC2233(1–62)-GFP generated by insertion of mini-Tn5-GFP were imaged by epifluorescence (left panel) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (center panel). Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images as in (A) indicated 100% of cells had fluorescence localized to the periphery (n = 500). (B) C. crescentus producing full-length CC2233 fused to GFP were imaged by epifluorescence. Quantification of images as in (B) indicated 100% of cells had fluorescence localized to the periphery (n = 100). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
