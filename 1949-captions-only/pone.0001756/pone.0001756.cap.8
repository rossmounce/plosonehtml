Schematic diagram (right panel) indicates location of fluorescence signal within the cell. Quantification of images as in (A) indicated 100% of cells had fluorescence localized to the periphery (n = 500). (B) <em>C. crescentus</em> producing full-length CC2233 fused to GFP were imaged by epifluorescence. Quantification of images as in (B) indicated 100% of cells had fluorescence localized to the periphery (n = 100). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
