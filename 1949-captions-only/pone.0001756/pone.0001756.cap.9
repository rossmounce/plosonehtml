The time after synchronization is shown (cell cycle progression is slower than in <a href="#pone-0001756-g004">Figure 4</a> because cells were grown in minimal medium). Schematic diagram indicates the cell cycle stage at each time point. CC2233-GFP was located around the periphery until the predivisional stage (105–135 min), when it was concentrated at the division plane (arrowheads). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.</p>
