                Figure 9.  Localization of CC2233 changes during the cell cycle.Swarmer cells were isolated from cultures of C. crescentus producing CC2233(1–62)-GFP and the cells were imaged by epifluorescence (left panels) and DIC microscopy (right panels) during synchronous growth in M2G medium. The time after synchronization is shown (cell cycle progression is slower than in Figure 4 because cells were grown in minimal medium). Schematic diagram indicates the cell cycle stage at each time point. CC2233-GFP was located around the periphery until the predivisional stage (105–135 min), when it was concentrated at the division plane (arrowheads). Scale bars indicating 1 µm are shown.
