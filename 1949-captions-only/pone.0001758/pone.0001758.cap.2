                Figure 2.  p110α is overexpressed in non-proliferating tumor cells in vivo.A. Immunohistochemical staining of p110α using high primary antibody concentration (1:50) reveals low expression of p110α diffusely in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in Ki67-positive (Ki67+) regions. B and C. High magnification of non-proliferating (B) and proliferating (C) regions from A.
