                Figure 3.  PIK3CA is upregulated in undervascularized tumor areas in vivo.A. Double immunostaining of CD31 (red, Texas Red) and p110α (green, FITC) in the 2008 xenograft model. Strong p110α staining is mainly detected in tumor regions located distant from capillaries. B. Triple staining of p110α (red, Texas Red), Ki67 (blue, AMCA) and TUNEL (green, FITC) in the 2008 xenograft model.
