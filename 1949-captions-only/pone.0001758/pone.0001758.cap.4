Illustration of the structure of human <em>PIK3CA</em> gene and its 5′ upstream regulatory region. B. A region highly rich in GC is found in the <em>PIK3CA</em> 5′TRR. C. Illustration of the primers used for mapping RT-PCR of the <em>PIK3CA</em> transcriptional start site (SST). D. Results of mapping RT-PCR. There is no band between the forward primer F1 located upstream of the SST and the reverse primer R located on exon 1 of <em>PIK3CA</em>. The right size bands could be detected between primer F2 or F3 (both located downstream of SST) and reverse primer R. E. A small splicing variant is found in the 5′UTR of human <em>PIK3CA</em> gene, which can also be detected by mapping RT-PCR (primers F2 and R). F. Summarized results of the transcriptional activity of <em>PIK3CA</em> TRR fragments.</p>
