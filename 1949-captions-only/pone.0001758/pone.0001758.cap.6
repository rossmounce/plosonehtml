<h4>Expression and localization of candidate transcription factors <em>in situ</em></h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>The expression and localization of three putative regulatory factors that emerged from the above <em>in silico</em> analysis, HIF1α; c-Jun, a member of the AP1 complex; and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, were screened in 2008 xenografts. Because function of these factors requires expression and nuclear translocation, we considered strong expression and nuclear localization indirect evidence of functional activation. Strong nuclear HIF1α expression was seen in patchy cell clusters in Ki67− regions. HIF1α protein was also detected in Ki67+ regions, but it mainly localized to the cytoplasm (<a href="#pone-0001758-g007">Figure 7 A, D and G</a>). c-Jun protein was strictly expressed in the boundaries between Ki67+ and Ki67− regions, where only nuclear staining was detected. Few scattered c-Jun-positive cells could also be detected in Ki67+ regions, but nuclear c-Jun was not seen in Ki67− regions (<a href="#pone-0001758-g007">Figure 7 B, E and H</a>). Strong nuclear localization of NF-κB/p65 protein was seen in the Ki67− regions and in Ki67+ areas adjacent to the Ki67− regions (<a href="#pone-0001758-g007">Figure 7 C, F and I</a>). Interestingly, strongest nuclear NF-κB/p65 was detected adjacent to areas of tissue necrosis (<a href="#pone-0001758-g007">Figure 7 F</a>). This data together with the <em>PIK3CA</em> promoter analysis suggest that HIF1α and NF-κB are implicated in the upregulation of <em>PIK3CA</em> in Ki67− regions <em>in vivo</em>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the hypoxia/HIF pathway has been reported to regulate <em>PIK3CA</em> in cancer cells <a href="#pone.0001758-Hu2">[48]</a>. Since hypoxic regulation of <em>PIK3CA</em> has been confirmed, we next focused on the regulation of <em>PIK3CA</em> by the NF-κB pathway.</p>
