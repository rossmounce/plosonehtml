                Figure 7.  Expression and localization of candidate transcription factors in situ.A to C. Immunohistochemical staining of candidate transcription factors HIF1α, c-Jun and NF-κB in 2008 xenografts. The line shows the boundary between the Ki67+ p110α-low, and Ki67− p110α-high regions. D to F. High magnification from A to C, respectively, shows expression and nuclear localization of HIF1Α, c-Jun and NF-κB in 2008 xenografts. G to I. Illustration of the localization of the candidate transcription factors HIF1α, c-Jun and NF-κB in the 2008 xenograft model. Large dots represent cytoplasmic localization, while small dots represent nuclear localization. The line represents the boundary between the Ki67+ p110α-low, and Ki67− p110α-high regions.
