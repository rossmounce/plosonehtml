                Figure 8.  NF-κB binds to the PIK3CA promoter and activates its expression.A. Illustration of the predicted NF-κB binding site in human (top) or murine (bottom) PIK3CA promoter region. B. Illustration of the constructs comprising luciferase linked to the human PIK3CA promoter with (Luc-2340/316) or without the NF-κB binding site (Luc-378/316). C. Summary of luciferase activities of Luc-2340/316 and Luc-378/316 co-transfected with pCMV- IκBα or pCMV- IκBαM. D. Gelshift assay using ovarian cancer cell nuclear extract after TNF-α stimulation. Lane 1, NF-κB binding site of wild-type human PIK3CA promoter (wt huPIK3CA NF-κB probe) alone; lanes 2 and 3, wt huPIK3CA NF-κB probe+nuclear extract; lane 4, control NF-κB probe+nuclear extract, lanes 5 and 6, mutated huPIK3CA NF-κB probe+nuclear extract; lane 7, mutated control NF-κB probe+nuclear extract; lanes 8 and 9, scramble huPIK3CA NF-κB probe+nuclear extract. E. Gel shift assay using recombinant NF-κB/p50 protein. Lane 1, wt huPIK3CA NF-κB probe alone; lanes 2 and 3, wt huPIK3CA NF-κB probe+p50; lane 4, mutated huPIK3CA NF-κB probe alone; lanes 5 and 6, mutated huPIK3CA NF-κB probe+p50; lane 7, control NF-κB probe alone; lanes 8 and 9, control NF-κB probe+p50.
