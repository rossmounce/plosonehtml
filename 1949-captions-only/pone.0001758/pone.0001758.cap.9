                Figure 9.  TNF-α regulates PIK3CA expression via NF-κB pathway.A. H&amp;E staining of 2008 tumor reveals a prominent area of necrosis (N). B and C. Immunohistochemical staining of murine CD11b reveals macrophage infiltrate in a 2008 xenograft. CD11b+ cells infiltrate tumors in Ki67-negative regions in proximity of necrosis. C. High magnification from B. D. Double immunostaining of CD11b (green, FITC) and Ki67 (red, Texas Red) reveals CD11b+ macrophages mainly in non-proliferating Ki67-negative regions. E. ChIP analysis of NF-κB binding to the endogenous PIK3CA promoter. The arrows indicate the positions of the primers flanking −803 NF-κB binding site that were used in the ChIP assays. Cells were treated with TNF-α for 0, 30, or 90 min, and then chromatin protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked using formaldehyde. The purified nucleoprotein complexes were immunoprecipitated with p65 antibody or non-immune IgG and amplified by PCR. F. PIK3CA mRNA expression levels after stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. G. Illustration of the transcriptional regulation of PIK3CA by NF-κB.
