T4 levels were measured from serum samples of SirT1-null and normal mice using an EIA kit. B. Corticosterone levels were measured from plasma samples of SirT1-null and normal mice at 4 hours intervals during the diurnal cycle using an EIA kit. The peak values are plotted. Unpaired T-tests were performed to assess statistical significance. Blood glucose (C) and insulin (D) levels of 2â€“3 months old mutant and wild type mice were measured after 24 hour fasting and again 3 hours after refeeding using a standard glucometer (C) and an ELISA kit (D). Means and standard errors are represented. Two-way ANOVAs was performed to assess statistical significance of interaction between genotype and dietary condition (p*-values on top of panel), and unpaired T-test to assess difference between genotypes within dietary condition groups (p-value over bars).</p>
