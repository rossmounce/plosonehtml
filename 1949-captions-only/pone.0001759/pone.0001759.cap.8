                Figure 8.  Activity of mice during CR.Total activity of normal (A) and SirT1-null (B) mice was monitored using a Micromax system for 24-hour periods at the indicated time after the start of CR. Animals were 5â€“7 months old at the beginning of CR. Means and standard errors are represented. The activity of CR normal mice increased with time whereas that of AL controls decreased. CR did not alter the activity of SirT1-null mice.
