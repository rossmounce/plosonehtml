RER from the same animals at 2–4 weeks (C) or 21–26 weeks (F) of CR were also obtained. Data were plotted as PRCF as in <a href="#pone-0001759-g004">Figure 4</a>. The normal mice adapted to CR by maintaining their levels of oxygen consumption but the oxygen consumption of SirT1-null animals was higher in AL than in CR. This difference was particularly evident in older SirT1-null mice (panel E) when AL animals' oxygen consumption was very high.</p>
