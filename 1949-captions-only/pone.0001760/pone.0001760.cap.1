                Figure 1.  A schematic diagram of the spatial working memory (WM) task.After the presentation of a fixation point (1000 ms), three targets appeared one after the other for 750 ms each with an interstimulus interval of 250 ms. A delay period of 12 s followed. Then a probe was presented. Participants were asked to decide whether the probe was located in one of the target locations or not. After they made a response, they were asked to rate their confidence level for the response that they had just made.
