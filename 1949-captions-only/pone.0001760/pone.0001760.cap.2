                Figure 2.  Activation maps of the delay-related BOLD data in the frontal cortex during the spatial WM task.(A) For correct trials, schizophrenic patients (SZ) showed increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus (white arrow) and the superior frontal gyrus (yellow arrow) in the left hemisphere whereas the control group (CO) showed increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus in the right hemisphere. (B) This figure shows the % signal change during the spatial WM task in the right MFG and the left MFG for correct trials. In the left MFG, schizophrenic patients showed increased activation during maintenance. (C) Schizophrenic patients showed increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus during “false memory” trials.
