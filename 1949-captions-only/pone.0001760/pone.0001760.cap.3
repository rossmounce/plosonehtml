                Figure 3.  NIRS data comparing maintenance-related NIRS measurements between the control (CO) and schizophrenic (SZ) groups during the spatial WM task.(A) Deoxy-Hb data: schizophrenic patients showed greater activity in the left frontal cortex (see the left panel) and the healthy control subjects showed greater activation in the right frontal cortex (see the right panel) on correct trials. (B) Oxy-Hb data: schizophrenic patients showed greater activation in the bilateral frontal cortex on correct trials. (C) Total-Hb data: schizophrenic patients showed greater activation in the bilateral frontal cortex compared with the control subjects on correct trials.
