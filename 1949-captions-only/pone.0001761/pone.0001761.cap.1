(B) Large <em>sav</em> follicle-cell clones cause a complete mislocalization of Stau-GFP (white arrow) toward the oocyte center, and the oocyte nucleus (blue arrow) remains at the posterior. (C) A stage 9 egg chamber with large <em>hpo</em> PFC clone also shows mislocalization of Stau:GFP toward the center of the oocyte (arrow). (E) Stau (arrow) is mislocalized away from the region adjacent to the <em>sav</em> clones when the PFC are partially mutated. (F) Oocyte nucleus and Grk (arrow) are localized to the dorsal anterior corner of wild-type stage-9 oocytes. (G) Large <em>hpo</em> follicle-cell clones cause mislocalization of the oocyte nucleus and Grk (arrow) at the oocyte posterior. Overexpression of Yki also caused Stau (D, arrow) and Grk (H, arrow) mislocalization. (I) Plus ends of microtubules, visualized with Kin:β-Gal (arrow) localization at the posterior of a wild-type stage-9 oocyte. (J) A stage-9 egg chamber with a large <em>sav</em> follicle-cell clone showing abnormal Kin:β-Gal (arrowhead) localization in the center of the oocyte, as well as mislocalization of the oocyte nucleus (blue arrow). Multilayering and small nuclear phenotypes can be observed in PFC clones of both <em>sav</em> and <em>hpo</em> mutants (red arrowheads). Loss-of-function clones are marked as the GFP-negative cells. Gain-of-function clones (<em>UAS-Yki</em>) are GFP-positive. All clones are additionally highlighted by yellow lines to indicate the affected follicle cells, except in a few cases of complete or almost complete follicle cell clones. In all Figures, posterior is to the right. Nuclei are marked in most figures by DAPI staining in blue.</p>
