                Figure 2.  Mutants of the Hpo pathway disrupt PFC differentiation.The PFC markers pnt-lacZ (A) and 667/9-lacZ (C) are specifically expressed in the PFC after stage 6 in wild-type egg chambers. (B and D) hpo PFC clones fail to express pnt-lacZ (B) or 667/9-lacZ (D), in a cell-autonomous manner (arrows). (E) Activation of JAK-STAT signaling in the PFC (arrow) can be marked by the expression of dome-lacZ. (F) In sav PFC clones, expression of dome-lacZ is not affected (arrow). The AFC markers slbo-lacZ (G) and dpp-lacZ (I) are expressed in the AFCs in stage-9 wild-type egg chambers. In sav mutant PFC, no misexpression of slbo-lacZ (H) or dpp-lacZ (J) was detected.
