In <em>sav</em> mutants, staining of PH3 (B) and Cyclin B (D) was occasionally found in mutant PFC after stage 6 (arrows). (E) In wild-type egg chambers, Cut is expressed in follicle cells until about stage 6. (F and G) Prolonged Cut expression was found in <em>sav</em> (F) and <em>wts</em> (G) PFC clones at stages 8–10 of oogenesis. (I) Hnt is expressed in follicle cells after stage 6 in the wild type. No Hnt expression was found in <em>sav</em> (J) or <em>hpo</em> (K) mutant PFC in stage-8 egg chambers. (L) Lack of Hnt staining was also occasionally observed in anterior and lateral hpo clones in stage 7 egg chambers (arrows). Overexpression of Yki caused prolonged Cut expression (H) and decreased Hnt expression (M). (N) The E(spl):CD2 Notch activity reporter, visualized by CD2 staining, is upregulated in follicle cells during stages 7–10A of oogenesis in wild-type egg chambers. (O) Lack of CD2 staining was observed in <em>sav</em> mutant PFC in this stage-7 egg chamber (arrow).</p>
