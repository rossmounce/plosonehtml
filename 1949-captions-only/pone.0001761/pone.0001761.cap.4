(A) Stau is mislocalized to the center of the oocyte when large <em>sav</em> clones are located at the posterior. (B) Stau is localized correctly to the posterior pole when NICD is expressed in <em>sav</em> PFC clones. (C) Grk was detected at the oocyte posterior when large <em>sav</em> PFC clones were generated . (D) Misexpression of NICD in <em>sav</em> PFC clones restored Grk at the dorsal-anterior corner of the oocyte.</p>
