                Figure 4.  Rescue of Hpo phenotypes through overexpression of NICD.GFP-positive sav clones were created by the MARCM technique. (A) Stau is mislocalized to the center of the oocyte when large sav clones are located at the posterior. (B) Stau is localized correctly to the posterior pole when NICD is expressed in sav PFC clones. (C) Grk was detected at the oocyte posterior when large sav PFC clones were generated . (D) Misexpression of NICD in sav PFC clones restored Grk at the dorsal-anterior corner of the oocyte.
