(E) In <em>hpo</em> follicle-cell clones (indicated by loss of GFP, false-colored blue in panel E, white in E’’), Hrs (red) accumulates at the apical region and overlaps significantly with NICD (false-colored in green to faciliate determination of colocalization by yellow signal, as shown in E'). (F) Some ectopic NICD is also found to colocalize with Rab7:GFP positive vesicles (white arrowheads) in <em>hpo</em> follicle cell clones (visualized by loss of lacZ in blue in panel F, white in F’’). Note in wildtype cells the Rab7:GFP-positive vesicles do not appear to contain Notch protein (red arrowheads). <em>hpo</em> (G) and <em>sav</em> (H) mutant PFC also contain discrete cytoplasmic as well as membrane-associated accumulations of Domeless protein. Staining of the endocytic marker FM4-64FX was significantly higher in <em>hpo</em> mutant follicle cells of stage 10 egg chambers, regardless of position in the FE (I cross-section, J top view-clone outlined in dashed yellow line).</p>
