Note that a stronger upregulation of Ex was found in the PFC clone (B). (C,D) Upregulated expression of lacZ markers for the Hpo pathway target genes <em>ex</em> (C) and <em>cycE</em> (D) was observed in <em>sav</em> follicle-cell clones (arrows). Note differences in expression of <em>cycE-lacZ</em> at boundaries between wildtype and clone cells at posterior (white arrow), as well as more anterior locations (blue arrow) in this stage 7 egg chamber. (E) In addition, <em>diap-lacZ</em> (arrow) was also upregulated in <em>hpo</em> PFC clones.</p>
