                Figure 6.  Expression of Hpo target genes in mosaic egg chambers.(A,B) Upregulated Ex expression was found in hpo (A) and sav (B) mutant follicle cells (arrows). Note that a stronger upregulation of Ex was found in the PFC clone (B). (C,D) Upregulated expression of lacZ markers for the Hpo pathway target genes ex (C) and cycE (D) was observed in sav follicle-cell clones (arrows). Note differences in expression of cycE-lacZ at boundaries between wildtype and clone cells at posterior (white arrow), as well as more anterior locations (blue arrow) in this stage 7 egg chamber. (E) In addition, diap-lacZ (arrow) was also upregulated in hpo PFC clones.
