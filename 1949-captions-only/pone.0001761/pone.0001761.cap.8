                Figure 8.  mer mutation disrupts PFC fate and Notch signaling.(A) mer clones lead oocyte nucleus mislocalization (blue arrow), and misexpression of Cut (white arrow) in the PFC clones of this stage 10 egg chamber. (B) Similar defects can also be observed in ex clones of this stage 7 egg chamber, although the penetrance was significantly lower (see Results). (C) Loss of pnt-lacZ expression was observed in mer PFC clones (arrow). (D) mer PFC clones accumulate high levels of NICD. Multilayering and small nuclei could also be seen in mer PFC clones (A’’’,D’’’, red arrowheads).
