(B) Similar defects can also be observed in <em>ex</em> clones of this stage 7 egg chamber, although the penetrance was significantly lower (see <a href="#s2">Results</a>). (C) Loss of <em>pnt-lacZ</em> expression was observed in <em>mer</em> PFC clones (arrow). (D) <em>mer</em> PFC clones accumulate high levels of NICD. Multilayering and small nuclei could also be seen in <em>mer</em> PFC clones (A’’’,D’’’, red arrowheads).</p>
