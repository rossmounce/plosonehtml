                Figure 1.  Alternating pattern of DHPR immuno-fluorescence signals and Second Harmonic Generation signals using multiphoton excitation in unfixed single wt fibres.A, overlay of DHPR immuno-fluorescence (green) and the SHG signal (blue) simultaneously recorded in a representative wt fibre excited with a pulsed Ti:Sa laser at 880 nm. The signal intensity profile plot (B) confirms the tubular origin of the DHPR signal that alternates with the SHG-signal arising from the myosin within the A-bands.
