                Figure 3.  Age dependent L-type Ca2+ current distributions in intact single wt, mdx and MinD fibres.A, Representative iCa recordings in young (2–3 months) and aged (12–18 months) single wt, mdx and MinD fibres. In the 2–3 months old mdx fibre, the current amplitudes are markedly reduced. In aged mdx mice, a second fibre type appears with iCa amplitudes similar to wt and MinD fibres. B, Age dependent distribution of imax amplitudes for age-matched wt, mdx and MinD fibres. In younger mdx fibres, imax values were considerably smaller than in wt or MinD fibres of age-matched littermates. In older mdx fibres, some fibres (‘wt-like’ mdx fibres) displayed imax values similar to those found in wt or MinD fibres while the rest (‘mdx-like’ mdx fibres) still had small imax values similar to younger mdx fibres.
