In the 2–3 months old mdx fibre, the current amplitudes are markedly reduced. In aged mdx mice, a second fibre type appears with i<sub>Ca</sub> amplitudes similar to wt and MinD fibres. B, Age dependent distribution of i<sub>max</sub> amplitudes for age-matched wt, mdx and MinD fibres. In younger mdx fibres, i<sub>max</sub> values were considerably smaller than in wt or MinD fibres of age-matched littermates. In older mdx fibres, some fibres (‘wt-like’ mdx fibres) displayed i<sub>max</sub> values similar to those found in wt or MinD fibres while the rest (‘mdx-like’ mdx fibres) still had small i<sub>max</sub> values similar to younger mdx fibres.</p>
