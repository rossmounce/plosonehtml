                Figure 4.  Dependence of iCa amplitudes on fibre dimensions and steady-state activation in single fibres from wt, mdx and MinD mice at 2–3 months and 12–18 months of age.A, imax from individual fibres plotted against fibre surface area A revealed a linear relationship. In young fibres (2–3 months, left), the slope was comparable for the three genotypes and did not change in old wt and MinD fibres but was almost flat in mdx fibres (12–18 months, right). B, Activation curves reconstructed from the mean activation d∞ of all individual fibres of each strain, as given in the Methods. There is a perfect match in young fibres that is also reflected in the mean half-activation potentials d0.5 and slope factors k (C). In fibres from 12–18 months old mice, mdx fibres had significantly right-shifted activation curves. However, when looking at those mdx fibres with overlapping imax values to wt fibres (see Fig. 3 B), these ‘wt-like’ mdx fibres had no difference in their activation curves compared to the ‘mdx-like’ mdx fibres with small imax values (C). n.s.: not significant. *: P&lt;0.05.
