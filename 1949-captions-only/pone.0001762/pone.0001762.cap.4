In young fibres (2–3 months, left), the slope was comparable for the three genotypes and did not change in old wt and MinD fibres but was almost flat in mdx fibres (12–18 months, right). B, Activation curves reconstructed from the mean activation d<sub>∞</sub> of all individual fibres of each strain, as given in the <a href="#s2">Methods</a>. There is a perfect match in young fibres that is also reflected in the mean half-activation potentials d<sub>0.5</sub> and slope factors k (C). In fibres from 12–18 months old mice, mdx fibres had significantly right-shifted activation curves. However, when looking at those mdx fibres with overlapping i<sub>max</sub> values to wt fibres (see <a href="#pone-0001762-g003">Fig. 3 B</a>), these ‘wt-like’ mdx fibres had no difference in their activation curves compared to the ‘mdx-like’ mdx fibres with small i<sub>max</sub> values (C). n.s.: not significant. *: P&lt;0.05.</p>
