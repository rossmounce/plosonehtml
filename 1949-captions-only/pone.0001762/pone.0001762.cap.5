B, ‘in situ’ dystrophin signals from three individual representative mdx fibres (10 months). From their morphological appearance, split fibres and fibres without apparent visual morphological abnormalities were classified. In the latter group, fibres were subdivided in ‘mdx-like’ (low <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001762.e009&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> values) and ‘wt-like’ (<span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001762.e010&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> values comparable to wt fibres). C, the majority of mdx fibres from aged animals were ‘mdx-like’ and a small portion ‘wt-like’ (‘revertant’) as judged from the overlap of the wt lower quartile (dashed line) and the mdx upper quartile. Arrow: median. D, the degree of colocalization correlates with membrane Dys ratios <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001762.e011&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> in aged mdx fibres.</p>
