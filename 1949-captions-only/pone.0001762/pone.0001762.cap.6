Some dystrophin molecules may bind directly/indirectly to the C-terminus of the α<sub>1</sub>-subunit or to the auxiliary ß-subunit, thereby modifying channel properties. In DMD, this linkage is suggested to be disrupted. In aged revertant mdx fibres, the putative link between the channel and the cytoskeleton is rescued (not shown). In MinD fibres, mini-dystrophin is suggested to functionally replace dystrophin. DAG: dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex.</p>
