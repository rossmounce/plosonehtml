                Figure 1.  Nucleotide exchange by Sse1 is required for efficient [PSI+] propagation.(A) Complementation of the sse1Δ sse2Δ double deletion by overexpression of chaperones or nucleotide exchange factors. sse1Δ sse2Δ cells expressing Sse1 from pCUA-SSE1 were transformed with plasmids encoding chaperones or nucleotide exchange factors under control of the GPD promotor. Ssa1, Ssb1 and Sse1 were expressed from p315-GPD-plasmids, while Fes1 and Snl1ΔN were expressed from p425-GPD-plasmids. Transformants were spotted onto selective media (left panel) or media containing 5-FOA (right panel) to select against the SSE1 plasmid. (B) Complementation of the [PSI+]s phenotype of sse1Δ cells. [PSI+]s sse1Δ cells were transformed with plasmids encoding chaperones or nucleotide exchange factors from p315-GPD-plasmids (Ssa1, Ssb1 and Sse1) or p2H-GPD-plasmids (Fes1 and Snl1ΔN) and [PSI+] phenotypes were assessed by growth on rich media (YPD) after 2 days and media lacking adenine (-Ade) after 3–6 days. (C) Nucleotide exchange activities of Sse1, Fes1, and Snl1ΔN on Ssa1. NEF activities of a 5-fold excess of nucleotide exchange factors (2.5 µM) over the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1 (0.5 µM) were determined using stopped-flow analysis. Determined koff values in the presence of NEF were related to the basal koff for release of MABA-ADP from Ssa1 to yield the fold stimulation. (D) [PSI+] phenotype of sse1Δssb1,2Δ cells. [PSI+] sse1Δ cells were crossed with the corresponding [PSI+] ssb1Δ ssb2Δ cells. Diploids were sporulated and [PSI+] phenotypes of segregants were assessed as stated above.
