Ssa1, Ssb1 and Sse1 were expressed from p315-GPD-plasmids, while Fes1 and Snl1ΔN were expressed from p425-GPD-plasmids. Transformants were spotted onto selective media (left panel) or media containing 5-FOA (right panel) to select against the SSE1 plasmid. (B) Complementation of the [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>]<sub>s</sub> phenotype of <em>sse1Δ</em> cells. [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>]<sub>s</sub> <em>sse1Δ</em> cells were transformed with plasmids encoding chaperones or nucleotide exchange factors from p315-GPD-plasmids (Ssa1, Ssb1 and Sse1) or p2H-GPD-plasmids (Fes1 and Snl1ΔN) and [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotypes were assessed by growth on rich media (YPD) after 2 days and media lacking adenine (-Ade) after 3–6 days. (C) Nucleotide exchange activities of Sse1, Fes1, and Snl1ΔN on Ssa1. NEF activities of a 5-fold excess of nucleotide exchange factors (2.5 µM) over the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1 (0.5 µM) were determined using stopped-flow analysis. Determined k<sub>off</sub> values in the presence of NEF were related to the basal k<sub>off</sub> for release of MABA-ADP from Ssa1 to yield the fold stimulation. (D) [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotype of <em>sse1Δssb1,2Δ</em> cells. [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] <em>sse1Δ</em> cells were crossed with the corresponding [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] <em>ssb1Δ ssb2Δ</em> cells. Diploids were sporulated and [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotypes of segregants were assessed as stated above.</p>
