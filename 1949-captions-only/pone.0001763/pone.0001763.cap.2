                Figure 2.  Nucleotide exchange by Sse1 is important for de novo [PSI+] formation.(A) Quantitation of [PSI+] formation upon overexpression of (co-)chaperones. [psi−PIN+] cells were transformed with pLA1-SUP35 and p316-GAL-SSA1, p316-GAL-SSB1, p315-SSE1 or p315-GAL-SNL1ΔN. Transformants were grown as suspension cultures in selective media and expression of Sup35 along with (co-)chaperones was induced with galactose for 2 days. Cells were plated onto selective media and [PSI+] phenotypes were scored after replica plating onto rich media as well as media lacking adenine. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (B) Quantitation of [PSI+] formation in wild-type vs. sse1Δ cells. [psi−PIN+] wild-type or sse1Δ cells were transformed with pLA1-SUP35 expressing Sup35 under control of the GAL promotor, as well as with p315-GPD-SSE1 or –SNL1ΔN. Quantitation of [PSI+] induction was performed as stated above. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
