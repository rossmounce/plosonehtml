[<em>psi</em><sup>−</sup><em>PIN</em><sup>+</sup>] cells were transformed with pLA1-SUP35 and p316-GAL-SSA1, p316-GAL-SSB1, p315-SSE1 or p315-GAL-SNL1ΔN. Transformants were grown as suspension cultures in selective media and expression of Sup35 along with (co-)chaperones was induced with galactose for 2 days. Cells were plated onto selective media and [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotypes were scored after replica plating onto rich media as well as media lacking adenine. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (B) Quantitation of [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] formation in wild-type vs. <em>sse1Δ</em> cells. [<em>psi</em><sup>−</sup><em>PIN</em><sup>+</sup>] wild-type or <em>sse1Δ</em> cells were transformed with pLA1-SUP35 expressing Sup35 under control of the GAL promotor, as well as with p315-GPD-SSE1 or –SNL1ΔN. Quantitation of [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] induction was performed as stated above. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.</p>
