[<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>]<sub>w</sub> cells were transformed with pHG28 for expression of Hsp104, as well as with p316-GAL-SSA1, p316-GAL-SSB1, p315-SSE1 or p315-GAL-SNL1Î”N and combinations thereof. Transformants were grown as suspension cultures in selective media and expression of Hsp104 along with (co-)chaperones was induced with galactose for 1 day. Cells were plated onto selective media and [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotypes were scored after replica plating onto rich media as well as media lacking adenine. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (B) Quantitation of [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] curing by Hsp104 overexpression in a [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>]<sub>s</sub> strain. Quantitation of Hsp104 mediated-curing was performed as stated above.</p>
