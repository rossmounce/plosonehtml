                Figure 4.  Sse1 stimulates spontaneous Sup35NM fibre assembly.Kinetics of rotated (80 rpm) Sup35NM (2.5 µM) fibre assembly in the absence or presence of Snl1ΔN (2.5 µM), Sse1 (2.5 µM) plus ATP (5 mM), Sse1 (2.5 µM) in the absence of nucleotide, or Ssa1 (2.5 µM) plus ATP (5 mM). Fiber assembly was determined by thioflavin T fluorescence. Error bars represent the standard deviation.
