Transformants were grown on selective media and expression was induced by replica plating onto selective media containing galactose. After 8 days of induction, plates were replicated onto media lacking adenine and growth was assessed after incubation at 30°C for 13 days. (B) Verification of [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] induction in [<em>pin</em><sup>−</sup>] cells. Papillae from adenine-deficient media were streaked to single colonies and the [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] phenotype was verified by growth on rich media and media lacking adenine as well as by loss of the nonsense suppression phenotype on media containing 3 mM guanidinium hydrochloride. (C) Centrifugation analysis of Rnq1 and Sse1 from [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] cells. Aggregation of Rnq1 and Sse1 in [<em>PSI</em><sup>+</sup>] cells was assessed by centrifugation analysis and Western Blotting.</p>
