                Figure 5.  [PSI+] formation in [pin−] cells.(A) [psi−pin−] cells were transformed with pLA1-SUP35 and p316-GAL-SSA1, p316-GAL-SSB1 or p315-SSE1. Transformants were grown on selective media and expression was induced by replica plating onto selective media containing galactose. After 8 days of induction, plates were replicated onto media lacking adenine and growth was assessed after incubation at 30°C for 13 days. (B) Verification of [PSI+] induction in [pin−] cells. Papillae from adenine-deficient media were streaked to single colonies and the [PSI+] phenotype was verified by growth on rich media and media lacking adenine as well as by loss of the nonsense suppression phenotype on media containing 3 mM guanidinium hydrochloride. (C) Centrifugation analysis of Rnq1 and Sse1 from [PSI+] cells. Aggregation of Rnq1 and Sse1 in [PSI+] cells was assessed by centrifugation analysis and Western Blotting.
