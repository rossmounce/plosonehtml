                Figure 2.  Phylogeny of complete mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup A2.The sequencing procedure for the novel complete sequences and the phylogeny construction were performed as described elsewhere [47]. Recurrent mutational events within the haplogroup are underlined, while mutations in italics are either disease-causing or heteroplasmic or likely erroneous, and were not used for age calculations. Table S1 lists the source of the complete genomes. For additional information, see the legend for Figure 1.
