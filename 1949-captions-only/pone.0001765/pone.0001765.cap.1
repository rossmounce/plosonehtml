                Figure 1.  mRNA expression in human THP1 monocytes following fetuin-A treatment.Expression of TNF (A), IL1B (B), PBEF1 (C), and RETN (D) mRNA in human THP1 monocytes before (control) and after treatment with human albumin or human fetuin-A for 8 h. Cellular mRNA contents were corrected for 28S-rRNA (RAU = relative arbitrary units). Data are given as meansÂ±SEM (n = 5). Data were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test.
