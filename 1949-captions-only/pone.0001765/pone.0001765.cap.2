                Figure 2.  Cytokine and adipokine mRNA expression in adipose tissue of mice.Adipose tissue expression of Il6 (A), Tnf (B), Adipoq (C), and Lep (D) mRNA in mice after bolus treatment with human fetuin-A (0.5 mg/g body weight), human albumin (0.5 mg/g body weight), or diluent (control) for 8 h. Cellular mRNA contents were corrected for 28S-rRNA (RAU = relative arbitrary units). Data are given as meansÂ±SEM. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test.
