                Figure 3.  Adiponectin mRNA expression in cultured human adipocytes.ADIPOQ mRNA expression of human in vitro differentiated adipocytes after treatment with bovine (A) and human (B) fetuin-A for 24 h. Cellular mRNA contents were corrected for 28S-rRNA. Data from adipocyte cultures of four donors are presented. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test.
