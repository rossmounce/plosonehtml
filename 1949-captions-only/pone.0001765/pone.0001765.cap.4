                Figure 4.  Relationships between circulating fetuin-A and circulating adiponectin in humans.Relationship between plasma levels of fetuin-A with total adiponectin and adiponectin's multimeric forms (A–D) in 49 healthy human subjects after adjustment of log-transformed data for age, sex, and percentage of body fat by multivariate linear regression analysis. The regression coefficients as well as the p-value are indicated (HMW–high molecular weight; LMW–low molecular weight; MMW–middle molecular weight).
