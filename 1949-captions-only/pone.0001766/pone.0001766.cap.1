Sample (1) was denatured in Laemmli buffer, run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and detected with Coomassie brilliant blue staining. (2) protein molecular size standards (kDa). (B) Observation of the different complexes adsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads under UV light. (C) Electron micrographs of ring-like structures produced by heterologous expression of N-GFP (left) and N (right) purified by GST-PCT. Bars, 50 nm. (D) N-GFP SRS (thin line) adsorption by RAW and D2SC/1 cell lines after 1 hour incubation at 4°C (controls: PBS in grey or GFP bold line). Green fluorescence associated with living cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (the gate was set up excluding dead cells stained with propidium iodide in FL3). The data (100,000 events) were acquired with a FACScalibur and analyzed with Cell Quest-Pro. (E) Confocal microscopy analysis showing entry of N-GFP SRS (green fluorescence) within cells. Filamentous actin was stained with phalloidin Rhodamin (red). Images of individual cells are either z sections through confocal images taken at sequential focal planes or xy views. Stacks of confocal images were acquired at 0.37 µm intervals (bars 10 µm).</p>
