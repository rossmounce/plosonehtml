(A) or s.c (B) 10 µg N SRS and 5 µg LT(R192G) (black bars) or 5 µg LT(R192G) alone (grey bars). Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were challenged with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU hRSV strain A2, together with a non-immunized control group of mice (white bars). Mice were monitored daily for body weight. Viral replication in lung was monitored by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The number of N-specific RNA copies for 1 µg total reverse-transcribed lung RNA was determined against a standard curve using a plasmid encoding the viral N gene. (A) Intranasal immunization with N SRS reduced N-specific RNA in lungs 4 to 10 days after RSV challenge. (B) Sub-cutaneous vaccination induced moderate protection at 5 days after RSV challenge. Each bar represents the mean and SEM of 5–8 mice. (C) Weight loss in vaccinated versus non vaccinated groups is expressed as the percentage of initial weight (plot of mean±SEM, n = 4–5, day 0 is 100%). Data are representative from four independent experiments.</p>
