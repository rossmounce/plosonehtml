Two weeks after the second immunization, all animals were challenged with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU hRSV strain A2, together with a control group of non-immunized mice. One group of mice was neither immunized nor infected. Lung were dissected out 5 days post challenge, embedded in paraffin, sectionned at 7 µm and stained with eosin-hematoxylin. One representative section per group is shown (original magnification 20×, bars 100 µm). (A) control group (no vaccine, no virus), (B) primary infection group (no vaccine, RSV); (C) adjuvant only group (LT(R192G), RSV), (D) N SRS vaccinated group (N SRS+LT(R192G), RSV). Areas with an infiltration of inflammatory cells are indicated with a white arrow. (E) Enlargement showing that the immune infiltrate in N SRS vaccinated group was composed predominantly of lymphocytes and some neutrophils (black arrows) (original magnification 63x, bars 20 µm).</p>
