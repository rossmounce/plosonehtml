One group was not immunized. Two weeks after the second immunization, all animals were challenged with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU hRSV strain A2. Cellular composition of BAL sampled at 0, 5 and 10 days after RSV challenge as determined by May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining: lymphocytes (dotted bars), macrophages (white bars) and neutrophils (grey bars). Results are expressed as mean and SEM percentages from 5–8 individual mice (Data from two experiments with similar results).</p>
