                Figure 4.  Nasal vaccination with N SRS induces neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment in BAL.BALB/c mice were administered i.n. 10 µg N SRS and/or 5 µg LT(R192G) twice at two weeks interval. One group was not immunized. Two weeks after the second immunization, all animals were challenged with 107 PFU hRSV strain A2. Cellular composition of BAL sampled at 0, 5 and 10 days after RSV challenge as determined by May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining: lymphocytes (dotted bars), macrophages (white bars) and neutrophils (grey bars). Results are expressed as mean and SEM percentages from 5–8 individual mice (Data from two experiments with similar results).
