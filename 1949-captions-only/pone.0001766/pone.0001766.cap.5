(A) Antigen-specific proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T splenocytes after 7 days restimulation with RSV-A2 (1 PFU/cell), N (10 µg/ml) or medium. Pooled splenocytes from non immunized (grey lines), LT(R192G) (black lines) or N SRS+LT(R192G) (red lines) immunized groups were stained with CFSE, cultured for 7 days and then labeled with anti-CD8-biot and anti-CD4-PE for flow-cytometry analysis. The data (100,000 events) were acquired with a FACScalibur and analyzed with Cell Quest-Pro. The CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte population was gated according to SSC/FCS and FL4 (CD8) or FL2 (CD4) fluorescence criteria and the fluorescence corresponding to CFSE was monitored in FL1. The percentage of proliferating cells (low CFSE staining) is indicated on the plot with the color corresponding to the immunization condition. (Data from one out of two experiments with similar results). (B) Two weeks after the booster immunization with LT(R192G) or N SRS+LT(R192G), spleen (white bars) and draining LN (cervical and sub-maxilliary LN, black bars) were dissected out and cell suspensions prepared. Splenocytes from individual mice and pooled draining LN cells from each group of mice were re-stimulated for 72 hr with N SRS (10 µg/ml) or medium (mock). IFN-γ secretion was measured in cell culture supernatant with a standardized specific sandwich ELISA assay (white bars represent the mean and SEM of 5 individual spleens, black bars represent the pool of LN, data from one out of three experiments). (C) The frequency of IFN-γ secreting splenocytes after 20 hr restimulation with N (10 µg/ml) was monitored by ELISPOT. Spleen cells from LT(R192G) or N SRS+LT(R192G) immunized mice were assayed for each mouse (each bar represents the mean and SEM of 5 mice). Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was done by immuno-magnetic separation of pooled splenocytes from either LT(R192G) or N SRS+LT(R192G) groups. (Data from one out of two experiments with similar results).</p>
