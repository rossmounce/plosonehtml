Two weeks after the second immunization, N SRS+LT(R192G) or LT(R192G) treated mice and a control group of non-immunized mice were challenged with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU hRSV strain A2. BAL cells were collected from non-infected vaccinated mice and at days 4 and 10 post-RSV challenge of vaccinated and control mice. Live cells were numerated after trypan blue exclusion. Cells (pool of 5 mice per group) were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated Abs anti-CD4, -CD8 and -CD69 and analyzed on a FACS Calibur, collecting data on at least 5,000 lymphocytes gated according to FSC and SSC criteria. (A) Gated on CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. First plot shows matched-isotype background staining for anti-CD69 (pool of BAL, 10 days post-RSV). Second and third dot plots show CD69 staining among BAL cells from N SRS+LT(R192G) vaccinated mice, respectively non infected (n.i.) or 10 days after RSV infection. The % of CD69<sup>+</sup> cells is indicated on the plots. (B) Gated on CD69<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. Percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, 10 days after virus challenge of non vaccinated mice (first plot), LT(R192G) or N SRS+LT(R192G) immunized mice (second and third plots, respectively). The % of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells are indicated on the plots. (C) The total number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> (black bars) and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> (white bars) lymphocytes in BAL was calculated as (% positively stained cells)×(% gated cells)×(number of live cells) at 4 and 10 days after RSV infection.</p>
