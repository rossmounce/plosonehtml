                Figure 6.  Nasal vaccination with N SRS followed by virus infection triggers CD69+CD4+ and CD69+CD8+ lymphocytes recruitment in BAL.BALB/c mice were administered i.n. twice at 2 weeks interval 10 µg N SRS and/or 5 µg LT(R192G). Two weeks after the second immunization, N SRS+LT(R192G) or LT(R192G) treated mice and a control group of non-immunized mice were challenged with 107 PFU hRSV strain A2. BAL cells were collected from non-infected vaccinated mice and at days 4 and 10 post-RSV challenge of vaccinated and control mice. Live cells were numerated after trypan blue exclusion. Cells (pool of 5 mice per group) were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated Abs anti-CD4, -CD8 and -CD69 and analyzed on a FACS Calibur, collecting data on at least 5,000 lymphocytes gated according to FSC and SSC criteria. (A) Gated on CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes. First plot shows matched-isotype background staining for anti-CD69 (pool of BAL, 10 days post-RSV). Second and third dot plots show CD69 staining among BAL cells from N SRS+LT(R192G) vaccinated mice, respectively non infected (n.i.) or 10 days after RSV infection. The % of CD69+ cells is indicated on the plots. (B) Gated on CD69+ lymphocytes. Percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, 10 days after virus challenge of non vaccinated mice (first plot), LT(R192G) or N SRS+LT(R192G) immunized mice (second and third plots, respectively). The % of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are indicated on the plots. (C) The total number of CD4+CD69+ (black bars) and CD8+CD69+ (white bars) lymphocytes in BAL was calculated as (% positively stained cells)×(% gated cells)×(number of live cells) at 4 and 10 days after RSV infection.
