The error bars represent a 95% confidence interval. The eight regions are ranked by the estimated forces of infection. (B) Equilibrium proportion of clinical malaria over all ages in terms of R<sub>0</sub>. The full lines represent the stable solutions of the system of differential equations, whereas the dashed lines stand for unstable equilibria. Endemic equilibria are marked for two representative regions: Foni Kansala and Kilifi. Alternative disease-free equilibria for Foni Kansala is marked F. (C) Relationship between the force of infection (or entomological inoculation rate, EIR) and the parasite prevalence. The full line represents the stable solution of the system whereas the dashed line stands for an unstable equilibrium.</p>
