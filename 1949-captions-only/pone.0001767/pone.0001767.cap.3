                Figure 3.  Sensitivity to hospitalisation rate, parameter η.(A) Equilibrium curves for different values of η (1, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, from lower to higher peak). (B) Estimated basic reproduction numbers for different values of η. The black full line on the left shows the lower value of R0 for which an endemic equilibrium solution exists. The red and green dotted lines represent the values of R0, derived from the estimated forces of infection, for Foni Kansala and Kilifi, respectively. Circles highlight the values of ηcorresponding to the curves in (A).
