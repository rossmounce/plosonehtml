                Figure 1.  Phylogenetic and brain relationships of avian vocal learners.A. One view of the phylogenetic relationships of living birds [129]. Vocal learners are highlighted in red. Red dots: possible independent gains of vocal learning; green dots: alternatively, possible independent losses. B. Semi-3D view of seven cerebral vocal nuclei (red and yellow) found in vocal learners and of auditory areas (blue) found in all birds. Red-labeled vocal nuclei and white arrows: anterior vocal pathway. Yellow-labeled vocal nuclei and black arrows: posterior vocal pathway. Only a few connections in hummingbirds are known and that of songbird MO is not known. Based on serial sections of singing-driven IEG expression in this study, we see that NIf and Av are adjacent at lateral levels. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bars, 1 mm. Figure modified from Jarvis et al. (2000) [7] and Jarvis (2004) [10], with connectivity reviewed therein.
