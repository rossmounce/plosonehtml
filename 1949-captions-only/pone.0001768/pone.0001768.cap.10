                Figure 10.  Movement-induced ZENK expression in budgerigars, a parrot.A. Serial sagittal sections of: (a) Auditory areas: bird sitting relatively still while hearing playbacks of budgerigar warble song; (b) Auditory and vocal areas: perched bird hearing himself and producing warble song while alone and moving relatively little; (c) Movement areas: bird hopping in the rotating wheel in the dark while deaf; (d) FoxP1 expression from adjacent sections of the bird in (c); (e) Corresponding anatomical drawings; red: areas with movement-induced expression; blue: areas with auditory- or visual-induced expression. First row are medial-most sections. Sections with N-L2 are not shown. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm. Compare with frontal sections in figure S6. B. Quantification of ZENK expression levels in 22 different brain regions in three groups of budgerigars. * = p&lt;0.05 to&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak multi-comparison test relative to the sitting still group (n = 3/group). t = significantly different, p&lt;0.05, by a t-test. (t) = 0.06&lt;p&lt;0.09 by a t-test. Although the cerebellum lobule VI clearly had high levels of induced expression in all three animals of the hopping, dark, deaf group, this difference approached significance (p = 0.06) due to a large variance; the same was true of the PH region in the hopping, dim light group. Error bars, S.E.M.
