Serial sagittal sections of: (a) Vocal and other areas: ZENK expression in a bird that was singing interspersed with flying near an outdoor feeder in the morning (high expression in non-vocal areas is due to other behaviors, including flying and feeding); (b) Auditory, visual, and movement-associated areas: ZENK expression in control hemisphere (contralateral to open eye and ear) and experimental hemisphere (contralateral to covered eye and ear) of a bird hovering in a plexiglass cage in dim light; (c) FoxP1 expression from adjacent sections of the experimental hemisphere of the bird in (b); (d) Corresponding anatomical drawings; red: areas with movement-induced expression; blue: areas with visual- or auditory-induced expression (auditory areas also determined from a previous study <a href="#pone.0001768-Jarvis3">[7]</a>). First row are medial-most sections. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm. Compare with coronal sections in <a href="#pone.0001768.s007">figure S7</a>. B. Quantification of ZENK expression levels in 18 different brain regions, in both hemispheres, in two groups of hummingbirds. * indicates brain areas with statistically significant increases in both experimental (covered) and control (open) hemispheres of hovering birds relative to the experimental and control hemispheres of the relatively still birds (p&lt;0.05, one-tailed t-test, n = 3 relatively still and 4 hovering animals for both hemispheres). # indicates significantly less increase in the experimental hemisphere (p&lt;0.05, paired t-test on experimental and control hemispheres within birds). The (*) for the OT indicates that this is the only visual area that did not show increased ZENK expression in the experimental hemisphere opposite the covered eye. Error bars, S.E.M.</p>
