Anterior vocal nuclei adjacent to ASt, AN, and AMV in sagittal sections. B. DLN adjacent to VLN [and LAI to VA] in coronal sections. C. LAI adjacent to VA [and DLN to VLN] in sagittal sections. D. VMN [as well as VMM] adjacent to activated areas near L2 in sagittal sections. The c-fos expression in vocal nuclei (first column) is of male that sang for 30 min interspersed with flying and feeding; c-fos is shown for its high contrast in vocal nuclei relative to the surrounding non-vocal areas. The hovering-associated expression patterns (left two columns) are from the hemisphere opposite of the covered eye and ear of males that hovered in a plexiglass cage. Anterior is right, dorsal is up for sagittal sections; medial is left, dorsal is up for frontal sections. The left most sections are either lateral (A, C, and D) or caudal (B) to that shown in the middle column. Different background red color is due to different cresyl violet staining intensities. Note that similar to budgerigar MO and NAO (<a href="#pone-0001768-g010">Fig. 10Ab</a> and <a href="#pone.0001768.s006">Fig. S6A</a>), the two analogous hummingbird pallial anterior vocal nuclei (VAM and VAM) are very close such that the IEG expression does not distinguish the brain subdivision boundary well. Yellow dashed lines-brain subdivision boundaries; white dashed lines–vocal nuclei boundaries, only highlighted for some images so that other sections can be viewed as is; boundaries were determined from Nissl stain and adjacent sections hybridized with FoxP1 (<a href="#pone-0001768-g011">Fig. 11Ac</a> and <a href="#pone.0001768.s007">Fig. S7C</a>).
