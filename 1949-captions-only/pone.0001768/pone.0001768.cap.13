                Figure 13.  Movement-induced ZENK expression in ring doves, a vocal non-learner.A. Sagittal sections of: (a) Dove sitting relatively still in the dark; (b) Dove walking on a treadmill in the dark while deaf; (c) FoxP1 expression from adjacent sections of the bird in (b); (d) Corresponding anatomical drawings; red: areas with movement-induced expression; blue: known auditory and visual areas. First row are medial-most sections. Front is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm. B. Quantification of ZENK expression levels in 20 different brain regions in two groups of ring doves. * = p&lt;0.05 to&lt;0.0001, one-tailed t-test, relative to sitting still animals (n = 3/group). Error bars, S.E.M.
