                Figure 2.  IEG expression patterns in brain sections from moving versus singing zebra finches.A. Example of the most restricted movement-associated expression pattern obtained in this study. A mid-sagittal section from a deafened bird that was hopping in the dark. B. Comparable section from a bird that was singing while movingly relatively little. ZENK expression is shown in (A); c-fos is shown in (B) due to its high contrast in vocal nuclei. White: IEG expression; red: cresyl violet staining. Six (HVC, NIf, Av, Area X, MAN, and MO) of the seven vocal nuclei can be seen in these sections, which are adjacent to five movement-associated areas (PLN, PLMV, ASt, AN, AMV); movement-associated areas laterally adjacent to the HVC and RA are not in this section. AMD and AH are known somatosensory areas. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm.
