Sagittal sections of birds (a) sitting relatively still in dim light, (b) hopping around the perimeter of a cylindrical cage in day light, (c) hopping in a rotating wheel in the dark, (d) sitting still in the dark and hearing a bird hop in the rotating wheel, (e) sitting still in the dark and hearing playbacks of zebra finch song, and (f) hopping in the rotating wheel in the dark while deaf. The anatomical profile in the lower right highlights the extent of the movement-induced (red) and visual- and auditory-induced (blue) gene expression. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm. B. Quantification of ZENK expression levels in 23 brain regions in 8 groups of male zebra finches. Except for a small difference in cerebellum lobule VI, there were no significant differences between sitting still dim light and dark animals; thus, they were treated as one control group for statistical analysis. * = p&lt;0.05 to&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak multi-comparison test relative to combined values of sitting still animals in dim light+dark (n = 3â€“6/group). Lines underneath *s indicate brain areas with statistically significant increases exclusive to the moving groups. #s alone indicate values that approached significance by a few tenths of decimal in the ANOVA test. Error bars, S.E.M.</p>
