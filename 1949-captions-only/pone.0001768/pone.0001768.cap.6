                Figure 6.  Serial sagittal brain sections of ZENK expression in male zebra finches.A. Auditory areas: bird sitting still in the dark while hearing song. Although not mentioned in the main text, hearing-induced expression also occurs in caudal St and MLd, known auditory regions of the striatum and midbrain, respectively [45]. B. Auditory and vocal areas: bird hearing and singing alone in a sound box in the day light condition. C. Movement areas: bird hopping in the rotating wheel in the dark while deaf. D. FoxP1 expression from adjacent sections of the bird in (C). E. Corresponding anatomical drawings; red: areas with movement-induced expression; blue: areas with auditory- or visual-induced expression. First row are medial-most sections. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bar, 2 mm. Compare with frontal sections in figure S3.
