(B) HVC adjacent to DLN and dorsal PLN. (C) NIf and Av adjacent to ventral PLN and PLMV respectively. (D) RA adjacent to LAI. The c-fos expression in vocal nuclei (first column) is of a young zebra finch male that sang for 30 min while moving relatively little; c-fos is shown for its high contrast in vocal nuclei relative to the surrounding non-vocal areas. The hopping-associated expression (left two columns) is from a male that hoped in the dark and was deaf; the left most sections are lateral to the vocal nuclei (except for anterior areas, which still contain the lateral part of the anterior vocal nuclei). Yellow dashed lines-brain subdivision boundaries; white dashed lines–vocal nuclei boundaries, only highlighted for some images so that other sections can be viewed as is. Anterior is right, dorsal is up–sagittal sections; sections of the top panel are orientated at a ~45° angle so that all three anterior vocal nuclei fit vertically into one image. Scale bar, 200 µm.</p>
