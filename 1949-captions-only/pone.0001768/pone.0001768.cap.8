                Figure 8.  Relative volumes of movement-associated areas and vocal nuclei.A. Relative volumes as a percentage of the summed cerebral (telencephalon) volume from a series of sagittal sections (see methods) from the hopping, dark and deaf animals. The movement-associated areas and adjacent vocal nuclei are shown as bars adjacent to each other. Totals represent the summed relative volumes of all movement-associated areas whether or not it is adjacent to a vocal nucleus, and of all vocal nuclei. * = p&lt;0.05, paired t-test (within bird comparisons, n = 3). Error bars, S.E.M. Although all animals had higher volumes of ASt and AMV relative to Area X and MO, the variance was large in the movement areas such that the volume difference did not reach significance. B. Correlation between relative volumes of movement-associated regions and adjacent vocal nuclei. Each dot represents the average values from the graph in (A).
