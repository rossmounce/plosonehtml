                Figure 1.  Map of the PIK3R1 gene showing exons (boxes), introns (solid lines) and position of the 4 htSNPs that discriminate all haplotypes with a frequency of â‰¥4.5%.The graph is not to scale. Open boxes indicate untranslated regions, whereas shaded boxes display the coding regions.
