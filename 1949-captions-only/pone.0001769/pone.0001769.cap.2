                Figure 2.  UCSC genome browser generated view of genomic region of PIK3R1 including exons 2 to 7.Coding exons are represented by blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns. The 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) are displayed as thinner blocks on the leading ends of the aligning regions. Arrowheads on the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription. Position of CpG islands, putative promoter and transcription start sites are indicated. Location of transcription factor binding sites conserved in the human/mouse/rat alignment is indicated. Conservation of binding sites in all 3 species is computed with the Transfac Matrix Database (v7.0). Evolutionary conservation in 17 vertebrates, including mammalian, amphibian, bird, and fish species was scored by the phastCons program following MULTIZ alignments. Conservation scores are displayed as wiggle, where the height reflects the size of the score. Pairwise alignments of each species to the human genome are displayed below as a “wiggle” that indicates alignment quality.
