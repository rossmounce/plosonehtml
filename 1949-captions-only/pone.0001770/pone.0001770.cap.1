                Figure 1.  Purification of βγ-CAT.(A) Lyophilized frog B. maxima skin secretions (5.0 g, containing 550 mg proteins, from a stock in Kunming Institute of Zoology) was dissolved in 10 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 5 mM EDTA, dialyzed against the same buffer at 4°C overnight and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a DEAE Sephadex A-50 (Pharmacia) column (2.6×50 cm). The elution was performed at a flow rate of 30 ml/h with a linear NaCl gradient, collecting fractions of 5 ml per tube. Hemolytic activity was mainly found in NaCl-eluted peak III. This peak was collected as indicated by a bar. (B) The peak III from DEAE Sephadex A-50 column was concentrated, then applied on a Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia, superfine) column (2.6×100 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA. Elution was achieved with the same buffer at a flow rate of 12 ml/h, collecting fractions of 2 ml per tube. The hemolytic activity was found in peak II. In A and B, The protein concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm (•). The hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes (○) was determined as described in “Methods”. (C) The peak II of Sephadex G-100 column was lyophilized and dialyzed against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 24 h at 4°C, and finally applied on an AKTA Mono-Q HR5/5 anion ion exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with the NaCl gradient, as shown in the figure. Hemolytic activity was found in peaks I, II and III. Peak I is highly purified βγ-CAT, as indicated by an arrow.
