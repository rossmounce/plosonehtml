                Figure 10.  Co-localization of βγ-CAT positive vacuoles with endocytic marker proteins.PBS control (A1–A3, D1–D3) and βγ-CAT treated cells (10 nM, 10 min) (B1–C3, E1–F3) were first stained with specific antibodies against vacuolar type ATPase (A1–C3) and rab5 (D1–F3), respectively by indirect immunofluorescence (Cy3 labeled secondary antibodies, red channel). After washed with PBS (containing 1% BSA) for three times, the cells were stained again with FITC-labeled antibodies against βγ-CAT α-subunit (green channel). Nucleus was counter-stained by Hoechst (blue channel). Co-localization of βγ-CAT with vacuolar type ATPase (B3, C3) or rab5 (E3, F3) in intracellular vacuoles was indicated by arrows. The vacuoles reached to nuclear membrane were also observed, as indicated in C3, F3 by arrows. Scale bars equal to10 µm.
