                Figure 2.  Characterization of βγ-CAT.(A) PAGE analysis of purified βγ-CAT. Left part, PAGE analysis of purified βγ-CAT under native conditions at pH 8.5 (10% acrylamide). Right part, SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) analysis of purified βγ-CAT under reducing conditions (lane 1) and non-reducing conditions (lane 2). The protein bands were silver-stained. (B) Native molecular weight analysis of βγ-CAT by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column. (C) HPLC isolation of βγ-CAT subunits. Purified βγ-CAT was loaded on a Vydac C4 reverse phase HPLC column equilibrated with 30% (v/v) acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution was performed with a gradient of buffer B (30% isopropanol plus 70% acetonitrile, containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Insert, SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide, under reducing conditions) analysis of isolated βγ-CAT subunits.
