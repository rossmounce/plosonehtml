The characteristic βγ-crystallin domains were marked. (B) Sequence comparison of βγ-CAT α-subunit C-terminal part (residues 173–287) with an internal fragment (residues 118–209) of ETX from bacterial <em>C. perfringens</em> <a href="#pone.0001770-Hunter1">[21]</a>. (C) Sequence comparison of βγ-CAT β-subunit with human TFF3 <a href="#pone.0001770-Hauser3">[22]</a>, Bm-TFF2 <a href="#pone.0001770-Zhang1">[12]</a> and human TFF2 <a href="#pone.0001770-Tomasetto1">[23]</a>. The characteristic cysteine residues of TFF domains are boxed. In (A) and (C), Peptides corresponding to determined amino acid sequences by Edman degradation are underlined. In (A), (B) and (C), identical residues are shown by asterisks. Gaps have been introduced to optimize the sequence homology.</p>
