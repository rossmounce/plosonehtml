                Figure 4.  Hemolytic activity of βγ-CAT and antibody neutralization.(A) Hemolytic activity of βγ-CAT on mammalian erythrocytes. The erythrocytes (5×106 cells/ml) of different species were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT at 37°C for 30 min, and hemolytic activity was determined as described in “Methods” (B) Neutralization of βγ-CAT hemolytic activity by specific antiserum against each subunit of the protein. βγ-CAT (3 nM) was incubated with a series of diluted rabbit antiserum against each subunit at 37°C for 30 min, and then the rest of the hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes was determined. Pre-immunized serum was used as a negative control. The value for the erythrocytes lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (A) or compared with the βγ-CAT only group (B). In (A), only initial point (p&lt;0.01) was marked (**) and the following points that all have p&lt;0.01 were omitted for clarity.
