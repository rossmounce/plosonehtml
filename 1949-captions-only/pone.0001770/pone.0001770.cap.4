The erythrocytes (5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) of different species were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT at 37°C for 30 min, and hemolytic activity was determined as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>” (B) Neutralization of βγ-CAT hemolytic activity by specific antiserum against each subunit of the protein. βγ-CAT (3 nM) was incubated with a series of diluted rabbit antiserum against each subunit at 37°C for 30 min, and then the rest of the hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes was determined. Pre-immunized serum was used as a negative control. The value for the erythrocytes lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (A) or compared with the βγ-CAT only group (B). In (A), only initial point (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) was marked (**) and the following points that all have <em>p</em>&lt;0.01 were omitted for clarity.</p>
