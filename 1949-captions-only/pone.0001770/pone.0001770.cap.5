Human erythrocytes (4×10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of PEGs of different molecular sizes. Hemolysis was tested as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>”. (B) Human erythrocyte K<sup>+</sup> efflux and hemolysis induced by βγ-CAT in the absence and presence of PEG 1000. The value of the erythrocytes lysed with 1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared with βγ-CAT only group (A–B); #, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; ##, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (B). (C) Western blotting analysis of SDS-stable oligomers formed in erythrocyte membranes. Human erythrocytes (6×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT (0.5–3 nM) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were treated as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>”, and loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel (linear gradient acrylamide gel of 3–15%) and blotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against native βγ-CAT, and each subunit, respectively. Lanes1, 6, 11, βγ-CAT control; lanes 2, 7, 12, erythrocyte control; lanes 3, 8, 13, lanes 4, 9, 14, and lanes 5, 10,15, erythrocytes treated with 0.5, 1.5, and 3 nM βγ-CAT, respectively.</p>
