                Figure 5.  Erythrocyte membrane pore formation.(A) Osmotic protection of erythrocytes from hemolysis induced by βγ-CAT. Human erythrocytes (4×109 cells/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of PEGs of different molecular sizes. Hemolysis was tested as described in “Methods”. (B) Human erythrocyte K+ efflux and hemolysis induced by βγ-CAT in the absence and presence of PEG 1000. The value of the erythrocytes lysed with 1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01, compared with βγ-CAT only group (A–B); #, p&lt;0.05; ##, p&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (B). (C) Western blotting analysis of SDS-stable oligomers formed in erythrocyte membranes. Human erythrocytes (6×107 cells/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of βγ-CAT (0.5–3 nM) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were treated as described in “Methods”, and loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel (linear gradient acrylamide gel of 3–15%) and blotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against native βγ-CAT, and each subunit, respectively. Lanes1, 6, 11, βγ-CAT control; lanes 2, 7, 12, erythrocyte control; lanes 3, 8, 13, lanes 4, 9, 14, and lanes 5, 10,15, erythrocytes treated with 0.5, 1.5, and 3 nM βγ-CAT, respectively.
