                Figure 6.  Stimulation of HUVEC migration and wound healing by low concentrations of βγ-CAT.(A) Left part, migration of HUVECs stimulated by βγ-CAT was tested by a Boyden chamber assay. Black columns and white columns present collagen-coated chambers and BSA-coated chambers, respectively. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT). Right part, the recorded photography under the chambers shows obvious increase of cells after treated with βγ-CAT. (B) Closure of an artificial wound in HUVEC monolayers stimulated by βγ-CAT. The results were the representative of three independent experiments. Scale bars equal to 100 µm in (A) and (B).
