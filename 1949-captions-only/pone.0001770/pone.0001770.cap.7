Insert shows morphological changes of βγ-CAT treated HUVECs. Scale bars equal to 100 µm. (B) Cell viability of HUVECs after treated with βγ-CAT for 2 h as determined by MTT assay. Insert, TUNEL-staining of cells treated with βγ-CAT (25 nM, 2 h). Nucleus was counter-stained by PI (red channel). The merge (yellow) fluorescent signals indicate TUNEL positive staining. Scale bars equal to 20 µm. (C) The DNA content of HUVECs treated with βγ-CAT (25 nM) was detected using Hoechst by flow cytometry. Cells in the Sub-G<sub>1</sub> (M1), G<sub>1</sub> (M2), S (M3), and G<sub>2</sub>/M (M4) phases are indicated. (D) The release of cytochrome c was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Nucleus was counter-stained by PI (red channel). Normal (top panels) and βγ-CAT treated cells (bottom panels) were labeled with a specific antibody against cytochrome c (green channel). Cells with cytochrome c releasing are marked by arrows. Scale bars equal to 20 µm. (E) Activated caspase activities of HUVECs after treated with βγ-CAT. White columns present PBS treated cells; black columns present the whole βγ-CAT treated cells; diagonal columns present the floating cells after βγ-CAT treated. In the parts of (D) and (E), HUVECs were treated by βγ-CAT (25 nM) for 2 h. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (*, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, in A, B and E, compared with zero βγ-CAT; in C, compared with zero time point).</p>
