                Figure 8.  Vacuole formation of HUVECs induced by βγ-CAT and inhibition by bafilomycin A1 and nocodazole.(A) Extensive cell vacuolation induced by high dosages of βγ-CAT. HUVECs planted on glass coverslips were incubated with βγ-CAT (25 nM) for 30 min. PBS-treated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with NH4Cl (16 mM) for 18 h were used as a positive control. The cells were stained with neutral red as described in “Methods”. The vacuole formation in the cells was observed by confocal microscope. Scale bars equal to 10 µm. (B) Neutral red uptake of βγ-CAT treated HUVECs in the absence and presence of bafilomycin A1 and nocodazole. HUVECs (2.5×104 cells/ml) seeded in 96 well titer plates were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (25 nM) or nocodazole (20 µM) for 30 min at 37°C, then different concentrations of βγ-CAT (50 pM-5 nM) were added and incubated for another 30 min. Neutral red uptake was performed as described in “Methods”. (C) Inhibition of cell detachment induced by βγ-CAT in the presence of bafilomycin A1 and nocodazole. HUVECs planted in 24-well plates were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (25 nM) or nocodazole (20 µM) for 30 min at 37°C, then βγ-CAT (1 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM) was added and incubated for 5 h. Cell detachment was analyzed as described in “Methods”. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (#, p&lt;0.05; ##, p&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (B); *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01, compared with the βγ-CAT only group (B–C).
