HUVECs planted on glass coverslips were incubated with βγ-CAT (25 nM) for 30 min. PBS-treated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (16 mM) for 18 h were used as a positive control. The cells were stained with neutral red as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>”. The vacuole formation in the cells was observed by confocal microscope. Scale bars equal to 10 µm. (B) Neutral red uptake of βγ-CAT treated HUVECs in the absence and presence of bafilomycin A1 and nocodazole. HUVECs (2.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml) seeded in 96 well titer plates were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (25 nM) or nocodazole (20 µM) for 30 min at 37°C, then different concentrations of βγ-CAT (50 <em>p</em>M-5 nM) were added and incubated for another 30 min. Neutral red uptake was performed as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>”. (C) Inhibition of cell detachment induced by βγ-CAT in the presence of bafilomycin A1 and nocodazole. HUVECs planted in 24-well plates were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (25 nM) or nocodazole (20 µM) for 30 min at 37°C, then βγ-CAT (1 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM) was added and incubated for 5 h. Cell detachment was analyzed as described in “<a href="#s4">Methods</a>”. Data were expressed as means±SEM of triplicate measurements (#, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; ##, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared with zero βγ-CAT (B); *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared with the βγ-CAT only group (B–C).</p>
