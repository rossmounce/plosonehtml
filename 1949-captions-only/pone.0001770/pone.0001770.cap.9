                Figure 9.  Endocytosis and intracellular localization of βγ-CAT.(A) The endocytosis and intracellular localization of βγ-CAT was detected by direct immunofluorescence. Nucleus was counter-stained by Hoechst (blue channel). PBS control (A1–A2, E1–E2) and βγ-CAT treated cells (10 nM, 10 min) were detected with FITC-labeled antibodies against the α-subunit (B1–D2) or β-subunit (F1–H2) (green channel). Some of the vacuoles were translocated to nucleus and partial fused with nuclear membrane, as indicated by arrows in C2, D2, G2 and H2. Scale bars equal to 10 µm. (B) Endocytosis of Cy3-labeled βγ-CAT. HUVECs were treated with Cy3-labeled βγ-CAT (10 nM, 10 min). The labeled protein (red channel) was observed to be concentrated in intracellular vacuoles (B1–D2). The vacuoles distributed in nuclear membrane were seen (D1–D2). Cells treated with free Cy3 dye (blocked with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8) was used as a negative control (A1–A2). Scale bars equal to 10 µm.
