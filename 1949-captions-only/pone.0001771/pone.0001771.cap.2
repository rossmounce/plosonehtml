                Figure 2.  Time course of rel-GFP expression.M. smegmatis harboring a rel-GFP construct was grown for different periods of time (indicated in h) and the rel promoter-driven expression of GFP was monitored by flow cytometry. With time, there is a gradual transition of the cells from the L (low) to the H (high) state.
