                Figure 3.  Analysis of the time course of rel expression.(A) Basal (mean fluorescence intensity of cells present in the L state) rel expression and (B) the percentage of cells in the high state were obtained from flow cytometry data and plotted against time. The data in both the cases can be fitted with sigmoids. (C) Transition rate from the L to the H state (solid curve) and the low expression state CV (solid squares represent data points) versus time. The inset shows the basal expression rate versus time.
