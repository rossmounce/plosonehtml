                Figure 4.  Time course of rel-GFP expression in M. smegmatis.A. schematic diagram of rel promoter. B. Time course of rel-GFP expression in a M. smegmatis mutant in which sigE was disrupted. Time course of GFP expression driven by rel promoter mutated at the SigE (C) or the SigA (D) binding site. The time points (h) in A, C and D are indicated in the histograms.
