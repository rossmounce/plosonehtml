                Figure 1.  2 % agarose gel, 16S rRNA PCR of gDNA extracted from archival blood samples 1 to 6.2 µl of gDNA in 25 µl PCR reaction with 25×PCR cycles. 5 µl loaded on gel. Image is reverse colour under UV transillumination (Bio-Rad). Positive control (+Control) used 2 µl of gDNA from a local Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate. Non template control (NTC) consisting of 25 µl PCR mix only, water control 2 µl molecular grade water in place of gDNA.
