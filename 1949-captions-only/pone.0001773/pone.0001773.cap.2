                Figure 2.  2 % agarose gel, PCR of gDNA extracted from a C. jejuni isolate using both PCR and sequencing oligonucleotide primers for C.jejuni MLST genes 1 to 7.2 µl extracted gDNA used in 25 µl PCR reaction with 35×PCR cycles. 3 µl loaded on gel. Image is reverse colour under UV tranillumination (Bio-Rad). NTC = Non-template control, 3 µl of each individual reaction combined and 21 µl loaded on gel.
