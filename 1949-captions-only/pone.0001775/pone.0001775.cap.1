                Figure 1. Schematic view of haptic guidances: (a) Haptic guidance in position (HGP); the force felt by the user at time t is proportional to displacement between the current user position and the theoretical position on the model trajectory; (b) Haptic guidance in force (HGF); the force felt by the user at time t is the same as the force existing for the theoretical trajectory at the same time.
