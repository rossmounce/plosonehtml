<h5>Pre-test and post tests.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec4.p1"></a><p>Participants were assessed before and after the training sessions in order to measure the visuo-manual tracking of letters. Participants were asked to trace with their right hand visually presented letters with the stylus as accurately and as promptly as possible. No feedback was given by the experimenter. Each participant executed five trials for each letter in pseudo random order (two identical consecutive letters never occurred). In total, there were therefore 20 trials in the pre and post-tests.</p>

<h5>Movement analysis.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.p1"></a><p>Three main criteria were used to evaluate the movement: Number of velocity peaks, mean velocity and shape matching score. The positions and time stamps of each trial were recorded and pre-processed to compute these measures. The PHANToM device allowed us to record the position of the tool tip at about 1 KHz, which resulted in over sampling. To avoid long computation time and due to the frequency range of information, data could be reasonably sampled at 200Hz. This is equivalent to applying a low-pass filter to avoid high frequency noise due to hardware imprecision in time sampling.</p>

<h4>1. Number of Velocity Peaks</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec1.p1"></a><p>The number of velocity peaks is a criterion to estimate the fluidity of the movement. A small number of velocity peaks, with no regression of the shape quality (shape matching criterion) indicates a “good” fluidity. To compute these peaks, the velocity was low-pass filtered using a 6-order Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency = 50Hz). Attention was paid to avoid distortions. Then, we computed the acceleration from these filtered data and counted the sign inversions for the acceleration. This value gave us the number of velocity peaks.</p>


<h4>2. Mean Velocity</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec2.p1"></a><p>The mean velocity also is a criterion to estimate the fluidity of the movement. A high mean velocity, with no regression of the shape quality (shape matching criterion), indicates a good fluidity of handwriting production.</p>


<h4>3. Shape matching</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec5.sec3.p1"></a><p>Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm <a href="#pone.0001775-Morris1">[13]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001775-Niels1">[16]</a> computes a cost corresponding to a match between a reference trajectory and a subject recall trajectory. DTW constructs a global cost matrix by aligning the two temporal series. Then, a minimal path through the matrix is determined and the final value of this minimal path provides a representative cost for the warping of the two trajectories, <em>i.e.</em> the similarity between the two shapes. This algorithm was implemented for each axis (X and Y of the unit table) separately. The cost function in this case was the Euclidean distance between two points. This criterion gives a score of shape matching: A low score means a good match in shape.</p>


<h5>Training Sessions.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.p1"></a><p>Each subjects participated in three training sessions (Haptic guidance in position-HGP, haptic guidance in force–HGF, and no haptic guidance–NHG). The order was given by a Latin-square plan. Participants were asked to move a stylus with their right hand to follow a visually presented trajectory. There were 20 test trials (5 trials×4 letters) in each training session.</p>

<h4>1. Haptic Guidance in Position (HGP)</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec1.p1"></a><p>Position Proportional-Derivative control is well known in automatism. It consists in minimising the trajectory error during the training. This type of control can be thought of as a spring, attached to the trajectory points, pulling the stylus' tip to the next point (<a href="#pone-0001775-g001">Figure 1.a</a>). The proportional and derivative gains were derived from <a href="#pone.0001775-Srimathveeravalli1">[12]</a> and experimentally tuned (with pilot studies) to 0.4 N/mm and 0.2 Ns/mm.</p>


<h4>2. Haptic Guidance in Force (HGF)</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec2.p1"></a><p>According to the hypothesis proposed by Srimathveeravalli <em>et al.</em> <a href="#pone.0001775-Srimathveeravalli1">[12]</a>, similar force profiles lead to similar trajectories (<a href="#pone-0001775-g001">Figure 1.b</a>). The handwriting task has been modelled as a force needed to move a mass on a surface with a constant friction value. To compute the forces from computer generated trajectories, a simple lumped model, described in previous studies <a href="#pone.0001775-Srimathveeravalli1">[12]</a>, was used. This model is described in Equation (1).<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001775.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span><br>where <em>F</em> is the force, <em>m</em> is the mass of the system (hand+stylus), <em>a</em> is the acceleration, <em>c</em> is the damping coefficient and <em>k</em> is the spring constant. According to this simple model, we were able to compute the force profile for the previously generated trajectories. The mass, the damping coefficient and the spring constant used for the method were theoretically estimated and were set equal to 0.1 Kg, 0.5 Ns/mm and 0.1 Ns/mm respectively. This force profile was then used as a reference for a proportional derivative control with visual tracking. Even if visual matching errors could occur during the movement, the haptic sensations felt by the user would be similar to what the expert felt during his interaction with the model. The proportional and derivative gains used were theoretically estimated and were set to 0.5N/mm and 0.1Ns/mm respectively.</p>


<h4>3. Control session without haptic guidance (NHG)</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.sec6.sec3.p1"></a><p>To replicate learning through observation and manual repetition, no haptic assistance was provided to the participants during the training session. This task was similar to pre and post tests in which no haptic guidance was added.</p>




<h4>Experiment 2: Untrained ellipses</h4>
<h5>Participants.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Participants were 24 right-handed adults, with no significant language, motor or neurological dysfunction. They were students from University in Grenoble and their age ranged from 18 to 28 years. The present study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It was conducted with the understanding and the written consent of each participant which was obtained and was approved by the local ethic committee.</p>

<h5>Experimental Setup.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>The experimental setup was the same as in Experiment 1.</p>

<h5>Pre-test and post tests.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>Participants were assessed before and after the training sessions in order to measure the visuo-manual tracking of letters. Participants were asked to trace with their right hand visually presented ellipses with the stylus as accurately and as promptly as possible. No feedback was given by the experimenter. Each participant followed 18 ellipses presented in pseudo random order. In total, there were therefore 18 trials in the pre test and 18 trials in the post-test.</p>

<h5>Characteristics of test Trajectories.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>In the pre and post tests, three target trajectories were derived from a base ellipse. Contrary to the Record-and-playback strategy <a href="#pone.0001775-Srimathveeravalli1">[12]</a>, where the base trajectories were recorded from a teacher, we have designed elliptical paths by controlling each parameter (size, velocity profile, number of points...). The shape of each ellipse varied from 6 to 2 cm in width and in height. The generation of these trajectories was made by a Scilab™ (<a href="http://www.scilab.org">www.scilab.org</a>) routine. Stimuli used for this experiment were composed of 1000 points (X,Y). Their velocity profiles followed the two-third power law <a href="#pone.0001775-Viviani2">[10]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001775-Lacquaniti1">[11]</a>, (<em>i.e.</em>, velocity V is proportional to the radius of curvature r of the trajectory: v = k * r<sup>−1/3</sup>; equivalent to angular velocity A is proportional to the curvature c of the trajectory: A = k * c<sup>2/3</sup>). Our generated trajectories were in adequacy with a trained-level movement skill. The untrained tested trajectories are shown (red curves) in <a href="#pone-0001775-g004">Figure 4</a>.</p>
