<h5>Movement analysis.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Three main criteria (number of velocity peaks, mean velocity and Shape matching) used to analyse the movements were the same as in Experiment 1.</p>

<h5>Training Sessions.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>Three training sessions-HGP, HGF and NHG-were proposed to each participants (the order was given by a Latin-square plan). There were 24 test trials in each training session. The trajectories used during the pre and post test were never encountered during the training sessions. This was done to provide variability during the training session. Ellipses used in training were generated using the same procedure as trajectories used in tests (cf. ยง Characteristics of Test Trajectories). Eighteen ellipses have been chosen around the three tested ones (see <a href="#pone-0001775-g004">Figure 4</a>). They appeared randomly during the training session. In total, each participant performed 72 trials. The three haptic guidance modes and parameters were similar to those found in Experiment 1 except for HGP, where the proportional and derivative gains were experimentally tuned to 0.6 N/mm and 0.2 Ns/mm for smoother sensations.</p>

<h4>Experiment 1: Japanese and Arabic letters</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Preliminary analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the order of training sessions had no effect and did not interact with any other factors (all p&gt;.25). Then, for each criterion, ANOVA was performed with test (pre and post tests), and letter (L1: Arabic Letter 1, L2: Arabic Letter 2, L3: Japanese-inspired Letter 3 or L4: Japanese-inspired Letter 4) as within factors and training mode (HGF, HGP or NHG) as independent factors.
