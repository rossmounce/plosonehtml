                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the wild-type, ΔFHA, ΔRF and ΔCys forms of the CHFR protein tagged with HA, and expression analysis of these proteins in a colon cancer-derived cell line that lacks endogenous CHFR mRNA.(A) The predicted protein structures of the wild-type, ΔFHA, ΔRF and ΔCys CHFR proteins. N and C indicate the amino and carboxyl terminus, respectively. FHA, forkhead associated domain; RF, ring finger domain; Cys, cysteine rich domain; HA-tag, hemagglutinin protein tag. (B) The detection of the wild-type, ΔFHA, ΔRF and ΔCys forms of CHFR proteins transiently expressed in HCT116 cells by western blotting with anti-HA antibodies (upper panel). Cells were transfected with HA-tagged empty vector (lane 1); wild-type CHFR (lane 2); ΔFHA (lane 3); ΔRF (lane 4); or ΔCys (lane 5). Tubulin was also detected as a loading control (lower panel). (C) Endogenous CHFR mRNA expression levels detected by real-time PCR in the indicated pancreatic- and colon cancer-derived cell lines. The relative levels of CHFR mRNA shown are normalized to beta-actin mRNA, the expression level of panc1 was set as 1.0, and the average values of duplicate experiments were calculated.
