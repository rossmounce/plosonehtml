Note that the wild-type CHFR, ΔRF and ΔCys retroviruses suppressed the cell growth of the host cells and this was partially restored in the ΔFHA expressing cells. There were no differences, however, between any of these transfected cells in terms of their morphology. (B) Colony formation assay of HCT116 cells after retroviral infection with the same CHFR constructs as in (A). (C) Statistical evaluation of the colony formation assay results for HCT116, RKO and HeLa cells expressing the indicated exogenous proteins. *p&lt;0.01, **p&lt;0.05. (D) Measurements of the recombinant retrovirus copy number in the supernatants of PT67 producer cells by real time PCR. (E) The detection of stably expressed wild-type, ΔFHA, a ΔRF and ΔCys CHFR protein in HCT116 and RKO cells following infection with the corresponding recombinant retroviruses. Total cellular protein extracts were obtained at the fourth passage. The level of introduced proteins in the cells that infected with empty vector (lane 1); wild-type CHFR (lane 2); ΔFHA (lane 3); ΔRF (lane 4); or ΔCys (lane 5).</p>
