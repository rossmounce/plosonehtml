The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. (Middle panel) Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of proteins with anti-HA antibodies. The proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. (Right panel) The detection of FLAG-reactive proteins following immunoprecipitation by HA antibodies. Ubiquitinated proteins are evident by the presence of high molecular weight bands in lanes 2 and 3, but not in lanes 1, 4 and 5. Cells were cotransfected with FLAG tagged ubiquitin expression (FLAG-Ubi) vector and either empty vector (lane 1); wild-type CHFR (lane 2); ΔFHA (lane 3); ΔRF (lane 4); or ΔCys (lane 5).</p>
