                Figure 4.  Intracellular localization of wild-type and mutant forms of CHFR proteins detected by fluorescence immunostaining.The localization of the wild-type or mutant forms of the CHFR protein was assessed by the immunoreactivity of an anti-HA antibody (green signal). PML nuclear foci were detected with an anti-PML antibody (red signal). The nuclei of HCT116 cells were counterstained with Hoechst (blue). Merged pictures are shown to highlight the signal overlap between the Hoechst and anti-HA staining.
