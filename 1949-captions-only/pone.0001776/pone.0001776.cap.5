                Figure 5.  Checkpoint assay of the wild type and mutant forms of the CHFR protein.(A) Schematic representation of the bicistronic vectors used to express the indicated CHFR products. (B) Validation of the positive correlation between the anti-HA antibody immunoreactivity and EGFP expression profiles. Cells that were positive for both are denoted by arrows. Cells that were positive for the anti-HA antibody, but not for EGFP, are highlighted by an asterisk. (C) Mitotic checkpoint analysis of HCT116 cells after the introduction of an empty vector, wild-type-EGFP, ΔFHA-EGFP, ΔRF-EGFP or ΔCys-EGFP. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p&lt;0.05).
