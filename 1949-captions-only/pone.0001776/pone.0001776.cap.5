(B) Validation of the positive correlation between the anti-HA antibody immunoreactivity and EGFP expression profiles. Cells that were positive for both are denoted by arrows. Cells that were positive for the anti-HA antibody, but not for EGFP, are highlighted by an asterisk. (C) Mitotic checkpoint analysis of HCT116 cells after the introduction of an empty vector, wild-type-EGFP, ΔFHA-EGFP, ΔRF-EGFP or ΔCys-EGFP. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p&lt;0.05).</p>
