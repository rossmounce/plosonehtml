The red line indicates its derivative, the oxygen consumption by the sample in the respiration medium. The responses to the addition of malate (5 mM), ADP (2 mM), glutamate (10 mM), succinate (10 mM), and oligomycin (1 Âµg/ml) can be seen. After succinate addition, state 3 was achieved. After oligomycin addition, state 4 was achieved.</p>
