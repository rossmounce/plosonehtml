Cells detected with probe EUBMIX only are green (A, B, C and D). Cells detected with both EUBMIX and PAO651 probes (A, B and C) and cells detected with both EUBMIX and ALF1b probes (D) are yellow-orange. Highlighted area in pane d corresponds to magnified region hybridised only with the ALF1b probe in the top right hand corner. Images taken under the different excitation wavelengths for CY3 and FITC were combined using Adobe Photoshop. Cells were observed under <em>x</em> 630 magnification, bars = 10 Âµm.</p>
