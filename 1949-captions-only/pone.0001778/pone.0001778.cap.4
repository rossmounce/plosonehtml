                Figure 4.  Proposed metabolic model for the (A) anaerobic and (B) aerobic phase of EBPR inferred from the proteomic data.Identified proteins catalysing individual reactions are highlighted in green [best MASCOT metagenomic sequence match located on a scaffold source binned as “A. phosphatis”, i.e. strong association with the “A. phosphatis” composite genome], orange [best MASCOT sequence match located on a scaffold source binned as “other Accumulibacter” for which a strong BLAST hit (&gt;90 % identity) was obtained with a sequence binned as “A. phosphatis”, i.e. medium strong association with the “A. phosphatis” composite genome], and red [best MASCOT sequence match located on a scaffold source binned as “other Accumulibacter” for which a weak BLAST hit (&lt;90 % identity) was obtained with a sequence binned as “A. phosphatis”, i.e. weak association with the “A. phosphatis” composite genome]. Not all intermediate metabolites are shown.
