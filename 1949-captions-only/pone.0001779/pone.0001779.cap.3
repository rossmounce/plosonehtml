Five adults (two in the CPG−DDS group, two in the +artesunate 1 mg/kg group and one in the +artesunate 2 mg/kg group) and 14 children (three from the CPG−DDS group, and five, three and three from the +artesunate 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively) were excluded from the mean time to PC50 analysis due to poor model fit. Seven adults (five in the CPG−DDS group, and one each in the +artesunate 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg groups) and five children (two from the CPG−DDS group, two from the +artesunate 1 mg/kg and one from the +artesunate 2 mg/kg group) were excluded from the mean time to PC99 analysis due to poor model fit.</p>
