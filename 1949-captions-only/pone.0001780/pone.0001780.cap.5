                Figure 5.  Comparison of the two innominates from Palau to that of a modern adult female of average stature (c162 cm).From left to right â€“ modern human pelvis (top is from the right, bottom is from the left), B:OR-15:18-009 and B:OR-15:18-087. Top: posterolateral view; bottom: lateral view. Maximum iliac breadth can be calculated for both. Calcium carbonate obscures part of the acetabulum of B:OR-15:18-009. Scale bar 1 cm.
