Interorbital breadth (mm) versus orbital breadth (mm) in Australasians.Filled circles: Palauan specimens; filled squares: sample means for recent human males; open squares: sample means for recent human females; open triangle; sample mean for Andamanese pygmy females; dotted line: orbital breadth value for LB1 (from supplemental data in [1]). Least squares regression line (y = 0.0624x+18.913, r = 0.1044) based on recent human sample means only. Recent human data representing Australian, Melanesian, Polynesian, western Pacific and Far Eastern populations from WW Howells [33].
