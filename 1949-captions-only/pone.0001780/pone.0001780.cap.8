                Figure 8.  Frontal and lateral-oblique views of B:OR-15:18-001 (Right, top and bottom) and B:OR-14:8-005 (Left, top and bottom), illustrating two adult specimens with inflated glabellae and thickened lateral superciliary arches.In B:OR-15:18-005 the inflated glabellar region gives rise to curved and laterally extending projections that are continuous with thickened lateral superciliary arches, creating a moderately projecting, double curved supraorbital torus. Specimen B:OR-14:8-001 has an inflated glabellar area and thickened superciliary arches continuing laterally. However, in this specimen the inflated glabellar region is not continuous with the superciliary arches and does not give the appearance of continuous brow ridges.
