                Figure 9.  Occlusal and lateral views of B:OR-14:8-122 (top left and top middle) and B:OR-14:8-771 (bottom left and right), illustrating two adult specimens with reduced chins in the Palauan sample.B:OR-14:8-122 lacks a vertical keel as well as the distended inferior margin, and consequently lacks the T-shaped mental trigone and associated mental fossae characteristic of modern human chins. The cross section (top right) - approximately through the symphysis - clearly shows the reduction of the chin in this individual. Although part of the symphyseal region of B:OR-14:8-771 is missing, the lack of swelling of the inferior margin at the level of the canine suggests a highly reduced mental eminence. B:OR-14:8-771 also exhibits a congenitally absent third molar, a feature also common in the Palauan sample.
