Numbers shown in subscript for each residue represent total number of sequences analyzed (in the consensus sequence) and frequencies in viruses (other residues) from drug-naïve (left) and NRTI-treated (right) subjects. Residues which differed significantly (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05) in frequency between naïve and treated patients, as well as the corresponding changed residues, are boxed in gray.</p>
