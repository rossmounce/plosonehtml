                Figure 3.  Comprehensive analysis of amino acid sequence variation in HIV-1 RT RNase H C-terminal domains showing polymorphic variations between subtype B viruses from drug-naïve and NRTI-treated subjects.Residues are displayed as the subtype B consensus; other residues found among sequences analyzed are shown below each consensus residue. Numbers shown in subscript for each residue represent total number of sequences analyzed (in the consensus sequence) and frequencies in viruses (other residues) from drug-naïve (left) and NRTI-treated (right) subjects. Residues which differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) in frequency between naïve and treated patients, as well as the corresponding changed residues, are boxed in gray.
