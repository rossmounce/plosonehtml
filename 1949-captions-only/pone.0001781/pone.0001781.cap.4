Subtype B-related substitutions with statistical significance are shown in red. Amino acid residues with asterisks denote those which interact with nucleic acid. Additional residues which interact with nucleic acid, but not found to be selected by treatment in our analysis, are shown in green. Amino acid residues depicted in orange in panel (<em>B</em>) represent the RNase H catalytic site.</p>
