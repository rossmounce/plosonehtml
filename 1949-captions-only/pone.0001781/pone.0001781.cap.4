                Figure 4.  Three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 RT connection (A) and RNase H (B) domains in contact with template viral DNA showing codons significantly associated with NRTI treatment.The atomic coordinates of HIV-1 RT isolate BH10 (entry 1HYS of the Brookhanven Protein Data Bank) was downloaded into the visualization software ViewerLite v. 5.0 and then manually colored. Subtype B-related substitutions with statistical significance are shown in red. Amino acid residues with asterisks denote those which interact with nucleic acid. Additional residues which interact with nucleic acid, but not found to be selected by treatment in our analysis, are shown in green. Amino acid residues depicted in orange in panel (B) represent the RNase H catalytic site.
