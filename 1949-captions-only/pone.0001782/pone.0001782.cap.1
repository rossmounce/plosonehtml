MEK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot with the corresponding anti-phospho-specific MEK antibodies (upper panel), and then reblotted with an anti-MEK antibody (lower panel). (A) Western blot for E1 cells. (B) Western blot for E1/4 cells. Data show a representative figure of three independent experiments. Quantified data are available in <a href="#pone.0001782.s002">Table S1</a> (no. 3).</p>
