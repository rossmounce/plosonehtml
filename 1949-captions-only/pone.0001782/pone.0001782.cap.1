                Figure 1.  The effect of MEK inhibitor U0126 on MEK phosphorylation in E1 and E1/4 cells.Serum-starved E1 and E1/4 cells were incubated with 10 nM EGF for the indicated time period with or without pretreatment of 200 nM U0126. MEK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot with the corresponding anti-phospho-specific MEK antibodies (upper panel), and then reblotted with an anti-MEK antibody (lower panel). (A) Western blot for E1 cells. (B) Western blot for E1/4 cells. Data show a representative figure of three independent experiments. Quantified data are available in Table S1 (no. 3).
