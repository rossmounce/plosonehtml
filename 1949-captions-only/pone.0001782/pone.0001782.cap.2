The output is the doubly phosphorylated ERK, ERKPP. Steps 1–11 are the fixed part of the cascade, whereas steps 12–19 are possible cross-talk/feedback connections to be determined. The selected pathways were steps 14 and 16 (red arrows). Numbers shown correspond to the kinetic equations in <a href="#pone.0001782.s006">Table S5</a>.</p>
