                Figure 2.  Topological model of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in CHO cells.The inputs of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade are the activated forms of Ras and Rap1, Ras-GTP and Rap1-GTP. The output is the doubly phosphorylated ERK, ERKPP. Steps 1–11 are the fixed part of the cascade, whereas steps 12–19 are possible cross-talk/feedback connections to be determined. The selected pathways were steps 14 and 16 (red arrows). Numbers shown correspond to the kinetic equations in Table S5.
