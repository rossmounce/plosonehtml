                Figure 3.  The 29 pathway structures that possess positive feedback by ERK to Raf.The 29 pathway structures that possess positive feedback by ERK to Raf isoforms can be classified into three types of regulation depending on which isoform is positively regulated: B-Raf (nos. 1–10), Raf-1 (nos. 11–20), or both B-Raf and Raf-1 (nos. 21–29). The symbol for MEK is omitted here for clarity.
