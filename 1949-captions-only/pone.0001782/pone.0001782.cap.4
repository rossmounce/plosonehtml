                Figure 4.  Time courses of Ras- and Rap1-GTPs.The input signal generator reproduced the time-course data of Ras- and Rap1-GTPs with 10 nM EGF. (A) Normalized time-course data of Ras-GTP. (B) Normalized time-course data of Rap1-GTP. The graphs represent the normalized activity of Ras- and Rap-1 GTPs in which the data are divided by the value for E1/4 cells at 1 min. Blue and red lines correspond to simulation data for E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. The filled squares and circles correspond to experimental data concerning E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively.
