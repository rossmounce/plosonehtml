                Figure 5.  The time-course simulation and steady-state responses of the number 4 structure.(A) The simulation results are shown with the corresponding experimental data. Filled squares and circles indicate experimental data relating to E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. Blue and red lines indicate the simulation data relating to E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. The x-axis represents time (min) and the y-axis activation (% of total protein). In (B) and (C) the steady-state responses of ERK and B-Raf activity for the selected pathway structure are shown. The input signal levels of Ras- and Rap1-GTPs to the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade characterized by the number 4 structure were changed in the range 0.1 to 2.0. The simulation for each input level was then ran for 100,000 sec to approximate the steady-state values where the activity of all molecules hardly moved at about the termination time of the simulation. (B) 3-D graph of steady-state ERK activity. (C) 3-D graph of steady-state B-Raf activity. The colors of the graphs indicate activation (% of total protein). Open and filled circles correspond to the activation level induced by the input level equivalent to the peak level of Ras-GTP in E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. Similarly, open and filled squares correspond to the activation level induced by the input level equivalent to the activity level 30 min following EGF stimulation of Ras-GTP in E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively.
