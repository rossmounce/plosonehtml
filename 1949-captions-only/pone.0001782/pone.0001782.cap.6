                Figure 6.  Detailed upstream model of EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated Ras activation.The pathways in the left and right boxes are mediated by the EGFR homodimer and the EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer, respectively. Ras activation is regulated by these two pathways via steps 12 and 22. When performing parameter estimation of total concentrations and kinetic parameters for the E1/4 cells, all parameters were estimated. On the other hand, the concentration of the ErbB4 receptors was set to zero for E1 cells, while other unknown parameters were considered to be identical as those for the E1/4 cells. Numbers shown correspond to the kinetic equations in Table S7.
