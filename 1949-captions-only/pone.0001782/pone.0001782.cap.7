                Figure 7.  Time-course activity of signaling molecules with 10 nM EGF in ErbB signaling.The responses of the signaling molecules during 30 min are plotted with the corresponding experimental data listed in Table 1 (nos. 4 and 8â€“10). (A) Phosphorylated EGFR in E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. (B) Phosphorylated ErbB4 receptor in E1/4 cells. (C) Phosphorylated Shc in E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. (D) Ras-GTP in E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. Blue and red lines indicate simulation data for E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively, and filled squares and circles indicate experimental data E1 and E1/4 cells, respectively. Graphs represent activity (% of total protein).
