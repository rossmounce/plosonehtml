                Figure 8.  Effect of ErbB4 receptor concentration on E11P_ShcP_GS and E14P_ShcP_GS.The two complexes E11P_ShcP_GS and E14P_ShcP_GS in Figure 6 regulate Ras activity. The solid and dashed lines represent the change in peak activity (%) of E14P_ShcP_GS and E11P_ShcP_GS, respectively, following 10 nM EGF treatment and depending on the concentration of ErbB4 receptors in the detailed upstream model, respectively. The 0% ErbB4 receptor concentration (E4 = 0) is regarded as representing E1 cells, while the 100% level (E4 = 1.0) represents E1/4 cells.
