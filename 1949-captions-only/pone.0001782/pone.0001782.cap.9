Figures demonstrate time-course patterns of signaling molecules in relation to the abundance of the ErbB4 receptor in silico. (A) and (C) The signaling molecules E11P_ShcP and E11P_ShcP_GS in EGFR homodimer-mediated pathways, respectively. (B) and (D) The signaling molecules E14P_ShcP and E14P_ShcP_GS in EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated pathways, respectively. The colors of the graphs indicate activity (% of total protein).</p>
