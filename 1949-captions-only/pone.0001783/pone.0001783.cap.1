The RT-PCR for the untranslated region of <em>Pax4</em> (PAX4 UTR) only detects endogenous expression whereas the RT-PCR for CDS picks up both endogenous and transgene expression. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was used as positive control and PCR without cDNA was used as negative control (Neg). <em>ACTB</em> (β-actin) was used as loading control in all samples. All five clones of H7.Px4 cells behaved similarly. (B) Western blot analysis in undifferentiated and late stage differentiated (21 days) EBs of H7 and Pax4-expressing H7 cells. β-actin was used as loading control in all samples. (C) Undifferentiated H7.Px4 cells expressed high level of <em>Oct4</em> indistinguishable from that in untransfected H7 cells. (D, E) Undifferentiated H7.Px4 cells also displayed a morphology characteristic of undifferentiated HESC. (F–K) As shown by immunocytochemistry, H7.Px4 HESC express human Pax4 protein (<em>green</em>), stage specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) (<em>red</em>) and TRA-1-60 (J). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (<em>blue</em>). Note the turquoise colour of the nuclei resulting from the overlay of Pax4 and DAPI staining. Scale bars, 50 µm. Human Pax4 protein is not expressed by untransfected H7 HESC (K). All data are typical of at least 2 experiments on control and from at least 3 independent H7.Px4 clones.</p>
