                Figure 2.  The effect of Pax4 expression upon EB differentiation of HESC.(A) RT-PCR analysis of gene expression in EBs produced from untransfected H7 cells and from two independent clones transfected with Pax4 during a 16 day in vitro differentiation. (B) Q-PCR analysis of Ins and Pdx1 expression in EBs produced from untransfected H7 and H7.Px4 cells. These experiments were performed on two independent H7.Px4 clones and control data came from 3 independent experiments using untransfected H7 cells. Data were collected on Day 0 and at 7 (Early), 14 (Mid) and 21 (Late) days following EB formation. Gene expression levels were calculated as 2−ΔΔCt values, relative to day 7 (Early) samples. Error bars represent standard deviation, and an asterisk denotes p&lt;0.05. (C) Differentiation of H7.Px4 EBs was also associated with the up-regulated expression of gene encoding enzyme prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3).
