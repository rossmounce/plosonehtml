(B) Q-PCR analysis of <em>Ins</em> and <em>Pdx1</em> expression in EBs produced from untransfected H7 and H7.Px4 cells. These experiments were performed on two independent H7.Px4 clones and control data came from 3 independent experiments using untransfected H7 cells. Data were collected on Day 0 and at 7 (Early), 14 (Mid) and 21 (Late) days following EB formation. Gene expression levels were calculated as 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> values, relative to day 7 (Early) samples. Error bars represent standard deviation, and an asterisk denotes p&lt;0.05. (C) Differentiation of H7.Px4 EBs was also associated with the up-regulated expression of gene encoding enzyme prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3).</p>
