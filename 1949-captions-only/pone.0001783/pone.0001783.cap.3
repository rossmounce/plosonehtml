Note that the actions of ATP are associated with a declining functional capacity in H7.Px4 (n = 18–29 EBs), but not untransfected H7 cells (n = 44–52 EBs). (B) Typical VGCC-mediated responses in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in H7 and H7.Px4 cells, respectively. (C) A summary of <em>CACNA1A</em>, <em>CACNA1C</em> and <em>CACNA1D</em> gene expression analyzed by Q-PCR in H7 and H7.Px4 cells. Data were obtained from n = 3 experiments on H7 controls and n = 3 experiments on H7.Px4 EBs from 1 H7.Px4 clone; similar trends were observed in another H7.Px4 clone (data not illustrated). (D) Production of C-peptide in early and late stage differentiating EBs from H7 and H7.Px4 cells. With the exception of Panel (C) all data were obtained from 3 independent experiments using untransfected H7 EBs and 3 independent H7.Px4 clones.
