                Figure 3.  The expression and function of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in H7 cells transfected with Pax4.(A) Selective enhancement and induction of functional responses in H7.Px4 EBs (n = 27–34 EBs) compared to untransfected H7 cells (n = 31–50 EBs). Note that the actions of ATP are associated with a declining functional capacity in H7.Px4 (n = 18–29 EBs), but not untransfected H7 cells (n = 44–52 EBs). (B) Typical VGCC-mediated responses in [Ca2+]i in H7 and H7.Px4 cells, respectively. (C) A summary of CACNA1A, CACNA1C and CACNA1D gene expression analyzed by Q-PCR in H7 and H7.Px4 cells. Data were obtained from n = 3 experiments on H7 controls and n = 3 experiments on H7.Px4 EBs from 1 H7.Px4 clone; similar trends were observed in another H7.Px4 clone (data not illustrated). (D) Production of C-peptide in early and late stage differentiating EBs from H7 and H7.Px4 cells. With the exception of Panel (C) all data were obtained from 3 independent experiments using untransfected H7 EBs and 3 independent H7.Px4 clones. Asterisk indicates p&lt;0.05, double asterisk indicates p&lt;0.01 and triple asterisk indicates p&lt;0.001.
