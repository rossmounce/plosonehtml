                Figure 4.  Isolation of putative β-cells based on high zinc content using a vital dye, Newport Green (NG).(A) Confocal microscopic examination of NG staining in H7 and H7.Px4 EB-derived cells. Note the quasi-homogeneous fluorescence of NG-labeled zinc-positive cells with cytoplasmic dots. (B) Isolation of NG+ve (top 10%) and NG-ve (bottom 10%) H7.Px4 cells by FACS. The selected cells were collected and analyzed by Q-PCR for the expression of Ins, Pdx1 and Oct4. (C) Gene expression levels in the sorted NG+ve, NG-ve and the unsorted cells are represented as ΔCt values (± standard deviation) relative to ACTB for all samples. Note that an increase in ΔCt of 1.0 represents 2-fold decrease in mRNA level. The ΔCt value was determined by subtracting the average housekeeping (ACTB) Ct value from the average target genes (Pdx1, Ins and Oct4) Ct values. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the difference, as calculated from the standard deviation of the target and ACTB values.
