Note the quasi-homogeneous fluorescence of NG-labeled zinc-positive cells with cytoplasmic dots. (B) Isolation of NG+ve (top 10%) and NG-ve (bottom 10%) H7.Px4 cells by FACS. The selected cells were collected and analyzed by Q-PCR for the expression of <em>Ins</em>, <em>Pdx1</em> and <em>Oct4</em>. (C) Gene expression levels in the sorted NG+ve, NG-ve and the unsorted cells are represented as ΔCt values (± standard deviation) relative to <em>ACTB</em> for all samples. Note that an increase in ΔCt of 1.0 represents 2-fold decrease in mRNA level. The ΔCt value was determined by subtracting the average housekeeping (<em>ACTB</em>) Ct value from the average target genes (<em>Pdx1</em>, <em>Ins</em> and <em>Oct4</em>) Ct values. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the difference, as calculated from the standard deviation of the target and <em>ACTB</em> values.</p>
