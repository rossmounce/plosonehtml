(A) shows immunocytochemistry for anti-human Proinsulin antibody (red) with nuclei counterstained with DAPI. Proinsulin-positive reaction is seen scattered in cytoplasm shown in (A) and in a higher magnification in (B) (arrows). Also shown is a Proinsulin-negative cell (arrowhead). Scale bars, 50 µm. (C) and (D) summarize C-peptide content and release in response to 100 µM tolbutamide; the fraction released was 79.92±10.8% from three independent experiments using two H7.Px4 clones. Triple asterisk indicates p&lt;0.001.</p>
