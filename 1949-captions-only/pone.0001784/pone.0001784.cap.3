BDNF protein levels were measured by ELISA and Sprouty2 proteins levels were estimated by Western blot analysis. mRNA levels of both BDNF and Sprouty2 were estimated by qRT-PCR analysis. Open bars represent haloperidol-treated rats whereas filled bars represent olanzapine-treated rats. Values are expressed as fold change relative to vehicle-treated rats. *p&lt;0.05, n = 10â€“12 per group.</p>
