The least significant difference (LSD) at the 0.05 confidence level for the RGR values were as follows: Mir1-CP – 0.31, Bt-CryIIA – 0.44, sub-lethal doses of Bt-CryIIA and Mir1-CP combined – 0.57. Numbers (mean±SD) in the histogram bars are the average percentage mortality for each treatment. The least significant difference (LSD) at the 0.05 confidence level for mortality were as follows: Mir1-CP – 8.5, Bt-CryIIA – 7.4, sub-lethal doses of Bt-CryIIA and Mir1-CP combined – 15.83. Results are based on four independent bioassays. Concentrations are given as parts per million (ppm).</p>
