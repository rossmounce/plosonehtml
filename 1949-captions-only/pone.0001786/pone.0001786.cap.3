The least significant difference (LSD) at the 0.05 confidence level for the RGR values were as follows: Mir1-CP – 0.14, Bt-CryIIA – 0.37, sub-lethal doses of Bt-CryIIA and Mir1-CP, combined – 0.46. Numbers (mean±SD) in the histogram bars are the average percentage mortality for each treatment. The least significant difference (LSD) at the 0.05 confidence level for mortality were as follows: Mir1-CP – 6.71, Bt-CryIIA – 8.42, sub-lethal doses of Bt-CryIIA and Mir1-CP, combined – 10.01. Results are based on four independent bioassays. Concentrations are given as parts per million (ppm).</p>
