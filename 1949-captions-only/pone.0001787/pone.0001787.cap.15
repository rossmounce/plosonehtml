                Figure 15.  NJ tree of K2P for three species of Odontomachus in Madagascar and Africa (all specimens with &gt;500 bp).Deep divergences evident between coquereli, troglodytes, and simillimus are evident. Deep divergences within O. coquereli are apparent. The rightmost column of colors differentiate which biogeographical groupings of Wilm√© et al [29] these populations fall. WCE-1 = Binara. WCE-10 = Manongarivo. WCE-2 = Mahavelona, Kalalao, Betampona, Mananara-Nord, Marojejy, Anjanaharibe. WRDW-a2 = Akirindro, Ambanitaza, Anjanaharibe.
