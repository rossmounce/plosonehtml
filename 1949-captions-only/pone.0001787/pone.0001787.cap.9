                Figure 9.  NJ tree of K2P for five species of Anochetus in Madagascar, Comoros and Aldabra (all specimens with &gt;500 bp).Deep divergences evident between madagascarensis, grandidieri, and goodmani are evident. Deep divergences within A. goodmani are evident (In this tree, A. boltoni falls within goodmani). The rightmost column of colors differentiate which biogeographical groupings of Wilm√© et al. [29] these populations fall. WCE-1 = Binara, Antsahabe. WCE-12 = Andavakoera, Ankarana. WCE-7 = Kirindy Mite. WRDW-B = Vazimba, Androngonibe, Andranopasazy.
