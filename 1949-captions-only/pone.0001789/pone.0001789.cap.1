(B) Fluorescence microscopic observation of cardiac sphere. Sphere is composed of DsRED<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocytes and GFP<sup>+</sup> Sk-34 cells. (C–F) Confocal laser microscopic analysis of cardiac sphere. Dot-like Connexin-43<sup>+</sup> reactions (gap-junctions) were located around GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (white arrows in E and F), as well as DsRED<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocytes (red arrows in E and F). Note that this sphere actively contracted spontaneously and synchronously (video available as <a href="#pone.0001789.s003">Movie S2</a>). There were no yellow (Red+Green) cells suggesting cellular fusion. Scale bars, 20 µm.</p>
