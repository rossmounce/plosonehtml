                Figure 1.  Co-culture of GFP-Tg mouse Sk-34 cells and DsRED-Tg mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes.(A) Typical cardiac spheres in co-culture on glass-slide chamber. (B) Fluorescence microscopic observation of cardiac sphere. Sphere is composed of DsRED+ cardiomyocytes and GFP+ Sk-34 cells. (C–F) Confocal laser microscopic analysis of cardiac sphere. Dot-like Connexin-43+ reactions (gap-junctions) were located around GFP+ cells (white arrows in E and F), as well as DsRED+ cardiomyocytes (red arrows in E and F). Note that this sphere actively contracted spontaneously and synchronously (video available as Movie S2). There were no yellow (Red+Green) cells suggesting cellular fusion. Scale bars, 20 µm.
