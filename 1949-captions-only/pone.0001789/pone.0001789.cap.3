Bar chart shows percentage of samples expressing target mRNA and total numbers are given in parentheses. Percentage of skeletal and smooth muscle, and two ion channel marker-expressing cells gradually increased following cellular divisions. However, cardiac and vascular-related makers did not change during clonal cell culture. M-cad, M-cadherin; Scn1b, sodium channel voltage gated type1-b; Cacnb1, calcium channel voltage-dependent beta-1 subunit; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; TEK, tyrosine kinase-endothelial.</p>
