                Figure 4.  Macroscopic and histological observation and FISH analysis at 4 weeks after therapeutic-bulk cell transplantation.(A) Macroscopic view of implanted GFP+ tissues under dissection microscope. GFP+ tissues located close to blood vessels (arrows). Scale bar, 500 µm. (B) Histological sections obtained from the region in (A). Left panel, low magnification; right panel, high magnification. Large numbers of GFP+ cells are distributed around blood vessels, and cardiac muscle-like cells having apparent striations were seen. Dotted lines indicate blood vessels. Scale bars, 100 µm. (C) FISH analysis for histological serial sections from the region in (B). Distribution of GFP+ cells (donor mouse derived) correspond to yellow reactions (mouse genomic DNA probe) among red reactions (host rat genomic DNA probe), thus suggesting that green cells were donor mouse derived. Dotted line indicates blood vessels. Scale bars, 100 µm.
