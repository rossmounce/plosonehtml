                Figure 5.  Histological characteristics at 4 weeks after therapeutic-bulk cell transplantation of freshly isolated Sk-34 cells.(A) Immunoelectron microscopic detection of implanted GFP+ cells. White squares (a and b) in panel A correspond to the respective insets. Intercalated disks including desmosomes (arrow heads) were clearly evident between GFP+ (having dork spots) and GFP+ and/or GFP+ and GFP− cells. GFP+ cells were mononucleated and exhibit typical cardiomyocyte features. N, nuclei. Scale bar, 2 µm. (B) Immunoelectron microscopic detection of gap-junctions and desmosomes (red arrows) between GFP+ and GFP− cells (white arrows). Black arrows, fascia adherentes. Scale bar, 2 µm. (C, D) Immunohistochemical detection of gap-junctions between GFP+ and GFP− cells (white arrowheads) and GFP+ and GFP+ cells (arrow) using connexin-43 (red reactions). Scale bar, 10 µm. (E) GFP+ endothelial cells in blood vessels were also evident (arrows). Scale bar, 2 µm.
