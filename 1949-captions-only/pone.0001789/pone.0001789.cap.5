White squares (a and b) in panel A correspond to the respective insets. Intercalated disks including desmosomes (arrow heads) were clearly evident between GFP<sup>+</sup> (having dork spots) and GFP<sup>+</sup> and/or GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>−</sup> cells. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were mononucleated and exhibit typical cardiomyocyte features. N, nuclei. Scale bar, 2 µm. (B) Immunoelectron microscopic detection of gap-junctions and desmosomes (red arrows) between GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>−</sup> cells (white arrows). Black arrows, fascia adherentes. Scale bar, 2 µm. (C, D) Immunohistochemical detection of gap-junctions between GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>−</sup> cells (white arrowheads) and GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (arrow) using connexin-43 (red reactions). Scale bar, 10 µm. (E) GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells in blood vessels were also evident (arrows). Scale bar, 2 µm.</p>
