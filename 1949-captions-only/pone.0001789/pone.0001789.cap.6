Donor-derived GFP<sup>+</sup> cells aggregated and filled in the MI zone, even at 2 weeks after transplantation. Squares in panel A correspond to panels B and C. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B and C) Formation of gap-junctions in border (arrowheads) and central (arrows) zones of MI. Elongated connexin-43<sup>+</sup> reactions (red) were observed in the border zones of MI, while spot reactions were seen in the central zone. Thus, formation of gap-junctions apparently begins in border zones and moves toward the central zone. Scale bars, 10 µm.</p>
