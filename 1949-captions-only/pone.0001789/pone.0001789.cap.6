                Figure 6.  Histological characteristics at 2 weeks after therapeutic-bulk cell transplantation.(A) Contribution to MI zone by transplanted freshly isolated Sk-34 cells. Donor-derived GFP+ cells aggregated and filled in the MI zone, even at 2 weeks after transplantation. Squares in panel A correspond to panels B and C. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B and C) Formation of gap-junctions in border (arrowheads) and central (arrows) zones of MI. Elongated connexin-43+ reactions (red) were observed in the border zones of MI, while spot reactions were seen in the central zone. Thus, formation of gap-junctions apparently begins in border zones and moves toward the central zone. Scale bars, 10 µm.
