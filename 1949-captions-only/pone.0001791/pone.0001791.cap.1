                Figure 1.  Venn diagram depicting the clones used for in silico normalization for the generation of the Gonad Uniclone Microarray.The number of adult and differentiating gonad-derived zebrafish sequences present in our Gonad Uniclone EST collection and their extent of overlap with gonad-derived public zebrafish ESTs listed in GenBank are shown. For details on sequence pre-processing and clustering, refer to the Methods section. In overlapping sections, the total number of clusters, prefaced by ‘C’, is followed in parentheses by the total number of ESTs contained by the clusters. The total number of singletons is prefaced by ‘S’.
