Images are arranged from top to bottom in order of decreasing <em>in situ</em> hybridization signal intensity. Microarray expression levels for each gene across the eight organs analyzed are indicated by the coloured expression profiles. (A: <em>zp2</em>, B: <em>btg4</em>, C: CO350808, D: <em>gez1</em>, E: CO350303, F: <em>gez2</em>, G: <em>sept4</em>, H: CO353006, I: <em>tekt1</em>, J: MGC75611; I, II, III: stage I, II and III oocytes; psc: primary spermatocytes, ssc: secondary spermatocytes; FB, FO, FK and FRB represent the brain, ovary, kidney and ‘rest-of-body’ from female zebrafish, while MB, MT, MK and MRB represent the brain, testis, kidney and ‘rest-of-body’ from male zebrafish.)</p>
