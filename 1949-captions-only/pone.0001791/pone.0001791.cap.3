                Figure 3.  Hierarchical clustering of expression profiles of five members of the septin gene family in zebrafish.Expression patterns of sept6, sept9 and sept8 appeared to be highly correlated to each other while sept4 and sept7 formed a separate cluster. sept4, sept6, sept9 and sept8 were most strongly expressed in either one or both gonads. sept7 had highest expression in the female ‘rest-of-body’ but strong expression was also observed in the testis.
