                Figure 4.  Hierarchical clustering of expression profiles for 6331 genes across eight different organs.Individual gene expression profiles are plotted horizontally against vertical columns of organ type. For each organ, profiles for the three biological replicates and each of their two technical replicates are displayed. Strongly expressed and weakly expressed genes with respect to the common reference are represented in red and green respectively. All organs showed a high level of correlation between biological and technical replicates. The gonads contained the highest number of strongly expressed transcripts. Many genes showed sexually dimorphic gene expression in the gonads and in other organs. Clustering showed correlation between expression profiles of different organs. Kidney targets clustered together with ‘rest-of-body’, while ovary and testis clustered with brain targets to form a distinct group. Refer to Fig. 2 for abbreviations.
