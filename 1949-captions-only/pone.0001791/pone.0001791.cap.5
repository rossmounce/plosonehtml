                Figure 5.  Real-time PCR analysis of selected genes which showed sexually dimorphic expression in the zebrafish brain.Normalized transcript levels in the female (FB) and male brain (MB) for genes mfge8 (A), wt1a (B), and cel (C) are shown. The real-time PCR revealed sexually dimorphic expression of these genes in the brain, thereby validating our array data.
