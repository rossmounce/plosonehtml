Arrows show immunopositive cells in contact with the epithelium of the epididymis. Note the presence of testicular macrophages within the peritubular wall bordering the seminiferous tubules of the testis (<a href="#pone-0001792-g001">Figure 1H</a>, arrow heads).Scale bars = 20 µm. (M): Quantification of HIV potential target cells (CD68+ and CD4+ stained positive cells) in the male reproductive organs of uninfected macaques. Stars indicate statistical difference between the number of CD68+ cells and CD4+ cells within an organ (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p&lt;0.05;). The number of CD68+ cells was significantly lower in the testis when compared with the other MGT organs (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p&lt;0.05, not shown on the graph). The number of CD4+ cells in the testis was significantly lower than in the prostate and seminal vesicles (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p&lt;0.05, not shown on the graph).</p>
