                Figure 2.  Blood PVLs from time of intravenous SIVmac251 inoculation to necropsy.(A) Four animals were sacrificed at 14 days p.i.; (B) Seven animals, sacrificed between 15 to 37 weeks p.i., were distinguished into one group of 3 “high chronic animals” (triangles) and one group of 4 “low chronics” (circles), based on PVL at necropsy. Mean viral loads are represented by a blue line for the primary-infected, a red line for the chronically-infected animals with high PVL and a green line for the chronically infected animals with low PVL.
