Ves.) of SIV-infected macaques, using nested SIV gag PCR. Each bar represents the mean +/âˆ’ SEM of gag+ PCR for each organ within a group of animals. Statistical difference (Kruskal Wallis test, p&lt;0.05) was found between the MGT of primary-infected, high chronic and low chronic animals (not shown on the graph); p values shown on the graph indicate statistical difference between the organs, according to Wilcoxon signed rank test. (B) Frequencies of detection of SIV gag DNA in genital organs of primary and chronically-infected animals were tested for association with blood viremia by Spearman rank test. The different organs are depicted by different symbols. Positive correlation was found for all male genital tract organs levels of infection and blood viral load. (C) SIV DNA viral load in mesenteric lymph nodes (LN), epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles of primary SIV-infected macaques, in quantitative real time PCR. Mean of 4 animals is represented by black bars. Squares with the same pattern show viral load for 2 independent fragments of the same organ. Stars indicate statistical difference between the epididymis and the other organs (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p&lt;0.05).</p>
