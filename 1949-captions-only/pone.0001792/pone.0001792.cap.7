Note the presence of HLA-DR+ and CD68+ cells in the seminal vesicle lumen (I, J). Scale bars = 20 µm. (Q) Semi-quantitative analysis of CD3+ cell foci in the male genital organs of infected macaques. The number of CD3+ cells in each focus was determined using the Cast software. The number of foci in each category (15–50 cells, 51–250 cells, 251–1000 cells) was counted on whole sections of epididymis, seminal vesicles and prostate from chronically-infected macaques with high PVL, and prostate from primary infected macaques. (R) Quantitative analysis of CD68+ and CD3+ stained positive cells in the testes of non-infected macaques (non inf.) and macaques chronically infected with SIV and displaying high PVL (high chronic).</p>
