Significance between body weight of wildtype and HSL null mice fed HFD is indicated. (B) Female wildtype and HSL null mice at 9 months of age after 24 weeks on HFD. (C) Weight of periovarial WAT from 10–11 months old mice fed a HFD for 6 months (n = 13–17). (D) Lipid analysis on stools from 7–8 months old female wildtype and HSL null mice fed either a control diet or a HFD for 4 months, collected during a 24 h period (n = 5). (E) Registration of physical activity in 10–11 months old male mice fed a HFD for 6 months (n = 3). The parameters investigated were: horizontal motor activity in the periphery (Periphery) and in the central part (Central) of the cage, rear leg (Rear), fine (grooming) (FT), ambulatory (AT) and total (Total) movements. Values given are mean±SEM, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001, analyzed with One way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test (A) and Mann-Whitney U tests (C,D,E).</p>
