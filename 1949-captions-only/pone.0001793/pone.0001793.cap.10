                Figure 10.  HFD-fed HSL null mice have increased oxygen consumption in WAT.Oxygen consumption (A) and level of uncoupling of mitochondria (B) measured using a Clark electrode in periovarial WAT pieces from 10–11 months old, wildtype (n = 11 and 9 respectively) and HSL null mice (n = 11 and 8 respectively) fed HFD for 6 months. Values given are mean±SEM, *** p&lt;0.001, analyzed with Mann-Whitney U tests.
