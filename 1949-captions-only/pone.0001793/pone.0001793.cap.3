                Figure 3.  Plasma levels of adipokines are altered in HSL null mice.(A) Plasma leptin protein levels in the fed state after 2 and 24 weeks of HFD feeding in female wildtype and HSL null mice, fed the HFD from 16 weeks of age (n = 6). (B) Plasma adiponectin protein levels in the fed state after 3 and 22 weeks of HFD feeding in female wildtype and HSL null mice, fed the HFD from 16 weeks of age (n = 6). Values given are meanÂ±SEM, ** p&lt;0.01, analyzed with Mann-Whitney U tests.
