                Figure 4.  Morphological changes in WAT of HFD-fed HSL null mice.(A) Representative morphology images of epididymal WAT from 10–11 months old wildtype (I) and HSL null (III) mice fed control diet and wildtype (II) and HSL null (IV) mice fed HFD for 6 months. (B) The cell area was determined using morphometry and was based on a total of 268 cells in wildtype control, 477 cells in HSL null control, 922 cells in wildtype HFD and 775 cells in HSL null HFD. (C) Caspase 3/7 activity was investigated in the infranatant fraction of WAT from 10–12 months old female mice fed a control diet or a HFD for 6 months (n = 7–12). Values given are mean±SEM.
