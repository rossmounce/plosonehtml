                Figure 9.  Altered gene expression in white adipocytes from HSL null mice.mRNA level of UCP-1 (A), CPT1 (B), pRb (C), RIP140 (D) and PGC1α (E) analyzed with real-time quantitative PCR in isolated adipocytes from periovarial WAT from 2 months old, wildtype and HSL null mice fed HFD for 4 weeks (n = 6). Values given are mean±SEM, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, analyzed with Mann-Whitney U tests.
