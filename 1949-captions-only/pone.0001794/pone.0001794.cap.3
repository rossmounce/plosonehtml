                Figure 3.  Temporal Analysis of Resting-State Networks.Left: A representative mean power spectral density plot for one component of interest (default mode network; Figure 2 A and A*). For all networks, the highest power density was observed below 0.04 Hz. Right: Proportion of power in the three non-overlapping frequency bands for the default mode RSN associated with the neutral and sad recall conditions. All identified components showed the highest percentage of power in the very low frequency band. LF = low frequency; VLF = very low frequency; HF = higher frequency. NR = neutral recall; SR = sad recall.
