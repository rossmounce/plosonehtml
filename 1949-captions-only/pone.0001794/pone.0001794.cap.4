                Figure 4.  Modulation of Resting-State Networks by Mood Induction.Global functional connectivity differences observed between the neutral and sad recall conditions for the common RSNs. The top panel A - A* indicates an apparent decrease in functional connectivity of the default mode network between the neutral and sad recall conditions. All other panels indicate apparent increases of functional connectivity during the sad compared to neutral recall condition. All images are presented on a high-resolution single-subject MRI in standard neuroanatomical space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Colin-27). Corresponding color bars indicate the t score ranges of the displayed maps. Images are displayed in neurological convention (left = left).
