The top panel A - A* indicates an apparent <em>decrease</em> in functional connectivity of the default mode network between the neutral and sad recall conditions. All other panels indicate apparent <em>increases</em> of functional connectivity during the sad compared to neutral recall condition. All images are presented on a high-resolution single-subject MRI in standard neuroanatomical space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Colin-27). Corresponding color bars indicate the t score ranges of the displayed maps. Images are displayed in neurological convention (left = left).</p>
