Bars represent mean standard error. Positive values correspond to finger flexion, whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. Asterisks indicate significant results (<em>p</em>&lt;.05) for the comparisons between the ‘OL’ and the ‘OS’ conditions at different epochs of normalized movement time. OL = Odourless air-Large target; OS = Odourless air-Small target.</p>
