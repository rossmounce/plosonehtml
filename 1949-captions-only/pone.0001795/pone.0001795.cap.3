                Figure 3.  Time course of fingers motion during reaching in the absence of olfactory stimuli.Each trace corresponds to the average angular excursion for the mcp (left panels) and pip (right panels) joints of the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers for the ‘OL’ (black squares) and the ‘OS’ (white circles) conditions. Bars represent mean standard error. Positive values correspond to finger flexion, whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. Asterisks indicate significant results (p&lt;.05) for the comparisons between the ‘OL’ and the ‘OS’ conditions at different epochs of normalized movement time. OL = Odourless air-Large target; OS = Odourless air-Small target.
