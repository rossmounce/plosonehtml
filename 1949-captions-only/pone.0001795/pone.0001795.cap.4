Bars represent mean standard error. Increase in negative values correspond to bigger abduction (i.e., increase of digits' angular distance). Asterisks indicate significant results (<em>p&lt;</em>.05) for the comparisons between the ‘OL’ and the ‘OS’ conditions at different epochs of normalized movement time. OL = Odourless air-Large target; OS = Odourless air-Small target.</p>
