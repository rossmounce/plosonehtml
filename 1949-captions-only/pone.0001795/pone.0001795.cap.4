                Figure 4.  Time course of abduction angle between fingers during reaching in the absence of olfactory stimuli.Each trace corresponds to the average abduction angle for the ‘OL’ (black squares) and the ‘OS’ (white circles) conditions. Bars represent mean standard error. Increase in negative values correspond to bigger abduction (i.e., increase of digits' angular distance). Asterisks indicate significant results (p&lt;.05) for the comparisons between the ‘OL’ and the ‘OS’ conditions at different epochs of normalized movement time. OL = Odourless air-Large target; OS = Odourless air-Small target.
