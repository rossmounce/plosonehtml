                Figure 5.  Time course of finger motion during reaching for the large target either in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking a large object.Each trace corresponds to the average angular excursion of a representative subject (Subject 15) for the mcp joint of the thumb and the pip joint of the index, middle, and ring fingers when performing the ‘OL’ (black squares) and the ‘LL’ (blue squares) conditions. Positive values correspond to finger flexion whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. OL = Odourless air-Large target; LL = ‘Large’ odour-Large target.
