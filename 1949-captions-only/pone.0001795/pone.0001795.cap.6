                Figure 6.  Time course of finger motion during reaching for the large target either in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking a small object.Each trace denotes the average angular excursion of a representative subject (subject 15) for the mcp joint of index, middle and ring fingers (upper panels), and the pip joint of the thumb and index finger (lower panels) when performing the ‘OL’ (black squares) and the ‘SL’ (red squares) conditions. Positive values correspond to finger flexion whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. OL = Odourless air-Large target; SL = ‘Small’ odour-Large target.
