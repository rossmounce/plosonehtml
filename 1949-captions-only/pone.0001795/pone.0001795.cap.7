                Figure 7.  Time course of abduction angle between fingers during reaching for the large target either in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking a small object.Each trace denotes average abduction angle of a representative subject (Subject 10) for the middle-ring and the ring-little fingers when performing the ‘OL’ (black squares) and the ‘SL’ (red squares) conditions. Increase in negative values correspond to bigger abduction (i.e., increase of digits' angular distance). OL = Odourless air-Large target; SL = ‘Small’ odour-Large target.
