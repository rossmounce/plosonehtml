                Figure 8.  Time course of finger motion during reaching for the small target either in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking a small object.Each trace denotes average angular excursion of a representative subject (Subject 2) for the mcp joint of the index and the little fingers when performing the ‘OS’ (black circles) and the ‘SS’ (purple circles) conditions. Positive values correspond to finger flexion whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. OS = Odourless air-Small target; SS = ‘Small’ odour-Small target.
