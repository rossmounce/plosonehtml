                Figure 9.  Time course of finger motion during reaching for the small target either in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking a large object.Each trace depicts average angular excursion of a representative subject (Subject 2) for the mcp joint of the thumb and the ring finger when performing the ‘OS’ (black circles) and the ‘LS’ (green circles) conditions. Positive values correspond to finger flexion whereas negative values correspond to finger extension. OS = Odourless air-Small target; LS = ‘Large’ odour-Small target.
