                Figure 2.  Recording backpropagating action potential responses from GECIs in hippocampal pyramidal cells.A, Schematic showing the linescan location at the base of the apical dendrite. B, Raw linescan images (top row) showing a dark period prior to shutter opening, followed by a shutter-open fluorescence baseline and action-potential (bottom row) evoked responses (left, 3 action potentials at 83 Hz; right, 10 action potentials at 83 Hz). Fluorescence time series (middle row) were obtained by averaging over the spatial extent of the dendrite (indicated by vertical white lines).
