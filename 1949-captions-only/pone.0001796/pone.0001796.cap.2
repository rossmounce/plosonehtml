B, Raw linescan images (top row) showing a dark period prior to shutter opening, followed by a shutter-open fluorescence baseline and action-potential (bottom row) evoked responses (left, 3 action potentials at 83 Hz; right, 10 action potentials at 83 Hz). Fluorescence time series (middle row) were obtained by averaging over the spatial extent of the dendrite (indicated by vertical white lines).</p>
