Dashed lines show perforated-patch recordings. Inset shows same data for 1–10 action potentials on a linear x-axis. Example single-trial responses (right) from four cells to 1, 5, 10 and 40 action potentials at 83 Hz (indicated by horizontal black lines). B, Responses of individual cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (thin lines) and the group mean (thick gray line) expressing GCaMP2 after <em>in utero</em> electroporation (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). C, GCaMP2 responses from hippocampal pyramidal cells at 34.5–35.5°C. D,E, Responses of previous versions of GCaMP family GECIs. B–E, Same conventions as in A.</p>
