                Figure 3.  Action-potential evoked responses in GCaMP-based GECIs.A, Amplitudes of GCaMP2 responses for individual hippocampal pyramidal cells (thin lines, left) in response to trains of action potentials given at 83 Hz, and the mean across cells (thick gray line). Dashed lines show perforated-patch recordings. Inset shows same data for 1–10 action potentials on a linear x-axis. Example single-trial responses (right) from four cells to 1, 5, 10 and 40 action potentials at 83 Hz (indicated by horizontal black lines). B, Responses of individual cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (thin lines) and the group mean (thick gray line) expressing GCaMP2 after in utero electroporation (see Materials and Methods). C, GCaMP2 responses from hippocampal pyramidal cells at 34.5–35.5°C. D,E, Responses of previous versions of GCaMP family GECIs. B–E, Same conventions as in A.
