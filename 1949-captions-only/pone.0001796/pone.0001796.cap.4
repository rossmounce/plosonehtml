Insets show same data for 1–10 action potentials on a linear x-axis. Example traces (right) show single-trial responses to trains of action potentials at 83 Hz (indicated by horizontal black lines). B, Responses from the membrane-targeted construct MARCKS-GCaMP2. C, Actin-potential evoked responses from the GCaMP2-actin fusion. Conventions as in A. D–F, Action-potential responses measured simultaneously with GECIs (green curves, traces) and with the synthetic dye X-Rhod-5F (500 µM; red curves, traces). Cells were loaded with X-Rhod-5F for ≥20 min prior to data collection. Example traces show single-trial responses measured simultaneously from the green and red channels. Cells shown in D–F are different from those in <a href="#pone-0001796-g003">Figure 3A</a> and in panels A–C.</p>
