                Figure 5.  Accuracy of action potential detection.Results of simulations (see Materials and Methods) giving percentage of action potential trains (for the indicated numbers of action potentials at 83 Hz) that can be detected at a 5% false positive rate for 1 second of data (i.e., such that when a time series is divided up into subsequent intervals of 1 second length, 5% of these intervals will contain a false positive). Thin dotted lines show results for individual cells and the thick black line gives the group mean.
