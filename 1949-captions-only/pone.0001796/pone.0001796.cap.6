A GCaMP2-actin fusion (right) shows a similar spine enrichment in the apical dendrite of a different CA1 cell. B, Example images showing spine and dendrite fluorescence for GCaMP2 (left) and GCaMP2-actin (right). Each image shows the baseline frame prior to uncaging. Images are median filtered in a 3×3 pixel neighborhood. C, Traces show uncaging-evoked ΔF/F fluorescence signals for ROIs covering the spine (gray) and dendrite (black) for GCaMP2 (left) and GCaMP2-actin (right). Uncaging occurs at the start of the third frame. Traces correspond to the spines/dendrites shown in B. D, Traces showing NMDA-receptor currents in response to glutamate uncaging at the spines shown in B. Each trace shows an average of 6 trials. E, ΔF/F fluorescence change in spines versus peak NMDA-receptor current versus for GCaMP2 (gray circles) and GCaMP2-actin (black circles). Lines indicate measurements taken from the same spine at different uncaging powers.</p>
