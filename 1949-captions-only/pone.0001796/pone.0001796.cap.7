                Figure 7.  Brightness of the GECIs compared.GECIs were expressed (34â€“48 hours) in pyramidal cells and brightness was measured as the mean fluorescence intensity collected in linescan mode across the base of the apical dendrite. Each plot symbol shows a single cell, except for the FRET probes in which symbols connected by a dashed line indicate cyan and yellow channel measurements from the same cell. Illumination was 7 mW at the objective back aperture (see Materials and Methods for details).
