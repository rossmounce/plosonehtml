(B) Ghrelin and cannabinoid effects on hypothalamic AMPK activity one hour after intraperitoneal administration of THC, ghrelin, rimonabant (R) or a combination of rimonabant and ghrelin (R+G) in WT and CB1-KO animals compared to vehicle-treated animals, n = 6–14 mice/group. (C) Hypothalamic 2-AG content after intraperitoneal treatment with ghrelin in WT and CB1-KO animals, n = 6 mice/group. (D) Hypothalamic 2-AG content in WT animals after ip treatment with ghrelin and rimonabant compared to vehicle treated animals, n = 6–14 mice/group.
