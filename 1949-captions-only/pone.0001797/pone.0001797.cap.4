The increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level activates the 2-AG synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase-Î± (DAGL), directly or through activation of protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in an increased 2-AG synthesis and release into the extracellular space. The increased activation of presynaptic CB1 then inhibits the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu) from the axons innervating the PVN neurons. Intracellular administration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator BAPTA blocks this cascade by preventing the increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, whereas extracellularly-given THL blocks the 2-AG synthesis and AM251 blocks the cascade at the level of CB1.</p>
