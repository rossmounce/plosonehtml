                Figure 1.  Direct binding targets of Myc in HeLa cells, quiescent foreskin fibroblasts, and serum stimulated foreskin fibroblasts.Fibroblasts are designated “2091”. Target binding loci of Myc were detected by ChIP-chip analysis in (A) HeLa cells, (B) quiescent (serum starved for 3 days) foreskin fibroblasts, and (C) serum stimulated foreskin fibroblasts (for 4 hours). Each scatter plot shows the red/green ratio (log2 transformed) on the Y-axis, and the p-value in X-axis. Red data points indicate Myc target loci with red/green log2 ratio &gt;1 (2-fold), and p&lt;0.005. 1351, 196, and 788 promoters were occupied by Myc respectively in the three conditions. (D) The Venn diagram compares target genes in HeLa cells, quiescent foreskin fibroblasts, and serum stimulated foreskin fibroblasts. A total of 1469 target promoters were identified as targets of Myc. Microarray data are also available through NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under GEO Series accession number GSE5197.
