Comparisons of Myc occupancy at promoters (A) between HeLa cells and quiescent foreskin fibroblasts, (B) between serum stimulated and quiescent foreskin fibroblasts, and (C) between HeLa cells and in serum stimulated foreskin fibroblasts, show a relatively high degree of similarity of Myc binding targets in different cell lines or conditions.(D) As a negative control, a comparison between E2F4 binding to promoters in quiescent fibroblasts and Myc binding to promoters in the same condition was performed. There is little correlation between Myc occupancy and E2F4 occupancy at the promoters (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.19).</p>
