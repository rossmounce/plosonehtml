(B) The histogram shows expression profiles of all genes in HeLa cells detected by cDNA microarray (gray bars) and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (black bars). (C) Myc occupancy at the promoters of selected target genes were independently verified by quantitative real-time PCR. The promoter of the actin gene (ACTB) served as a negative control. The graph shows fold enrichment over background, as an average of triplicate PCR reactions from two independent biological replicates. 20 of 24 tested promoters showed significant enrichment compared to the negative control. (D) A gene-by-gene visualization of the correlation between Myc occupancy at the promoters of genes in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression in HeLa cells.</p>
