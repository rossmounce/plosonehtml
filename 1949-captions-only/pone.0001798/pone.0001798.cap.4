Of the six previously defined E-box sequences, <span class="gene">CACGTG</span>, <span class="gene">CATGCG</span>, and <span class="gene">CACGCG</span> were well clustered near the TSS region. A bin size of 50, and a total of 18,193 promoter sequences spanning 3 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of the TSS were used in this analysis. (B) Number of promoters that contained each E-box element in the region between −800 bp, and +200 bp of the TSS. (C) The relationship between the presence of each E-box sequence in the promoter region (between −800 bp, and +200 bp of the TSS), and Myc binding represented by the log<sub>2</sub> red/green ratio on the X axis. The Y-axis represents the frequency of each E-box element. A moving window average (size 100) was applied to the frequency of the E-box sequence. The canonical E-box sequence <span class="gene">CACGTG</span>, and the non-canonical E-box sequence <span class="gene">CACGCG</span> in promoters showed the strongest correlation with Myc binding to its target promoters in HeLa cells.</p>
