(A) Top and bottom 2% Myc occupancy data and (B) top and bottom 10% of Myc occupancy data were used. Black bars in both panels represent target promoters that were occupied by Myc and gray bars represent promoters that were not occupied by Myc. Promoters that contained the E-box sequence CATGTG did not show a positive correlation with Myc binding.</p>
