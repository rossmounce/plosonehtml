                Figure 6.  E-box usage in foreskin fibroblasts.The relationship between the presence of the two E-box sequences (CACGTG, and CACGCG) and Myc binding represented by the log2 red/green ratio in (A) quiescent foreskin fibroblasts, and (B) in serum stimulated fibroblasts is shown. Only the canonical E-box sequence CACGTG showed good correlation with Myc binding in both conditions. Average moving window (size 100) was applied to the frequency of E-box sequence. (D) E2F4 ChIP-chip data was used as a negative control, and showed no correlation with E-box elements.
