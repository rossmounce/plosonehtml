Only the canonical E-box sequence <span class="gene">CACGTG</span> showed good correlation with Myc binding in both conditions. Average moving window (size 100) was applied to the frequency of E-box sequence. (D) E2F4 ChIP-chip data was used as a negative control, and showed no correlation with E-box elements.</p>
