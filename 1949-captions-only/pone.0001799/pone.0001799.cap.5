                Figure 5.  The trade-off relationships between population density vs. the photosynthetic mass/leaf mass (A) and the allometric exponents, 1/δ vs. β (B).The population density and the photosynthetic mass show a reciprocal relationship (A) and the exponents 1/δ and β show a negative reciprocal relationship (B).
