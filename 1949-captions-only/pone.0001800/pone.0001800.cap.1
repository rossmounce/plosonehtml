                Figure 1.  Genetic map of pMET1 and comparison to plasmid pCRY and chromosomal elements.A. The genetic maps of pMET1 and pCRY are compared showing the homologous regions. The arrows indicate genes locations and orientation. Genes with different functions are shown with different colors and if the genes in the different structures shown are homologus they are represented with the same colors. Yellow: mobilization; green: replication and partition; red: antibiotic resistance; purple: virB/pilX-like; blue: transposition; grey: unknown. Since pCRY is smaller than pMET1, to represent it in circular form a dotted line was added to fill the gap. Solid line represents non-homologous DNA. B. Comparison of a pMET1 region with chromosomal HPIs or ICEs is shown using a linearized version of the plasmid. The HPIs shown are those from E. coli ECOR31 (HPIECOR31) [43], K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044 (ICEKp1) [44], and Y. pestis KIM (HPIYp)[43]. The diagram shows the HP core regions, which are not at scale and are represented as in [43], and the RB-HPIs. The sequence described in this manuscript has been deposited in GenBank, accession number is EU383016.
