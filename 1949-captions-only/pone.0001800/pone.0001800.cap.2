                Figure 2.  Genetic organization of transposons Tn3, Tn1331, Tn1332, and Tn1331.2.The horizontal arrows indicate the location and direction of transcription of the genes. The genes are named only once for the sake of clarity. The light gray blocks show the 520-bp region direct repeats. Note that in Tn1332 one of the direct repeats is interrupted by an insertion of ISPpu17. The upper vertices of the dark gray triangles show points of insertion of DNA fragments that generate a new transposable element. The length of the base of each triangle defines the sizes of such DNA insertions. The curved dashed arrow to the right indicates that the transition Tn1331.2 to Tn1331 by deletion of one of the 3,047-bp occurred in the laboratory but it has not been confirmed to occur in nature. Stippled bar below Tn1331 indicates potential gene cassettes (GC).
