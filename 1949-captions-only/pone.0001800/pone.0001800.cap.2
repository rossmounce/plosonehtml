The genes are named only once for the sake of clarity. The light gray blocks show the 520-bp region direct repeats. Note that in Tn<em>1332</em> one of the direct repeats is interrupted by an insertion of IS<em>Ppu17</em>. The upper vertices of the dark gray triangles show points of insertion of DNA fragments that generate a new transposable element. The length of the base of each triangle defines the sizes of such DNA insertions. The curved dashed arrow to the right indicates that the transition Tn<em>1331.2</em> to Tn<em>1331</em> by deletion of one of the 3,047-bp occurred in the laboratory but it has not been confirmed to occur in nature. Stippled bar below Tn<em>1331</em> indicates potential gene cassettes (GC).</p>
