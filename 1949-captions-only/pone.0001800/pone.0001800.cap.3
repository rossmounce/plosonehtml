The bar shows a genetic map of the pMET1 replication region and the GC content plot generated using a window size of 100 bp on top. Recombinant clones were obtained by inserting the indicated fragments into pCR2.1 or ligated to the pUC4K <em>aph</em> cassette. The ability to be maintained in <em>E. coli</em> C2110 (a <em>polA</em> mutant) of the recombinant plasmids made using pCR2.1 as vector is indicated to the right by a + or − sign. The ability to generate kanamycin resistant colonies in <em>E. coli</em> TOP10 of the indicated fragments when ligated to the <em>aph</em> cassette from pUC4K is also represented by a + or − sign. B. BLASTP comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative RepA proteins from pMET1 and pCRY.</p>
