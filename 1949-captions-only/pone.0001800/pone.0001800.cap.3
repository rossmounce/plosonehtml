                Figure 3.  Replication region of pMET1.A. The bar shows a genetic map of the pMET1 replication region and the GC content plot generated using a window size of 100 bp on top. Recombinant clones were obtained by inserting the indicated fragments into pCR2.1 or ligated to the pUC4K aph cassette. The ability to be maintained in E. coli C2110 (a polA mutant) of the recombinant plasmids made using pCR2.1 as vector is indicated to the right by a + or − sign. The ability to generate kanamycin resistant colonies in E. coli TOP10 of the indicated fragments when ligated to the aph cassette from pUC4K is also represented by a + or − sign. B. BLASTP comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative RepA proteins from pMET1 and pCRY.
