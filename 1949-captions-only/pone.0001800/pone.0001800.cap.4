The direct repeats within the pMET1 putative <em>parH</em>-like locus are shown in red. The diagram also shows the −35 and −10 sequences, as well as the inverted repeats (arrows). The inverted repeat within the putative <em>parH</em> locus is shown in blue. The beginning of the ParF amino acid sequence including the deviant Walker motif A and motif A' are shown. B.
