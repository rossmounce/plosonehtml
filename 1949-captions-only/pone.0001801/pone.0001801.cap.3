Sizes (kDa) of the markers in the left-most lane are indicated to the left of the autoradiogram. B). The effect of tRNA supplementation on relative protein translation in “A” is depicted schematically as the ratio of full-length product produced in the presence and absence of tRNA supplementation.</p>
