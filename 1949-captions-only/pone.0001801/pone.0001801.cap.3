                Figure 3.  Translation in vitro of PTB and paralogs.A) Translation was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate pre-treated with micrococcal nuclease [37] in the presence or absence of additional calf liver tRNA (60 µg ml−1) over a time-course of 12, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min, and with 10 µg ml−1 of mRNA. Sizes (kDa) of the markers in the left-most lane are indicated to the left of the autoradiogram. B). The effect of tRNA supplementation on relative protein translation in “A” is depicted schematically as the ratio of full-length product produced in the presence and absence of tRNA supplementation.
