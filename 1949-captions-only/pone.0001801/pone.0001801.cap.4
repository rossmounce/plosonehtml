Lanes M, protein size markers (sizes in kDa indicated to the left). For clarity only the lane numbers for the lowest and highest concentration of each mRNA are indicated below. Positions of truncated nPTB and ROD1 products are indicated by white arrowheads to the right of lanes 20 and 30. B) Translation of nPTB mRNA (80 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>) was carried out for 60 min except for lane 1, which was stopped at 30 min. Edeine (1 µM) was added at 30 min (lane 3,4,5) or at 0 min (lane 7). Calf liver tRNA (60 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>) was added at 30 min (lane 4 and 5) or at 0 min (lane 6), as indicated. Lanes 4 and 5 are identical replicates. Lanes “M”, molecular size makers. Lanes M, protein size markers (sizes in kDa indicated to the left). Truncated products accumulated in the absence of supplementary tRNA could be chased into full length products by addition of tRNA (compare lane 3 with 4 and 5).</p>
