                Figure 5.  Sequence of nPTB and nPTB* open reading frames.The amino acid sequence is shown on the top line, the human nPTB nucleotide sequence is shown on the second line and the wobble position mutations to create the codon-optimized nPTB* are shown on the third line. The Asp 718 and Sal I sites used for cloning are underlined.
