                Figure 1.  Estrogen receptor phosphorylation induced by HRG and E2.Phosphorylation levels of estrogen receptor alpha at Ser-118 and Ser-167 treated with HRG (10 nM) or E2 (10 nM) were measured at the designated time period. Three-independent western blots were performed for each ligand. Representative figures are shown on the left. Levels of phosphorylation were quantified using a densitometer and are shown graphically on the right.
