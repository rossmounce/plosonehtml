Larger <em>d<sub>A</sub></em> (or <em>d<sub>R</sub></em>) values represent a higher level of acetylation (or RNA map) in HRG-treated cells compared with untreated cells. Red and green dashed lines show the distribution of these values in the expression array and represent up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. Colored dotted lines depicted along the vertical axis represent average values of each distribution.</p>
