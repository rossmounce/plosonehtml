                Figure 2.  Distribution of signal differences dA and dR between HRG-treated and untreated cells.Upper and lower panel shows the distribution of acetylation and RNA map signal differences, dA ( = Ahrg–Acontrol) and dR ( = Rhrg–Rcontrol) (A and B), respectively. Larger dA (or dR) values represent a higher level of acetylation (or RNA map) in HRG-treated cells compared with untreated cells. Red and green dashed lines show the distribution of these values in the expression array and represent up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. Colored dotted lines depicted along the vertical axis represent average values of each distribution.
