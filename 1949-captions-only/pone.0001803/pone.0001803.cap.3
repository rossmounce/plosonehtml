                Figure 3.  Comparison of tiling array-inferred up-regulated genes and expression array results at various thresholds.The proportion of genes that were identified as up-regulated and also found in the expression array-based gene list at various thresholds of α and β ((A) and (B)). (C) and (D) represent the number of identified genes.
