                Figure 4.  HRG-regulated TFs involved in the KEGG MAPK signaling pathway.Thirteen TFs included in the 117 HRG-regulated TF list involved in the MAPK signaling pathway and are highlighted in red. Note that since Elk-1 appears twice in the figure (downstream of classical MAP kinase pathway and JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathway), 14 boxes are highlighted.
