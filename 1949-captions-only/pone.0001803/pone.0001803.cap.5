                Figure 5.  Chromosome-wide plots for copy number distribution.Four representative chromosomes (1, 3, 17 and 20) are shown in this figure. See Figure S2 for the same plots for all chromosomes. Red and blue bars at the top and bottom in each plot designate actively transcribed and high copy number regions, respectively. Green triangles represent location of the BCAS2 (chromosome 1), PSMD6 (chromosome 3) , PPM1D (chromosome 17) and NCOA3 (chromosome 20) gene loci, respectively.
