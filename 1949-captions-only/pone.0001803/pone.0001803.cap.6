                Figure 6.  OmicBrowse display for the BCAS2 gene.Experimental results (tiling arrays and array CGH) together with genome annotation are represented along the genomic coordinate using OmicBrowse, a web-based genome browser. The upper panel shows the copy number (1st lane) and BCAS2 gene locus (2nd lane) in chromosome 1. The lower panel represents a detailed view of this locus with 5 lanes. Each lane represents 1) H3K9 acetylation signals in the control experiment, 2) RNA mapping signal in the control experiment, 3) Ensembl Gene with exon-intron structure, 4) human CAGE tag counts, and 5) a region of BCAS2 derived from the NCBI Entrez Gene database. The height of the vertical bars in the 1st and 2nd lanes corresponds to the strength of the signals. Light green bars in the top 2 lanes represent regions with significant signal intensity. The upper panel shows that BCAS2 is located in amplified regions. In the lower panel, a high level of acetylation around the TSS, significant and higher signal intensity of the RNA map at exons, and a high CAGE tag can be seen for BCAS2. These data support the view that BCAS2 was expressed in the absence of exogenous stimuli.
