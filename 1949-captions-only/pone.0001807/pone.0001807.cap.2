                Figure 2.  Schematic illustration of the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) and its linkage disequilibrium structure.The line in the top part of the figure illustrates the ESR1 gene with the exons marked with horizontal lines. The lower part of the figure shows the positions of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ESR1 genotyped in the ULSAM cohort with pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) values. The SNPs with nominal p-values&lt;0.05 in the ULSAM cohort are marked with stars, and the SNP rs2179922 located in intron 4 of ESR1 with p = 0.0056 in the PIVUS cohort is marked by a large star.
