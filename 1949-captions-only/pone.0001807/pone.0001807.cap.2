The lower part of the figure shows the positions of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <em>ESR1</em> genotyped in the ULSAM cohort with pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>) values. The SNPs with nominal p-values&lt;0.05 in the ULSAM cohort are marked with stars, and the SNP rs2179922 located in intron 4 of ESR1 with p = 0.0056 in the PIVUS cohort is marked by a large star.</p>
