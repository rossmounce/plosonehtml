NIH-3T3 cells were infected (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) with wild-type MHV-68, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for viral glycoproteins. Positive staining appears black or grey. gN, gp48 and gp70 could each be seen on frond-like extensions of the infected cell plasma membrane (arrows). nil = secondary antibody only. B. NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing human CD8α were infected (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) or not with MHV-68 expressing eGFP-tagged gM. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained for CD8α. Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI. eGFP fluorescence was visualized directly. A similar MHV-68 induction of membrane fronds was seen using a lipophilic dye to stain the plasma membrane (data not shown). C. NIH-3T3 cells were infected (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) with MHV-68 expressing free eGFP, then fixed and stained for gp48 with mAb T8H3. eGFP fluorescence was visualized directly. Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI. The zoomed images correspond to the boxed regions in the upper panels.</p>
