                Figure 2.  Relationship between membrane fronds and virions.A. BHK-21 cells infected with MHV-68 expressing eGFP-tagged gM (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) were examined by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The eGFP signal appears as black/gray. Each zoomed image corresponds to the boxed region of the corresponding overview. The punctate fluorescence of distal membrane fronds is seen to change with time. See also Movies S1 and S2. B. BHK-21 cells were infected with gM-eGFP-tagged MHV-68 as in A. Time-lapse imaging then focussed on a single membrane process. Zoom 1 is the boxed region in the overview; zoom 2 is the boxed region of zoom 1, with its boxed region shown as a zoomed inset. Zoom 3 shows a region equivalent to the central part of zoom 2 at Ã—5 greater magnification. Again, its boxed region is shown as a further zoomed inset. The complete sets of zoom 2 and zoom 3 pictures make up Movies S3 and S4. C. Stills from Movies S3 and S4, which correspond to the zoom 2 and zoom 3 images in B, show the variation in eGFP+ dot distribution at 10sec intervals. D. BHK-21 cells were infected with MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell, 16h) then fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. cyt = cytoplasm; ext = extracellular. Closed arrows show virions. Open arrows show the bases of membrane fronds.
