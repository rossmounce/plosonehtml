BHK-21 cells infected with MHV-68 expressing eGFP-tagged gM (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) were examined by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The eGFP signal appears as black/gray. Each zoomed image corresponds to the boxed region of the corresponding overview. The punctate fluorescence of distal membrane fronds is seen to change with time. See also <a href="#pone.0001808.s003">Movies S1</a> and <a href="#pone.0001808.s004">S2</a>. B. BHK-21 cells were infected with gM-eGFP-tagged MHV-68 as in A. Time-lapse imaging then focussed on a single membrane process. Zoom 1 is the boxed region in the overview; zoom 2 is the boxed region of zoom 1, with its boxed region shown as a zoomed inset. Zoom 3 shows a region equivalent to the central part of zoom 2 at Ã—5 greater magnification. Again, its boxed region is shown as a further zoomed inset. The complete sets of zoom 2 and zoom 3 pictures make up <a href="#pone.0001808.s005">Movies S3</a> and <a href="#pone.0001808.s006">S4</a>. C. Stills from <a href="#pone.0001808.s005">Movies S3</a> and <a href="#pone.0001808.s006">S4</a>, which correspond to the zoom 2 and zoom 3 images in B, show the variation in eGFP<sup>+</sup> dot distribution at 10sec intervals. D. BHK-21 cells were infected with MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell, 16h) then fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. cyt = cytoplasm; ext = extracellular. Closed arrows show virions. Open arrows show the bases of membrane fronds.</p>
