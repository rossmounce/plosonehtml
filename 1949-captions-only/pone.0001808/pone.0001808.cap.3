Schematic diagram of the MHV-68 ORF58 and ORF27 loci. Filled arrowheads show restriction sites created by eGFP tagging ORF58 or disrupting ORF27. Open arrowheads show genomic restriction sites. The thick lines show probe locations. B. Southern blots of wild-type (WT), eGFP-tagged ORF58 (G58) and ORF27-deficient eGFP-tagged ORF28 (G58/27<sup>−</sup>) viruses. The <em>Eco</em>RI digest plus <em>Bam</em>HI-C probe gave predicted wild-type and G58 virus fragments of 5611bp, 2703bp, 744bp and 1342bp (difficult to see because of limited overlap with the probe). The <em>Eco</em>RI-restricted oligonucleotide introduced into ORF27 at genomic co-ordinate 45480 converted the 5611bp band to 4075bp plus 1536bp. The <em>Bgl</em>II digest plus <em>Sac</em>I/<em>Sac</em>I/<em>Eco</em>RI probe gave predicted WT fragments of 5300bp, 5165bp, 2294bp and 3379bp. The eGFP insertion just upstream of ORF58 converted the 3379 band to 1193bp+2916bp. C. BHK-21 cells were left uninfected or infected (0.5 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) with ORF27<sup>+</sup> or ORF27<sup>−</sup> versions of the eGFP-ORF58 virus. The cells were then stained for gN (mAb 3F7), gp150 (mAb T1A1) or gp48 (mAb T8H3), each with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG pAb. The data are from 1 of 3 equivalent experiments. D. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with eGFP-ORF58 MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h), then fixed, permeabilized and stained for gp48 with mAb 6D10 plus Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG pAb. EGFP fluorescence was visualized directly. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The zoomed images correspond to the boxed regions in the left-hand panels. The data are from 1 of 5 equivalent experiments. E. BHK-21 cells were infected (0.01 p.f.u./cell) with ORF27<sup>+</sup> or ORF27<sup>−</sup> versions of either untagged (wild-type) or eGFP-ORF58-tagged MHV-68. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay at the times indicated. F. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with eGFP-ORF58 MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell, 16h) then examined by time-lapse confocal microscopy. An infected (inf) cell is shown next to an uninfected (UI) or only recently infected neighbour to demonstrate eGFP<sup>+</sup> fronds reaching from one to the other. <a href="#pone.0001808.s007">Movie S5</a> shows the difference between these cells in shape and motility. The findings were typical of &gt;100 cells examined.</p>
