NIH-3T3 cells were infected (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) with gp48<sup>+</sup> (upper set of images) or gp48<sup>−</sup> (lower set of images) versions of eGFP-ORF58 MHV-68, then fixed, permeabilized and stained for gp150 (mAb T1A1, left set of images) or gN (mAb 3F7, right set of images). Each mAb was visualized with Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG pAb, eGFP was visualized directly, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The zoomed images correspond to each boxed region above. B. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with ORF27<sup>−</sup> or ORF27<sup>+</sup> eGFP-ORF58 viruses as in A, then visualized by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The boxed region highlights eGFP<sup>+</sup> membrane fronds growing away from the ORF27<sup>+</sup> infected cell surface. Times are indicated in each panel. The complete image sets make up <a href="#pone.0001808.s008">Movies S6</a> and <a href="#pone.0001808.s009">S7</a>.</p>
