Red and green fluorescence signals were examined 48 h later. The zoomed images match the boxed region in the mRFP-58+eGFP-27 transfection. Arrowheads show membrane fronds. B. 293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for eGFP-tagged BMRF2 (EBV ORF58 homolog), with or without an expression plasmid for BDLF2 (EBV ORF27 homolog). 48 h later, the eGFP signal was visualized. Arrowheads show membrane fronds, which were not seen with either plasmid alone. Note also eGFP-BMRF2 redistribution following BDLF2 transfection, much like that seen with ORFs 27 and 58. C. ORF27 truncations, each tagged with eGFP (our mAbs only recognize full-length ORF27) were transfected into 293T cells. 48 h later, the cells were fixed and eGFP fluorescence visualized. The numbers correspond to amino acid residues of the full-length protein (gp48). The gp48 C-terminal domain is extracellular. The shaded region corresponds to its transmembrane domain. The arrows show membrane fronds, which were prominent only with the eGFP-27(1-88) mutant. Note also the redistribution of eGFP fluorescence. D. 293T cells were transfected with different eGFP-tagged ORF27 truncation mutants and 48h later fixed, permeabilized and stained for actin with Alexa568-conjugated phalloidin. EGFP fluorescence was visualized directly. The boxed region for each transfection is shown in the zoomed images below. E. 293T cells were transfected with mRFP-tagged ORF58 plus either full-length or N-truncated ORF27. 48 h later, eGFP (ORF27) and mRFP (ORF58) fluorescence signals were visualized. The arrows show membrane fronds with the full-length form. These were never seen with the cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants.</p>
