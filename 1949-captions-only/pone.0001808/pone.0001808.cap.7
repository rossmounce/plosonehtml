NIH-3T3 cells were either infected with eGFP-tagged ORF58 MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell) or transfected with the eGFP-tagged C-truncated ORF27(1-88) mutant. 18h later, the cells were treated or not for 1h with Brefeldin A or nocodazole. They were then fixed and examined for eGFP fluorescence. The arrowheads show membrane fronds on the cells without drug treatment. B. NIH-3T3 cells were either infected with eGFP-tagged ORF58 MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell) or transfected with the eGFP-tagged C-truncated ORF27(1-88) mutant. 4 h later they were transfected or not with dominant negative inhibitors of Cdc42 (Cdc42N17), Rac1 (Rac1N17) or RhoA (RhoN19). After a further 18h, the cells were fixed and examined for membrane fronds based on eGFP fluorescence. The arrows show fronds on the cells without inhibitors or with only Cdc42 inhibited. C. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with eGFP-ORF58 tagged MHV-68 (1 p.f.u./cell, 16 h) then exposed to either <em>C.difficile</em> toxin or its active moiety fused to an HIV tat transporter peptide. 4 h later, the cells were fixed and examined for membrane fronds based on eGFP fluorescence. The arrowheads show fronds on the cells without toxin treatment.</p>
