<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>Temperature stress brought on by prolonged warming of sea water is the cause of coral death by bleaching and can facilitate some coral disease outbreaks <a href="#pone.0001811-Miller1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001811-Bruno1">[26]</a>. Uncertainty of the mechanism by which increased temperature leads to disease outbreaks has led to the hypothesis that temperature stress causes corals to be immune compromised, but there are no significant studies on this phenomenon to draw conclusions. In the Fall of 2005, the Caribbean experienced the largest warm temperature anomaly in more than 100 years <a href="#pone.0001811-Oxenford1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001811-Levy1">[28]</a>; sea water temperatures were elevated for 4â€“8 continuous weeks in the Florida Keys and for 14 weeks in Puerto Rico. This temperature event caused mass bleaching and mortality of corals; in some cases 50% of live coral cover was lost <a href="#pone.0001811-Miller1">[25]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001811-Oxenford1">[27]</a>. Following this mass bleaching, disease spread through the remaining population and caused increased mortality <a href="#pone.0001811-Miller1">[25]</a>. These combined events underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanism by which corals can fight temperature stress and infectious diseases concomitantly.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a><p>In this paper we characterize the local and systemic changes in amoebocyte density in sea fan tissue with emphasis on linking these cellular responses to natural events. We describe how sea fan tissue reacts to fungal infection with two of the mainstays of invertebrate immunology; melanization via the prophenoloxidase cascade and increased amoebocytes. Additionally we test the hypothesis that temperature stress affected immunity by measuring amoebocyte density using corals naturally heat stressed in the field during the 2005 Caribbean bleaching event as well as experimentally heat stressed. This data set combines field sampling of wild populations with experimentally obtained data, and is uniquely set against a backdrop of the longest and warmest temperature anomaly in the Caribbean which killed many reef-building corals.</p>

<h4>Melanization reaction and amoebocyte responses in natural infections</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>The cellular component of the sea fan's immune response to pathogen infection was quantified by calculating the area of mesoglea (tissue between the polyps) occupied by amoebocytes from histological images. We detected a sizeable and dramatic increase of the granular amoebocytes in tissue infected with fungus, indicative of a classic inflammatory response. In healthy corals the amoebocytes comprise an average of 15.2% of the mesogleal tissue area and appear uniformly interspersed in the tissue (<a href="#pone-0001811-g002">Figure 2A</a>). In diseased corals there are more amoebocytes aggregated in the mesoglea adjacent to areas with fungal infections and they occupy a greater surface area (24.5%) (<a href="#pone-0001811-g002">Figure 2B</a>, <a href="#pone-0001811-g003">Figure 3</a>, n = 8, <em>X</em><sup>2</sup> = 28.93, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
