                Figure 6.  Quantitative analysis of amoebocytes in mesoglea of sea fans experimentally exposed to Aspergillus sydowii.A) Increase in amoebocytes in sea fans exposed to fungal hyphae, n = 14, X2 = 41.85, p&lt;0.0001. B) Fine spatial analysis of amoebocyte surface area at point of fungus exposure and 1, 4, and 8 mm away. Dashed line indicated control or basal % amoebocyte surface area. Data presented are meanÂ±s.e.m, n = 8, F = 18.95, p = 0.015. Asterisk denotes significant differences at p&lt;0.05.
