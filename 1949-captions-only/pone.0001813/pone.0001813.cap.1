                Figure 1.  Txnrd1 expression is strongly reduced in Txnrd1-NS null mouse brain.(A) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic brain protein extracts, revealing strongly reduced Txnrd1 protein levels in brain tissue of Txnrd1-NS null mice as compared to control mice. 30 µg protein were separated per lane. α-tubulin served as loading control. (B) Thioredoxin reductase activities were significantly reduced in the cytosol of Txnrd1-NS null brain but not of control brain nor of liver tissue regardless of genotype.
