(B) Determination of body weight at various time points revealed impaired growth of <em>Txnrd1</em>-NS null mice compared to control littermates. Values are expressed as meanÂ±SD. (C) Motor coordination performance was tested using the pole test. Shown is the time required to climb down the vertical pole on 5 consecutive trials. If a mouse fell down, slipped or was unable to climb down, a default value of 120 s was taken into account. (P = postnatal day).</p>
