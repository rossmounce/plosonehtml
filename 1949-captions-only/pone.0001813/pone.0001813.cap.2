                Figure 2.  NS-specific Txnrd1 knockout mice display restricted growth and striking movement disorders.(A) Shown are a Txnrd1-NS null mouse (right) and a control littermate (left) at the age of 1.5 years. (B) Determination of body weight at various time points revealed impaired growth of Txnrd1-NS null mice compared to control littermates. Values are expressed as meanÂ±SD. (C) Motor coordination performance was tested using the pole test. Shown is the time required to climb down the vertical pole on 5 consecutive trials. If a mouse fell down, slipped or was unable to climb down, a default value of 120 s was taken into account. (P = postnatal day).
