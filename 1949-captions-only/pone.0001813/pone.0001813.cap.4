Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haemalaun. Scale bar: 200 Âµm. (B) Illustrated is the number of PH3-positive cells per visual field from E11.5 until completion of postnatal cerebellar development at P21. (C) <em>Txnrd1</em>-NS null mice show a reduced cerebellar size from P1 onwards. Dashed line indicates the measured area. (D) Adult null mice show a strongly reduced relative cell density of the granular layer in the anterior cerebellum and only a slight reduction in the posterior part. The number of Purkinje cells remained unaffected.</p>
