                Figure 4.  Reduced proliferation in Txnrd1 null cerebellum.(A) To visualize mitotic cells, immunohistochemial staining on paraffin-embedded sagittal sections of P7 cerebelli were performed with an anti-phosphorylated histone 3 (PH3) antibody. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haemalaun. Scale bar: 200 Âµm. (B) Illustrated is the number of PH3-positive cells per visual field from E11.5 until completion of postnatal cerebellar development at P21. (C) Txnrd1-NS null mice show a reduced cerebellar size from P1 onwards. Dashed line indicates the measured area. (D) Adult null mice show a strongly reduced relative cell density of the granular layer in the anterior cerebellum and only a slight reduction in the posterior part. The number of Purkinje cells remained unaffected.
