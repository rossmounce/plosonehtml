The anterior and posterior cerebellar areas, represented in the high power micrographs shown in the lower part of the figure, are indicated by a filled box or an open box, respectively. Bergman Glia, shown as anti-Nestin or anti-GFAP immunoreactive cells, is essential for neuronal migration during pre- and postnatal cerebellar development. Clew-like alignment and shortening of Bergman glia is found in the anterior cerebellum of the mutant in 1 day old mutants (upper centre) or 14 day old mutants (middle centre). Anti-GFAP immunoreactive Bergmann glial fibers are shorter, disoriented, and reduced in density in the affected anterior <em>Txnrd1</em>-NS null lobules compared to control animals which show a radial alignment of these cells towards the pial surface (middle left). Glial cells in the posterior area of the <em>Txnrd1</em>-NS null cerebellum appear normal (upper and middle right). Purkinje cells, which are immunoreactive with anti-Calbindin, are located in a monolayer and project their dendrites towards the cells of the molecular layer in control mice (lower left). In the dysmorphic anterior <em>Txnrd1</em>-NS null cerebellum, ectopic Purkinje cell bodies in numerous layers fill the merged lobules and show impaired dendritic arborisation (lower centre). Purkinje cells of the mutant posterior cerebellar area show the same features, although less pronounced (lower right). Scale bar: 25 µm, anti-Calbindin staining: 200 µm.</p>
