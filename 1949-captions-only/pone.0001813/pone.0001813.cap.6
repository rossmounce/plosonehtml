                Figure 6.  Mice with neuron-specific disruption of Txnrd1 are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type litter mates.(A) Histological analysis of cerebellum revealed normal size and foliation pattern of the cerebellum of Tα1-Cre;Txnrd1fl/fl mice (with neuron-specific disruption of Txnrd1, right panel) in comparison to control mice (left panel) at the age of 5 weeks. Purkinje cells are stained with an antibody against Calbindin. (B) Higher power magnifications from (A). Sections were counterstained with Nissl. (B) Reduced cytosolic thioredoxin reductase activity in neuron-specific Txnrd1 knockout mice. Residual activity most likely resides in glial cells. Scale bars: 250 µm
