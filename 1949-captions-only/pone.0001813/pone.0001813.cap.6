Purkinje cells are stained with an antibody against Calbindin. (B) Higher power magnifications from (A). Sections were counterstained with Nissl. (B) Reduced cytosolic thioredoxin reductase activity in neuron-specific <em>Txnrd1</em> knockout mice. Residual activity most likely resides in glial cells. Scale bars: 250 µm</p>
