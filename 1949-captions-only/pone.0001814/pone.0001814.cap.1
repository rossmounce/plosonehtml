Left panel: top view on the peptide binding site of the class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1. Only the α<sub>1</sub>- (blue ribbon) and the β<sub>1</sub>-domain of the MHC molecule (red ribbon) are depicted; position of P1 is indicated. The backbone of the peptide ligand HA306-318 and the anchor side chain filling the P1 pocket are shown in yellow; MHC residues forming H-bonds with the backbone are labelled in grey. Right panel: side view of a P1 pocket loaded with the tyrosine anchor side chain. Surface of the pocket is indicated in yellow; amino acid residues forming this pocket are indicated; the peptide is shown in spacefill mode (green). Images are based on the crystal structure of HA306-318/HLA-DR1 (PDB: 1DLH) <a href="#pone.0001814-Stern2">[38]</a>. b) The catalytic impact of dipeptide side chains on the formation of antigen-complexes. The influence of short peptides on the complex formation-rate between HA306-318 and soluble HLA-DR1 was determined. The loading reaction was carried out in the presence of titrated amounts of the dipeptides Tyr-Arg (YR, filled circle) or Ala-Arg (AR, open circle) or in the absence of these dipeptides (dashed line). Complex formation was determined by ELISA and is expressed as relative enhancement in reference to the spontaneous complex formation in the absence of any catalyst. The amount of catalytic peptide fragments (MLE concentration) is indicated on the x-axis.</p>
