                Figure 2.  Structure/activity relationships of catalytic dipeptides.a) Role of H-bonds for the catalytic activity of dipeptides. Various H-bond bridges proximal to the P1 pocket stabilize the ligand complex (compare Fig. 1a). N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation was introduced to the YR dipeptide to facilitate the utilization of this H-bond network by minimal peptide-MLE catalysts. The influence was demonstrated in loading reactions with HA306-318 and sol. HLA-DR1 in the presence of titrated amounts of YR (filled circle), Ac-YR (open circle), YR-NH2 (open triangle), Ac-YR-NH2 (open square) and as control Ac-AR-NH2 (open diamond). b) Impact of elongated side chain spacing. A dipeptide derivative was used in which the side chain spacing was elongated a single CH2-group by using the L-Î²-homotyrosine (Ac-b3hYR-NH2; open circle) instead of tyrosine (Ac-YR-NH2; filled circle). c) Influence of D-amino acids. Complex formation was carried out in the presence of titrated amounts of Ac-YR-NH2 (filled circle), Ac-ry-NH2 (open circle), Ac-rY-NH2 (open triangle), Ac-Ry-NH2 (open square), Ac-yR-NH2 (open diamond), Ac-Yr-NH2 (open triangle up), Ac-yr-NH2 (open hexagon). D-amino acids are indicated by small letters. d) Structural requirements of the catalytic anchor side chain. The P1 pocket of HLA-DR1 interacts preferably with bulky hydrophobic anchor side chains. To compare the catalytic activity with the known structural preferences of P1 the complex formation of HA306-318/HLA-DR1 is shown for Ac-FR-NH2 (filled circle), Ac-WR-NH2 (filled triangle down), Ac-YR-NH2 (filled square), Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle), Ac-MR-NH2 (open triangle down), Ac-IR-NH2 (open square), Ac-VR-NH2 (open diamond), Ac-ER-NH2 (open triangle up).
