In this experiment 10 mM Ac-FR-NH<sub>2</sub>, (filled circle), Ac-YR-NH<sub>2</sub> (filled triangle), Ac-LR-NH<sub>2</sub> (open circle), Ac-AR-NH<sub>2</sub> (open triangle) or no catalysts (cross) was used. The percentage of CLIP/HLA-DR1 complex remaining after indicated time points was determined by ELISA.</p>
