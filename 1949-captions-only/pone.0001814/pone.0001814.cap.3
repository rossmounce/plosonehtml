                Figure 3.  Catalytic dipeptides trigger reversible ligand exchange.To demonstrate that peptide-MLE can catalyze the reversible ligand exchange, complex dissociation of CLIP/HLA-DR1 induced by the peptide-MLE was determined in the absence (left panel) or presence of 200 Âµg/ml free HA306-318 (right panel). In this experiment 10 mM Ac-FR-NH2, (filled circle), Ac-YR-NH2 (filled triangle), Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle), Ac-AR-NH2 (open triangle) or no catalysts (cross) was used. The percentage of CLIP/HLA-DR1 complex remaining after indicated time points was determined by ELISA.
