                Figure 4.  Allele selectivity of catalytic dipeptides.Recombinant soluble HLA-DR1 molecules were mutated inside the P1 pocket and used in loading experiments with ABL908-922, a peptide able to bind to wt as well as to the mutated forms of HLA-DR1 (S. Höpner, unpublished). Upper panels: the spontaneous loading of ABL908-922 is shown for wt HLA-DR1 (β86G), for HLA-DR1 (β86G→V) and HLA-DR1 (β86G→Y). The formation of ABL908-922/HLA-DR complex is expressed in counts per minute (cpm); dashed line indicates background signal. Lower panels: The allele-selective effect of catalytic dipeptides is shown. The influence on HLA-DR loading is shown for Ac-FR-NH2 (filled circle), Ac-WR-NH2 (filled triangle down), Ac-YR-NH2 (filled square) and Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle) and for p-chlorophenol (pCP; cross with dashed line), a simple aromatic MLE compound acting independent of P1 [13]. 1.5 µg/ml ABL908-922 were used for wt HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR1 (β86G→V) and 0.2 µg/ml for HLA-DR1 (β86G→Y). Complex formation is expressed as relative enhancement in reference to the spontaneous complex formation in the absence of any catalyst. The loading was determined by ELISA.
