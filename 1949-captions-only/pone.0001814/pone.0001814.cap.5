                Figure 5.  Enhanced loading of cell surface MHC by peptide-MLE.a) Confocal laser scanning analysis of cell surface loading. 721.221-DRb1GFP cells expressing a GFP-tagged HLA-DR1 molecule were incubated with biotinylated HA306-318 peptide in the absence or presence of Ac-FR-NH2. After staining with streptavidin-Cy5 images were taken by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Scale bar represents 10 µm. b) Impact on APC loading and T cell response. Fibroblast transfectants expressing either wt HLA-DR1 (left panels) or mutated HLA-DR1 (β86G→V; right panels) were incubated with ABL908-922 in the presence of titrated amounts of Ac-FR-NH2 (filled circle), Ac-WR-NH2 (filled triangle), Ac-YR-NH2 (filled square), Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle) or in the absence of any peptide-MLE. Upper panels: Analysis of cell surface loading by FACS. Fibroblast cells were incubated with 12 µg/ml biotinylated ABL908-922. After 4h peptide loading was determined by FACS and is expressed as geometrical mean (geo. mean). Lower panels: Enhancement of the ABL908-922-specific T cell response. Fibroblast cells expressing wt HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR1 (β86G→V) were incubated for 4 h with 150 ng/ml or 300 ng/ml ABL908-922, washed and used to challenge SaABL1/G2, an ABL908-922 specific T cell hybridoma that recognizes the peptide on both HLA-DR1 molecules. The response is expressed as IL-2 release; dashed lines represent the T cell response triggered in the absence of any MLE compounds.
