                Figure 6.  Amplification of the antigen-specific T cell response.a) Enhancement of the in vitro T cell response. The influence of catalytic peptides on the antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response was tested with a mouse T cell hybridoma EvHA/X5 (upper panels) and a human T cell line PD2 (lower panels). Both recognize the HA306-318 antigen in the context of HLA-DR1. The left panels show the influence of titrated amounts of Ac-FR-NH2 (filled circle), Ac-YR-NH2 (filled triangle) or Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle) by EvHA/X5 and PD2 in the presence of 15 or 2 ng/ml HA306-318, respectively. The response in the absence any catalyst is indicated as a dashed line. The right panels are showing the dose response curves of HA306-318 in the presence of 5 mM Ac-FR-NH2 (filled circle) or Ac-LR-NH2 (open circle), 3 mM Ac-YR-NH2 (filled triangle) or in the absence of any peptide-MLE (cross). Dashed line indicates the background. b) Enhancement of the ex vivo T cell response. Lymph node cells were isolated from HLA-DR1tg mice primed with HA306-318 peptide or NY-ESO-1 89-101. The ex vivo response was determined by an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay by challenging the cells with 5 ng/ml HA306-318 (upper panel) or 50 ng/ml NY-ESO-1 89-101 (lower panel), respectively. The bars represent the number of spots detected in the absence (black bar) or presence of 2.5 mM Ac-FR-NH2 (grey bar). Each spot originates from a single IFN-γ secreting cell; dashed line indicates the background signal.
