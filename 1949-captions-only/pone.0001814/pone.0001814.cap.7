The floor composed of the β-plated sheats is depicted in magenta, the α-helices of the starting structure are shown in red, α-helices of the structure obtained after 15 ns are shown in blue. The approximate position of P1 is indicated. While the dynamic was carried out with all extracellular domains, only the binding site is shown (α<sub>1</sub>-, β<sub>1</sub>-domain). b) Dynamic of the peptide-MLE stabilized MHC molecule. The same MD calculation was carried out as in <a href="#pone-0001814-g007">Fig. 7a</a> except that coordinates of an HLA-DR1 molecule were used, in which prior to the MD calculation the peptide-MLE Ac-FR-NH<sub>2</sub> was docked into the P1 pocket. c) P1 pocket in the peptide loaded MHC complex. The image shows a cross-section of the HLA-DR1/HA306-318 complex. The surface of the MHC molecule is shown in yellow, the peptide ligand in red; position of the P1 pocket is indicated. d) Loss of P1 in the empty MHC molecule. The same cross-section shown in <a href="#pone-0001814-g007">Fig. 7c</a> for the peptide-loaded MHC is shown here for the empty molecule obtained after 15 ns of MD calculation. In this structure the P1 pocket can no longer be located.</p>
