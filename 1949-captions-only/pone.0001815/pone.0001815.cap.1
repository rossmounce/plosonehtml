                Figure 1.  Reaction scheme of the Pdx1 and Pdx2 proteins.The PfPdx2 enzyme depends on its interaction with PfPdx1 for glutaminase activity. The Pdx1 enzyme is responsible for the de novo synthesis of PLP by utilizing the substrates ribose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ammonia, whereas the latter is provided by deaminating of glutamine by Pdx2 via substrate channelling to the attached PfPdx1 protein. The reactions of each enzyme are indicated.
