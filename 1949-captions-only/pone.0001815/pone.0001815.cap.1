The Pdx1 enzyme is responsible for the <em>de novo</em> synthesis of PLP by utilizing the substrates ribose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ammonia, whereas the latter is provided by deaminating of glutamine by Pdx2 via substrate channelling to the attached <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 protein. The reactions of each enzyme are indicated.</p>
