                Figure 2.  (A) Homology model of one plasmodial Pdx1 monomer showing the analyzed amino acid residues as indicated.(B) The interface region between two PfPdx1 proteins within the same hexameric ring illustrating the amino acid residues R85, H88 and E91, which are involved in Pdx1:Pdx1 binding. The model was generated by Swiss-Model [30] and visualised by PyMOL (www.pymol.org).
