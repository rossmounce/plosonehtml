Identical (*) and similar (:) amino acid residues are indicated below the protein sequence. Gaps (-) were introduced into the sequence to maximize homology and to compensate for the different chain lengths. Mutated amino acid residues, which are predicted to be participating within the active site and the additional phosphate binding site, are labelled above by (+) and (ยง), respectively. The exchanged amino acid residues, proposed to be involved in the Pdx1:Pdx1 interaction, are labelled above the sequence by (#).</p>
