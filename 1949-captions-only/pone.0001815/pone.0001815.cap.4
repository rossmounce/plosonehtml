The co-purification was visualized by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Strep antibody (IBA) and the HIS-probe-HRP (Pierce) as described in <a href="#s4">Material and Methods</a>. (A) Co-purification of the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 wild-type (3) and the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 DKK (D26A, K83A and K151A) triple mutant protein (4) with the <em>Pf</em>Pdx2HIS wild-type. As a control the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 wild-type (WT) (1) and the <em>Pf</em>Pdx2HIS (2) single proteins were purified via Strep-tag affinity chromatography and applied in Western blot analysis. (B) Co-purification of the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 ERR (5), <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 RHE (6) as well as the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 H88A (7) and <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 E91A (8) mutant proteins with the plasmodial Pdx2HIS wild-type. (Note: The <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 R85A mutant was not recombinantly expressible.) (C) The gate-keeper <em>Pf</em>Pdx2HIS E53Y (9) and <em>Pf</em>Pdx2HIS R154W (10) mutants were co-purified with the <em>Pf</em>Pdx1 wild-type protein via its Strep-tag.</p>
