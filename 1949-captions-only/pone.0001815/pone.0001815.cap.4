                Figure 4.  Western blot analysis of the co-purified PfPdx1 and PfPdx2HIS proteins.Cell homogenates of the recombinant expression of the plasmodial Pdx1 protein and Pdx2HIS protein (6Ã— His-tag instead of a Strep-tag) were mixed and subsequently purified via Strep-tag affinity chromatography of the PfPdx1 protein. The co-purification was visualized by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Strep antibody (IBA) and the HIS-probe-HRP (Pierce) as described in Material and Methods. (A) Co-purification of the PfPdx1 wild-type (3) and the PfPdx1 DKK (D26A, K83A and K151A) triple mutant protein (4) with the PfPdx2HIS wild-type. As a control the PfPdx1 wild-type (WT) (1) and the PfPdx2HIS (2) single proteins were purified via Strep-tag affinity chromatography and applied in Western blot analysis. (B) Co-purification of the PfPdx1 ERR (5), PfPdx1 RHE (6) as well as the PfPdx1 H88A (7) and PfPdx1 E91A (8) mutant proteins with the plasmodial Pdx2HIS wild-type. (Note: The PfPdx1 R85A mutant was not recombinantly expressible.) (C) The gate-keeper PfPdx2HIS E53Y (9) and PfPdx2HIS R154W (10) mutants were co-purified with the PfPdx1 wild-type protein via its Strep-tag.
