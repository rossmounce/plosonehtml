                Figure 5.  Static light scattering of the plasmodial Pdx1 DKK and RHE mutant proteins in comparison to the wild-type (WT).In order to analyze the structural conformation of the PfPdx1 proteins, size exclusion chromatography was performed with the PfPdx1 WT (—), PfPdx1 DKK (----) and the PfPdx1 RHE (……) mutant proteins and the masses measured by static light scattering. The corresponding molecular masses and the proposed structural assemblies are given below. Aliquots of the three peak fractions were subsequently analysed by SDS-PAGE, which confirmed the presence of PfPdx1 (data not shown).
