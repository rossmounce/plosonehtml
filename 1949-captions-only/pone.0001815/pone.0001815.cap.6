The proposed structural conformations are given above the peak fractions. (B) Affect of mutations on Pdx1 interactions between hexamers. Monomers coloured in green and violet belong to the upper hexameric crown and the monomer coloured in salmon belongs to the lower hexameric crown. Mutations in R85, H88 and E91 of the upper crown affect the conformation of loop 113–119, which interacts with loop-helix 179–191 in the lower crown. Helix 88–98 interacts directly with Pdx2 (not shown).</p>
