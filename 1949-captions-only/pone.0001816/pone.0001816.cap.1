Expression patterns are represented as a color map. Each row represents a gene; each column represents a sample. The level of expression of each gene in each sample is represented using a yellowâ€“blue color scale (yellow: high expression). Pathways represented are the following: (A) Myc, c-Src, beta-catenin, E2F3, and H-Ras, from the study by Bild <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Bild1">[3]</a>; (B) erbB-2 (HER2), EGFR, MEK, Raf, and MAPK from Creighton <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Creighton1">[4]</a>; (C) the cell cycle from Whitfield <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Whitfield1">[10]</a>; (D) androgen receptor (AR) signaling, from Deprimo <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-DePrimo1">[11]</a>; (E) AR signaling, from Chen <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Chen1">[12]</a>; (F) Myc, from Coller <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Coller1">[13]</a>; (G) cyclin D1, from Lamb <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Lamb1">[2]</a>; (H) Akt, from Majumder <em>et al</em>. <a href="#pone.0001816-Majumder1">[14]</a>. (I) Graphical representation of the significance of gene overlap (by one-sided Fisher's exact test, using as the reference population the entire set of 14130 genes represented among any of the array platforms) between the various pathway signatures (focusing here on the sets of genes up-regulated in each signature).</p>
