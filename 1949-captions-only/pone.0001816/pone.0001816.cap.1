                Figure 1.  Gene expression patterns indicative of oncogenic pathway deregulation.RNA profiling datasets were collected from various published studies (described in Table 2) in which a particular pathway was activated in an experimental model. Expression patterns are represented as a color map. Each row represents a gene; each column represents a sample. The level of expression of each gene in each sample is represented using a yellowâ€“blue color scale (yellow: high expression). Pathways represented are the following: (A) Myc, c-Src, beta-catenin, E2F3, and H-Ras, from the study by Bild et al. [3]; (B) erbB-2 (HER2), EGFR, MEK, Raf, and MAPK from Creighton et al. [4]; (C) the cell cycle from Whitfield et al. [10]; (D) androgen receptor (AR) signaling, from Deprimo et al. [11]; (E) AR signaling, from Chen et al. [12]; (F) Myc, from Coller et al. [13]; (G) cyclin D1, from Lamb et al. [2]; (H) Akt, from Majumder et al. [14]. (I) Graphical representation of the significance of gene overlap (by one-sided Fisher's exact test, using as the reference population the entire set of 14130 genes represented among any of the array platforms) between the various pathway signatures (focusing here on the sets of genes up-regulated in each signature).
