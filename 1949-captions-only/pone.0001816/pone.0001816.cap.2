Enrichment is defined as a significant number of genes in the experimental set being located at or near the top of a population of genes rank-ordered by a given metric applied to the human tumor dataset. (B) Results of enrichment analysis in four different gene expression profile datasets of human prostate tumors <a href="#pone.0001816-Glinsky1">[5]</a>â€“<a href="#pone.0001816-Singh1">[8]</a>. Patterns of consensus among the various datasets (i.e. patterns observed in at least 2 or 3 datasets) are also represented. For each oncogene-to-pathway association, a red square indicates that genes in the pathway were enriched within the top genes most correlated with the oncogene. Anti-enrichment (blue square) indicates that genes in the pathway overlapped with the genes most anti-correlated with the oncogene. Associations between a given gene and its corresponding oncogenic pathway signature are highlighted with black outline.</p>
