                Figure 2.  Patterns of enrichment involving selected oncogenes (KLK3 i.e. PSA, MYC, SRC, ERBB2, EGFR, CCND1 i.e. cyclin D1, and AKT1) and their corresponding pathway signature genes.(A) Schematic overview of Q1-Q2 enrichment analysis. Enrichment is defined as a significant number of genes in the experimental set being located at or near the top of a population of genes rank-ordered by a given metric applied to the human tumor dataset. (B) Results of enrichment analysis in four different gene expression profile datasets of human prostate tumors [5]â€“[8]. Patterns of consensus among the various datasets (i.e. patterns observed in at least 2 or 3 datasets) are also represented. For each oncogene-to-pathway association, a red square indicates that genes in the pathway were enriched within the top genes most correlated with the oncogene. Anti-enrichment (blue square) indicates that genes in the pathway overlapped with the genes most anti-correlated with the oncogene. Associations between a given gene and its corresponding oncogenic pathway signature are highlighted with black outline.
