                Figure 1.  siRNA knockdown of LRP5 and LPR6 mRNA and protein expression in HeLa cells.A) RT-PCR analysis of LRP5 and LRP6 levels in HeLa cells transfected either with cognate pools of siRNAs or with siRNAs directed against luciferase (negative control). These experiments were each performed with triplicate samples and the mean average results are shown along with the standard deviation of the data indicated by error bars. B) Immunoblot analysis of LRP5 and LRP6 protein levels in cells transfected with the pools of siRNAs described in panel A. To control for equivalent cellular protein levels imunoblot analysis was also conducted on tubulin. C) The relative levels of LRP5 and LRP6 proteins in each sample shown in panel B were quantitated relative to the levels of tubulin in each sample using the fluorescence-scanning method described in materials and methods.
