                Figure 2.  Reduced levels of LRP6 and/or LRP5 do not influence the toxin sensitivity of HeLa cells.siRNA-transfected cells were incubated with varying amounts of PA83 (as shown) and with 5×10−10 M LFNDTA. These experiments were performed with triplicate samples and the results shown are the mean average values with the standard deviation of the data indicated with error bars.
