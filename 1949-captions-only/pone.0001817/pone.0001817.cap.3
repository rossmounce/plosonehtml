                Figure 3.  Reduced levels of LRP6 and/or LRP5 do not influence the kinetics of PA63(7) pore formation in HeLa cells.A) The kinetics of PA pore formation in siRNA-transfected HeLa cells was evaluated as described in materials and methods. The cells were lysed at different time points after initiating toxin entry (0, 15, 25, 35 mins) and the protein lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PA antibody to detect the SDS-resistant oligomeric PA63(7) pore species. (B) Quantitation of the levels of SDS-resistant pore species in the different time point samples shown in panel A. As described in materials and methods, the relative levels shown were determined by comparing the pore:tubulin ratio in each sample. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments.
