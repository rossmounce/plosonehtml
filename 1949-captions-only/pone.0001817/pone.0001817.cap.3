The cells were lysed at different time points after initiating toxin entry (0, 15, 25, 35 mins) and the protein lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PA antibody to detect the SDS-resistant oligomeric PA<sub>63(7)</sub> pore species. (B) Quantitation of the levels of SDS-resistant pore species in the different time point samples shown in panel A. As described in <a href="#s3">materials and methods</a>, the relative levels shown were determined by comparing the pore:tubulin ratio in each sample. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments.</p>
