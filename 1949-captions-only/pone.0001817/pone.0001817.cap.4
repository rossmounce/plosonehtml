Protein lysates were prepared at different time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-N-terminal MEK-1 antibody. Ku86, which is not an LF substrate, was also immunblotted as a loading control. B) The relative signal obtained with the N-terminal MEK1 antibody was compared with that associated with Ku86 in each sample shown in panel A. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments.</p>
