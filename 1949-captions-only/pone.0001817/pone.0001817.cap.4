                Figure 4.  Reduced levels of LRP6 and/or LRP5 do not influence the kinetics of MEK1 cleavage in HeLa cells.A) HeLa cells transfected with different siRNAs were incubated with LeTx. Protein lysates were prepared at different time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-N-terminal MEK-1 antibody. Ku86, which is not an LF substrate, was also immunblotted as a loading control. B) The relative signal obtained with the N-terminal MEK1 antibody was compared with that associated with Ku86 in each sample shown in panel A. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments.
