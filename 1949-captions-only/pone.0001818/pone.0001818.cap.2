                Figure 2.  PCR and western analysis of transgenic T0 plants.The fragment of 440bp from the T-DNA insert was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from different events of transgenic rice (A). The G6 expressed in transgenic rice plants were detected by its antiserum from rabbits (B). Lane 1 to 4, transgenic event R450-2, R450-5, R450-6 and R450-7, respectively; CK, non-transformed rice as the negative control; M, 100bp ladder (A) or 48 kDa pre-stained protein size maker (B).
