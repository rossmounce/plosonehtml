                Figure 3.  Sensitivity test of transgenic rice plants to bentazon or glyphosate.The T0 transgenic rice plants along with non-transgenic ones were cultured in solution in greenhouse and sprayed with 1000 mg/L bentazon (A) or 20 mM glyphosate (B). The plants in panel C were not sprayed. The pictures were taken 7 days after the spray. Independent transgenic events (R450-2, R450-5, R450-6, and R450-7) along with untransformed rice (CK) were tested. The plants in each panel were in the same order.
