                Figure 5.  Field trial for selective termination of the transgenic rice.The T1 transgenic plants and the conventional control rice plants were sprayed with Bentazon at 1500 mg/L. The picture was taken 7 days after the spray. CK, conventional rice; R450-2 and R450-5 are T1 transgenic rice plants of the event R450-2 and R450-5, respectively. The surviving plants in the R450-2 rows were segregates not carrying the transgene.
