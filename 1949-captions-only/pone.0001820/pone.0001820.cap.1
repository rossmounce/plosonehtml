                Figure 1.  An illustration of four different binding site configurations for a TF that is associated with two motif models (blue and green boxes).The diagram illustrates the upstream promoter region for a gene, where the direction of transcription is indicated by the direction of the arrows. The arrows are located at the transcription start sites.
