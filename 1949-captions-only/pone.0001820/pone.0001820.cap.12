<h4>Predicting binding site positions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec11.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec11.p1"></a><p>Our final simulation concerns inferring the probability of having a binding site at a single nucleotide position. Although our proposed methods are primarily designed to process each promoter sequence as a whole, it is also useful to be able to infer binding probabilities at a higher resolution, in particular, at each nucleotide position. Inferring the binding probabilities at each base pair location is more challenging from the computational point of view. In particular, the efficient recursive algorithm developed for the likelihood method cannot be applied. The inference can, however, be easily performed in our Bayesian framework using our MCMC sampler. The binding probability at each base pair location is achieved by integrating out all other locations (see ‘Binding probabilities at single nucleotide resolution’ Section more details). <a href="#pone-0001820-g013">Figure 13</a> shows a representative result of binding probabilities for SRF on the Actc1 and M23768 promoters, SP1 on the Myod1 promoter, and TEAD1 on the Myh6 promoter, with and without evolutionary conservation as an additional data source. These results correspond to the data shown in <a href="#pone-0001820-g006">Figure 6</a>. The Bayesian inference (left column) is able to find and assign a high probability to all the annotated sites, although some presumably non-functional (i.e., non-annotated) sites are identified as well. The use of evolutionary conservation improves the performance of the Bayesian inference by “biasing” the binding sites towards conserved regions. In particular, all the annotated (resp. non-annotated) binding sites are assigned a higher (resp. lower) binding probability than without conservation data. It is also worth noting that our probabilistic inference method does not assign a zero probability to any of the possible binding sites. This is useful because the motif models are known to contain uncertainty and particularly because the binding prediction is based on noisy data. Hence, a probabilistic approach is more flexible and principled.</p>
