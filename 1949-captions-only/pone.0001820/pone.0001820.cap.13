                Figure 13.  Estimated binding probabilities on a single base pair resolution for SRF on (a) the Actc1 and (c) M23768 promoters, (e) SP1 on the Myod1 promoter, and (g) TEAD1 on the Myh6 promoter without any additional information.Subplots (b), (d), (f) and (h) show the same results but with evolutionary conservation as the additional data source. The blue and red graphs indicate the start of the binding sites. The annotated binding sites are shown with gray vertical bars. These results correspond to Figure 6.
