                Figure 4.  Histograms of the estimated binding probabilities for the likelihood and Bayesian methods with varying prior strengths.(a) Likelihood M = 50. (b) Bayesian M = 50. (c) Likelihood M = 100. (d) Bayesian M = 100. x-axes correspond to the estimated binding probability and y-axes show the fraction of negative (blue) and positive (red) test cases. Histogram bin edges are located at , i = 0,1,â€¦,10, although the two histograms are shown side by side.
