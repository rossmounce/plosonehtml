                Figure 6.  An illustration of the data fusion for TF binding prediction.(a) Annotated binding sites for SRF on Actc1 promoter. (b) Annotated binding site for SRF on M23768 promoter. (c) Annotated binding site for SP1 on Myod1 promoter. (d) Annotated binding site for TEAD1 on Myh6 promoter. Figure keys are as follows. Î¸(i): motif models for each TF, Conserv.: sequence conservation probabilities computed by PhastCons [72], Nuc. pos.: nucleosome occupancy probabilities estimated by a yeast nucleosome model from [74], and Reg. pot.: regulatory potential log-likelihood scores from [73]. The additional evidences range between 0 and 1. Promoters sequence lengths are 2000 base pairs in (a), (c) and (d), and 500 base pairs in (b). See text for more details.
