Î¸<sup>(<em>i</em>)</sup>: motif models for each TF, Conserv.: sequence conservation probabilities computed by PhastCons <a href="#pone.0001820-Siepel1">[72]</a>, Nuc. pos.: nucleosome occupancy probabilities estimated by a yeast nucleosome model from <a href="#pone.0001820-Segal1">[74]</a>, and Reg. pot.: regulatory potential log-likelihood scores from <a href="#pone.0001820-Taylor1">[73]</a>. The additional evidences range between 0 and 1. Promoters sequence lengths are 2000 base pairs in (a), (c) and (d), and 500 base pairs in (b). See text for more details.</p>
