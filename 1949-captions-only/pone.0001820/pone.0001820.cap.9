<h4>Modeling combinatorial regulation</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p1"></a><p>Gene regulation in higher organisms commonly requires multiple TFs. Thus, combinatorial regulation by several TFs is another important problem to study. The main difference between a single TF and multiple TFs regulating a gene is that combinatorial regulation requires all TFs to have at least one binding site for (at least) one of their motif models. Although multiple regulatory proteins can also form a complex and the complex can regulate a target gene via a single binding site, we only consider regulation via multiple binding sites, the single binding site case being similar with our previous analysis. Statistical inference for combinatorial regulation can be naturally addressed in our probabilistic framework. For that purpose, we propose to use both the likelihood and Bayesian methods (see ‘Combinatorial regulation’ Section for more computational details).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p2"></a><p>Combinatorial regulation by multiple TFs is less well-known and fewer combinatorial annotated binding sites are reported in databases or even in the literature (see <a href="#pone.0001820-KelMargoulis1">[79]</a>). We construct a sufficiently large test set for computational simulations from our test set of annotated binding sites. For each promoter sequence, we pair different TFs that have annotated binding sites on it and consider these TF pairs to jointly regulate a given gene. We add a further constraint that, for each pair of TFs, at least one annotated binding site pair is within a cluster, i.e., sufficiently close to each other, as is typically the case in real promoters as well <a href="#pone.0001820-Levine1">[76]</a>. We construct a negative set such that approximately half of the TF pairs have no annotated binding sites and half of the TF pairs have an annotated binding site for one TF but not for the other.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec9.p3"></a><p>The problem of inferring combinatorial regulation among many TFs becomes computationally expensive because there are <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001820.e008&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> ways to choose <em>k</em> TFs from the set of <em>n</em> TFs. Inference for combinatorial regulation can only be done exactly using an MCMC sampler. This can become a problem since Bayesian inference is considerably slower than the likelihood-based inference. Therefore, in addition to Bayesian inference for combinatorial regulation, we also consider here a naive approximation that estimates the probability of combinatorial regulation by the product of individual TF binding probabilities. <a href="#pone-0001820-g010">Figure 10</a> shows ROC results and the corresponding histograms for the two different methods. Surprisingly, the approximative method performs slightly better than the Bayesian method. <a href="#pone-0001820-g010">Figures 10 (b) and (c)</a> seem to suggest that the Bayesian method assigns higher probabilities to some of the negative cases and, thereby, results in slightly worse ROC curve than the likelihood method. Note that, given the more difficult problem of finding multiple weak sequence signals, histograms of combinatorial regulation probabilities for the positive set (red bars) now span the whole range from 0 to 1.</p>
