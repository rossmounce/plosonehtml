                Figure 1.  Comparison between the expression profiles of PHO81 and its two homologs SPL2 and YPL110C in the eight TFPE experiments of Pho4p.Red and green colors represent up- and down-regulation, respectively. The brightness of the color is proportional to the absolute expression ratio.
