                Figure 1.  Schematic overview of the BaFiso assay system.BaFiso consists of paired isogenic cell lines that have been engineered to acquire IL-3 autonomous growth through constitutive activation of Akt or Stat5 signaling. The two cell lines to be compared are individually tagged with either yellow or cyan fluorescent proteins. Equal numbers of yellow and cyan cells were co-cultured, treated with compounds and the change in the relative cell number was calculated on the basis of the distinct fluorescent proteins measured. Our strategy aims to identify lead compounds that specifically kill test cells with activated Akt signaling (yellow cells) and that spare the otherwise isogenic control cells (cyan cells).
