Photos were taken 24 h after transferring the cells to medium without IL-3 or in the presence of 3 ng/ml of the recombinant cytokine. (B) Measurement of cell viability using the Alamar blue assay. Alamar blue fluoresces and changes color in response to chemical reduction, and the extent of the conversion is a reflection of cell viability. Metabolic conversion of Alamar blue to its reduced, pink derivative upon cytokine-deprivation (−IL-3) or in its presence (+IL-3). (C), Bar graph showing the results of Alamar Blue cell viability assay. Maximal absorbance of the reduced and oxidized forms of AlamarBlue™, 570 and 600 nm was measured using Victor 1420 multilabel counter 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal. The percentage of cell survival was calculated compared with control cells in the presence of 3 ng/ml of IL3. The data represents three independent experiments performed in triplicate samples. (D) Time course of cell viability upon IL-3 withdrawal. Cells were washed twice in PBS and seeded in media lacking IL-3. Viability was assessed at 12 hour intervals by trypan blue exclusions followed by cell countings. Black rhombs and open squares represent percentage viability of BY and BC cells, respectively. Open triangles and black circles represent percentage viability of BYA and BCS cells, respectively. Data are presented as mean±SD from three independent experiments.</p>
