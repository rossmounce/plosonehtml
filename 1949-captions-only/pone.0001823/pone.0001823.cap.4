                Figure 4.  The analysis of Akt phosphorylation in BaFiso cell lines.Immunoblot analysis of total lysates from the Ba/F3 derived cell lines BY, BC, BYA and BCS. Cells were seeded, grown to 80% confluence and starved for 12 h in IL-3 free medium (âˆ’IL-3) or maintained in medium containing 3 ng/ml of the recombinant cytokine (+IL-3). Relevant proteins are indicated by arrows in the blot from a representative experiment.
