                Figure 5.  Validation of BaFiso assay using a panel of test compounds.(A) Analysis of the general toxicity of compound treatment. The total cell numbers in each well were determined by nuclear counterstain with the far-red fluorescent DNA probe DRAQ5. The number of DRAQ5-stained nuclei was determined after exposure to 30 µM Cisplatin (Cis), 100 µM Minerval (Min), 500 nM Akt Inhibitor X (AIX), 20 µM Genistein (Gen), 1 nM Leptomycin B (LMB), 20 nM Staurosporine (Stau), 1 µM UCN-01, 20 nM Raf1 Kinase Inhibitor (RKI), 20 µM LY294002 (LY), 10 µM Etoposide (Eto) and 1 mM lithium chloride (LiCl) for 12 hours and compared to vehicle treatment. (B) Equal numbers of BCS and BYA cells were co-cultured in IL-3-free medium. We exposed the paired BaFiso cell lines to 3 µM, 30 µM and 300 µM Cisplatin (Cis), 25 µM, 100 µM, 200 µM Minerval (Min), 50 nM, 500 nM, 5 µM Akt Inhibitor X (AIX), 200 nM, 20 µM, 50 µM Genistein (Gen), 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 4 nM Leptomycin B (LMB), 2 nM, 20 nM, 10 µM Staurosporine (Stau), 200 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM UCN-01; 5 nM, 20 nM, 200 nM Raf1 Kinase Inhibitor (RKI), 1 µM, 20 µM, 50 µM LY294002 (LY), 100 nM, 10 µM, 100 µM Etoposide (Eto) and 100 µM, 1 mM, 10 mM lithium chloride (LiCl), and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a negative control (striped bar). Three images specific for ECFP, EYFP or DRAQ5 from each well were acquired using BD Pathway Bioimager. The ECFP/EYFP ratio was determined by dividing the number of ECFP positive cells by the number of EYFP positive cells. Light, dark grey and black bars represent low, medium and high concentrations of the corresponding compounds, respectively. The data shown here represents three independent experiments. The average Z' value for BaFiso was 0.53. (C) Untreated, co-cultured BaFiso cells imaged before exposure to Akt Inhibitor X and (D) 12 h after treatment with 5 µM AIX.
