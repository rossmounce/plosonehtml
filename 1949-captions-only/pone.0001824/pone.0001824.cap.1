                Figure 1.  mRNA expression profiles during in vitro and in vivo growth of IVIAT-identified and paralog/similar B. anthracis genes.Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on RNA recovered from in vitro grown B. anthracis (Ames strain cells grown in BHI and air; late-log phase) and compared to RNA recovered from mice infected with vegetative Ames strain B. anthracis via intravenous injection. RNA from mice was isolated from spleens 18 hr post-infection. Transcript numbers on the Y-axis are normalized against 16S rRNA. Displayed are gene profiles of B. anthracis genes up-regulated in vivo compared to in vitro. In bar graphs, expression levels represent mean values; error bars represent standard deviations (SD). In summary table, expression given as mRNA transcript copies (× 10−5) per copy of 16S rRNA.
