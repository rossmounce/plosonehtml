(A) A<sub>595</sub> readings were recorded every 2 min. and reported as a percentage of starting A<sub>595</sub>. Buffer-only controls were not different for cultures containing <em>B. cereus, B. subtilis,</em> or <em>E. coli</em>. (B) Dilutions of cells were plated prior to addition of BA0485 and BA2446 proteins and then again following 20 min of incubation with buffer alone or buffer containing exogenous BA0485 or BA2446, and CFU are reported as percentage of the starting CFU. (C, D) BA0485, BA2446, or buffer alone were added to cell suspensions of <em>B. anthracis</em>, <em>B. cereus, B. subtilis,</em> and <em>E. coli</em>, and incubated for 20 min. Bacterial morphological changes were only evident following protein addition to <em>B. anthracis</em> (D); representative <em>B. cereus</em> samples are shown (C). Gram stains were performed and all images were captured at 1000×.</p>
