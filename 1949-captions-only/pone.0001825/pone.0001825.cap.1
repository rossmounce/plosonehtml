                Figure 1.  Basic compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism.The basic ordered mechanism for the general reaction , with a = [A], b = [B], p = [P], and q = [Q] is illustrated. The four states refer to unbound enzyme (state 1), enzyme-substrate A complex (E·A, state 2), enzyme-substrate A-substrate B complex (E·AB, state 3), and enzyme-product Q complex (E·Q, state 4). The four steps of the catalytic cycle are detailed in Equation (1).
