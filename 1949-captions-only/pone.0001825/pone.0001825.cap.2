                Figure 2.  Fits to kinetic data from [14] on the forward operation of kidney enzyme.Measured flux as a function of substrate concentrations was obtained from Figures 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 of [14]. Initial fluxes (µmol of COASH (or CIT) synthesized per minute per µg of enzyme) measured at the substrate concentrations indicated in the figures. For A, B, and D, the initial product (CIT and COASH) concentrations are zero. C. Flux measured with COASH added in various concentrations to investigate the kinetics of product inhibition. All data were obtained at pH = 8.1 at 28°C. Model fits are plotted as solid lines.
