                Figure 3.  Fits to kinetic data from [14] on the reverse operation of kidney enzyme.Measured reverse flux as a function of concentrations of CIT and COASH was obtained from Figures 4 and 5 of [14]. Initial fluxes (µmol of COASH (or CIT) synthesized per minute per µg of enzyme) measured at the substrate concentrations indicated in the figures. All data were obtained at pH = 8.1 at 28°C. Model fits are plotted as solid lines.
