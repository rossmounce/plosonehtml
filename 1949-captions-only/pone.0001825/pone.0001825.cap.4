For all cases the product (CIT and COASH) concentrations are zero and total substrate and inhibitor concentrations are indicated in the figure. A and B report data obtained with no inhibitors present. C. The relative activity (normalized to its maximum) of the enzyme is plotted as functions of [ATP], [ADP], and [AMP] measured at [ACCOA] = 11 µM and [OAA] = 1.9 µM. D. The measured flux is plotted as a function of [ACCOA] at [OAA] = 34 µM with ATP, ADP, and AMP present as indicated in the figure. All data were obtained at pH = 7.4 at 25°C. Model fits are plotted as solid lines.</p>
