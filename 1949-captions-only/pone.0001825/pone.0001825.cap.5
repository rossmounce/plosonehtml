                Figure 5.  Impact of [Mg2+] and pH on liver enzyme.Measured flux in arbitrary units was obtained from Figures 13 and 14 of [15]. A. The relative activity (normalized to its maximum) of the enzyme is plotted as functions of [ATP] at [Mg2+] = 0 mM (shaded circles), 0.5 mM (shaded triangles), 1.0 mM (shaded squares), 2.0 mM (open circles), and 4.0 mM (diamonds). B. Relative activity is plotted as a function of pH. Substrate concentations are [ACCOA] = 21 µM and [OAA] = 8.6 µM. All data were obtained at 25°C. pH is fixed a 7.4 for A. Model fits are plotted as solid lines.
