A. Flux is plotted as a function inhibitor ATP concentration for [ACCOA] = 16 µM and [OAA] = 1.13 and 2.25 µM. B. Flux is plotted as a function of [ACCOA] at [OAA] = 5 µM at three different concentrations of ATP indicated in figure. C. Flux is plotted as a function of [ACCOA] at [OAA] = 3.1 µM at three different concentrations of SCOA indicated in figure. All data were obtained at pH = 7.4 at 21°C. Model fits are plotted as solid lines.</p>
