                Figure 7.  Analysis using random-order model of Equation (26).Data and conditions in A, B, C, and D are the same as for Figure 2. Data and conditions for E and F are the same as for Figures 3A and 3B, respectively Parameter values for solid line model predictions are Vmax = 0.320 µmol·min−1· µg−1, KmB = 6.20 µM, KmP = 8.00 µM, KeA = 1.35 µM, KeB = 1.10 µM, KeP = 21.6 nM, KeQ = 0.150 µM. Parameter values for dashed line model predictions are Vmax = 0.526 µmol·min−1·µg−1, KmB = 36.6 µM, KmP = 80.792 mM, KeA = 3.08 nM, KeB = 10.8 nM, KeP = 0.152 µM, KeQ = 17.0 µM.
