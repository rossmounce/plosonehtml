                Figure 1.  Transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells.A: differential migration of breast cancer cells across HUVEC monolayers pre-activated with TNF-α. B: migration of MDA-MB-231 across HUVEC monolayers in the presence of anti-E-selectin, anti-ICAM-1, and anti-VLA-4 antibodies (25 µg/ml each), respectively. HUVEC monolayers were pre-incubated with endothelial medium containing 25 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h, and migration was terminated after overnight incubation at 37°C. All data are expressed as the mean±SD (n = 3) of a typical experiment and similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments.
