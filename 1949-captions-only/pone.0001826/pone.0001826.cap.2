                Figure 2.  Binding of soluble exE-selectin/Fc recombinant to breast cancer cells via sLex moieties on the tumor cell surface.Trypsin-elicited breast cancer cells were surface labeled with soluble exE-selectin/Fc or Fc-only as detailed in the Methods. The bound Fc recombinants were detected by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fc and measured by FACS. In separated experiments, tumor cells were treated with neuraminidase to remove surface sLex moieties before exE-selectin/Fc binding.
