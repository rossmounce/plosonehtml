                Figure 3.  Localization of potential E-selectin ligand(s) on the breast cancer cell surface.A: After blocking with 5% normal goat serum in PBS, breast cancer cells cultured in a tissue culture dish were incubated with exE-selectin/Fc (10 µg/ml) in blocking solution for 1 h at 4°C. Following three washes, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde (5 min, 20°C) and the bound exE-selectin/Fc was detected by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit Fc. Cell surface labeling with Fc-only served as a background control. B: To determine the localization of E-selectin ligand on metastatic tumor cell surfaces during migration, MDA-MB-231 cells were double labeled with soluble exE-selectin/Fc for E-selectin ligand (left panel) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for F-actin (right panel).
