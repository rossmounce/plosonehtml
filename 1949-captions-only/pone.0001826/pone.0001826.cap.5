B: Western blot analysis of the 170 kD purified protein with antibodies specific to sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and different CD44 variant isoforms, respectively. C: Specific binding of the 170 kD purified protein (CD44v4) to E-selectin through sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties. The data are represented as the meanÂ±SD of three different experiments.</p>
