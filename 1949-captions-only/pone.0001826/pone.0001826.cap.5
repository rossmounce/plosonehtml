                Figure 5.  Identification of the CD44 variant isoform in metastatic breast cancer cells as CD44v4.A: RT-PCR amplification and DNA sequence of CD44 extracellular domain from various breast cancer cells and colonic HT29 cells. B: Western blot analysis of the 170 kD purified protein with antibodies specific to sLex moieties and different CD44 variant isoforms, respectively. C: Specific binding of the 170 kD purified protein (CD44v4) to E-selectin through sLex moieties. The data are represented as the meanÂ±SD of three different experiments.
