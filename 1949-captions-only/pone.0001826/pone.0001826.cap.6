                Figure 6.  The role of CD44v4 in mediating breast cancer cell adhesion and transmigration.A and B: siRNA transfection-induced CD44v4 downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells as shown by Western blot (A) and immunofluorescence labeling (B), respectively. C and D: reduction of MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to immobilized recombinant exE-selectin/Fc (C) and TNF-Î± pre-activated HUVEC monolayers (D) after CD44v4 downregulation via siRNA. E: reduction of MDA-MB-231 cell transendothelial migration by CD44v4 downregulation. The data are representative of three independent experiments.
