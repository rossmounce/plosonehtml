C and D: reduction of MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to immobilized recombinant exE-selectin/Fc (C) and TNF-Î± pre-activated HUVEC monolayers (D) after CD44v4 downregulation via siRNA. E: reduction of MDA-MB-231 cell transendothelial migration by CD44v4 downregulation. The data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
