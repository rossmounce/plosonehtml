(A) <em>caps-lacZ</em> expression in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar eye disc. Staining with anti-β−gal revealed <em>caps-lacZ</em> expression in the furrow and in subsets of cells after the furrow. (A'–A”) Co-staining with anti-Elav (a photoreceptor marker) and anti-Senseless (R8 specific marker) identified the cells eventually expressing high levels of <em>caps-lacZ</em> as photoreceptor R8. (B) <em>trn-lacZ</em> expression in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar eye disc. Staining with anti-β−gal revealed <em>trn-lacZ</em> expression in the furrow and in a different subset of cells from <em>caps-lacZ</em> after the furrow. (B'–B”) Co-staining with anti-BarH1 (R1 and R6 specific marker) and anti-Prospero (R7 and cone cell marker) identified R1, 6 and 7 as the photoreceptors expressing high levels of <em>trn-lacZ</em>.</p>
