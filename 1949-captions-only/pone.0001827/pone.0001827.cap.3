                Figure 3.  Generation of caps null and caps trn double null mutants.(A) Generating capspB1 null. Two piggyBac element insertion lines were used for FLP-FRT based recombination to delete the entire coding sequence of caps, which is contained in exon 5. pBacRBe03402 is inserted upstream of exon 4 and pBacRBe03153 is inserted downstream of exon 5. Upon heatshock, recombination occurs between these two piggyBac elements, deleting the intervening region, regenerating a complete piggyBac element from half of each of the original piggyBacs. The deletion sites were confirmed by using genomic primers (marked) outside the piggyBac elements to amplify across the newly formed element (about 6 kb). Sequencing outward from either end of the PCR fragment identified the precise deletion sites. Flanking sequence of the new deletion is shown. (B) Generating capsDel1trn28.4 double null. caps16964 has a GS element inserted downstream of the caps gene. trn28.4 is a null allele of tartan generated by P-element excision. caps16964 was used to induce male recombination with the trn28.4 chromosome. This allowed the simultaneous deletion of the caps gene and recombination onto the existing trn28.4 null chromosome. The GS element remains intact after the recombination allowing its precise new position, and any deletions, to be verified by inverse PCR and sequencing. The entire caps gene was deleted, but no other gene (apart from one tRNA gene) was affected. Flanking sequence of the new deletion is shown.
