Two <em>piggyBac</em> element insertion lines were used for FLP-FRT based recombination to delete the entire coding sequence of <em>caps</em>, which is contained in exon 5. <em>pBacRB<sup>e03402</sup></em> is inserted upstream of exon 4 and <em>pBacRB<sup>e03153</sup></em> is inserted downstream of exon 5. Upon heatshock, recombination occurs between these two <em>piggyBac</em> elements, deleting the intervening region, regenerating a complete <em>piggyBac</em> element from half of each of the original <em>piggyBacs</em>. The deletion sites were confirmed by using genomic primers (marked) outside the <em>piggyBac</em> elements to amplify across the newly formed element (about 6 kb). Sequencing outward from either end of the PCR fragment identified the precise deletion sites. Flanking sequence of the new deletion is shown. (B) Generating <em>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> double null. <em>caps<sup>16964</sup></em> has a GS element inserted downstream of the <em>caps</em> gene. <em>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> is a null allele of tartan generated by P-element excision. <em>caps<sup>16964</sup></em> was used to induce male recombination with the <em>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> chromosome. This allowed the simultaneous deletion of the <em>caps</em> gene and recombination onto the existing <em>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> null chromosome. The GS element remains intact after the recombination allowing its precise new position, and any deletions, to be verified by inverse PCR and sequencing. The entire <em>caps</em> gene was deleted, but no other gene (apart from one tRNA gene) was affected. Flanking sequence of the new deletion is shown.</p>
