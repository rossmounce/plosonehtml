Mutant tissue is marked by lack of GFP (green). Anti-Senseless (Sens), is used to identify R8 cells (A') and anti-Prospero (Prosp) is used to identify R7 and cone cells (A”). Anti-Elav marks all photoreceptor cells (B') and anti-Armadillo (Arm) marks the adherens junctions of cells, thereby outlining all cells (B”). No defects could be detected in <em>caps<sup>pB1</sup></em> mutant tissue. (C–D) <em>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> clones in the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar eye disc. Mutant tissue is marked by lack of GFP (green). As with <em>caps<sup>pB1</sup></em> clones, no defects were observed.</p>
