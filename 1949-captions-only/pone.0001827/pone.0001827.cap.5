Mutant tissue is marked by lack of GFP (green). Anti-Elav marks all photoreceptors. Anti-Armadillo (Arm) marks the apical surface of cells and is accumulated at a high level in the apically constricted cells of the furrow. At the border between wild type and <em>caps<sup>Del1</sup> trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> tissue, there is a reduction in Arm accumulation in the cells of the furrow and the apical surface of cells is expanded (yellow arrow A'). (A”) A Z-section along the furrow (between the two red arrows in A'). At the clone boundaries, cells are taller in the apical-basal direction, producing ‘bumps’ in the furrow (two yellow arrows). (B) A <em>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> clone (marked by lack of GFP, green) where ommatidia near the clone boundaries are mis-positioned (circled in white). (C) <em>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> clones in pupal retinae (marked by lack of GFP, green). Elav is used to mark the photoreceptors and Cut is used to mark cone cells (four per ommatidium) <a href="#pone.0001827-Blochlinger1">[27]</a>. At mutant-wild type borders neighbouring ommatidia sometimes fuse with each other (red arrows in C'). Correct cone cell numbers are also sometimes disrupted (red arrow in C”). (D) <em>caps<sup>pB1</sup></em> clones in pupal retinae (marked by lack of GFP, green). No defects in mutant tissue or clone boundaries can be seen. (E) <em>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> clones in pupal retinae (marked by lack of GFP, green). Again, the retinae are phenotypically wild type. (F) <em>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></em> clones in the wing (marked by lack of GFP, green) do not visibly affect the DV boundary (between the two red arrows), as marked by anti-Senseless (Sens). Clones do not cross the DV boundary (white arrows).</p>
