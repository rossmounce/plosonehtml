Both cell lines showed comparable protein expression. (Magnification 20×). To assess the biological features of K5 and K5L cells, cell motility (C) and invasiveness (D) were evaluated in transwell chambers in starving condition. Cells migrated through the porous filter were counted after 16 h incubation (C). Cells migrated through the artificial basement membrane (Matrigel®) were counted after 24 h incubation (D). In both panels Y-axis shows average migrated cell number (±S.D.) of triplicate wells in a representative experiment.</p>
