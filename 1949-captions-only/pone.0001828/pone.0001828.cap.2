The expression levels were all compared to that of the mRNA of the K5 cells, the poor metastatic parental cell lines. Each point shows the mean expression variations (±S.D.) measured using mRNAs prepared from three experiments carried out independently. The mean fold change in expression of the target gene in each cell line versus K5 cells was calculated using the method 2<sup>−ΔΔC</sup><sub>T</sub>.</p>
