K5L culture cells (A) infected by lentivirus, named K5L-Luc, constitutively express both GFP (B) and Luciferase (C) protein.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1"></a><p>Notably over 40% of the cells plated were positive for GFP (B). Cells were plated in a 96 multiwell plate in various dilutions and they showed a detectable luciferase signal using IVIS. From the top, wells were plated with 1,5×10<sup>5</sup>, 1×10<sup>5</sup> e 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells. Signal intensity was roughly proportional to cell number (C). Transwell assays to compare the <em>in vitro</em> K5, K5L, K5L-Luc cells migratory and invasive ability were performed in starving condition. Cells migrated through the porous filter were counted after 16 h incubation (D). Cells migrated through the artificial basement membrane (Matrigel®) were counted after 24 h incubation (E). In both panels Y-axis shows average migrated cell number (±S.D.) of triplicate wells in a representative experiment.</p>
