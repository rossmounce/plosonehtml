                Figure 4.  K5L-Luc mouse in vivo imaging and histologic evaluation of the primary tumors and pulmonary metastases.Fifteen minutes after injection of 1×106 K5L-Luc cells the signal from labeled cells was localized in the injection site of the right knee of the mouse (A). On day 21 from inoculation, tumor growth at the injection site (right knee) was macroscopically detectable and documented using IVIS. The only source of emission is circumscribed to the injection site (B). Thirty-eight days after K5L-Luc cells injection, a first luminous signal was evident at pulmonary level (C). X-ray analysis (D) revealed an aggressive destructive growth pattern toward knee region with periosteal new bone formation at the site of injection (red arrow), but did not show sign of metastatic spread to lung (yellow arrow).At 45 days histologic analysis of the K5L-Luc orthotopic primary tumor section (F) revealed densely packed malignant mesenchymal cells consistent with osteoid formation and bone trabeculae, including invasion of normal bone (Magnification 10×). Non-sequential serial sections were taken from lungs of the injected K5L-Luc animals and section through a visible pulmonary metastasis (E) revealed malignant mesenchymal cells proliferating in the lung parenchyma. Staining with eosin hematoxylin was performed (Magnification 40×).
