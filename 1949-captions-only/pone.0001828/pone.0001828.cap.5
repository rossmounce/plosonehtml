                Figure 5.  Lung metastases' macroscopic analysis.At 45 days after tumor cells injection, the animals injected with K5L and K5L-Luc cells were sacrificed. Macroscopic surface metastases were observed in all lungs (A). The lungs of the mice injected with K5L cells were removed and stained with India ink (B).Using IVIS we analyzed lungs of animals injected with K5L-Luc cells (C). When the isolated lungs were exposed to X-ray, the latter highlighted calcified metastasis (D, yellow arrow).
