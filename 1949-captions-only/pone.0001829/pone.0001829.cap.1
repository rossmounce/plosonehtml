                Figure 1.  Secondary Structure of the osa-MIR528 stemloop in pNW55.Depicted is the secondary structure of the 255 bp derived from osa-MIR528 (245 bp plus the BamHI and KpNI restriction sites) as predicted by ‘RNAfold’ [33] (Vienna RNA package, http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA) for 23°C. The sequences replaced in the different transgenes are boxed. The oligo designer in WMD2 [25] (http://wmd2.weigelworld.org) designs the amRNA* sequence (black) such that it pairs to the respective miRNA (red) in the same way as in osa-MIR528.
