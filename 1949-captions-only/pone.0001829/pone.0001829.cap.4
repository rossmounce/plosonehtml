The predicted cleavage sites (between positions 10 and 11 of the miRNA) are highlighted in grey. ‘RNAup’ calculates the <em>effective</em> free hybridization energy (ΔG) as sum of the energies necessary to open the target site in the target mRNA (ΔGu_l), the internal folding of the amiRNA (ΔGu_s), and the energy gained from hybridization of amiRNA and target mRNA (ΔGint).</p>
