                Figure 1.  Prion haplotypes of atypical BSE cases.(A) Physical map of bovine PRNP. Orange and yellow arrows represent untranslated and protein coding regions, respectively. PRNP regions spanned by prion haplotypes are indicated by brackets labeled network 1 and network 2. (B) PRNP haplotype relationships and frequencies in U.S. cattle. Haplotypes in network 1 are represented as yellow circles, are defined by 9 htSNPs and span a portion of the PRNP promoter, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and a small portion of intron 2 (6.3 kb). Haplotypes in network 2 are represented as black circles, are defined by 10 htSNPs and span most of intron 2, the entire coding region, and a portion of the 3â€² UTR of PRNP (13 kb). Numbers represent the frequencies of PRNP haplotypes in the control group of U.S. cattle. (C) Atypical BSE case information. BSE type, country of origin, bovine taxa, age, and PRNP diplotyes of the atypical BSE cases.
