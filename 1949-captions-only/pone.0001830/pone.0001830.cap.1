Orange and yellow arrows represent untranslated and protein coding regions, respectively. <em>PRNP</em> regions spanned by prion haplotypes are indicated by brackets labeled network 1 and network 2. (B) <em>PRNP</em> haplotype relationships and frequencies in U.S. cattle. Haplotypes in network 1 are represented as yellow circles, are defined by 9 htSNPs and span a portion of the <em>PRNP</em> promoter, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and a small portion of intron 2 (6.3 kb). Haplotypes in network 2 are represented as black circles, are defined by 10 htSNPs and span most of intron 2, the entire coding region, and a portion of the 3â€² UTR of <em>PRNP</em> (13 kb). Numbers represent the frequencies of <em>PRNP</em> haplotypes in the control group of U.S. cattle. (C) Atypical BSE case information. BSE type, country of origin, bovine taxa, age, and <em>PRNP</em> diplotyes of the atypical BSE cases.</p>
