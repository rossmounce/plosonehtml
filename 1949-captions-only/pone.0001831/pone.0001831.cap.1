The x-axis shows the positions in SLFNTVATL. The letters stacked on top of each position are the accepted amino acid substitutions. The y-axis gives Shannon information <a href="#pone.0001831-Shannon1">[14]</a> which is a measure of how conserved a position is. Rigid positions have few but tall letters, while very degenerate positions have many but very short letters. For example, position 1 was mutated 19 times of which 18 variants preserved TCR binding, only the S1R variant compromised TCR binding while the MHC binding was preserved (see <a href="#pone.0001831-Lund1">[38]</a>). The frequency of amino acids occurring in this TCR motif can also be used to estimate the number of distinct ligands this T cell clone can recognize (see text for details). (B) Sequence motif of HLA-A2 binding peptides (277 HLA-A2 restricted peptides were extracted from the SYFPEITHI database <a href="#pone.0001831-Rammensee1">[15]</a>). (C) The average Shannon information at each position, for the CTL clones: G10 and T4, and PBMC.</p>
