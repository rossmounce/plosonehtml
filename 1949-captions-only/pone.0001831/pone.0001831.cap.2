The x-axis shows the relative IFNγ secretion measured for 171 single mutants of SLFNTVATL (SFL9). Immunogenicity was grouped in four bins with average ELISPOT responses of 0, 0.15, 0.50 and 0.85 of maximal ELISPOT for SFL9. In both figures the y-axis shows the predicted CTL recognition in terms of BLOSUM35 similarity scores (see Eq. 2). Unfavorable (non-conservative) substitutions (low x) are associated with a low similarity score (low y) whereas conservative substitutions (high x) in general are associated with higher similarity scores (high y). (B) Observed and predicted recognition of patient derived SLYNTVATL (SYL9) variants with 0–3 mutations. The axis shows the relative IFNγ and peptide similarity scores. Note, that the IFNγ response falls to a half when peptide similarity is around 0.85.</p>
