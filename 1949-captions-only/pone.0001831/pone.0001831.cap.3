                Figure 3.  Predicted similarity of pairs of cross-reactive epitopes reported in the literature.(A) The observed similarities SO between 19 cross-reactive epitopes listed in table 1 versus the expected similarities SE (for definitions of SE and SO see the text). The line depicts the diagonal SO = SE. 16 out of 19 points fall above the diagonal. (B) The relative increase of observed similarity with respect to the expected similarity. There is a strong inverse relationship between sequence identity and the level of conservation on non-identical positions. Cross-reactive epitopes with low sequence identity share increasingly conserved amino acids on the remaining positions.
