The line depicts the diagonal S<sub>O</sub> = S<sub>E</sub>. 16 out of 19 points fall above the diagonal. (B) The relative increase of observed similarity with respect to the expected similarity. There is a strong inverse relationship between sequence identity and the level of conservation on non-identical positions. Cross-reactive epitopes with low sequence identity share increasingly conserved amino acids on the remaining positions.</p>
