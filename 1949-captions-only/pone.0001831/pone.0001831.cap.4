Confirmed HIV epitopes are shown as black diamonds and predicted, non-immunogenic HIV peptides are shown as open circles. The 0.85 self-similarity line described in the text divides the y-axis. The region above the line is clearly dominated by non-immunogenic antigens where 88% (14/16) are non-immunogenic compared to the expected frequency of 62% (54/87). This difference is significant (p&lt;0.05, Fisher's exact test). Peptide similarity was calculated using the BLOSUM35 matrix.</p>
