                Figure 1.  Syntactic dependency component (ELAN, 100–300 ms -grey area) elicited for the syntactic violation.a. ERP waveforms for the groups from F5 (left frontal) electrode. b. Scalp distribution of differences between the violation minus control sentences for each group. The syntactic violation elicited a negativity distributed on the left hemisphere for the age controls (Condition×Hemisphere: F1,17 = 10.16, p&lt;.005), and the language controls (Condition×Hemisphere: F1,19 = 11.12, p&lt;.003; Condition×Caudality×Hemisphere: F2,38 = 3.55, p&lt;.05), with a maximum of difference on the anterior left sites for both groups (p&lt;.006, p&lt;.05 respectively). This negativity is equally distributed on anterior sites for the adults (Condition×Caudality: F2,38 = 10.17, p&lt;.001; anterior central p&lt;.001). No effect was significant for the G-SLI children (F&lt;1). c. Effect sizes for individual G-SLI children and their age controls (numbers correspond to matched individuals with increasing numbers corresponding to increasing age). Effect size: mean amplitude difference (violation minus control) in the Anterior Left ROI in the 100–300 ms time window. We plot Negativity upward.
