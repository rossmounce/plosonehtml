                Figure 3.  Reanalysis component (P600, 800–1000 ms–grey area) elicited for the syntactic violation.a. ERP waveforms, for each group from Fz (frontal electrode). b. Scalp distribution of the differences between the violation minus control sentences for each group. The syntactic violation elicited a positivity distributed on anterior regions with a maximum on the right sites for the G-SLI participants (Condition×Caudality: F2,34 = 15.64, p&lt;.0001, Condition×Caudality×Hemisphere F2,34 = 6.39, p&lt;.005); and on anterior regions for the age controls (Condition×Caudality: F2,34 = 8.93, p&lt;.003), language controls (Condition×Caudality: F2,38 = 17.54, p&lt;.001), and adults (Condition×Caudality: F2,38 = 9.61, p&lt;.003). c. Effect sizes for individual G-SLI children and their age controls. Effect size: mean amplitude difference (violation minus control) in the Anterior Right ROI within the 800–1000 ms temporal window. We plot Negativity upward.
