                Figure 4.  Semantic component (N400, 300–500 ms) elicited for the semantic violation.a. ERP waveforms for each group from two posterior electrodes (P3, left and P4 right hemisphere). b. Scalp distribution of the differences between the violation minus the control sentences for each group. The semantic violation elicited a posterior negativity for the age controls (Condition×Caudality: F2,34 = 3.72, p&lt;.05) and also the G-SLI group (Condition×Caudality: F2,34 = 7.15, p&lt;.001). This negativity was maximal on the right hemisphere for the language controls (Condition×Hemisphere: F1,18 = 6.92, p&lt;.01), and on the left posterior sites for the adults (Condition×Caudality: F2,38 = 6.07, p&lt;.01, Condition×Hemisphere: F1,19 = 10.69, p&lt;.001). Note that the N400 effect started as early as 100 ms for the G-SLI, age and language controls. c. Effect sizes for individual G-SLI children and their age controls. Effect size: mean amplitude difference (violation minus control) in the 3 Posterior ROIs within the 300–500 ms temporal window. We plot Negativity upward.
