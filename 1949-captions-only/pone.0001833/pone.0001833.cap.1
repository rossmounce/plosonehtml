                Figure 1.  Sensitivity of Salmonella to acid stress upon exposure to NO donors.(A) Salmonella grown to an OD600 of 0.4 in EG medium, pH 7.0 were acid challenged in fresh EG medium, pH 3.0 (NonAd). Selected groups of mid-log phase cells were adapted (Ad) for 2 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 at 37°C. The % of surviving bacteria was estimated over time. (B) Effects of RNS on the ability of Salmonella to mount an ATR were determined by adding NO donors spermine NONOate (sperNO) and NaNO2 to bacteria during the 2 h adaptation period. The NO donors were removed by pelleting the bacteria before 1 h of challenge in EG medium, pH 3.0. (C) The effects that NO generated from sperNO exert on the viability of Salmonella grown for 2 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 can be seen in panel C. The effect that 10 µM of the NO-scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) had on the sperNO-inhibitable ATR is shown in panel D. The spermine base was used as a negative control. The chemicals were added for 2 h during the adaptation in EG medium, pH 4.4. The data represent the mean±SEM of 4-16 independent observations from 2–4 separate experiments. *, p&lt;0.001 compared to adapted controls.
