Selected groups of mid-log phase cells were adapted (Ad) for 2 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 at 37°C. The % of surviving bacteria was estimated over time. (B) Effects of RNS on the ability of <em>Salmonella</em> to mount an ATR were determined by adding NO donors spermine NONOate (sperNO) and NaNO<sub>2</sub> to bacteria during the 2 h adaptation period. The NO donors were removed by pelleting the bacteria before 1 h of challenge in EG medium, pH 3.0. (C) The effects that NO generated from sperNO exert on the viability of <em>Salmonella</em> grown for 2 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 can be seen in panel C. The effect that 10 µM of the NO-scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) had on the sperNO-inhibitable ATR is shown in panel D. The spermine base was used as a negative control. The chemicals were added for 2 h during the adaptation in EG medium, pH 4.4. The data represent the mean±SEM of 4-16 independent observations from 2–4 separate experiments. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 compared to adapted controls.</p>
