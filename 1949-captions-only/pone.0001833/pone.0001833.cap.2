                Figure 2.  RNS inhibit the Salmonella ATR.The susceptibility of adapted (Ad) and nonadapted (NonAd) Salmonella cultures to acid challenge in EG medium, pH 3.0 was determined as described in figure 1. (A) Selected groups of Ad and NonAd bacterial cultures were treated with 250 µM spermine NONOate (NO) for 2 h before acid challenge. (B) The acid sensitivity of Ad and Ad+NO Salmonella was compared to controls grown for 1 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 before exposure to 250 µM spermine NONOate for 1 h (Ad 1 h, Ad+NO 1 h). The data represent the mean±SEM of 4–8 independent observations from 2–3 separate experiments.
