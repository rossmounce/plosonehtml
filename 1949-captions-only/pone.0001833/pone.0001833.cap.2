(A) Selected groups of Ad and NonAd bacterial cultures were treated with 250 µM spermine NONOate (NO) for 2 h before acid challenge. (B) The acid sensitivity of Ad and Ad+NO <em>Salmonella</em> was compared to controls grown for 1 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 before exposure to 250 µM spermine NONOate for 1 h (Ad 1 h, Ad+NO 1 h). The data represent the mean±SEM of 4–8 independent observations from 2–3 separate experiments.</p>
