                Figure 3.  RNS suppress the increased oral virulence of ATR-adapted Salmonella.C57BL/6 mice were inoculated orally with ~5Ã—105 CFU of NonAd, Ad and Ad+NO Salmonella grown as described in figure 1. (A) Fecal shedding of nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella was monitored in individual mice for 3 days after oral inoculation. Panel B shows the % of mice that survived after oral challenge with Salmonella. Data represent 10 mice per group from 2 separate experiments.
