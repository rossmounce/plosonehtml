                Figure 4.  Responses of Salmonella to acidified RNS.The acid-inducible expression of the SPI2-encoded spiC::lacZ transcriptional fusion was compared in nonadapted (NonAd), adapted (Ad) and adapted+250 µM spermine NONOate (Ad+NO) Salmonella cultures (A). The survival of NonAd, Ad and Ad+NO Salmonella cultures exposed for 1 h to 400 µM H2O2 in PBS is shown in panel B. Oxygen consumption was monitored in Ad and Ad+NO Salmonella cultures (C). The transcription of the ribosomal protein-encoding gene rplN relative to the housekeeping gene rpoD was monitored by semi-quantitative (D) and quantitative RT-PCR (E). Relative expression is represented as the ratio of rplN/rpoD transcripts. Data represent the mean±SEM of 3–6 independent observations. *, p&lt;0.05 by one-way ANOVA.
