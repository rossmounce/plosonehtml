The survival of NonAd, Ad and Ad+NO <em>Salmonella</em> cultures exposed for 1 h to 400 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS is shown in panel B. Oxygen consumption was monitored in Ad and Ad+NO <em>Salmonella</em> cultures (C). The transcription of the ribosomal protein-encoding gene <em>rplN</em> relative to the housekeeping gene <em>rpoD</em> was monitored by semi-quantitative (D) and quantitative RT-PCR (E). Relative expression is represented as the ratio of rplN/rpoD transcripts. Data represent the mean±SEM of 3–6 independent observations. *, p&lt;0.05 by one-way ANOVA.</p>
