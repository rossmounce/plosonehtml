Microarray data are represented as the mean fold change±SD from 3 independent experiments. (B) Transcription of PhoP-activated genes (pag), PhoP-repressed genes (prg), the control housekeeping <em>rpoD</em> gene and the NO-inducible <em>hmpA</em> gene were assessed by RT-PCR of RNA isolated from NonAd, Ad, and Ad+NO bacterial cultures grown as described in <a href="#pone-0001833-g001">figure 1</a>.</p>
