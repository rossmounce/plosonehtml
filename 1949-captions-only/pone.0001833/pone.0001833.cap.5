                Figure 5.  Acid-inducible PhoPQ-dependent gene transcription is repressed by RNS.Panel A shows the expression of PhoP-activated genes in rapidly growing Salmonella cultured for 1 h in EG medium, pH 4.4 in the presence (Ad+NO) or absence (Ad) of 250 µM spermine NONOate. Microarray data are represented as the mean fold change±SD from 3 independent experiments. (B) Transcription of PhoP-activated genes (pag), PhoP-repressed genes (prg), the control housekeeping rpoD gene and the NO-inducible hmpA gene were assessed by RT-PCR of RNA isolated from NonAd, Ad, and Ad+NO bacterial cultures grown as described in figure 1.
