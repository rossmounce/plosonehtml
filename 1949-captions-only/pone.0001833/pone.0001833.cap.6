                Figure 6.  Suppression of PhoPQ-dependent gene transcription is mediated by nitrogen oxides and requires an intact signal transduction cascade.The effect of spermine NONOate on the PhoPQ-dependent induction of the lpxO::lacZ transcriptional fusion is shown in panel A. β~-galactosidase activity (Miller Units, M.U.) is represented as the mean±SEM of 4–6 independent observations from 2–3 separate experiments. *, p&lt;0.002 compared to adapted controls. The acid-inducible expression of the PhoP-activated loci lpxO, pqaA and pcgE were monitored in the presence or absence of 250 µM spermine, 250 µM spermine NONOate or 500 µM NaNO2 (B–D). (E) The expression of C-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged PhoP and PhoQ proteins was monitored in NonAd, Ad, and Ad+NO Salmonella cultures grown as described in figure 1.
