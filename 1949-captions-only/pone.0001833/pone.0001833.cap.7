The <em>ΔphoQ::FRT</em> mutation was complemented with a wild-type allele expressed from pWSQ. Selected groups of bacteria were treated with 250 µM spermine NONOate (Ad+NO) during the adaptation in EG medium, pH 4.4. Panel B compares the acid sensitivity of Ad and Ad+NO groups of <em>Salmonella</em> strains isogenic for <em>ΔrpoS::km</em>, <em>ompR::Tn10</em> and <em>Δfur::FRT</em>. The data represent the mean±SEM of 6–9 independent observations from 2–3 separate experiments. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05 compared to adapted controls. *<em>*,</em> no viable cells were detected after the adapted+NO group was challenged for 1 h in EG medium, pH 3.0.</p>
