                Figure 7.  Acidified RNS suppress the PhoPQ-dependent ATR.Killing of wild-type Salmonella and its isogenic ΔphoQ::FRT control in EG medium, pH 3.0 is shown in panel A. The ΔphoQ::FRT mutation was complemented with a wild-type allele expressed from pWSQ. Selected groups of bacteria were treated with 250 µM spermine NONOate (Ad+NO) during the adaptation in EG medium, pH 4.4. Panel B compares the acid sensitivity of Ad and Ad+NO groups of Salmonella strains isogenic for ΔrpoS::km, ompR::Tn10 and Δfur::FRT. The data represent the mean±SEM of 6–9 independent observations from 2–3 separate experiments. *, p&lt;0.05 compared to adapted controls. **, no viable cells were detected after the adapted+NO group was challenged for 1 h in EG medium, pH 3.0.
