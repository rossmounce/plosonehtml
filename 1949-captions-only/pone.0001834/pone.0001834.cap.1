                Figure 1.  Secondary structure propensity of AChE586-599 mutants as predicted by hidden β-propensity method (available at http://opal.umdnj.edu).Propensities for helices (red squares), β-strands (blue squares) and random coil (green squares) are presented numerically using a 0-1 scale, with low values indicating zero to low propensity and high values indicating high propensity to near certainty. Hydrophobic residues are shown in green and aromatic residues in bold with a bigger font size.
