On the carbon backbone structure, only the side chains of aromatic residues (F<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>4</sub>, W<sub>6</sub>, Y<sub>9</sub>, H<sub>12</sub> and W<sub>13</sub>) are represented for clarity. The boxes highlight possible aromatic interactions (π-π) between strands within a β-sheet. Within a β-sheet, AChE<sub>586-599</sub> strands are stacking in an antiparallel arrangement. Within AChE<sub>586-599</sub> fibril, the β-sheets are antiparallel, have the same sides facing each other (‘face-to-face’), however the orientation of the strand edges within a sheet alternate between up and down (‘up = down’). According to the nomenclature of Sawaya <em>et al</em>., this type of arrangement and orientation corresponds to a class 5 steric-zipper <a href="#pone.0001834-Sawaya1">[70]</a>.</p>
