                Figure 11.  Model of quaternary interactions within β-sheets of AChE586-599 within a fibril of class 5.Each β-sheet is represented with only 3 copies of AChE586-599 for clarity: sheet 1 colored in different shades of green, sheet 2 in different shades of blue, and sheet 3 in different shades of red. On the carbon backbone structure, only the side chains of aromatic residues (F3, H4, W6, Y9, H12 and W13) are represented for clarity. The boxes highlight possible aromatic interactions (π-π) between strands within a β-sheet. Within a β-sheet, AChE586-599 strands are stacking in an antiparallel arrangement. Within AChE586-599 fibril, the β-sheets are antiparallel, have the same sides facing each other (‘face-to-face’), however the orientation of the strand edges within a sheet alternate between up and down (‘up = down’). According to the nomenclature of Sawaya et al., this type of arrangement and orientation corresponds to a class 5 steric-zipper [70].
