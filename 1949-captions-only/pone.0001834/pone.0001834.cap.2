                Figure 2.  Conformation of AChE586-599 and AChE586-599 mutants.(A) Far UV spectra (250 to 190 nm) before and after pH neutralization (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) of 4 AChE586-599 mutants (100 µM). These spectra are representatives of the different structures and different changes in structure observed for the wild-type and mutant peptides. (B) Conformation and changes in conformation after pH neutralization (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) for AChE586-599 and all AChE586-599 mutants (100 µM). (C) Near UV spectra (320 to 240 nm) before and after pH neutralization (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) of AChE586-599 and 4 mutants (100 µM). In all panels, the mutation within AChE586-599 is indicated in bold and italics.
