Changes in ThT fluorescence were monitored (A, with the right panel showing scale-up of the left panel to visualize the rapid fibrilization of some peptides) with the lag phase of fibrilization (B, left panel) and plateau height (B, right panel) depicted. A black star signifies p&lt;0.003 (B, left panel) and p&lt;0.03 (B, right panel) when compared to the wild type peptide (WT). The peptides shown are representatives of the different fibrilization properties observed. (C) Fibrilization properties for AChE<sub>586-599</sub> and all AChE<sub>586-599</sub> mutants (100 µM). The properties are divided into 4 categories: ability to fibrilize, duration of lag phase, height of plateau and stability of the amyloid products (indicated by stability or decay of the ThT fluorescence after plateau). The mutation within AChE<sub>586-599</sub> is indicated in bold and italics. The peptides that do not fibrilize and/or the peptides which amyloid products are not stable are indicated by grey boxes. The lag phase and plateau height for the mutant peptides are shown as fold ratio of AChE<sub>586-599</sub> (e.g. ‘1’ represents equal value to AChE<sub>586-599</sub> and ‘100’ for the lag phase represents 100 times longer than AChE<sub>586-599</sub>). ‘N.D.’ means ‘not detectable’.</p>
