                Figure 4.  Effect of ionic strength on the fibrilization properties of mutant peptide with unstable amyloid products.Mutant peptide E2/A (50 µM) (A and B) or K14/A (100 µM) (C) were incubated with 165 µM ThT in 1.8 mM KH2PO4 and 10.1 mM NaH2PO4 with varying concentration of NaCl and KCl. The concentrations of NaCl and KCl were respectively: 0 and 0 (0 X), 42.8 mM and 0.84 mM (0.31 X), 85.6 mM and 1.7 mM (0.63 X), 136.9 mM and 2.7 mM (1 X), 171.1 mM and 3.4 mM (1.25 X), 350 mM and 6.7 mM (2.5 X), 700 mM and 13.5 mM (5 X), and 1.4 M and 27 mM (10 X). Changes in ThT fluorescence were monitored (A, with the right panel showing a scale-up of the left panel to visualize the rapid fibrilizations; and C). The lag phase of fibrilization (B, left panel) and plateau height (B, right panel; and C, right panel) are depicted. A black star signifies p&lt;0.02 (B, left panel) and p&lt;0.03 (B, right panel; C, right panel) when compared to 1 X NaCl and KCl.
