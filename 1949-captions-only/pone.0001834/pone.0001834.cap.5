                Figure 5.  Effect of the mutant peptide F3/A on AChE586-599 fibrilization.Varying concentrations of the mutant F3/A were incubated with 165 µM ThT, with or without 50 µM AChE586-599. Changes in ThT fluorescence were monitored (A) with the lag phase of fibrilization (B) and the plateau height (C) depicted. The mutant peptide F3/A decreases the lag phase of AChE586-599 (A, with the inset showing a scale-up to visualize the fibrilization of the F3/A mutant on its own; and B), and increases the plateau height of AChE586-599 (A and C). A black star signifies p&lt;0.03 (B) and p&lt;0.05 (C) when compared to both 50 µM AChE586-599 and the equivalent concentration of the F3/A mutant. A white star signifies p&lt;0.05 (C) when compared to the equivalent concentration of the F3/A mutant. The double bar in B indicates the absence of fibrilization (i.e. an indeterminably long lag phase).
