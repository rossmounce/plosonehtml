Changes in ThT fluorescence were monitored (A) with the lag phase of fibrilization (B) and the plateau height (C) depicted. The mutant peptide F<sub>3</sub>/A decreases the lag phase of AChE<sub>586-599</sub> (A, with the inset showing a scale-up to visualize the fibrilization of the F<sub>3</sub>/A mutant on its own; and B), and increases the plateau height of AChE<sub>586-599</sub> (A and C). A black star signifies p&lt;0.03 (B) and p&lt;0.05 (C) when compared to both 50 µM AChE<sub>586-599</sub> and the equivalent concentration of the F<sub>3</sub>/A mutant. A white star signifies p&lt;0.05 (C) when compared to the equivalent concentration of the F<sub>3</sub>/A mutant. The double bar in B indicates the absence of fibrilization (i.e. an indeterminably long lag phase).</p>
