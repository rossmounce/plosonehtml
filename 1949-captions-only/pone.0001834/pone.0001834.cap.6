                Figure 6.  Effect of the mutant peptides W6/A and M10/A on AChE586-599 fibrilization.Varying concentrations of the mutant peptides were incubated with 165 µM ThT, with or without 50 µM AChE586-599. Changes in ThT fluorescence were measured and plotted as the lag phase of fibrilization (A and D) and the plateau height (B and E). The double bar in A and D indicates the absence of fibrilization (i.e.an indeterminably long lag phase). Far UV spectra (250 to 190 nm) before and after pH neutralization (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) of 75 µM AChE586-599 with 75 µM mutant peptide (C and F). The insets show the mean residue ellipticity at 200 nm (random coil) and 215 nm (β-sheet) for 75 µM AChE586-599, 75 µM mutant peptide, 75 µM AChE586-599 with 75 µM mutant peptide, and the arithmetic addition of AChE586-599 to the mutant. (A and B) The mutant peptide W6/A does not affect either the lag phase (A, a black star signifies p&lt;0.002 when compared to W6/A at the equivalent concentration) or the plateau height of AChE586-599 (B, a black star signifies p&lt;0.045 when compared to W6/A at the equivalent concentration; a white star signifies p&lt;0.05 when compared to AChE586-599). (C) The mutant peptide W6/A interacts with AChE586-599. A black star signifies p&lt;0.014 when compared to the arithmetic addition of 75 µM W6/A mutant to 75 µM AChE586-599. (D and E) The mutant peptide M10/A does not affect either the lag phase (D, a black star signifies p&lt;0.0007 when compared to M10/A at the equivalent concentration) or the plateau height of AChE586-599 (E, a black star signifies p&lt;0.045 when compared to M10/A at the equivalent concentration). (F) The mutant peptide M10/A interacts with AChE586-599. A black star signifies p&lt;0.01 when compared to the arithmetic addition of 75 µM M10/A mutant and 75 µM AChE586-599.
