                Figure 7.  Surfactant properties of AChE586-599 and AChE586-599 mutants.Surface tension was measured before and after neutralization (1M NaH2PO4, pH 7.2). (A) Representative surfactant activity of the AChE586-599 mutants (50 µM). ΔOD calculations were as described in Methods. A black star signifies p&lt;0.035 when compared to AChE586-599. (B) Temporal pattern of the surfactant properties for AChE586-599 and AChE586-599 mutants. The peptides shown are representatives of the different surfactant properties observed. A black star signifies p&lt;0.05 when compared to the same peptide after 2 min at neutral pH. (C) Surfactant properties for AChE586-599 and all AChE586-599 mutants (50 µM). The properties are divided into 2 categories: surfactant activity dependent on pH (depicted by subtracting the value at acidic pH to the value at neutral pH after 2 min) and stability of the surfactant activity (indicated by stability or decay of the OD signal). The mutation within AChE586-599 is indicated in bold and italics. The peptides with unstable surfactant activity are indicated by grey boxes. ‘*’ indicates peptides which activity remains stable over the time course, albeit one time point. The activity for the mutant peptides is shown as fold ratio of AChE586-599 activity (e.g. ‘1’ represents equal value to AChE586-599).
