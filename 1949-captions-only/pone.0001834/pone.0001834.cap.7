(A) Representative surfactant activity of the AChE<sub>586-599</sub> mutants (50 µM). ΔOD calculations were as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. A black star signifies p&lt;0.035 when compared to AChE<sub>586-599</sub>. (B) Temporal pattern of the surfactant properties for AChE<sub>586-599</sub> and AChE<sub>586-599</sub> mutants. The peptides shown are representatives of the different surfactant properties observed. A black star signifies p&lt;0.05 when compared to the same peptide after 2 min at neutral pH. (C) Surfactant properties for AChE<sub>586-599</sub> and all AChE<sub>586-599</sub> mutants (50 µM). The properties are divided into 2 categories: surfactant activity dependent on pH (depicted by subtracting the value at acidic pH to the value at neutral pH after 2 min) and stability of the surfactant activity (indicated by stability or decay of the OD signal). The mutation within AChE<sub>586-599</sub> is indicated in bold and italics. The peptides with unstable surfactant activity are indicated by grey boxes. ‘*’ indicates peptides which activity remains stable over the time course, albeit one time point. The activity for the mutant peptides is shown as fold ratio of AChE<sub>586-599</sub> activity (e.g. ‘1’ represents equal value to AChE<sub>586-599</sub>).</p>
