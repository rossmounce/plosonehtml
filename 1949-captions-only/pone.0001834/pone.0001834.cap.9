                Figure 9.  T40/IDE digestion products form amyloid protofibrils.Electron micrographs of negatively stained AChE586-599 and AChE586-599 mutants showing fibrils (A) and protofibrils (B). The white arrows in the left panel indicate thinner fibrils, and the black arrows indicate twists in the fibrils (A).
