                Figure 2.  Illustrative stamps, issued in 1987 and 2005.(A) 2005: Text and illustrations belong together and are correct. (B) 1987: In Gough G. comeri occurs, not G. nesiotis; both names should not be synonymized. (C) 2005: The text correctly indicates G. nesiotis as from Tristan, but the bird itself most probably belongs to G. comeri, introduced from Gough, since G. nesiotis is now extinct on Tristan and not available to be pictured anymore.
