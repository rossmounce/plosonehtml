(B) 1987: In Gough <em>G. comeri</em> occurs, not <em>G. nesiotis</em>; both names should not be synonymized. (C) 2005: The text correctly indicates <em>G. nesiotis</em> as from Tristan, but the bird itself most probably belongs to <em>G. comeri</em>, introduced from Gough, since <em>G. nesiotis</em> is now extinct on Tristan and not available to be pictured anymore.</p>
