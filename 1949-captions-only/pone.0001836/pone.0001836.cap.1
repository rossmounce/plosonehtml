                Figure 1.  Illustration of the technique that identifies reliable overlaps: (a) a scenario where a genome contains two copies of a repeat region R.The correct positions of reads A, B, C and D are shown. (b) A “fork” in the overlaps. (c) a scenario where reads A and D have the same sequencing error at the same base.
