<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>All statistical analyses, except shape analyses, were performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Demographic variables and clinical measures were compared using pooled, two-tailed <em>t</em>-tests for continuous variables and chi-square models for categorical variables. Analysis of group differences in left and right hippocampal volume were modeled using the GLM procedure, which covaried for age, sex, and total cerebral volume.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p2"></a><p>Using a MADRS score of less than 10 as a definition of remission <a href="#pone.0001837-Hawley1">[32]</a>, we then dichotomized the depressed cohort into those currently remitted, and those who were not. This resulted in a trichotomous diagnostic variable (nondepressed, depressed-remitted, and depressed-nonremitted). We tested for differences between comparison subjects, remitted depressed, and nonremitted depressed subjects using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We repeated the previous models, replacing the previous dichotomous diagnosis variable with this new trichotomous variable. Finally, we used the least squared means approach to identify significant differences between groups.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p3"></a><p>For the shape analysis statistical methods, the final shape description consisted of the coordinates of the corresponding points (appropriately scaled). The null hypothesis is that the distribution of the spatial locations at each surface point is the same for every subject regardless of the group. Group differences between two groups of surfaces were tested using a multivariate metric: Hotelling's T-squared test which is a multivariate version of Student's t statistic. The analysis generated a raw (unadjusted for multiple comparisons) significance map showing raw p-values exceeding 0.05 across the surface. The distance of the two mean surfaces of the two groups were also generated.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p4"></a><p>To quantitatively measure the global shape difference, the global average deviation between the mean surfaces of the two groups as well as the near maximal distance (95%) between the mean surfaces of the two groups (average and maximal distance across the whole surface) was calculated and tested with a two tailed t-test. This analytic approach was used first for comparisons between depressed and nondepressed comparison subjects, but then also paired comparisons between nondepressed, depressed remitted and depressed non-remitted subjects.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p5"></a><p>To present the shape differences we incorporated our results into a single informative visualization shown in <a href="#pone-0001837-g002">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0001837-g003">Figure 3</a>, where the maps in <a href="#pone-0001837-g003">Figure 3</a> that show the distance from the mean surface of the group A to the mean surface of the group B are masked by the significance maps, and displayed in anatomical context in a corresponding T1-weighted MRI scan in <a href="#pone-0001837-g002">Figure 2</a>. In this study, group A was the control, group B was the depressed patients. Thus, this visualization shows three kinds of information at a specific location on the surface:</p>


<ol class="order">

<li><em>The magnitude of the distance between the mean shapes of group A and group B:</em> White color is used where the magnitudes are zero. The color gets darker as the magnitudes of the distance increase. The magnitude is in millimeters.</li>

<li><em>The direction of the distances:</em> The distance is positive if the mean surface of group A is protruding outside of the mean surface of group B; the distance is negative if the mean surface of group A is shrinking below the mean surface of group B. Positive distances are color-coded by blue and negative distances are color-coded by red.</li>

<li><em>The significance map:</em> The distances are set to zero wherever the raw p-value exceeds 0.05 and the color is set to white at that location. In other words, surface locations are in white if the differences are not statistically significant regardless the magnitude of the distance. Therefore, only the distances which are statistically significant are visualized in this illustration.</li>
