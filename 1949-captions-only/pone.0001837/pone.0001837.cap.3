There was no difference in sex representation (depressed: 60.7% female, 37/61; nondepressed: 67.4% female, 29/43; χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.5009, <em>p</em> = 0.4791), although the nondepressed population was older (depressed: 65.9y, SD = 5.5y; nondepressed: 69.0y, SD = 5.5y; t = 2.87, 102 <em>df</em>, <em>p</em> = 0.0048). There was no difference in MMSE score between the groups (depressed: 28.4, SD = 2.2; nondepressed: 28.7, SD = 1.5; t = 0.89, 102 <em>df</em>, <em>p</em> = 0.3748). The depressed cohort on average had a mild level of depression severity at time of imaging (MADRS = 16.1, SD = 10.7, range 0–44), with a mean age of first depressive episode onset of 39.3 years (range = 4–76 years, SD = 19.9 years).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2"></a><p>We also reviewed what antidepressant medications depressed subjects had been taking over the month before the MRI. 29 (47.5%) were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), 15 (24.6%) were taking venlafaxine, 9 (14.8%) were taking bupropion, 5 (8.2%) were on nortriptyline, 1 (1.6%) was on mirtazapine, and 7 (11.5%) were not on an antidepressant medication. 5 people (8.2%) were on two antidepressants. Per exclusion criteria, no nondepressed comparison subject was taking an antidepressant.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3"></a><p>Depressed subjects generally exhibited smaller hippocampal volumes than did nondepressed subjects, although in univariate analyses of unadjusted volumes, these differences were not statistically significant (left hippocampus: depressed = 3.42mL, SD = 0.54mL; nondepressed = 3.55mL, SD = 0.48mL; t = 1.29, 102 df, p = 0.1994; right hippocampus: depressed = 3.65mL, SD = 0.55mL; nondepressed = 3.66mL, SD = 0.57mL; t = 0.08, 102 df, p = 0.9236). The models controlling for age, sex, and total cerebral volume showed a significant difference between depressed and nondepressed subjects in left (F<sub>1,103</sub> = 5.26; <em>p</em> = 0.0240) but not right hippocampus volume (F<sub>1,103</sub> = 0.41; <em>p</em> = 0.5213).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4"></a><p>The visualization demonstrating group differences between control and depressed subjects is overlaid on a pair of representative hippocampi in <a href="#pone-0001837-g003">Figure 3</a>. The regional differences are most noticeable in the left hippocampus, on the superior side, approximately midway down the body. The area where there is a shape difference shows a central region of contraction (smaller in depressed than nondepressed subjects) flanked by regions of expansion (larger in depressed than nondepressed subjects). Although the location of these anatomic changes cannot be specifically pinpointed, in the depressed cohort these changes correspond to a contraction in the dentate gyrus and possibly CA4 region, with areas of expansion in the subiculum and the CA2-3 region.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.p5"></a><p>The global shape difference metrics yielded no significant difference in the average difference or the maximal deviation between the average surface for the two groups (p&gt;0.1 for all measures for left and right hippocampus) indicating that the differences shown are local.</p>

<h4>Three-Way Comparisons</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>To further investigate the shape difference of remitted patients, depressed subjects were divided into two groups: currently remitted (N = 24) and non-remitted (37). See <a href="#pone-0001837-t001">Table 1</a> for demographic differences between these two groups and nondepressed comparison subjects. Of the remitted subjects, 13 (54.2%) were on a SSRI, 5 (20.8%) on venlafaxine, 2 (8.3%) on bupropion, 2 (8.3%) on nortriptyline, and 1 (4.2%) was on no antidepressant, with 1 person on two agents. Of the nonremitted subjects, 16 were on a SSRI (43.2%), 10 (27.0%) on venlafaxine, 7 (18.9%) on bupropion, 3 (8.1%) on nortriptyline, 1 (2.7%) on mirtazapine, and 4 (10.8%) on no antidepressant, with 4 people on two agents. Using Fisher's exact test, there was no difference in medication use between the remitted and nonremitted groups (<em>p</em> = 0.8541)</p>
