Within each dataset, letters distinguish gene groups that differ significantly at <em>P</em>&lt;0.001 as determined by bootstrapping. Within each dataset, variance estimates were standardized to the whole genomic average (set to 100%) indicated by the horizontal line. VMR: variance mean ratio. CV: the coefficient-of-variance. A. Average VMR for the transcripts. B. Average CV for the transcripts.</p>
