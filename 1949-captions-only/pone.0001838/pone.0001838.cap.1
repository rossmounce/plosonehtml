                Figure 1.  Gene duplication status alters transcript variance.Genes within each of four independent microarray datasets were grouped as unique (pink), segmental duplicated (dark blue) and/or tandem duplicated (red) and the average of two measures of transcript variance was determined across all genes within these groups as well as for the whole genome (light blue). Within each dataset, letters distinguish gene groups that differ significantly at P&lt;0.001 as determined by bootstrapping. Within each dataset, variance estimates were standardized to the whole genomic average (set to 100%) indicated by the horizontal line. VMR: variance mean ratio. CV: the coefficient-of-variance. A. Average VMR for the transcripts. B. Average CV for the transcripts.
