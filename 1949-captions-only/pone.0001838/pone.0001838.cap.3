For all graphs, pink shows unique genes, light blue is the genome average, dark blue are the segmental duplicated genes and red is the tandem duplicated genes. A. Average number of <em>cis</em>-eQTL per transcript per duplication class. Letters show duplication classes with statistically significant differences. B. Average number of <em>cis</em>-eQTL per transcript per duplication class. Letters show duplication classes with statistically significant differences. C. QQ plot comparing distributions of the average eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for each transcript among duplication classes. The X-axis shows the average eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for transcripts every percentile within the whole genome. The Y-axis shows the average eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for transcripts every percentile within the comparison transcript set. D. QQ plot comparing distributions of the maximum (max) eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for each transcript among duplication classes. The X-axis shows the max eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for transcripts every percentile within the whole genome. The Y-axis shows the max eQTL R<sup>2</sup> for transcripts every percentile within the comparison transcript set.</p>
