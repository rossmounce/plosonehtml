                Figure 3.  Impact of gene duplication on eQTL analysis.An analysis of eQTL detected within 211 replicated Bay-0Ã—Sha recombinant inbred lines was used to address the impact of gene duplication on genetic control of transcript variation. For all graphs, pink shows unique genes, light blue is the genome average, dark blue are the segmental duplicated genes and red is the tandem duplicated genes. A. Average number of cis-eQTL per transcript per duplication class. Letters show duplication classes with statistically significant differences. B. Average number of cis-eQTL per transcript per duplication class. Letters show duplication classes with statistically significant differences. C. QQ plot comparing distributions of the average eQTL R2 for each transcript among duplication classes. The X-axis shows the average eQTL R2 for transcripts every percentile within the whole genome. The Y-axis shows the average eQTL R2 for transcripts every percentile within the comparison transcript set. D. QQ plot comparing distributions of the maximum (max) eQTL R2 for each transcript among duplication classes. The X-axis shows the max eQTL R2 for transcripts every percentile within the whole genome. The Y-axis shows the max eQTL R2 for transcripts every percentile within the comparison transcript set.
