                Figure 4.  Comparison of average metabolic pathway CVs between development and abiotic stress datasets.The average CV per metabolic pathway for the Development and Abiotic microarray studies are plotted with the significance of each spot within the two studies represented by both color and shape: Pink squares = pathways with a significant deviation from the whole genome in both studies; red diamonds = deviation from the whole genome in Abiotic only; dark blue diamonds = deviation from the whole genome in Developmental only; light blue circles = no observed deviation from the whole genome average. The inset expands the lower left part of the graph. Significantly differing pathways are annotated to indicate biosynthesis (‘bio’) or degradation (‘deg’). GLS stands for glucosinolate. FAE stands for fatty acid elongation. CN stands for cyanate.
