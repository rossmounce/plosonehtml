Ï‡<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to test duplication frequency within each metabolic pathway for deviation from the whole genome expectation. * and blue bars show pathways that have a statistically significant bias in gene duplication after adjusting for multiple comparisons at an FDR of 0.05. The bars are separated into biochemical groups (left to right: secondary metabolism, amino acid related, energy related, nucleotide related and hormone related). A. Total duplicated genes per metabolic pathway. B. Tandem duplicated genes per metabolic pathway.</p>
