                Figure 7.  Variation of transcripts within the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway.The variation of each aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic transcript across seven Arabidopsis accessions from the Accession I dataset is plotted. Accumulation of each transcript within each accession was standardized to the average transcript level across the accessions. Accession coding is shown in the legend. Genes for the different transcripts are ordered from first to last (left to right) biosynthetic step. Arrows group genes for different biosynthetic steps. ‘Duplication’ indicates whether each gene was classified as being a tandem (T), segmental (S) or unique (U) gene [5]. ‘Activity’ shows whether each gene has a unique (U), redundant (R), semi-redundant (SR) or unvalidated (?) activity. Activity was defined via analysis of published literature such that if a loss of the gene abolished the biosynthetic reaction it was classified as unique, if the loss partially abolished the reaction it was classified as semi-redundant, and if gene loss had no effect on the reaction it was deemed redundant. A question mark means that gene loss has not yet been evaluated. As there is only one probeset on the ATH1 microarray for CYP79F1 and CYP79F2, they are jointly annotated as CYP79F in this study.
