Drug-resistance with low transmission fitness can emerge during treatment of individuals infected with the wild-type virus. It is assumed that compensatory mutations may result in generation of resistant mutants with high transmission fitness during the secondary stage of treated symptomatic infection. The compartments of untreated and treated individuals infected with the wild-type strain are represented by <em>I<sub>U</sub></em> and <em>I<sub>T</sub></em>, respectively. The corresponding compartments for the resistant strain with low (high) transmission fitness are denoted by sub-index <em>r</em> (<em>rH</em>).</p>
