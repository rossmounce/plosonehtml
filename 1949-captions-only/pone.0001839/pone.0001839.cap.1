                Figure 1.  Model structure for the emergence of drug-resistance during treatment of symptomatic infections.The clinical course of disease is divided into three stages: pre-symptomatic; primary; and secondary stages of symptomatic infections. Drug-resistance with low transmission fitness can emerge during treatment of individuals infected with the wild-type virus. It is assumed that compensatory mutations may result in generation of resistant mutants with high transmission fitness during the secondary stage of treated symptomatic infection. The compartments of untreated and treated individuals infected with the wild-type strain are represented by IU and IT, respectively. The corresponding compartments for the resistant strain with low (high) transmission fitness are denoted by sub-index r (rH).
