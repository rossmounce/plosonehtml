                Figure 3. (a) Total number of clinical infections caused by the wild-type, low fitness resistant, and high fitness resistant strains; (b) Total number of deaths; (c) Total number of clinical infections caused by the low fitness resistant strains; (d) Total number of clinical infections caused by the high fitness resistant strains, as a function of treatment level. Treatment of infected individuals begins one day after the onset of clinical disease; red and black curves correspond, respectively, to the reproduction numbers  (, ) and  (). Dashed curves in (a) and (b) correspond to the scenario in which no compensatory mutations occur, and resistant mutants are only present at low fitness cost.
