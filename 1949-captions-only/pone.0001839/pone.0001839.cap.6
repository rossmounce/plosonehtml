                Figure 6.  The effect of changing treatment level during a pandemic on the total number of clinical infections caused by the high fitness resistant strain, with .Simulations were seeded with an initial treatment level of (a) 85%; (b) 78% (optimal level); (c) 50%; (d) 25%, and then changed to the level shown on the horizontal axis at the time displayed on the vertical axis (corresponding to the time-course of the epidemic). The color bars illustrate the total number of clinical infections due to the resistant strain with high transmission fitness, relative to that generated when the optimal constant treatment level (78% in this case) is implemented.
