Treatment in (a) is maintained at the optimal level (78%) for the entire course of the outbreak. Treatment in (b) is initiated at a 25% level for the first 50 days (shaded area), and then increased to 90% for the rest of the outbreak. All other parameters are the same as those used for simulations in <a href="#pone-0001839-g002">Figure 2</a>.</p>
