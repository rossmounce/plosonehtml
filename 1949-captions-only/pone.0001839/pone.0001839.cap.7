                Figure 7.  Time-courses of clinical infections with one day delay in onset of treatment of indexed cases for .Simulations were run, when a single case infected with the wild-type virus is introduced into the susceptible population of size S0 = 100 000. Treatment in (a) is maintained at the optimal level (78%) for the entire course of the outbreak. Treatment in (b) is initiated at a 25% level for the first 50 days (shaded area), and then increased to 90% for the rest of the outbreak. All other parameters are the same as those used for simulations in Figure 2.
