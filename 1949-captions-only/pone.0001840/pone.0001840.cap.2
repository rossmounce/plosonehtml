Bc = Blindfolding continuous (for 21 days); Bt = Blindfolding test-only; Sc = System use continuous (in daily life and for all tests); St = System test-only (for all test but not in daily life); Sn = no System used (for the tests or in daily life). Note that subject BcSn/c was a cross between BcSc and BcSn because he was blindfolded continuously for 21 days, did not have the system for the first 11 days, but did use it in daily life and the tests for the final 10 days. The colors represent the extent of system use in <a href="#pone-0001840-g003">Figures 3</a> to <a href="#pone-0001840-g004"></a><a href="#pone-0001840-g005">5</a>, the shapes the extent of blindfolding in <a href="#pone-0001840-g003">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#pone-0001840-g005">5</a>.</p>
