The inserted array shows the potential target LEDs (black) in the perimeter. The subjects knew that these were confined to the horizontal meridian. Bottom) Accuracy is plotted as a function of the number of LEDs pushed on a given trial until hitting the target (“1” is perfect performance). All error bars denote standard error of the means in this and all figures.</p>
