                Figure 4.  The hexagonal LED task results from Experiment 2.Each of the six hexagonally arranged LEDs shown in the insert served twice as target, but as subjects were not informed about this array, they had to consider all 164 LEDs as possible targets. Mean response time (top) and number of trials to hit the target (bottom) as a function of the subject's condition (visual deprivation and system use for each subject).
