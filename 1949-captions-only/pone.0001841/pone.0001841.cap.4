                Figure 4.  The relationship between running performance on the ground and body mass across spider taxa.Filled circles and solid line: standing spiders; Open squares and dashed line: hanging spiders. Means were obtained across different instars for each spider group. Errors are s.e.m. The fitted model for standing spiders is: (log_speed = 1.3+1.6*log_carapace_width, P = 0.025). The fitted model for hanging spiders is: (log_speed = 1.3+2.1*log_carapace_width–1.1*log_carap​ace_width2, both regression coefficients P&lt;0.001). Letters on top of bars indicate significant differences between groups according to a Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test (P&lt;0.05). The letters in italic denote the spider taxa used: An, Anelosimus; Dy, Dyctinidae; Gn, Gnaphosidae; Hg, Hogna; Ho, Holocnemus; La, Latrodectus; Pa, Pardosa; Ph, Pholcus; Pl, Philodromidae; Sp, Sparassidae; Spk, Steatoda paykulliana; Str, Steatoda triangulosa (see Table S2 for further details).
