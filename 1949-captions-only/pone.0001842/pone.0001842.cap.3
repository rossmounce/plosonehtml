                Figure 3.  Insulin regulation of lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue (fragment).Transcripts called present are plotted with a red line on a white pane, absent transcripts are plotted blue on gray. Interactions are marked as p+ (activation by phosphorylation), b+ (activation by bonding) and tr+ (transcription activation). Timing of insulin receptor substrate transcription (IRS-1) is perfectly synchronized with insulin receptor transcription rate in spite of the absence call for the latter.
