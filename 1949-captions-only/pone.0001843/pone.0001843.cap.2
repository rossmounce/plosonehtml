The genomic fragment of each v-rDNA was identified by its clone digested with the same restriction enzyme (e.g., <a href="#pone-0001843-g001">Fig. 1F</a>) and the identity is indicated on the right of each Southern image. In A, copy number markers (1, 10 and 100 copies) of high (v-rDNA VI), medium (v-rDNA I) and low (v-rDNA VII) molecular weights were included on the right of the genomic DNA (G) In B and C, the identification markers, which are generated by digesting a mixture of cloned v-rDNA (cM), are shown to the right of the genomic DNA. m, molecular weight markers. D shows, as an example, the quantification of Bsp E1 RFLP. Three standard curves and their mathematical descriptions are shown; H, high-, M, medium- and L, low-molecular weight range. The density measurement of each RFLP band is mapped onto the standard curve of the appropriate molecular weight range. E, A summary of the copy number measurements. The copy numbers are rounded to the next integer. The Roman numerals in the parenthesis indicate the RFLPs that cannot be separated by gel electrophoresis. The average copy number was calculated from unambiguously identified RFLPs only. For the Nla III digestion, one RFLP had no corresponding v-rDNA clone (*). The total copy number of Nla III RFLP is estimated without this RFLP (i.e., 49) or with (i.e., 57).</p>
