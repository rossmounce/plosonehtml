Gray area represents the region sequenced. DNA sequencing and PCR analysis showed that the RFLPs around the promoter are due, in part, to the variable size of the enhancer. Because of uncertainties associated with aligning repetitive sequence, the size of the enhancer region was verified by PCR with primers flanking the region (circle-ended arrows). The resulting PCR fragments are shown in the gel panel, in which the templates (cloned v-rDNA) are indicated above each lane. The number of repeats in each enhancer region was estimated (black blocks, each represents one unit). Some units are partial as evidence in their DNA sequence. B, Multi-sequence alignment reveals variant-specific SNPs in the transcribed region (5′-ETS). The sequences (+1 to +2000) of the 26 v-rDNA clones are aligned with the known rDNA sequence BK000964. Only a segment of the alignment (+407 to +475) is shown as an example. The nucleotides identical to all v-rDNAs are displayed as white letters in a gray background, the variable nucleotides as gray letters in a white background and the variant-specific nucleotide as white letters in a black background. Listed at the bottom of the alignment is the consensus sequence. C, The same alignment is displayed as a dendrogram to show the genetic distance among the v-rDNA types.</p>
