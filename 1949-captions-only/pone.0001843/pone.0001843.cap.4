A generic rDNA promoter is depicted at the top and the location of the SNPs (bold letters in the sequence) is shown below. The v-rDNAs associated with the SNP are indicated on the left of the sequence and the promoter classification on the right. Transcription start site (bent arrow), cis-elements (grey sections), HpaII sites (banners) and CpG islands (diamond-headed pins). B, The methylation status of the CpCpGpG was examined by Hpa II and Msp I digestions followed by PCR amplification of the fragment containing the cut site. Hpa II-resistance indicates methylation at the CpG within the site, where as MspI-resistance indicates CpC methylation. Three PCRs were designed to examine the Hpa II/Msp I sites at −144, −179 and −261 using primers indicated in (A). The PCR primers (circle-ended arrows) share an anchor primer (*) and the other primers determine whether the PCR examines one, two or three HpaII sites as indicated by the boxed number in (A). The number of Hpa II sites examined is indicated on the right of the gel panel in (B). The variant types examined are listed on top and restriction enzymes used below each lane. For each DNA sample, three digestions were performed. b, bovine serum albumin (no digestion control), h, Hpa II and m, Msp I. C, The results in (B) were verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR, n = 2), in which the quantity of amplified genomic sequence is assigned as 1.0. D and E, Cytosine-methylation at other sites was evaluated by bisulfite sequencing. Genomic DNA from liver (D) and testis (E) was digested by Bsp I (D) or Nsp I (E) and six v-rDNA types were isolated based on their co-migration with the cloned v-rDNA digested with the same restriction enzyme. The genomic DNA served as a reference. Randomly picked rDNA promoters were sequenced from either strands (above and below the line) and cytosine methylation data are aligned with a generic rDNA promoter depicted on the top of the panel. Black circle, methylated, open circle, unmethylated, gray circle, methylation of non-CpG (e.g., CpC sites).</p>
