The large arrow depicts transcription start site and direction; asterisk, the first cleavage site in processing the pre-rRNA; small arrows, PCR primers; and the Roman numerals, PCR specificity. B, The specificity of each variant-specific PCR was tested with cloned v-rDNAs. The PCR was also adjusted, using cloned v-rDNA, to have similar amplification efficiency. Lowercase letters on top of the gel image indicate cloned templates, and uppercase letters to the left of image, the specificity of primers, m, molecular weight marker. C, An example of the specificity of qPCR for variant IV is shown (SYBG fluorescence). The delta Ct between specific and non-specific reactions is greater than 10.</p>
