A, RNAs from common and gender-specific tissues of one female and one male CF1 mice were assayed as indicated above the gel image. For a given tissue sample, all variant-specific PCRs were performed with the same cDNA preparation. The primer specificity is indicated on the left of the gel image. For each PCR, a set of controls was included to monitor the specificity (the left seven lanes) and the relative quantity and integrity of the RNA preparation (beta-actin). To assure no toxicity was present to prevent amplification of v-rDNA V, the cloned DNA was mixed with cDNA preparation before PCR (row +V). Similar results were obtained for VII (not shown). A PCR detecting all v-rDNA transcript (47S) is also included. m, molecular weight markers, O, blank. B and C, as in A except that each assay included a set of CF1 RNA samples as a reference (the last three or four lanes).</p>
