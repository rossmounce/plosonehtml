                Figure 2.  Definition of an engaged nucleotide in a particular step of transcriptional analysis.(A) to (C). This is to illustrate that multiple secondary structures of the targeted exon (drawn in green) are predicted in each step of transcriptional analysis, with some of the possible structural motifs shown here. For illustration purpose, a particular nucleotide (marked in red) within an AON target site (green line) is tracked. When this nucleotide is paired (denoted with *), it is not accessible for AON binding. If this nucleotide is paired in all predicted secondary structures, this nucleotide is defined as an engaged nucleotide at this particular step of transcriptional analysis (B).
