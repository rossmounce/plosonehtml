                Figure 3.  Occurrences of engaged nucleotides at each step of transcriptional analysis.In the above illustration, the horizontal axis denotes sequential steps of transcriptional analysis while the vertical axis denotes numbered nucleotides within the AON target site. At each step of transcriptional analysis, nucleotides in the target site that are engaged are depicted as a black dot in the plot. The calculations of the fourth level scores, L4_OR and L4_AND, are illustrated (refer to main text for details).
