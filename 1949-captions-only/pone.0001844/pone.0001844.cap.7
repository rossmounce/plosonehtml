For every AON concentration, the relative percentage of total transcripts (average value of duplicate transfections) with skipping of the targeted exon is given below the lanes. The middle panel indicates the relative position of the novel AONs with respect to published AONs. The right panel plots the <em>co-transcriptional</em> binding accessibility of the novel AON target sites, wherein the horizontal axis denotes sequential steps of transcriptional analysis and the vertical axis denotes numbered nucleotides within the AON target site. At each step of transcriptional analysis, nucleotides in the target site that are <em>engaged</em> are depicted as a black dot in the plot.</p>
