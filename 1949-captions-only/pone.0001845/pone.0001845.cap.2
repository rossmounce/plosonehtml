                Figure 2.  Effect of remigration interval (RI) on δ13C and δ15N leatherback tissus (plasma, RBC and egg-yolk).Values are mean±SD. The black symbols represent the values of Wallace et al. [41] for Atlantic and Pacific populations of leatherback turtles, provided for comparison. The map shows the two major patterns of migration of Atlantic turtles, from nesting beaches to foraging areas, following Ferraroli et al. [3] and Hays et al. [23].
