Hoechst 33342 was used to visualize the shape or condensation of the nuclei and PI was used as a probe for lack of membrane integrity. Assessment of cell death was performed as described in the text. The percentage of cells denoted as dead, counting a total of 700–1000 cells in this particular experiment, is also given in italics in the lower part of the figure. (<em>B</em>) Exposure of phospatidylserine was evaluated after 3 h treatment of HeLa cells with either only <em>BioPORTER</em>, SecTRAP/<em>BioPORTER-</em>complex or 1 µM staurosporine, staining cells with Annexin-V and PI as described in the text. Magnification was x 40 in all panels.</p>
