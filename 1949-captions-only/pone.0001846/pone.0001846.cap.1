                Figure 1.  SecTRAPs induce cell death and phosphatidyl serine exposure in human cancer cells.(A) Morphological features and staining of HeLa and A549 cells after incubation for 4 h with BioPORTER (BP) alone, 100 ng full-length TrxR1/BioPORTER-complex, 100 ng SecTRAP/BioPORTER-complex or 1 µM staurosporine (STS), as indicated. Hoechst 33342 was used to visualize the shape or condensation of the nuclei and PI was used as a probe for lack of membrane integrity. Assessment of cell death was performed as described in the text. The percentage of cells denoted as dead, counting a total of 700–1000 cells in this particular experiment, is also given in italics in the lower part of the figure. (B) Exposure of phospatidylserine was evaluated after 3 h treatment of HeLa cells with either only BioPORTER, SecTRAP/BioPORTER-complex or 1 µM staurosporine, staining cells with Annexin-V and PI as described in the text. Magnification was x 40 in all panels.
