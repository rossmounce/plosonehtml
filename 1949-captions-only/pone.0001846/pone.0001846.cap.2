A significant increase in cell death was seen in all cases where SecTRAPs were incubated with the cells in the presence of <em>BioPORTER</em> as compared to addition of SecTRAPs alone (***, p&lt;0.001) (<em>B</em>) A SecTRAP preparation (truncated rat TrxR1) at an amount of 0.1 pg-100 ng was used for delivery into 10,000 A549 cells using <em>BioPORTER,</em> as described in the text. The graph shows the determined cell death (mean value±S.D.) triggered by each SecTRAP amount and significant differences to control treatments are indicated, using as controls either incubation with only TE buffer (white bar: n.s., p&gt;0.05; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001) or with <em>BioPORTER</em> alone (dashed bar: n.s., p&gt;0.05; ##, p&lt;0.01; ###, p&lt;0.001). No significant difference in cell death was seen comparing the two control treatments with each other. (<em>C</em>) A549 cells were treated with 100 ng full-length TrxR1 or a mixture of different amounts of TrxR1 with 10 ng SecTRAP using <em>BioPORTER</em>, as indicated in the figure. Differences in cell death were compared to control cells either treated with TE buffer (white bar; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001) or with only <em>BioPORTER</em> (dashed bar; ###, p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant difference in cell death was seen between the two control treatments or in comparisons of either control with the treatment using 100 ng TrxR1 (n.s., p&gt;0.05). In all experiments (<em>A–C</em>) cells were incubated for 4 h with the separate treatments and were subsequently stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI for evaluation of dead cells as described in the text.</p>
