Cell death was subsequently evaluated by staining with Hoechst and PI as described. As a control experiment, an expected increase of cell death was seen when cells were treated with the combination of TNF-α and cycloheximide compared to treatment of either of these compounds alone, showing that the cycloheximide treatment had inhibited protein synthesis (see text). In contrast, cycloheximide had no effect on the cell death provoked by the SecTRAP/<em>BioPORTER</em> treatment, as indicated in the figure (n.s., p&gt;0.05; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01).</p>
