In (<em>B</em>) HeLa or A549 cells were incubated 30 min with 25 µM of inhibitors for caspase-2 (zVDVAD-fmk), caspase-3 (zDEVD-fmk) or caspase-8 (zIETD-fmk) before SecTRAP treatment. In all of these cases a significantly lower cell death was observed, as indicated in the figure, suggesting that the three caspases may be involved in propagating the cell death triggered by SecTRAPs, as further discussed in the text (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001).</p>
