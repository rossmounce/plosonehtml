                Figure 6.  C59S/C64S mutant SecTRAPs cannot induce cell death in A549 cells.A549 cells were treated with 100 ng of the C59S/C64S mutant rat TrxR or native rat TrxR1 preparations, with or without cisplatin (CDDP) derivatization of the Sec residue, using BioPORTER, as indicated in the figure and described further in the text. Cell death was significantly increased after treatment with truncated TrxR or TrxR1 derivatized with cisplatin compared to control using only BioPORTER, whereas the other proteins gave no significant difference in cell death compared to the control (n.s., p&gt;0.05; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01).
