Cell death was significantly increased after treatment with truncated TrxR or TrxR1 derivatized with cisplatin compared to control using only <em>BioPORTER,</em> whereas the other proteins gave no significant difference in cell death compared to the control (n.s., p&gt;0.05; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01).</p>
