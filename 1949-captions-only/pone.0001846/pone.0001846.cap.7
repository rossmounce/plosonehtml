                Figure 7.  Either α-tocopherol or ascorbic acid can prevent cell killing by SecTRAPs but not the combinatory treatment.A549 cells were preincubated for 1 h with α-tocopherol (100 µM), ascorbic acid (100 µM) or a combination of the two compounds, as indicated in the figure. SecTRAP/BioPORTER-complex was subsequently added to the cells, which were then incubated for additional 4 h before analysis of cell death as described in the text. A significant increase in cell death compared to non-treated cells (***, p&lt;0.001) or cells treated with only BioPORTER (##, p&lt;0.01, ###, p&lt;0.001) was seen in cells treated with SecTRAPs either in absence of the antioxidant compounds or together with the combination of both α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. All other treatments lacked a significant difference in cell death compared to either of the two controls (p&gt;0.05).
