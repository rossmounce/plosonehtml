SecTRAP/<em>BioPORTER</em>-complex was subsequently added to the cells, which were then incubated for additional 4 h before analysis of cell death as described in the text. A significant increase in cell death compared to non-treated cells (***, p&lt;0.001) or cells treated with only <em>BioPORTER</em> (##, p&lt;0.01, ###, p&lt;0.001) was seen in cells treated with SecTRAPs either in absence of the antioxidant compounds or together with the combination of both α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. All other treatments lacked a significant difference in cell death compared to either of the two controls (p&gt;0.05).</p>
