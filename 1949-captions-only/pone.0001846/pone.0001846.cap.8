The cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Ascorbic acid (Vit C) and/or α-tocopherol (Vit E) was added 1 h in advance to the cells before treatment. Two distinct experiments with two samples in each treatment were performed with similar results and representative images of the observed staining patterns are shown. The three right-most pictures displaying the intracellular patterns of DCF fluorescence are shown at higher magnification than the three panels to the left displaying the overview of DCF fluorescence in control cells or in cells treated with either TrxR1 or SecTRAPs together with <em>BioPORTER</em>.</p>
