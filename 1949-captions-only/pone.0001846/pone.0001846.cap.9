                Figure 9.  Model for the formation and function of SecTRAPs.We propose that during most conditions of normal cell growth the Sec residue in TrxR1 is intact and the role of this enzyme is thus to sustain the many cellular functions of the thioredoxin system. This activity is dependent upon the redox active C-terminal Sec-containing active site in TrxR1. SecTRAPs may however be formed from TrxR1 if its Sec residue becomes compromised, either by removal or by derivatization with electrophilic compounds, while the FAD and N-terminal redox active CVNVGC motif of the enzyme are kept intact. SecTRAPs lack the Trx reducing activity of native TrxR1 but become potent inducers of cell death by a gain of function. This cell death is, as shown in the present study, rapid, does not require induction of protein synthesis, involves production of reactive oxygen species and is prevented by caspase inhibitors. If, on the other hand, both the CVNVGC motif and the C-terminal selenolthiol motif become inactivated, e.g. by certain types of TrxR1 inhibitors or if the overall expression of TrxR1 is diminished in cells, impaired cell function or cell death may still occur. In such cases the cellular consequences would however not be due to a gain of function in derivatives of TrxR1, but rather to hampered functions of the complete cellular thioredoxin system.
