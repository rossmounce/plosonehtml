Predicted protein products from the structural (VP4 to VP1) and non-structural (PRO-protease; POL-polymerase) regions are indicated. Regions are shaded alternatively for convenience and numbering indicates positions of predicted protease cleavage according to the start of the HRV-QPM polyprotein. Dashed lines indicate regions involved in species classifications. (B) HRV A2 amino acid similarity to HRV A (n = 34) and B (n = 13), or HEV (n = 71) strains as determined by SimPlotÂ© analysis. Plots indicate the percentage similarity of a 50% consensus sequence from each species' polyprotein compared to the HRV A2 strains. Average similarity across the polyprotein is indicated by dotted line. Averaged values for the complete coding, P1 and 2C+3CD regions are indicated within the inset of each panel.</p>
