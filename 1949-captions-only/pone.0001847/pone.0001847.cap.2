                Figure 2.  Comparison of predicted protomers.(A) A simplified depiction of two protomers in opposition on a viral capsid (shaded areas, adapted from [37]). As a guide for visualising loop length, a dashed and a dotted line are spaced equidistantly and represent proximal and distal positions from the virion core, respectively. (B) Ribbon depiction of two opposing viral protomers from HRV-QPM, HRV-2 (minor group) and HRV-14 (major group). HRV-QPM proteins were predicted by in silico matching to the empirically derived HRV-16 and HRV-14 structure (materials and methods). Protomers consist of one copy each of VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. β-sheets are depicted as flat arrows and α-helices as coiled ribbons. The formation of VP1-VP3 into eight anti-parallel β-sheets is indicative of the ‘jellyroll’ conformation typical in picornaviruses. Major differences in the predicted HRV-QPM VP1 include the shortened external loops between β-sheets (asterisk) and an additional C-terminal sheet-loop-sheet formation (arrow indicates the same location on all protomers for comparison).
