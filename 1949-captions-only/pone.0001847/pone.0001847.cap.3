                Figure 3.  Predicted HRV-QPM pentamers compared to representative major (HRV-14) and minor (HRV-2) group HRV pentamers derived from crystallography data.(A) HRV-QPM versus HRV-14 SimPlot data projected onto a space filling depiction of the predicted HRV-QPM pentamer. Shading represents the amino acid identity (26–69%). The yellow dashed triangle represents a single icosahedral asymmetric unit (T = p3 conformation) composed of VP1 and VP2 from the same protomer and VP3 for an adjacent protomer. The major group domains of interest are divided between two asymmetric units for ease of viewing. Receptor (white) and antigenic (red) sites are shown in outline. (B) Top view ribbon depiction of a major group HRV pentamer (HRV-14; gray) with labelled antigenic neutralisation sites (NImIA-III, green) and combined HRV A (HRV-16) and B (HRV-14)ICAM-1 receptor footprints (red) [6], [37]. Magnified areas of interest (boxed) highlight computer-based predictive comparisons to the equivalent HRV-QPM (orange) structures of interest. Arrows indicate structures and corresponding sequences of interest (refer to text). (C) HRV-QPM versus HRV-2 SimPlot data projected onto the HRV-QPM pentamer. The domains of interest are mostly shown within a single asymmetric unit. (D) A minor group pentamer (HRV-2; gray) including antigenic sites (sites A–C, green) and VLDL-R footprint (red) [10]. Attachment of the VLDL-R involves adjacent VP1 molecules. Magnified VP1 area represents one half of a VLDL-R footprint [42]. Amino acid substitutions (arrowed) contributed to the differences between minor group sites B and C.
