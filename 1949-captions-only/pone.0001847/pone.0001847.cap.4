                Figure 4.  Comparison of HRV-QPM and HEV structures at the sites comprising HEV receptor footprints.Figures indicate comparison of the predicted structures of HRV-QPM (orange) with representative HEVs (gray) in regions identified as HEV receptor footprints (red) across VP1, VP2 and VP3 proteins. RMSD values shown for conformational comparison of CAR and HRV-QPM structures, in angstroms.
