(B) 3D rendering of predicted HRV capsids providing imagery similar to that obtained by cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction at 10 Å resolution. HRV-2, -14 and -16 predicted structures were derived from crystallography data. Each viral capsid has been depth cued to demonstrate canyon structure; yellow indicates surface detail and blue identifies areas of greatest depth. (C) Numbers superimposed over the lattice indicate the fold axis. The simplified position of the canyon is indicated by a circle on the capsid. All models were rendered and oriented identically, as determined by VIPERdb <a href="#pone.0001847-Shepherd1">[59]</a>.</p>
