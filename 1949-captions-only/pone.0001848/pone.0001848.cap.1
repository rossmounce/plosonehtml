                Figure 1.  Synthetic pathways for serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine.The amino acid tryptophan is the starting point for the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), whereas tyrosine is the source for dopamine as well as tyramine and octopamine. An alternative pathway (dotted arrow) via DADH may exist that permits the synthesis of tyramine from dopamine. DADH: dopamine dehydroxylase; DDC: DOPA decarboxylase; TβH: tyramine β-hydroxylase; TDC: tyrosine decarboxylase; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; TRH: tryptophan hydroxylase.
