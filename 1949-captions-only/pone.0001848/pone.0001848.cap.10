B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a1 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. C1) Dorsal view of <em>Ddc-gal4</em> x mCD8GFP expressing neurons (green) and C2) MIP-immunoreactive neurons (magenta) in a larval VG. The merged image (C3) provided the basis for the scheme shown in (C4). D1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a3 (* in C3), and D4) the deduced idealized scheme. In all schemes, neurons showing both <em>Ddc-gal4</em>-driven mCD8GFP expression and CCAP/MIP immunoreactivity are green-colored. <em>Ddc-gal4</em> x mCD8GFP expressing neurons which lacked CCAP/MIP immunoreactivity are shown in gray. Vice versa, neurons which exclusively showed CCAP/MIP immunoreactivity are blue-colored. Original images are maximum pixel intensity projections of volume-rendered 3D image stacks. Scale bars: 50 µm in A) and C), 25 µm in B) and D).</p>
