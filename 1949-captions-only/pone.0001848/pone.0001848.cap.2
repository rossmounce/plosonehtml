                Figure 2.  The Fasciclin2 landmark system in the Drosophila larval VG.A1) Dorsal view of a 3D image stack showing volume-rendered Fas2-immunoreactive tracts in the thoracic (t1-3) and abdominal neuromeres (a1-8) of the L3 larval VG, and A2) the deduced idealized dorsal scheme. B) Detailed dorsal and C) lateral view of a5 and adjacent neuromeres (* in A1). D1) Transversal view of a5, and D2) the deduced idealized transversal scheme. Longitudinal projections are named according to their relative dorso-ventral (D: dorsal, C: central, V: ventral) and medio-lateral (M: medial, I: intermedial, L: lateral) position. For example, the two dorso-medial Fas2-immunoreactive tracts are referred to as DM tracts. Transversal projections (TP) are numbered according to their relative dorso-ventral position, i.e. “1” represents the topmost TP [19]. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 10 µm in B), C), and D).
