                Figure 3.  Mapping of 5-HT-immunoreactive neurons.Ventral view of 3D image stacks showing volume-rendered A1) 5-HT-immunoreactive neurons (green) and A2) Fas2-positive tracts (magenta) in a larval VG. The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of presumed 5-HT neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a2 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized transversal scheme. Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of 5-HT-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B).
