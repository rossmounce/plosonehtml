                Figure 4.  Mapping of Th-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons.A1) Ventral view of 3D image stacks showing volume-rendered GFP-immunoreactive neurons (green) and A2) Fas2-positive tracts (magenta) in a larva expressing Th-gal4-driven mCD8GFP. The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of Th-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere t1 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. C1-3) Transversal views, and C4) idealized scheme of a5 (° in A3). Note that the idealized schemes A4) and C4) include the vmTH neurons of a1-7, which often lacked Th-gal4-driven mCD8GFP expression. These neurons, however, always showed strong TH immunoreactivity (see Fig. S2). Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B) and C).
