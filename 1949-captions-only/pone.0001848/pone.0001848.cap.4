The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of <em>Th-gal4</em> x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere t1 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. C1-3) Transversal views, and C4) idealized scheme of a5 (° in A3). Note that the idealized schemes A4) and C4) include the vmTH neurons of a1-7, which often lacked <em>Th-gal4</em>-driven mCD8GFP expression. These neurons, however, always showed strong TH immunoreactivity (see <a href="#pone.0001848.s002">Fig. S2</a>). Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B) and C).</p>
