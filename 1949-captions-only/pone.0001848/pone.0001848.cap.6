                Figure 6.  Mapping of Ddc-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons.A1) Ventral view of 3D image stacks showing volume-rendered GFP-immunoreactive neurons (green) and A2) Fas2-positive tracts (magenta) in a larva expressing Ddc-gal4-driven mCD8GFP. The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of Ddc-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a4 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. Note that the Ddc-gal4 driver typically drives mCD8GFP expression in most, but not all presumed DDC neurons of the VG (see Fig. S3 and S4). Thus, some presumed DDC neurons are not included in the idealized schemes shown here. Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B) and C).
