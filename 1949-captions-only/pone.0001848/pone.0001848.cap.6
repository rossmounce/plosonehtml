The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of <em>Ddc-gal4</em> x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a4 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. Note that the <em>Ddc-gal4</em> driver typically drives mCD8GFP expression in most, but not all presumed DDC neurons of the VG (see <a href="#pone.0001848.s003">Fig. S3</a> and <a href="#pone.0001848.s004">S4</a>). Thus, some presumed DDC neurons are not included in the idealized schemes shown here. Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B) and C).</p>
