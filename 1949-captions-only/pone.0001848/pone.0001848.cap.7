The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of DDC-immunoreactive neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a4 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. Besides the aminergic neurons, the DDC antiserum also faintly labeled presumed peptidergic neurons, which are shown in gray in the schemes. Noteworthy, these peptidergic neurons are also present in the <em>Ddc-gal4</em> expression pattern (see <a href="#pone-0001848-g006">Fig. 6</a>). Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B).</p>
