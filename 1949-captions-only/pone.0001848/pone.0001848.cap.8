                Figure 8.  Mapping of Tdc2-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons.A1) Ventral view of 3D image stacks showing volume-rendered GFP-immunoreactive neurons (green) and A2) Fas2-positive tracts (magenta) in a larva expressing Tdc2-gal4-driven mCD8GFP. The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of Tdc2-gal4 x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a3 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. Note that the idealized scheme A4) includes the pmTDC2 neurons of t1-3 and a1, which often faintly expressed Tdc2-gal4-driven mCD8GFP. The pmTDC2 neurons, however, always showed strong TβH immunoreactivity (see Fig. S5). Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B).
