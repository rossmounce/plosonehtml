The merged image (A3) served for an idealized schematic representation of <em>Tdc2-gal4</em> x mCD8GFP expressing neurons in the Fas2 landmark system (A4). B1-3) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromere a3 (* in A3), and B4) the deduced idealized scheme. Note that the idealized scheme A4) includes the pmTDC2 neurons of t1-3 and a1, which often faintly expressed <em>Tdc2-gal4</em>-driven mCD8GFP. The pmTDC2 neurons, however, always showed strong TβH immunoreactivity (see <a href="#pone.0001848.s005">Fig. S5</a>). Green-shaded areas in the schemes contain a high concentration of GFP-immunoreactive arborizations. Scale bars: 50 µm in A), 25 µm in B).</p>
