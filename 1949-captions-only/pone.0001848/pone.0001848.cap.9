                Figure 9.  Distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in TDC2 neurons.(A1-D1) Dorsal view of GFP immunoreactivity in the VG of larvae expressing Tdc2-gal4-driven mCD8GFP (A1-2), SybGFP (B1-2), SytGFP (C1-2), or DscamGFP (D1-2). (A2-D2) Corresponding transversal views of the neuromeres a3 or a4 (* in A1-D1). All images are auto-contrasted maximum pixel intensity projections of volume-rendered 3D image stacks. Scale bars: 50 µm in A1-D1), 25 µm in A2-D2).
