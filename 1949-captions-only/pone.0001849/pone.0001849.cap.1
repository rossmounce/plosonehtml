                Figure 1.  IGF2 DMR0 Methylation levels in Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) patients.A. Location of DMR0 within the IGF2 gene relative to the paternally methylated imprinting control region IC1 which is upstream of H19. Pyrosequencing was used to analyse methylation at six CpGs within the DMR0 region (NCBI 36: 11, 2125904–2126160, containing SNP rs3741210). Bisulphite (BSQ) and pyrosequencing (PSQ) primer positions are as indicated. This region contains the CpGs (numbered 15,16,17) marked in grey which have previously been published to be hypomethylated in Colorectal cancer [21]. Vertical lines indicate MspI/HpaII sites in the DMR0. B. Box plot showing medians, IQR, max. and min. values for IGF2 DMR0 methylation levels as measured by pyrosequencing of bisulphite converted DNA obtained from peripheral blood samples from BWS and SRS patients. Methylation percentages reflect the proportion of bisulphite converted cytosines at the CpGs measured in the assay. Normal methylation levels for imprinted DMRs are 45–55% (see C). Categories of BWS patients included those with: no imprinting defect at the IC1 region and the IC2 region (NM); low methylation (LM) at the IC2 (IC2-LM); increased paternal 11p15 through paternal duplication or uniparental disomy (pUPD); and hypermethylation at IC1 (IC1-HM). SRS patients included two each of maternal duplication of 11p15 (Mat Dup) and hypomethylation at IC1 (IC1-LM). BWS with hypermethylation at the IC1, also have hypermethylation at DMR0, while SRS with hypomethylation IC1 have hypomethylation at DMR0. C. Parent of origin specific methylation in normal, BWS and SRS patients. The BWS and SRS patients have imprinting defects at IC1. Bisulphite converted DNA was amplified with allele-specific primers for the rs3741210 polymorphism in IGF2 DMR0 prior to pyrosequencing for methylation. The T allele is shown by squares and C alleles shown by triangles in the plots. Circles show the percentage of total methylation of the CpGs assayed. The paternal allele is more methylated at DMR0 than the maternal allele. Both alleles are hypermethylated in BWS and both alleles are hypomethylated in SRS.
