A.</span></strong></p><a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1"></a><p>Box plot showing medians, IQR, max. and min. values for <em>IGF2</em> DMR0 methylation levels as measured by pyrosequencing of peripheral blood (open box), normal kidney (hatched box) and tumour biopsies (grey box) from Wilms Tumour patients that do not have BWS. Methylation percentages reflect the proportion of bisulphite converted cytosines at the CpGs measured in the assay. Normal methylation levels for imprinted DMRs are 45–55% (see D). Wilms Tumour patient samples include peripheral blood and tumour DNA from patients with normal methylation at IC1 in their tumours (NM); peripheral blood, normal kidney and tumour DNA samples from patients with hypomethylation of IC1 in their tumours (IC1-HM); and tumour DNA samples from patients with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in their tumours. Strikingly, Wilms Tumour patients with hypermethylation at IC1 have hypomethylation at DMR0 in their tumours. B Methylation levels in peripheral blood, unaffected kidney tissue and Wilms tumour kidney tissue from two BWS patients (one with IC1 hypermethylation and one with pUPD). Both patients have hypomethylation of <em>IGF2</em> DMR0 in their tumours. C Linear regression curve showing inverse relationship between methylation levels at the IC1 and DMR0 in Wilms Tumour. Tumours with hypermethylation at the IC1 have loss of methylation at DMR0. D. Peripheral blood and kidney tissue from a patient with Wilms Tumour that does not have hypermethylation at IC1. The C-allele is hypermethylated, while the T-allele is hypomethylated in both the blood and kidney–indicating similar parent of origin methylation in these tissues.</p>
