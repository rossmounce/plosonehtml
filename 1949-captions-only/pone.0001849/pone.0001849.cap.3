IC1 and DMR0 are methylated on the paternal chromosome. In BWS, the epigenotype and expression pattern of the maternal chromosome are converted to paternal and in SRS, the epigenotype and expression pattern of the paternal chromosome are converted to maternal (imprint switching). In the Wilms tumour, <em>IGF2</em> activation and <em>H19</em> silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints (somatic loss of imprinting).</p>
