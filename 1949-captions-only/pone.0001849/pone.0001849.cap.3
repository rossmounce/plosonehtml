                Figure 3.  Summary of IGF2 DMR0 Methylation relative to IC1 in normal, congenital growth disorders and Wilms tumour.In normal individuals, IGF2 expression is from the paternal allele and H19 is from the maternal allele. IC1 and DMR0 are methylated on the paternal chromosome. In BWS, the epigenotype and expression pattern of the maternal chromosome are converted to paternal and in SRS, the epigenotype and expression pattern of the paternal chromosome are converted to maternal (imprint switching). In the Wilms tumour, IGF2 activation and H19 silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints (somatic loss of imprinting).
