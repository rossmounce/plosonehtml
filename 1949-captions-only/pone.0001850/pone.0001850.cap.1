                Figure 1.  Test versus re-test QFT results expressed as IFN-γ (IU/mL).Data for each individual is plotted with different symbols, and the line of equality is shown as the diagonal. Note that more points fall above the line of equality than below, indicating higher IFN-γ levels upon re-testing of blood. The spread of the IFN-γ results from the line of equality increases with increasing IFN-γ results, indicating that a log-transformation was appropriate. QFT: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube®; IFN-γ: interferon-gamma.
