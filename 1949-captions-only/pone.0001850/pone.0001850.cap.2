                Figure 2.  Difference in QFT results (test–re-test) versus the average of QFT test and re-test results (all on the log scale).Separate plotting characters are used for each individual and the mean log-difference is shown as the broken horizontal line. We note that there tend to be more points above zero and hence the average difference (test–re-test) lies above 0, indicating higher IFN-γ results upon re-testing of the same specimens. QFT: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube®; IFN-γ: interferon-gamma.
