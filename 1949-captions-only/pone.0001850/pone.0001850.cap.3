For each individual, the IFN-γ results taken on four days are plotted on the log scale. Most individuals do not cross the positive test result threshold. For two individuals (lines shown in bold) whose trajectories do cross the threshold, test results are discordant. QFT: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube®; IFN-γ: interferon-gamma.</p>
