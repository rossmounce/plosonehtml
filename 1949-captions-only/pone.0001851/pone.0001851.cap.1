                Figure 1.  Defects in embryonic bile duct morphogenesis in Jag1dDSL/+ Notch2del1/+ mice.Cytokeratin immunostaining of control littermate and Jag1dDSL/+ Notch2del1/+ liver sections at the indicated ages. A,B. At E16.5, both control (A) and Jag1dDSL/+ Notch2del1/+ (B) have formed a partly bilayered ductal plate (arrowheads). Câ€“F. Over the next several days, focal dilations (arrowheads) form in the ductal plate of both control and mutant embryos. Other regions of the ductal plate begin to regress. G,H. At P7, the focal dilations have formed epithelial bile ducts incorporated into the portal mesenchyme (arrows) in the control liver (G), while the Jag1dDSL/+ Notch2del1/+ liver (H) exhibits only ductal plate remnants (arrowheads).
