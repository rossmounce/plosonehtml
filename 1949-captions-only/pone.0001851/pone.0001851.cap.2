                Figure 2.  Conditional excision of the Notch2flox allele by the Alb1-Cre transgene.Southern blot of SacI/EcoRI- digested DNA isolated at P4. Excision of the Notch2flox allele (asterisk indicates the excised allele) was observed only in liver DNA of Notch2-cko mice (lane 2), but not in kidney DNA of Notch2-cko mice (lanes 5,6). Genotype of Notch2-cko mice is Notch2flox/Notch2del2; Alb1-Cre/+.
