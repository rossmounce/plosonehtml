                Figure 4.  Defects in bile duct formation in Notch2-cko mice using either the Notch2del2 or Notch2del3 alleles.A,B. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections at P7 of control littermate (CT) and Notch2-cko mice using the Notch2del2 allele. Bile ducts (arrow) are observed in the periportal region of the control littermate (A), but not the Notch2-cko mouse (B). Câ€“F. DBA lectin staining. C,D. Control littermate and Notch2-cko mice using the Notch2del2 allele at P7. E,F. Control littermate and Notch2-cko mice using the Notch2del3 allele at P3. DBA-positive cells form patent bile ducts (arrows) adjacent to the portal veins in control mice (C,E). In Notch2-cko mice using either the Notch2del2 (D) or Notch2del3 (F) allele, small numbers of DBA-positive cells (arrowheads) are present adjacent to the portal veins, but these cells have not formed patent ducts. G,H. Cytokeratin immunostaining of control littermate and Notch2-cko mice (Notch2del2 allele) at P7. The ductal plate of the control liver (G) has remodeled into epithelial bile ducts (arrows), while the Notch2-cko liver (H) exhibits only ductal plate remnants (arrowheads).
