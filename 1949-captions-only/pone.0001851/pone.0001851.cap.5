                Figure 5.  Notch signaling regulates bile duct morphogenesis independently of HNF6 and HNF1β.A–D. HNF1β expression in Notch2-cko mice at P7 and P0. E,F. HNF6 expression in Jag1dDSL/+ Notch2del1/+ mice at P0. The HNF1β and HNF6 proteins were expressed similarly in the periportal region (arrowheads) of both control littermate and mutant livers.
