The blot was also probed with prohibitin as a mitochondrial marker and with actin as a cytosolic marker (negative, not shown), to check for fraction purity. (B) Output of multiparametric FACS analysis show apoptosis induction of HeLa cells exposed for 2 hours to several concentrations of CTM with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (DB, 8 µM). Healthy cells (H) are delimited by the quadrant. Apoptotic cells (A) display mitochondrial depolarization (reduced TMRM staining) and/or expose phosphatidylserine on their surface (increased Annexin V-FITC staining). Propidium iodide-positive, <em>i.e.</em> dead cells (D), were evaluated on a PI <em>vs</em> TMRM diagram (not shown); these cells were excluded from the reported plots and shown as histograms. Numbers are percentages. (C) PTP opening of digitonized HeLa cells measured with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> retention capacity assay. Calcium Green-5N fluorescence is reported as arbitrary units on the <em>y</em> axis. As the probe does not permeate mitochondria, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the organelles is displayed by a rapid decrease of the fluorescence spike. Pore inducers or inhibitors reduce or increase, respectively, the threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration required to trigger the permeability transition, <em>i.e.</em> the number of spikes before a sudden and marked fluorescence increase occurs. Experiments were started by the addition of digitonized cells (not shown) followed by pulses of the indicated concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Where indicated, CTM was added to cells 45 minutes before permeabilization with digitonin. Note that CTM reduced the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into mitochondria. In the upper right plot DB was added before mitochondria to test the PTP-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. (D) Respiration assay performed on mitochondria isolated from mouse liver. The graph shows the rate of oxygen consumption (ng AtO stands for ngatoms of oxygen) <em>vs.</em> different concentrations of CTM. The rate of respiration is displayed in basal conditions (▪), after ADP administration (•) or after dinitrophenol administration (▴). All reported results in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.</p>
