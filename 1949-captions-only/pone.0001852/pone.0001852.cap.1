                Figure 1.  Effects of clotrimazole on cells and mitochondria.(A) HK II detachment from mitochondria following a 1 hour treatment with clotrimazole (CTM, 20 µM) was assessed by Western immunoblot on a mitochondrial fraction of HeLa cells. The blot was also probed with prohibitin as a mitochondrial marker and with actin as a cytosolic marker (negative, not shown), to check for fraction purity. (B) Output of multiparametric FACS analysis show apoptosis induction of HeLa cells exposed for 2 hours to several concentrations of CTM with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (DB, 8 µM). Healthy cells (H) are delimited by the quadrant. Apoptotic cells (A) display mitochondrial depolarization (reduced TMRM staining) and/or expose phosphatidylserine on their surface (increased Annexin V-FITC staining). Propidium iodide-positive, i.e. dead cells (D), were evaluated on a PI vs TMRM diagram (not shown); these cells were excluded from the reported plots and shown as histograms. Numbers are percentages. (C) PTP opening of digitonized HeLa cells measured with the Ca2+ retention capacity assay. Calcium Green-5N fluorescence is reported as arbitrary units on the y axis. As the probe does not permeate mitochondria, Ca2+ uptake into the organelles is displayed by a rapid decrease of the fluorescence spike. Pore inducers or inhibitors reduce or increase, respectively, the threshold Ca2+ concentration required to trigger the permeability transition, i.e. the number of spikes before a sudden and marked fluorescence increase occurs. Experiments were started by the addition of digitonized cells (not shown) followed by pulses of the indicated concentrations of Ca2+. Where indicated, CTM was added to cells 45 minutes before permeabilization with digitonin. Note that CTM reduced the rate of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. In the upper right plot DB was added before mitochondria to test the PTP-dependence of Ca2+ release. (D) Respiration assay performed on mitochondria isolated from mouse liver. The graph shows the rate of oxygen consumption (ng AtO stands for ngatoms of oxygen) vs. different concentrations of CTM. The rate of respiration is displayed in basal conditions (▪), after ADP administration (•) or after dinitrophenol administration (▴). All reported results in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.
