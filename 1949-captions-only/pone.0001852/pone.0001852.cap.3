                Figure 3.  CyP-D modulates apoptosis triggered by detachment of HK II from mitochondria.(A, B) Output of multiparametric FACS analyses show apoptosis induction in fibroblasts obtained either from wild-type mice (A) or from mice in which the Ppif gene encoding for CyP-D was ablated (B). Cells were exposed for 2 hours to the reported concentrations of TAT-HK with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (DB, 8 µM) or with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z.VAD-fmk, 50 µM). Diagrams and percentages of the different cell populations are indicated as in Fig. 1B. All reported measures in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.
