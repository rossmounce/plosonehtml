Cells were exposed for 2 hours to the reported concentrations of TAT-HK with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (DB, 8 µM) or with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z.VAD-fmk, 50 µM). Diagrams and percentages of the different cell populations are indicated as in <a href="#pone-0001852-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. All reported measures in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.</p>
