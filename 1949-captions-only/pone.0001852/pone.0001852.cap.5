Co-immunoprecipitation of CyP-D in wild-type mouse fibroblasts is shown either in control conditions or after a 1 hour treatment with TAT-HK. (B) Output of multiparametric FACS analyses show apoptosis induction in fibroblasts obtained either from wild-type mice (upper row) or from CyP-D knock-out animals (lower row). Cells were exposed for 2 hours to the stated concentrations of TAT-HK with or without a 3 hour pre-incubation with bongkrekate (BK, 100 ÂµM). Diagrams and percentages of the different cell populations are indicated as in <a href="#pone-0001852-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. All reported measures in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.</p>
