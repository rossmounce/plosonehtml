                Figure 5.  ANT modulates apoptosis triggered by detachment of HK II from mitochondria.(A) Western blot of ANT immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation of CyP-D in wild-type mouse fibroblasts is shown either in control conditions or after a 1 hour treatment with TAT-HK. (B) Output of multiparametric FACS analyses show apoptosis induction in fibroblasts obtained either from wild-type mice (upper row) or from CyP-D knock-out animals (lower row). Cells were exposed for 2 hours to the stated concentrations of TAT-HK with or without a 3 hour pre-incubation with bongkrekate (BK, 100 ÂµM). Diagrams and percentages of the different cell populations are indicated as in Fig. 1B. All reported measures in the Figure are representative of at least four experiments.
