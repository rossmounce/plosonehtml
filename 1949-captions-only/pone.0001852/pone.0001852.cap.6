Western immunoblot shows GSK3β inhibition (<em>i.e.</em> Ser9 phosphorylation) by insulin. (B) HK II and VDAC expression in MEF obtained from either wild-type or VDAC 1/3 knock-out mice were assessed by Western immunoblot. VDAC expression was checked with an anti-VDAC1antibody, protein loading with an anti-actin antibody. (C) Immunoprecipitation of HK II and rehybridization with an anti VDAC2 in VDAC1/3 knock-out MEFs. (D) Output of multiparametric FACS analyses show apoptosis induction in VDAC1/3 knock-out MEFs. Cells were exposed for 1 hour to the stated concentrations of TAT-HK with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (DB, 8 µM), bongkrekate (BK, 100 µM) or Z.VAD-fmk (50 µM). Diagrams and percentages of the different cell populations are indicated as in <a href="#pone-0001852-g001">Fig. 1B</a>. (E) Mitochondrial depolarization after cell treatment with TAT-HK (10 µM) with or without pre-incubation with Debio 025 (8 µM), as assessed by decreased TMRM staining by epifluorescence microscopy. All reported measurements are representative of at least four experiments.</p>
