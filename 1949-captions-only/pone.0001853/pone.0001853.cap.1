                Figure 1.  Discrepancy and error rate depending on haplotype frequency:A) Discrepancy (from simulations) and error rate (analytically derived), B) ambiguity fraction and correlation coefficient r (Abstract type a scenarios: two loci varying frequency f1 of haplotype h1 = 00 with f3  = 0.1 and f4  = 0.05 for h3 = 01 and h4 = 11).
