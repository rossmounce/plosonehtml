                Figure 5.  Haplotype-specific error measures:Star plots for the CAPN10 displaying the R2, the sensitivity or the specificity as in Figure 4. The angle between lines is given by 360Â° divided by the number of frequent haplotypes (frequency 3 1%) to accommodate for the large number of loci (L = 7).
