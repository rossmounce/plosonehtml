Most ribosomal protein genes were present in all tissues examined and thus can be called housekeeping genes. Exceptions were <em>Rpl39l</em> and <em>Rpl3l</em>. (B) Variance of expression levels within replicates of tissues, representing biological variation between animals and technical error on measurements (triangles) compared to variance of expression between tissues (circles). Variance within replicated measurements was significantly smaller than variance of expression between different conditions (Wilcoxon's rank sum statistic: p&lt;0.0001).</p>
