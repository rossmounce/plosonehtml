                Figure 3.  Multidimensional unfolding analysis of mRNA expression signals encoding 81 ribosomal proteins (purple symbols) versus 69 mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits (blue symbols).This analysis gives a graphical overview based on expression profiles; genes with a high expression in a certain tissue will be represented close to that tissue. Note that both groups of transcripts formed separate clusters. These clusters indicated high co-expression of ribosomal protein mRNA's in tissues that are active in exocrine protein secretion and/or cell division. Respiratory chain mRNA's were also co-expressed but were particularly high in striated muscle. Arrowheads indicate 2 ribosomal protein genes outside of the cluster. The upper arrowhead is Rpl3l, which clustered closely to the contractile tissues. The lower arrowhead is Rpl39l, located close to testis.
