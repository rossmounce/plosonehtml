Note that both groups of transcripts formed separate clusters. These clusters indicated high co-expression of ribosomal protein mRNA's in tissues that are active in exocrine protein secretion and/or cell division. Respiratory chain mRNA's were also co-expressed but were particularly high in striated muscle. Arrowheads indicate 2 ribosomal protein genes outside of the cluster. The upper arrowhead is <em>Rpl3l</em>, which clustered closely to the contractile tissues. The lower arrowhead is <em>Rpl39l</em>, located close to testis.</p>
