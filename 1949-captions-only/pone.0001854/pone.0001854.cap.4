Note that tissues where <em>Rpl3l</em> was expressed (heart, diaphragm and muscle) had the lowest expression of <em>Rpl3</em>. (B) Schematic of Affymetrix probeset binding sites on the <em>Rpl9</em> transcript. Probeset 1443843_x_at (blue) binds most 3â€² and probeset 1416420_a_at (red) binds more upstream. (C) Expression levels of <em>Rpl9</em> as detected by each of the probesets shown above. Both probesets yield similar signals, except in one tissue: seminal vesicles. This indicates that in seminal vesicles, an <em>Rpl9</em> transcript variant exists.</p>
