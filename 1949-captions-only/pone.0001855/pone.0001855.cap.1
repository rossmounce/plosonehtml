                Figure 1.  Transcriptional characteristics of placental isolates.Plots of log2 ratio of expression (M) against average log intensity (A) for three different pools of placental isolates (pool 1 included 3 isolates: ≤5% rings, 70% trophozoites, ≥25% schizonts; pool 2 with 7 isolates: ≤5% rings, ≥25% trophozoites, 70% schizonts; pool 3 with 8 isolates: ≤5% rings, 0% trophozoites, ≥95% schizonts) versus common 3D7 reference (10% rings, 45% trophozoites, 45% schizonts). Only statistically significant data according to Bonferroni p value correction are shown. A single dominant var gene (var2csa) is detected in placental isolates of all groups examined (red dots; each dot represents one oligonucleotide). Non var genes over-expressed or under-expressed are shown as black (when the difference was present in all 3 pools), green (in 2 of the 3 pools). Blue dots correspond to oligonucleotides corresponding to genes only differentially expressed in 1 out of 3 experiments (these were not taken into account in our analysis).
