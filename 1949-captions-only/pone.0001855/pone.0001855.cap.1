Only statistically significant data according to Bonferroni p value correction are shown. A single dominant <em>var</em> gene (<em>var2csa</em>) is detected in placental isolates of all groups examined (red dots; each dot represents one oligonucleotide). Non <em>var</em> genes over-expressed or under-expressed are shown as black (when the difference was present in all 3 pools), green (in 2 of the 3 pools). Blue dots correspond to oligonucleotides corresponding to genes only differentially expressed in 1 out of 3 experiments (these were not taken into account in our analysis).</p>
