                Figure 2.  Association plot between gene expression and, (A) chromosome location, (B) predicted host cell export.Bar width indicates the number of genes within each category while bar high indicates deviations from an independent model showing categories contributing to the disequilibrium. Result of chi2 test is indicated above the legend. *Multi-copy gene families such as var, rif, stevor and Pfmc-2TM were excluded from the data used to calculate the bias.
