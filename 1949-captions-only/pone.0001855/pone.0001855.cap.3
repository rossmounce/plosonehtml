Shown are transcription levels for 22 parasites isolated from the placenta of women (PW), 9 parasites from asymptomatic children (C) (mean age 10 years) and 4 parasites from symptomatic non-pregnant women (NPW) living in the same area, as well as by (in the right side of each panel) the <em>in vitro</em> cultured <em>P. falciparum</em> strains 3D7 (black dots), FCR3 (red dots), and NF54 (blue dots). Each of these 3 strains were used either non-selected or after selection for CSA binding using panning on soluble CSA (3D7), Bewo cells (FCR3), or VAR2CSA IgGs (NF54). Hb3 (yellow dots) was also studied after selection on Bewo cells. These parasite lines were highly synchronized and aged 24 hours post invasion Missing points correspond to lack of detection of the corresponding gene (in particular for PFI1785w in FCR3). Horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences between groups. On top, (+) indicates over-expressed in PAM parasites according to array data; (âˆ’) indicates under-expressed in PAM parasites according to array data.</p>
