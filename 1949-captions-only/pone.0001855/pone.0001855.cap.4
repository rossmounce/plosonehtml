Primers indicated on (A) by arrows were used to amplify full size and a short fragment of the gene on 3D7 genomic DNA (lane 2 and 5), and on cDNA of 3D7 (lane 3 and 6) and a placental isolate (lane 4 and 7). Lane 1 indicates a 100 bp DNA lader. (B) Diagram of exon/intron structures from predicted gene and mRNA/cDNA. The heavy bars are predicted exons. Empty and stripped bars are predicted intron 1 and intron 2 respectively according to 3D7 gDNA sequence. Figures below the gDNA structure indicate nucleotide positions. mRNA/cDNA structure is the experimentally observed structure.</p>
