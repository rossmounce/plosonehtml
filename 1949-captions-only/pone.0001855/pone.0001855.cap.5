The levels of IgG expressed as OD values are shown for exposed Ghanaian men (n = 30; white bars) and women (n = 30; grey bars). The top, bottom, and line through the middle of the box correspond to the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, 25<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 50<sup>th</sup> percentile (median), respectively. The whiskers on the bottom extend from the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile and top 90<sup>th</sup> percentile. Plasma concentrations of anti-VAR2CSA and anti-NP561 IgG were significantly higher in the women group.</p>
