                Figure 5.  Recognition of PFI1785w recombinant protein (NP561) by sera from malaria exposed individuals assessed by ELISA.ELISA was carried out on NP561, DBL5-Îµ of VAR2CSA and GLURP coated plates. The levels of IgG expressed as OD values are shown for exposed Ghanaian men (n = 30; white bars) and women (n = 30; grey bars). The top, bottom, and line through the middle of the box correspond to the 75th percentile, 25th percentile, and 50th percentile (median), respectively. The whiskers on the bottom extend from the 10th percentile and top 90th percentile. Plasma concentrations of anti-VAR2CSA and anti-NP561 IgG were significantly higher in the women group.
