(B) The result of a β III tubulin antibody immunostaining in NPCs exposure to myelin preparation for 8 days. The proportion of positive cells was 32.35±1.91% and 30.95±4.32% in 1.0 ug/ml and 5.0 ug/ml soluble myelin treatment respectively, significantly lower than 45.38±5.31% in 5.0 ug/ml BSA control (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05).(C) The result of GFAP antibody immunostaining in NPCs exposure to myelin preparation for 8 days. The proportion of GFAP positive cells was 28.19±1.1.78% and 29.83±2.16% in 1.0 ug/ml and 5.0 ug/ml soluble myelin treatment respectively, significantly higher than 22.53±1.85% in 5.0 ug/ml BSA control (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01).(D, E) Purified MBP did not affect the neural differentiation of NPCs.</p>
