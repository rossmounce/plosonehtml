                Figure 3.  Astroglial induction of NPCs by Nogo-66 for 8 days.(A) Images of immunocytochemistry. (B) In western blot analysis, both NeuN and β III tubulin expressions were decreased and GFAP was upregulated in NPCs induced by Nogo-66. (C, D) The quantitative results of anti-NueN, and β III tubulin antibodies immunocytocheminstry. Nogo-66 significantly inhibited neuronal differentiation in NPCs in dose-dependent manner. (E, F) The quantitative results of anti-GFAP and S-100βantibodies immunocytocheminstry. Nogo-66 significantly induced NPCs differentiation into astroglial cells in dose-dependent manner. (G) Apoptosis assay with Annexin V-Fitc and PI staining by FACS. Nogo-66 did not induce significantly apoptosis compared to GST at day 2, 5, and 8. Data are mean±S.E. Error bars indicate SE. *p&lt;0.05 **p&lt;0.01(n = 3). Bar scale = 100 um.
