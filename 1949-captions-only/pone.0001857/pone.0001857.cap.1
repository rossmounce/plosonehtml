Peak intensities are scaled relative to the highest peak in each chromatogram. Absolute intensities are indicated to the right of the ordinate axis. A <sup>D3</sup>33-mer peptide reference exhibits the same retention time and ion transitions as the peptide detected in the 180 min plasma sample.</p>
