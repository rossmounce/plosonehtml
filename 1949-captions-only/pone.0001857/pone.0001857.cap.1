                Figure 1.  Detection of an oral gluten peptide in the peripheral plasma of gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque FH09 during remission.Plasma samples collected at indicated timepoints following intragastric administration of D333-mer to FH09 (in remission) were analyzed by 3Q LC-MS/MS, monitoring for the m/z 979.54+â†’263.4+ transition in the positive ion SRM mode. Peak intensities are scaled relative to the highest peak in each chromatogram. Absolute intensities are indicated to the right of the ordinate axis. A D333-mer peptide reference exhibits the same retention time and ion transitions as the peptide detected in the 180 min plasma sample.
