                Figure 3.  Oral enzyme therapy prevents clinical relapse but increases plasma AGA and anti-TG2 IgG in gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque FH45.Gluten-sensitive FH45 (A-C) and control FI96 (D-F) were switched from a gluten-containing to a gluten-free diet at week 0, re-challenged with the gluten-containing diet from week 10.4 to 11.4, and then returned to a gluten-free diet for the remainder of the experiment. During week 22.9-30.9, the gluten-free diet was supplemented with a daily slice of wheat bread. FH45 additionally received a daily dose of EP-B2 glutenase during the first half of this period (week 22.9-26.9). Clinical scores (A,D), anti-gliadin antibodies (B,E), and anti-TG2 antibodies (C,F) were monitored over the course of the experiment. Levels of IgG (blue; open circles) and IgA (red; open squares) antibodies are provided on the left and right ordinates, respectively. Clinical score criteria are described in Methods.
