                Figure 3.  Phylogenetic relationships of Djarthia murgonensis.A, strict consensus of 2 most parsimonious trees (tree length = 886; consistency index (CI) excluding uninformative characters = 0.357; retention index (RI) = 0.646) from analysis of a 242 morphological character matrix [8]. Position of Djarthia highlighted in red. Australidelphia is indicated. Numbers above branches represent bootstrap values (2000 replicates); numbers below branches represent Bremer support values. B, Bayesian 50% majority rule consensus from analysis of the morphological matrix in combination with a 20.1 kb molecular data set [10]. Position of Djarthia highlighted in red. Australidelphia is indicated. Numbers at nodes represent Bayesian posterior probabilities.
