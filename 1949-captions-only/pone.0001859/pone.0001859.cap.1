                Figure 1.  Analysis of gene expression profiles in response to different signals.(A) Venn diagrams of gene sets regulated by E2/GFs/cAMP. Top and bottom panels: genes regulated by at least 2-fold (total of 220 genes) and 1.5-fold (922 genes), respectively. (B) Hierarchical clustering analysis with Eisen tree of 2-fold gene set. (C) Clustering analysis using the gene sets defined separately by a 1.5-fold cut-off for each treatment. Green and red colour bars represent repression and induction, respectively, compared to control (untreated). Black bars indicate no change.
