                Figure 2.  Verification of microarray data by Q-PCR.Top panel: dendrogram of fold expression ratios from the microarray data of the genes DNM3, BCL3, RGS16, TFF1 (pS2), RAP1GAP, EPHB3 and CCNG2. Yellow and cyan indicate induction and repression, respectively. Bottom panel: Q-PCR results for three conditions (E2, GFs and cAMP). Log-scale graph of the fold expression values calculated with the ΔΔCt method using DNM3 as internal control. Values shown are the means of triplicate samples ± standard deviation.
