                Figure 3.  Ligand-independent ERÎ±-mediated gene expression profiles.(A) Log expression ratios of the ICI-affected GF-regulated (65 genes) and cAMP regulated (28 genes) gene sets at the top and bottom, respectively. (B) Hierarchical cluster analysis with Eisen tree of gene sets shown in panel A. Interesting clusters are numbered on the right. Asterisks denote genes with unique response that are discussed in the text. Colour code as in Figure 1.
