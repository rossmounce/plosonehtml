Gene set includes 20 genes that also respond in the same manner to OHT alone (marked with dotted lines). Some sets of genes with interesting behaviors are marked with solid lines and listed. (B) Venn diagrams illustrating overlap between gene sets obtained with OHT alone or in combination with cAMP or GFs. (C) Selected patterns of genes most strongly affected by the agonistic activity of OHT. Arrows mark rows of most relevant pairwise comparisons.</p>
