                Figure 6.  A Hox protein mediates cAMP-induced agonistic switch of OHT for MCF7 proliferation.(A) MCF7 proliferation assay. Equal numbers of cells (2×105) were seeded onto plates and then treated over a period of 6 days with vehicle control (0.1% ethanol), 10 nM E2, 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP), 1 µM OHT or combinations thereof. (B) Venn diagram showing overlap between the cAMP-regulated/ERα-dependent genes and genes OHT-regulated by cAMP (corrected for E2 and OHT behavior as described in the text). The overlapping 14 genes include the 11 genes used in the promoter analysis of Figure 5 (ARF4L, ARFIP1, CLPS, DPP6, GRIA3, KLK1, NDUFB2, P2RY13, RAFTLIN, RAG2, UBCE7IP5) and the unannotated transcripts/genes KIAA0406, KIAA0556 and Hs.541338 (see Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4). (C) Effect of dominant-negative transcription factor mutants on proliferation of MCF7 cells. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for dnPax5, dnCREB or dnHox, or empty expression vector (control). Data in panels A and C are representative of two independent experiments.
