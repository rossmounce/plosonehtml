Filled circles denote the initial points and triangles represent the endpoints of the tool head. A: Representative trajectory of the tool head before extensive training. Right: A photograph of the top view. Left: Trajectory drawn from multiple video frames. The degu waved the tool for a while around the reward but failed to obtain the reinforcement in this trial. B: Representative examples of trajectories (a) and corresponding velocity profiles (b) of the tool head chosen from an early-middle phase of training (middle 1; red line), a late-middle phase (middle 2; broken green line), and a late phase (dotted blue line) during Level 2a training in one degu. In B-a, time zero indicates the time when the degu changed the angle of the rake upon approaching the reward. In the early-middle phase, the velocity of the tool was generally slow and became particularly slow at around time zero, presumably because the degu took time to adjust the angle of the tool relative to the food. In the late-middle phase, the velocity peaked at âˆ’0.4 s and 0.6 s and decreased after the degu changed the angle of the tool at time zero. In the late phase, the velocity peak of the tool came at around time zero.
