                Figure 4.  Varieties of rake (left photographs) used in the probe tests (summary of results in table 1) to examine conceptual understandings of tool use.A) Reversed contingency test (see also Movie S9 for the behavior). The same tool as used in training was used in this test. B) Generalization test (Movie S10). New tools are shown on the left and right; performance on these new tools was tested in ten trials each on four animals in random order. C) Functionality test 1 (Movie S11). The normal tool is on the left and a nonfunctional tool without a blade is shown on the right. D) Functionality test 2 (Movie S12). Another nonfunctional tool, which has a raised blade, is shown on the right. E) Preference test (Movie S13). A functional but unusual-looking tool is shown on the right. The animals did not hesitate to use this tool. In test A, the same tool as that in training was used.
