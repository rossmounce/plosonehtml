The same tool as used in training was used in this test. B) Generalization test (<a href="#pone.0001860.s010">Movie S10</a>). New tools are shown on the left and right; performance on these new tools was tested in ten trials each on four animals in random order. C) Functionality test 1 (<a href="#pone.0001860.s011">Movie S11</a>). The normal tool is on the left and a nonfunctional tool without a blade is shown on the right. D) Functionality test 2 (<a href="#pone.0001860.s012">Movie S12</a>). Another nonfunctional tool, which has a raised blade, is shown on the right. E) Preference test (<a href="#pone.0001860.s013">Movie S13</a>). A functional but unusual-looking tool is shown on the right. The animals did not hesitate to use this tool. In test A, the same tool as that in training was used.</p>
