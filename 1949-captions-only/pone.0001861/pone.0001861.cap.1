                Figure 1.  Dihydroisoxazole inhibitors do not inhibit TG2 in intact cells.(A) Chemical structures of the 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroisoxazole inhibitors used in these studies [18], [19]. In some experiments described herein, the stereoisomers of compound 2A (compounds 2B and 2C) at the C-5 carbon of the dihydroisoxazole ring (see arrow) were used. The (S)-isomer (compound 2B) irreversibly inhibits recombinant human TG2 while the (R)-isomer (compound 2C) does not [19]. (B) WI-38 fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with or without 100 µM inhibitor 1 for 1 hour. Cells were washed with PBS and detached from the culture plate using 10 mM EDTA in PBS for MDA-MB-231 cells or using trypsin-EDTA in PBS for WI-38 cells. After lysing the cells via sonication, the lysate was split into four equal aliquots and incubated with □ 1% DMSO, ▪ 1% DMSO+100 µM 1, ▪ 1% DMSO+5 mM CaCl2, or ——□ 1% DMSO+100 µM 1+5 mM CaCl2 for 30 minutes at room temperature. TG2-catalyzed putrescine incorporation into dimethyl casein in a calcium-rich reaction buffer was then used to quantify the amount of ex vivo TG2 activity in each fraction. Activities were normalized by total protein concentrations.
