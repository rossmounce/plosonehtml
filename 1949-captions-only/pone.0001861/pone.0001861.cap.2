Small intestinal tissue was flushed with PBS before freezing on dry ice. Liver: Mice were IP injected with vehicle, 20 mg/kg 2A, or 200 mg/kg 2A and sacrificed 1 hour post-injection. TG2 activity in the tissue lysates was determined using the putrescine incorporation assay. (Average of two mice. P&gt;0.1 for all doses except 60 mg/kg 3) (B) <em>Ex vivo</em> TG2 activity (orange) was measured using 5-BP in tissue sections from the small intestine of rats perfused with vehicle or 2.4 mM 2A. Tissue autofluorescence using the 488 nm laser was collected to help orient and visualize the villous structure of the intestine. (400×) (C) Staining of rat small intestinal tissue for fibronectin (green), TG2 (yellow), and <em>ex vivo</em> TG2 activity (red) revealed nearly perfect overlap of all three stains. (400×)</p>
