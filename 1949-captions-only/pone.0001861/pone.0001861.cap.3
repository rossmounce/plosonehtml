WI-38 nuclei were visualized with propidium iodide (PI) to illustrate the relative size of a typical scratch compared to an individual cell. No significant TG2 activity was detected in unscratched regions of the WI-38 monolayer. (B) TG2 is enzymatically inactivated within 12 hours of WI-38 wounding despite the persistence of anti-TG2 protein staining. WI-38 monolayers were scratched 48, 12, and 0 hours before adding 5-BP to test for TG2 activity (red). The cells were co-stained for fibronectin (green) and TG2 (blue). (100×) (C) Triple staining of scratched WI-38 monolayers for fibronectin (green), TG2 (blue), and TG2 activity (red) revealed nearly perfect overlap between TG2 and TG2 activity (purple) but only partial overlap with fibronectin (white). This partial overlap of TG2 protein (blue) and fibronectin (green) was not observed 12 hours after wounding. (400×) (D) Addition of exogenous recombinant human TG2 to the monolayers resulted in TG2 deposition onto the WI-38 assembled fibronectin matrix (colocalization in yellow). (E) TG2 inhibitor 2B was able to block <em>in situ</em> TG2 activity, whereas the control compound 2C could not block activity.</p>
