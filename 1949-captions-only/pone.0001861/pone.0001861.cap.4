Mice were then injected with either 100 mg/kg 5-BP or PBS after 0 hours and 3 hours then sacrificed at 6 hours (labeled “6 hours”) or injected after 6 hours and 9 hours then sacrificed at 11 hours (labeled “11 hours”). One mouse became sick and needed to be sacrificed after 9.5 hours (labeled “9.5 hours”). (A) H&amp;E staining of small intestinal tissues revealed obvious villous atrophy at both the 6 hour and 11 hour time-points following poly(I:C) injection. (B) Small intestinal tissue lysates were Western blotted using HRP-conjugated streptavidin to detect 5-BP labeled proteins. All mice receiving the combination of poly(I:C) and 5-BP showed extensive protein labeling while all controls showed background labeling. (C) Immunofluorescent staining of OCT intestinal tissue sections with fluorescent streptavidin revealed the localization of 5-BP labeled proteins in the poly(I:C)/5-BP mice but showed no labeling in any of the control tissues. (D) Fluorescent streptavidin staining of intestinal tissue from poly(I:C)/5-BP treated mice showed co-localization with anti-TG2 antibody staining suggesting that the 5-BP labeling was due to TG2 activity.</p>
