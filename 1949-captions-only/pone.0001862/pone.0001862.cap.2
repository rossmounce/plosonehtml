                Figure 2.  Microbial diversity in air and other local environmental samples.A. Rarefaction curves of observed phylotype diversity for Air-1 (pink line), Air-2 (dark blue), water (green), Soil-1 (purple), and Soil-2 (red). The similarity threshold is 97%. Inset: the estimated diversity in the 5 samples using the Chao1 richness estimator. B. Distribution of microbial divisions in each of the environmental samples; circles represent, from the inside out, Air-1, Air-2, Water, Soil-1, and Soil-2. C. Bacterial orders within the Proteobacteria for each sample. D. A Venn diagram of all phylotypes observed in the air and dust samples from location 2.
