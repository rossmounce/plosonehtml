                Figure 3.  COG analysis.Predicted ORFs from the two air samples in this study and the other 3 environmental samples from previous studies were mapped to orthologous groups and broad functional categories according to the COG and STRING databases. Only functions that are more common in air than in other environments are depicted: N, Cell motility and secretion; U, Intracellular trafficking and vesicular transport; P, Inorganic ion transport and metabolism; K, Transcription; L, DNA replication, recombination and repair; G, Carbohydrate transport and metabolism; and O, Posttranslational modification.
