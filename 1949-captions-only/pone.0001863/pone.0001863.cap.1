                Figure 1.  An example of development of a 4 cell agent.A) The development process begins with a chromosome. B) The chromosome is translated into a gene-protein network expressed in a zygote. C) The gene-protein network triggers mitosis events, producing 4 different cells. The network is the same in all cells, but the concentrations are different. D) The cells migrate and differentiate into a neuron, motor cell, and two sensory cells. E) Neurite sprouting events occur. Some proteins are marked by ktype as ones that cannot diffuse from neurite to soma. Therefore, their instances are separated in the neurites, with the same connectivity. F) After the axon is guided by external protein concentrations, target selection events occur, causing the axons to synapse. A synapse is formed, allowing proteins marked ktype as synapse-diffusible to move from one cell to another.
