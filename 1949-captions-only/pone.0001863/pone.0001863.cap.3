                Figure 3.  Static estimation of the mutual information between the agent's neural representation and the environment.The agent (arrowed) is moved between the center of s1 and s2 in a random order while its neural activity is recorded. The agent is pinned to the center of s1 and s2 and cannot move freely. s1 and s2 are two different environments containing agents of the same sex (grey) or opposite sex (white) at random locations.
