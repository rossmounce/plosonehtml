                Figure 4.  Best estimated mutual information with static environment values of randomly selected agents during evolution.A) The rate based measure  has higher values than the other measures, but no significant correlation was observed with generation (P =  0.7087, r =  2×10−2). B) Measure based on cross correlation combined with lag . C) Measure based on cross correlation alone . D) Measure based on lag alone . All values are based on Spearman's Rank Correlation Test made on 340 randomly chosen agents from the same evolutionary session. Please note the different axis in A.
