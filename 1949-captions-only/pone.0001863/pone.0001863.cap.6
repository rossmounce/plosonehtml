                Figure 6.  Best estimated mutual information with dynamic environment values of randomly selected agents during evolution.A) The rate based measure  has higher values than the other measures, with a significant correlation . B) Measure based on cross correlation combined with lag . C) Measure based on cross correlation alone . D) Measure based on lag alone . All values are based on Spearman's Rank Correlation Test made on randomly chosen agents from the same evolutionary session. Since the cross correlation based measures  reached a plateau earlier than the others, their statistical tests were based on the first 2700 generations whereas the other tests were based on the entire evolutionary session. Please note the different axis in A and B.
