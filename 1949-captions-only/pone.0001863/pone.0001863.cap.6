All values are based on Spearman's Rank Correlation Test made on randomly chosen agents from the same evolutionary session. Since the cross correlation based measures <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001863.e053&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span> reached a plateau earlier than the others, their statistical tests were based on the first 2700 generations whereas the other tests were based on the entire evolutionary session. Please note the different axis in A and B.</p>
