(B) Western blot analysis of p16 and loading control β-Actin levels in young (Y, pdl 20) and senescent (S, pdl 54) WI-38 HDFs. (C) The polysomal association of mRNAs encoding p16 (<em>left</em>) or GAPDH (<em>right</em>) in Y and S WI-38 cells was tested by fractionating cytoplasmic lysates through sucrose gradients and measuring mRNA abundance by RT-qPCR in each of the 10 resulting fractions (<em>insets</em>). The relative abundance of p16 and GAPDH mRNAs in each gradient fraction is shown as a percent of the total mRNA. <em>NB/NT</em> (‘not bound/not translated’) fractions with mRNA devoid of translational components; <em>LMW</em>, <em>HMW</em>, low and high molecular weight polysome fractions, respectively.</p>
