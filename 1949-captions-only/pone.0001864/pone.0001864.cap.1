                Figure 1.  p16 levels increase with replicative senescence.(A) The levels of mRNAs encoding cyclin D1, p16, and control housekeeping GAPDH were measured by RT-qPCR, normalized to 18S rRNA levels and plotted as fold levels relative to the levels in pdl 20 HDFs. (B) Western blot analysis of p16 and loading control β-Actin levels in young (Y, pdl 20) and senescent (S, pdl 54) WI-38 HDFs. (C) The polysomal association of mRNAs encoding p16 (left) or GAPDH (right) in Y and S WI-38 cells was tested by fractionating cytoplasmic lysates through sucrose gradients and measuring mRNA abundance by RT-qPCR in each of the 10 resulting fractions (insets). The relative abundance of p16 and GAPDH mRNAs in each gradient fraction is shown as a percent of the total mRNA. NB/NT (‘not bound/not translated’) fractions with mRNA devoid of translational components; LMW, HMW, low and high molecular weight polysome fractions, respectively.
