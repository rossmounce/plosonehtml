                Figure 2.  Microarray analysis of miRNAs showing reduced expression with senescence.(A) Three independent preparations of total RNA from early-passage (Young, pdl 25) and from late-passage (Senescent, pdl 54) WI-38 cells were subjected to microarray analysis (Exiqon, Materials and Methods). Thirty-one miRNAs showed reduced levels in the senescent cultures (by two-fold in at least two samples), 9 miRNAs showed increased levels (Supplemental Fig. S2). (B) The differential expression of ten downregulated miRNAs was validated using RT-qPCR analysis; the relative levels of each miRNA in Y and S WI-38 cells are shown (means+SEM from three independent experiments).
