                Figure 3.  miR-24 levels decrease with replicative senescence.(A) Top, p16 mRNA depicting the two locations (in CR and 3′UTR) where miR-24 is predicted to bind. Bottom left, miR-24 levels were measured in WI-38 cells by RT-qPCR using miR-24-specific primers, and normalized to 5S rRNA levels. Bottom right, PCR-amplified products (~100-bp), visualized on 1.5% agarose gels, were absent from RT- reactions; MWM, DNA molecular weight markers. (B) Young (pdl 20) or Senescent (pdl 54) WI-38 cells were left utnreated (Untr.) or treated with puromycin (Puro., 200 µM, 1 hr) and cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and fractionated through sucrose gradients. The presence of miR-24 was measured in each fraction, calculated as a percentage of the total miR-24, and plotted using a semilogarithmic scale. The data are representative of 3 independent experiments. (C) The relative abundance (fold) of miR-24 in each fraction was compared between Y and S cells. In fractions 1–5 (black bars), miR-24 was comparable or more abundant in S than in Y cells; in fractions 6–10 (gray bars), miR-24 was more abundant in Y than in S cells. All bars represent the means+SD from 3 independent experiments.
