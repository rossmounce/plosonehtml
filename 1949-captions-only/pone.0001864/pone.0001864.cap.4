                Figure 4.  Modulation of miR-24 alters p16 levels in WI-38 HDFs.Late-passage WI-38 cells (pdl 51) were transfected with pre-miR-24 or Ctrl. siRNA (100 nM) and 48 hr later (A) RT-qPCR was used to measure the levels of p16 mRNA (normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels, left) and the levels of miR-24 (normalized to 18S rRNA levels, right), and (B) the levels of p16 and loading control α-Tubulin were monitored by Western blotting, and quantified (%) by densitometry. Early-passage (pdl 20) WI-38 cells were transfected with AS-miR-24 or Ctrl. siRNA (100 nM) and 48 hr later (C) RT-qPCR was used to measure the levels of p16 mRNA (normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels, left) and the levels of miR-24 (normalized to 18S rRNA levels, right), and (D) p16 and loading control α-Tubulin levels were assessed by Western blotting, and quantified by densitometry. (E) p16 mRNA levels in sucrose gradients were calculated as described for Fig. 1C. (A) and (C) show the means+SD from 3 independent experiments.
