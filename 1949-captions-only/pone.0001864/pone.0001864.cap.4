Early-passage (pdl 20) WI-38 cells were transfected with AS-miR-24 or Ctrl. siRNA (100 nM) and 48 hr later (C) RT-qPCR was used to measure the levels of p16 mRNA (normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels, <em>left</em>) and the levels of miR-24 (normalized to 18S rRNA levels, <em>right</em>), and (D) p16 and loading control α-Tubulin levels were assessed by Western blotting, and quantified by densitometry. (E) p16 mRNA levels in sucrose gradients were calculated as described for <a href="#pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1C</a>. (A) and (C) show the means+SD from 3 independent experiments.</p>
