                Figure 5.  miR-24 associates with p16 mRNA and with actively translating polysomes in HeLa cells.(A) Cells were left untreated (Untr.) or treated with puromycin (Puro., 200 ÂµM, 1 hr); cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and fractionated through sucrose gradients. Top, representative miR-24 levels in each fraction, visualized after RT-PCR (30 cycles) and electrophoresis (1.5% agarose). Bottom, miR-24 levels in each fraction, quantified by RT-qPCR analysis and represented as % of the total miR-24 (semilogarithmic scale). (B) Representative gradient profiles. (C) By 48 hr after transfection of pre-miR-24 or control (Ctrl.) siRNA (100 nM), miR-24 and U6 snRNA levels were visualized on agarose gels (left), quantified by RT-qPCR, and normalized to 5S (right). Data (means+SD) represent the fold differences in miR-24 levels between the transfection groups. (D) HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing either pTRESNeo (V) or pIRESNeo-HA-Ago1 (HA-Ago1); the specific IP of HA-Ago1 was assessed by Western blot analysis of the IP reaction products. Forty-eight hr after transfection of HeLa cells with plasmid (V or HA-Ago1) and either control (siRNA) or pre-miR-24 RNA, RT-qPCR analysis was used to test the association of p16 mRNA with the RISC complex in the V and HA-Ago1 groups after HA IP. Graphs show the means+SD from 3 independent experiments.
