                Figure 7.  Lowering miR-24 increases p16 levels in HeLa cells.(A) Cells were transfected with either a control (Ctrl.) siRNA or antisense (AS) miR-24 (100 nM) and the levels of mRNAs encoding p16, and controls GAPDH (for normalization) and SDHA were calculated by RT-qPCR and represented as the means+SD from 3 independent experiments; the levels of miR-24 and U6 RNA were also measured. (B) Representative Western blot analysis of p16 (and loading control Î±-Tubulin) levels in each transfection group. p16 signals were measured by densitometry and represented as % p16 levels relative to the control transfection group. (C) The levels of miR-24 were measured by RT-qPCR in each of the fractions (Materials and Methods) and shown as relative miR-24 levels in the AS-miR-24 transfection group relative to the levels in the Ctrl. siRNA transfection group (left) and also as a percentage of the total miR-24 in each of the two transfection groups (right). Note that the abundance of miR-24 was preferentially reduced in fractions 1 and 2 (left), but the remaining miR-24 was found distributed among all of the fractions of the polysome gradient (right). Data are representative from three independent experiments yielding similar results. (D) The levels of p16 and control GAPDH mRNAs on polysome gradients were measured and represented as explained in the legend of Fig. 1C. (E) Nascent translation of p16 or (control) GAPDH was monitored following incubation of cells with L-[35S]methionine and L-[35S]cysteine for 15 min; after immunoprecipitation (IP) using either anti-p16 (left) or anti-GAPDH (right) antibodies along with control IgG, the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into newly synthesized p16 and GAPDH polypeptides was visualized after SDS-PAGE and quantified using a PhosphorImager; the % change in p16 nascent translation is shown.
