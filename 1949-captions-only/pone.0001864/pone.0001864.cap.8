By 48 hr after co-transfection of HeLa Tet-off cells with Ctrl. siRNA or AS-miR-24, along with the plasmids indicated, the levels of EGFP expressed from each reporter vector was assessed; shown are representative Western blotting signals and quantification (<em>Fold</em>, AS-miR-24 vs. Ctrl. siRNA) of EGFP reporter levels in each transfection group after normalization to Î±-tubulin signals.</p>
