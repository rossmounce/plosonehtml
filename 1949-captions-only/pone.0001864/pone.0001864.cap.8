                Figure 8.  Analysis of p16 predicted sites of miR-24 association using a heterologous reporter.Schematic (left) and names (center) of the EGFP and chimeric EGFP-p16 reporter plasmids tested (Materials and Methods). By 48 hr after co-transfection of HeLa Tet-off cells with Ctrl. siRNA or AS-miR-24, along with the plasmids indicated, the levels of EGFP expressed from each reporter vector was assessed; shown are representative Western blotting signals and quantification (Fold, AS-miR-24 vs. Ctrl. siRNA) of EGFP reporter levels in each transfection group after normalization to Î±-tubulin signals.
