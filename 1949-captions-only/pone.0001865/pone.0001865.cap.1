                Figure 1.  Association of Early-Onset Preeclampsia and HELLP Syndrome with Common Allelic Variants of TLR4 and NOD2 Related to Impaired Innate Inflammatory Responses to Endotoxin.Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for carrying either heterozygous or homozygous common functional allelic variants of TLR4 (D299G and T399I) and NOD2 (R702W, G908R and L1007fs) are presented as unadjusted values (closed symbols) and were adjusted for maternal age at first delivery and chronic hypertension (open symbols). Comparisons were made between women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and controls with a history of only uneventful pregnancies (A), between women with a history of early-onset HELLP syndrome and controls with a history of only uneventful pregnancies (B) and between women with a history of early-onset HELLP syndrome and women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia without HELLP syndrome (C).
