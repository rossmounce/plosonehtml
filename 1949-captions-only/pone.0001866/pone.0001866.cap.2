                Figure 2.  EWI-2wint is a cleavage product of EWI-2.CHO cells were (co)-transfected with pcDNA3.1/CD81 and pcDNA3.1/EWI-2FLAG (A and D), with pcDNA3.1/wint-FLAG (B and E), or with pcDNA3.1/CD81 and pcDNA3.1/EWI-2FLAGfur (C and F). EWI-2FLAGfur corresponds to EWI-2FLAG in which a furin cleavage site has been engineered. After cell surface biotinylation, cells were lysed with Bj/EDTA (A–C) or TX/EDTA (D–F) and proteins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated mAbs. Proteins were revealed by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Asterisks indicate additional cleavage products of EWI-2.
