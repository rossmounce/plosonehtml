EWI-2FLAG<sup>fur</sup> corresponds to EWI-2FLAG in which a furin cleavage site has been engineered. After cell surface biotinylation, cells were lysed with Bj/EDTA (A–C) or TX/EDTA (D–F) and proteins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated mAbs. Proteins were revealed by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Asterisks indicate additional cleavage products of EWI-2.</p>
