                Figure 4.  EWI-2wint expression in Huh-7 cells.After cell surface biotinylation, Huh-7 cells (A) stably expressing pcDNA3.1 (B), HAEWI-2FLAG (C) or EWI-2FLAGfur (D) were lysed with Bj/EDTA and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with indicated mAbs. Proteins were revealed by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The molecular weights of the prestained molecular ladder are indicated in KDa. The asterisk indicates an additional cleavage product of EWI-2. The band indicated by a light arrow likely corresponds to a dimer of CD81, and the band indicated by a full arrow to an unidentified EWI-2 associated protein.
