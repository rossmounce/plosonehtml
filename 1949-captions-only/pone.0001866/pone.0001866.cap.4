Proteins were revealed by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The molecular weights of the prestained molecular ladder are indicated in KDa. The asterisk indicates an additional cleavage product of EWI-2. The band indicated by a light arrow likely corresponds to a dimer of CD81, and the band indicated by a full arrow to an unidentified EWI-2 associated protein.</p>
