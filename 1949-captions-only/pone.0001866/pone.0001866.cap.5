The fields displayed in (A) contained similar numbers of cells. C, Infection levels were measured by quantification with NIH Image 1.62 of the intensities of HCV E2 bands. The results are presented as percentages of HCVcc infection relative to the infection of Huh-7/pcDNA3.1 cells. Infection levels of three independent experiments are reported as the mean with standard deviation bars. D, CD81 expression on the surfaces of cells expressing or not EWI-2wint. Cells were stained by using an anti-CD81 mAb (5A6) and secondary antibody conjugated with PE. Cont corresponds to Huh-7 cells that were stained only with the secondary antibody.</p>
