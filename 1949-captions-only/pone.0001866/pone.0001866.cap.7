In parallel, these cells were infected with HCVpp 1a, HCVpp 2a or VSVpp expressing firefly luciferase (F-Luc) (B), as described in <a href="#pone-0001866-g006">Figure 6</a>. At 2 days post-infection, cells were lysed and processed to measure the luciferase activity. The luciferase activities were normalized for protein concentration in each cell lysate. The results are presented as relative percentages to HCVcc (A) and HCVpp (B) infectivity on Huh-7 cells. HCVpp infections (B) were also normalized to VSVpp infections on Huh-7 cells. Results are reported as the meanÂ±S.D. of three independent experiments.</p>
