                Figure 7.  EWI-2wint inhibits the infection of both HCVcc and HCVpp.A, Cellular populations (pcDNA3.1, HAEWI-2FLAG and EWI-2FLAGfur POP) and individual cellular clones (EWI-2FLAGfur A1, A6, B14, C1) were infected with HCVcc expressing Renilla luciferase (R-Luc). In parallel, these cells were infected with HCVpp 1a, HCVpp 2a or VSVpp expressing firefly luciferase (F-Luc) (B), as described in Figure 6. At 2 days post-infection, cells were lysed and processed to measure the luciferase activity. The luciferase activities were normalized for protein concentration in each cell lysate. The results are presented as relative percentages to HCVcc (A) and HCVpp (B) infectivity on Huh-7 cells. HCVpp infections (B) were also normalized to VSVpp infections on Huh-7 cells. Results are reported as the meanÂ±S.D. of three independent experiments.
