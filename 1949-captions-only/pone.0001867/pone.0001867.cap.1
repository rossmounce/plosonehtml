                Figure 1.  aSyn forms dimers/oligomers in cells.A. Schematic of the constructs selected for the remainder of the study. B.–E. Confocal microscopy showing the specificity of the complementation reaction driven by aSyn-aSyn interactions (Scale bar, 50 µm). F. FACS analysis of parallel vs anti-parallel aSyn-aSyn interaction. G. aSyn-aSyn interactions were also monitored using a bioluminescent-protein PCA whereby non-bioluminescent halves of G. princeps luciferase were fused to aSyn molecules. Cotransfection (S1+S2) results in a more than 5-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to background single transfections (S1 or S2), indicative of at least dimer formation. H. Immunoblot of native PAGE of cells transfected with GN-link-aSyn (1), aSyn-GC (2), and GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC (3) showing smears which are indicative of a wide range of oligomeric species. I. Immunoblot of SDS-PAGE of the same cells as in G showing the levels of expression of GN-link-aSyn and aSynGC. Immunoblots were probed with an antibody against EGFP (Abcam, Cambridge, USA).
