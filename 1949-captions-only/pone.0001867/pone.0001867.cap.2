                Figure 2.  aSyn oligomers are stabilized by complementation and show increased cytotoxicity.A. The half lives of EGFP (1), aSyn-GC (2), GN-link-aSyn (3), and GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC (4) were monitored via immunoblotting of H4 cells transfected with the different constructs and treated with cycloheximide for the indicated period of time prior to cell harvesting. Immunoblots were probed with an antibody against EGFP (Abcam, Cambridge, USA).B. Toxicity assay of cells transfected with EGFP (1), WT aSyn (2), GN-link-aSyn (3), aSyn-GC (4), and GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC (5) showing that stabilization of aSyn oligomers leads to increased toxicity (*t-test, n = 3, p&lt;0.005).
