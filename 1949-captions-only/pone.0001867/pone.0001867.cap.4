H4 cells were transfected with WT or mutant combinations of GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC and analyzed via flow cytometry to quantify the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence signal was identical for WT and mutant aSyn. B. Immunoblots of native-PAGE showing oligomeric species formed by GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC (lane 1), WT aSyn (lanes 2 and 3), A53T (lane 4), A30P (lane 5), and E46K (lane 6) and the corresponding expression levels (SDS-PAGE). C. Subcellular distribution, analyzed by confocal microscopy, of WT and mutant aSyn oligomers in H4 cells showing cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (green). Hoescht staining highlight the nuclei in blue (Scale bar, 50 Âµm).</p>
