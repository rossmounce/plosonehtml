H4 cells were co-transfected with WT aSyn or GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC and either with an empty vector or with Hsp70. Cytotoxicity was reduced by Hsp70 (t-test, n = 3, p&lt;0.001). B. Confocal microscopy analysis showing that overexpression of Hsp70 reduces aSyn oligomerization (Scale bar, 50 Âµm). C. Quantification of the pixel intensity of the same cells as in B showing a statistically significant reduction in fluorescence in cells overexpressing Hsp70 (t-test, p&lt;0.0001). D. Immunoblot of a native PAGE of cells co-transfected with GN-link-aSyn+aSynGC and either an empty vector of with Hsp70 showing a strong reduction in high molecular weight oligomeric species by Hsp70. E. Immunoblot of an SDS-PAGE of the same samples as in E showing Hsp70 overexpression does not lead to decreased levels of GN-link-aSyn nor aSynGC. F. Quantification of the SDS-PAGE confirms that Hsp70 does not reduce the protein levels of GN-link-aSyn nor aSyn-GC.</p>
