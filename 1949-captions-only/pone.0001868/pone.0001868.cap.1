Monolayers were immunostained for SLK in combination with actin (A–C), paxillin (D–F), α-tubulin (G–I), or Rac1 (J–L). In addition to perinuclear staining, SLK was found to be recruited into membrane ruffles (arrowheads) at the leading edge with the other markers surveyed. SLK was not found in mature adhesion complexes as shown by the lack of co-localization between SLK and paxillin in these structures (arrows). All photomicrographs are shown at 400×. Scale bar 10μ.</p>
