(A) Western blot analysis of HA-KΔC expression. Cdc42 was used as a loading control. (B) Polycarbonate membranes were DAPI stained and cells on the underside were enumerated (C) in random fields and expressed as the average/field from triplicate wells. (D) MEF 3T3 cells were transfected with SLK siRNAs and analysed for SLK expression. Western blot analysis of treated lysates indicates that SLK siRNA at 10 pM resulted in a marked knockdown of SLK. Reprobing the membrane with a α-tubulin antibody was used as a control for loading (lower panel). (E–F) Cells were treated with SLK-specific or control siRNAs and assayed for migration through a chamber coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10 µg/ml) (control) or fibronectin (FN) (10 µg/ml). In both cases a 60–70% reduction in migration was observed. (G) Confluent MEF3T3 cells were infected with Adenovirus vectors expressing a scramble or SLK shRNA and manually scratched with a pipet tip. Wound closure was followed for 12 h and the percent closure was evaluated.</p>
