                Figure 4.  SLK is required for microtubule-dependent adhesion turnover.Subconfluent MEF 3T3 fibroblasts were infected with adenoviral constructs (A) encoding kinase-defective SLK (AdHA-KΔC) or an AdGFP control or transfected (B) with SLK siRNA (or siControl). Cultures were then treated with nocodazole (10 µM) for 4 h, washed and surveyed for FAK-pTyr397 levels over time. Expression of HA-tagged SLK or SLK knockdown was confirmed by Western blot analysis. SLK knockdown or expression of a kinase-deficient SLK interferes with focal adhesion turnover as evidenced by the delayed disappearance of FAK-pTyr397. (C) The status of the microtubule and pFAK-Y-397 was assessed following nocodazole wash-out in the presence or absence of shSLK expression. Large adhesions could still be observed in shSLK expressing cells following wash-out. (D) SLK in vitro kinase assay showing the induction of kinase activity following nocodazole wash-out as described in A and B. Scale bar 10μ.
