After 2 hours, the cells were fixed and stained for SLK (A, C, E and G) in combination with vinculin (B and D) or phalloidin (F and H). In addition to reduced SLK staining, shSLK expressing cells showed no SLK immunoreactivity at the leading edge with an increased number of focal adhesions. No overt differences were observed in phalloidin stained samples. Scale bar 10Î¼.</p>
