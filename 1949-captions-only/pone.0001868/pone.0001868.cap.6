Cells were collected 60 minutes later and analysed for SLK kinase activity. (A) Treatment with PP2 or PP3 control. (B) FAK-null or wildtype cells were subjected to scratch wound assays as above and assayed for SLK activity. (C) Treatment with U0126 and DMSO control. Phospho-Erk1/2 is shown as a control for U0126 treatment. SLK activation requires FAK/src/MAPK signaling.</p>
