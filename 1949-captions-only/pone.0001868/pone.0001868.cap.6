                Figure 6.  SLK activation requires FAK/src/MAPK signaling.(A) Confluent MEF 3T3 monolayers were pre-incubated (60 min) with inhibitors and then scratch wounded in the presence of inhibitors. Cells were collected 60 minutes later and analysed for SLK kinase activity. (A) Treatment with PP2 or PP3 control. (B) FAK-null or wildtype cells were subjected to scratch wound assays as above and assayed for SLK activity. (C) Treatment with U0126 and DMSO control. Phospho-Erk1/2 is shown as a control for U0126 treatment. SLK activation requires FAK/src/MAPK signaling.
