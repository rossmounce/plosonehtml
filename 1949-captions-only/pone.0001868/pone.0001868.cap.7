                Figure 7.  Recruitment of SLK at the leading is c-src-dependent.Confluent monolayers of FAK wildtype (A–B), FAK-null (C–D), SYF +c-src (E–F) and SYF (G–H) cells were scratch wounded and immunostained for SLK and Rac1. Similarly, MEF3T3 monolayers were pretreated with U0126 (30 min), scratch wounded and stained for SLK and Rac1 (I and J). SLK and Rac1 failed to be recruited to the leading edge in SYF cells.
