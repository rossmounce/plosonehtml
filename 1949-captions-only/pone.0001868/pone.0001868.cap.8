Following activation of the FAK/c-src complex, the microtubule network can be recruited as well as activation of a MAPK cascade. Signaling through CKII by active src may keep SLK inactive (32) until src inactivation can occur through csk and other phosphatases. The combined MAPK activation and CKII downregulation may contribute to SLK activation. It remains to be elucidated whether SLK is recruited prior to its activation or whether CKII downregulation is required for MAPK-mediated SLK activation. This cascade would ultimately result in adhesion turnover by destabilization of the actin network or focal contacts/adhesions through an unknown mechanism.</p>
