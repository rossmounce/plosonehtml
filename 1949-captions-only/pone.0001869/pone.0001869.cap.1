                Figure 1.  Generation of transgenic mice and expression analysis of the transgene.(A) Schematic representation of transgene constructs. Narrow arrows indicate the location and direction of RT-PCR primers (Figure S2). (B) Photographs of typical in situ hybridization are shown. DIG-labeled cRNA probe corresponding to the SV40 polyA sequence was hybridized to sagittal sections of the brain from 16–22 week-old wild-type, FSM and ACM4 mice. Scale bars, 500 µm. (C) Follistatin and activin protein levels in the hippocampus (Hip), cortex (CTX), cerebellum (Cbm) and medulla (Med) in wild-type, FSM and ACM4 mice measured by ELISA. Results are shown as mean±s. e. m. (n = 4) Except for activin in CTX in wild-type (n = 1). Adult indicates 16–22 weeks-old. P7, postnatal day 7.
