Each plot represents an average of 5 minutes. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001; Fisher's test. (B and C) Statistical analyses of walking velocity (B) and total pathlength (C) during 30 minutes of open field test. (D) Risk taking behavior test. Left panel, overhead view of the box used for open field test. #, area defined as a center region. Mid panel, time spent in the center region during the 30 minutes of open field testing. Right panel, the percentage pathlength in the center region. Results are shown as meanÂ±s. e. m.</p>
