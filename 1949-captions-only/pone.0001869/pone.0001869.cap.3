Lower panels, time (%) spent in the dark compartment was measured over 30 min. Wild-type littermates (black circles), n = 34; FSM (blue squares), n = 18; ACM4 (red triangles), n = 11. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, Fisher's test. (B) Statistical analyses of elevated plus-maze. Wild-type littermates, n = 26; FSM, n = 7; ACM4, n = 11. <em>p</em> values indicate ANOVA for genotype effect. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; t-test. (C) Left panels shows the apparatus used for the novel-area accessing test. Arrows indicate points of entry to the cylinder. Small picture shows side view of the cylinder. Bar graphs show time spent in novel area (inside cylinder) and distance traveled during 10 min testing. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05, t-test. Results are shown as meanÂ±s. e. m.</p>
