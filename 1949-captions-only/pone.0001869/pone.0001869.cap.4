Mice were sacrificed 1 day (upper panels) or 4 weeks (lower panels) after BrdU administration. At 4 weeks, most BrdU-positive cells were co-labeled with NeuN (red), a marker for mature neurons. Propidium iodide (PI, red) was used as a nuclear marker. (B) Number of BrdU-positive cells in the SGZ. The Y-axis indicates the number of BrdU-positive cells of the entire hippocampus. ACM4 had more BrdU-positive cells than FSM (wild-type, n = 21 animals; ACM4, n = 6 animals; FSM, n = 10 animals). (C) Number of BrdU-positive cells differentiated to neurons (NeuN<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>) or differentiated to another cell type (non-NeuN<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>) in the SGZ (wild-type, n = 25; ACM4, n = 14; FSM, n = 9). Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU administration. (D) Number of BrdU- and NeuN-double positive cells in the SGZ (wild-type, n = 32; ACM4/FSM, n = 9; FSM, n = 14). Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU administration. (E) Number of BrdU/NeuN-double positive cells in the SGZ. Animals were sacrificed 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU administration. At the 2-week stage (wild-type, n = 7; FSM, n = 8), but not at the 1-week stage (wild-type, n = 7; FSM, n = 9), the number of double positive cells was significantly decreased in FSM mice compared with wild-type littermates. Error bars indicate the s. e. m. *, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; **, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; t-test.</p>
