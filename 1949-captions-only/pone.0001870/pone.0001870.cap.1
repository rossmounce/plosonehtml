                Figure 1.  Distribution of the GCK mutations.The structure of GCK in the closed form (PDB code: 1v4s) is shown as cyan and red ribbons that represent the small and large domain, respectively. Orange ribbons show the Î±13 helix. Yellow spheres are the mutation sites. Red and blue circles indicate clusters of mutations in the large and small domain, respectively.
