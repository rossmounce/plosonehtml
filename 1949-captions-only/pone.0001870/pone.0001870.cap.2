A) Mutation p.Phe123Leu. Phe123 is structured inside the hydrophobic core of the small domain. Yellow sticks represent hydrophobic residues that constitute the core. Phe123 and Leu123 are represented by red sticks (left and right panel, respectively). B) The sticks represent residue Thr168 and glucose. The right panels show a close-up view of the glucose-binding cleft for the wild-type (top) and for the Ala168 mutant (bottom).</p>
