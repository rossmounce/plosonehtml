                Figure 3.  Structural features of mutations p.His137Asp, p.Arg392Ser and p.Gly162Asp GCK.The structure of GCK in the closed form (PDB code:1v4s) is shown as cyan ribbons. A) p.His137Asp. Loop 141–144, which is involved in GKRP binding, is in red. His137 is at the end of the α3 helix. His137 is a capping residue of the helix, which is terminated by the interaction between side chain of His137 and Phe133. Asp137 (right) is not able to replace His137 interactions but adds a new interaction with Lys104. B) p.Gly162Asp. Yellow sticks represent hydrophobic residues that constitute the core. The location of Gly162 is marked in red (left of the panel). Asp162 is on the right of the panel. C) p.Arg392Ser. Residues Asp42, Glu236, Asn240 and Arg392 are represented by yellow sticks. H-bonds are shown in green. The wild-type enzyme and the p.Arg392Ser mutant are on the left and right of the panel, respectively.
