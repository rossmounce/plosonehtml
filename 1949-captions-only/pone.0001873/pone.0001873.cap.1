B) Fc fusion chimeras of the intracellular domains from ROR2 WT, ROR2 KD, ROR2 Y<sup>755</sup>X and, as a control, the Fc-transmembrane domain of FGFR1 fusion were expressed in chondrocytes. The chimeric receptors were immunoprecipitated using Protein-A-sepharose (IP-PA) and analysed by Western blotting following 10% SDS-PAGE. Receptor phosphorylation was detected by a cocktail of phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10/pY20; WB-pY, upper panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-IgG1 antibody to compare receptor expression levels (WB-Fc, lower panel).</p>
