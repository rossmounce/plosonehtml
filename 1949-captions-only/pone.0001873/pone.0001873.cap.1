                Figure 1.  Fc-ROR2 WT is tyrosine phosphorylated.A) A schematic diagram of the full length ROR2 and Fc-ROR2 chimeras used in this study. ‘Kinase dead’ (KD) mutants were constructed by mutating three Lysine residues within the ATP binding pocket to Argenine. B) Fc fusion chimeras of the intracellular domains from ROR2 WT, ROR2 KD, ROR2 Y755X and, as a control, the Fc-transmembrane domain of FGFR1 fusion were expressed in chondrocytes. The chimeric receptors were immunoprecipitated using Protein-A-sepharose (IP-PA) and analysed by Western blotting following 10% SDS-PAGE. Receptor phosphorylation was detected by a cocktail of phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10/pY20; WB-pY, upper panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-IgG1 antibody to compare receptor expression levels (WB-Fc, lower panel).
