Following 1 hr of serum starvation in KHB, cells were either stimulated with 0.1% BSA carrier (C) or Wnt5a (1.6 µg/ml) for 5, 30 or 60 min. Control vector-transfected cells (V) were not stimulated. The receptor was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody (IP-myc) and analysed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. The membrane was probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine cocktail (WB-pY), followed by stripping and re-probing with anti-myc antibody (WB-myc). The fold-increase of ROR2 receptor phosphorylation was determined by normalizing Wnt5a-induced phosphorylation to carrier-induced phosphorylation (mean±s.e.m., n = 3, lower panel). B) Chondrocytes expressing ROR2-myc WT were stimulated with either 0.1% BSA (C) or Wnt5a (1.6 µg/ml) for 30 min. The receptor was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody (IP-myc) and probed with a phospho-Src antibody (WB-pSrc-Y<sup>416</sup>) to detect activated Src. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-c-Src (WB-cSrc) and anti-myc (WB-myc).</p>
