                Figure 3.  Wnt5a-induced association of activated Src and the ROR2 receptor.Chondrocytes were transfected with; A) ROR2-myc WT, B) ROR2-myc KD or C) ROR2-myc L747X and serum-starved for 1 hr in KHB prior to stimulation with either 0.1% BSA carrier or Wnt5a (1 µg/ml) plus heparin (10 µg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were fixed and stained with anti-myc, anti-phospho-Src (Y416) and Hoechst.
