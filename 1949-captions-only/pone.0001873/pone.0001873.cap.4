                Figure 4.  ROR2 receptor is a substrate for Src.Chondrocytes were co-transfected with myc-tagged ROR2 WT, ROR2 KD and myc-tagged deletion mutants ROR2 P860X and ROR2 L747X and either vector alone (V), constitutively active Src (Src A) or inactive Src (Src MF). Lanes 5 and 6 are controls for Src A and Src MF, respectively. The receptor constructs were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc (IP-myc) and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (WB-pY, upper panel) then stripped and reprobed with anti-myc (loading control, WB-myc). Src A and MF expression was confirmed on whole cell lysate prior to immunoprecipitation using anti-chicken Src antibody (WB-EC10, lower panel).
