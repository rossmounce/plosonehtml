                Figure 5.  ROR2 is targeted into Rab5A-positive endosomes upon Wnt5a stimulation.A) ROR2-myc WT and B) ROR2-myc KD transfected chondrocytes were serum-starved in KHB for1 hr. Cells were stimulated with either 0.1% BSA carrier or Wnt5a (1 ug/ml) plus heparin (10 µg/ml) for 5 min (upper panels), 30 min (middle panels) or 5 min in the presence of 24 µM SU6656 (lower panels). The cells were fixed and subsequently stained with anti-myc and anti-Rab5A antibodies.
