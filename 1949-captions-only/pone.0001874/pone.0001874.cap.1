                Figure 1.  Reduced expansion of P. berghei in BALB/c liver after intravenous injection.P. berghei 18S rRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in the liver of C57BL/6 and BALB/c males at the indicated times after intravenous injection of 104 P. berghei sporozoites. Each data point represents the average value and standard deviation of parasite quantification in the liver of 5â€“10 mice. Differences between groups were evaluated by unpaired t-test (** p&lt;0.01).
