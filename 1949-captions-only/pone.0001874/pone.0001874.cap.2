                Figure 2.  Reduced expansion of P. berghei in BALB/c liver after intra-hepatic injection.C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were surgically injected under the liver capsule with 104 P. berghei sporozoites and compared with mice injected intravenously. P. berghei 18S rRNA was quantified by real-time PCR at 40 hours after injection. Average values and standard deviations for each experimental group are represented. Differences between groups were evaluated by unpaired t-test (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01).
