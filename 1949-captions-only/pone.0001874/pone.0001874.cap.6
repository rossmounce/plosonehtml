                Figure 6.  The belr1 locus controls Plasmodium liver burden.P. berghei 18S rRNA was quantified by real-time PCR both in the livers of parental mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) and in B6.C-H2d congenic mice (A) or in C.B10-H2b congenic mice (B) 40 hours after infection with 104 P. berghei sporozoites. The observed difference between C57BL/6 and B6.C-H2d is attributable to the congenic region in chromosome 17 of B6.C-H2d mice while the chromosome 17 congenic region in the C.B10-H2b shows no control over malaria resistance phenotype. Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired t-test (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001).
