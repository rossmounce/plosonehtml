                Figure 7.  Location of belr1 locus in chromosome 17.The diagram represents the physical map of chromosome 17 congenic regions in B6.C-H2d and C.B10-H2b mouse strains compared to the C57BL/6 strain. Delimitation of belr1 locus is represented taking into account the malaria resistance phenotypes in the congenic strains.
