                Figure 1.  Muscle protein synthesis rate in men and women.Panels A and B show the mixed skeletal muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) during basal, post-absorptive conditions (fasted) and liquid mixed meal consumption (fed) in men and women (A) and the meal-induced change in the FSR in men and women (B). Graphs show the median (central horizontal line), 25th and 75th percentiles (box), and minimum and maximum values (vertical lines). * Value significantly different from corresponding value in men. â€  Value significantly different from corresponding value during basal, postabsorptive (fasted) conditions.
