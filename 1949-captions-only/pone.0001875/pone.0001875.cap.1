Graphs show the median (central horizontal line), 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles (box), and minimum and maximum values (vertical lines). * Value significantly different from corresponding value in men. <sup>â€ </sup> Value significantly different from corresponding value during basal, postabsorptive (fasted) conditions.</p>
