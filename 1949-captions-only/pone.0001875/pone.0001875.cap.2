                Figure 2.  Phosphorylation of anabolic signaling transduction molecules in muscle of men and women.Panels A–E show concentrations of phosphorylated AktThr308 (A), p70s6kThr389 (B), eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 (C), eIF4ESer209 (D), and eEF2Thr56 (E) during basal, postabsorptive conditions (fasted) and liquid mixed meal consumption (fed) in men and women. Values are means±SEM. * Value significantly different from corresponding value in men; † Value significantly different from corresponding value during basal, postabsorptive (fasted) conditions.
