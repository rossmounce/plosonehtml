                Figure 3.  Muscle mRNA expression of proteins involved in the regulation of muscle mass in men and women.Panels A and B show myostatin (A) and myoD (B) gene expression during basal, postabsorptive conditions (fasted) and liquid mixed meal consumption (fed) in men (n = 7) and women (n = 7). Values are means±SEM. † Value significantly different from corresponding value during basal, postabsorptive (fasted) conditions; P&lt;0.05.
