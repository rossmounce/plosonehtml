The typical TRP domain (stripes) is present directly C-terminal to the last transmembrane domain and a Ser/Thr-rich region (checkered) is present immediately N-terminal of the kinase domain. In addition to the full-length protein, the entire cytosolic C tail but excluding the TRP domain of TRPM6 and TRPM7 (TRPM6-C-long and TRPM7-C-long) as well as the isolated kinase domain of TRPM7 (TRPM7-C-short) were expressed as HA-tagged recombinant proteins in mammalian cells. Mouse and human TRPM7 sequences found in the NCBI database differ by a single amino acid. Since we used human TRPM7 in this study, we have corrected all positions to correspond to the human sequence and therefore Ser1511 and Ser1567 become Ser1512 and Ser1568, respectively.</p>
