WT and KD TRPM7-C-long were incubated in the absence or presence of MnATP for 30 min and detected using anti-HA (top panel) and anti-pThr antibodies (bottom panel). (B) Kinetics of TRPM7 autophosphorylation. TRPM7-C-long was incubated with MnATP for the indicated times. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies.</p>
