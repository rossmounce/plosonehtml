TRPM7-C-long was incubated with GST-myosin IIA in the presence of varying MnATP concentrations for 30 min at 30°C. The specific activity of ATP was maintained constant for all samples. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with coomassie brilliant blue (bottom panel) and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography (top panel). (B) Myosin II phosphorylation correlates with TRPM7 autophosphorylation even at exceedingly high specific activities. The experiment was performed as described in A except that the specific activity of the ATP solution was varied to detect myosin II phosphorylation at low ATP concentrations. All samples contained 5 µCi of [γ−<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP supplemented with the indicated concentrations of cold ATP.</p>
