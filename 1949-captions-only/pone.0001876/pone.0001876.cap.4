                Figure 4.  TRPM7 autophosphorylation precedes phosphorylation of substrates.TRPM7-C-long was incubated with GST-myosin IIB in the presence of Mn[γ−32P]-ATP for the indicated times. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, revealed by coommassie staining (bottom panel) and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography (top panel).
