TRPM7-C-long was incubated in the absence (−ATP) or presence (+ATP) of cold MnATP to generate non-phosphorylated and completely autophosphorylated TRPM7. ATP was subsequently removed by washing the kinase with <em>in vitro</em> kinase buffer lacking ATP. Kinase reactions were initiated by adding Mn[γ−<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and GST-myosin IIB and allowed to proceed at 30°C for the indicated times. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by coomassie staining (bottom panel). Phosphorylated myosin II (top panel) was detected by autoradiography. Note that the kinase pre-incubated in buffer without ATP (−ATP) must first complete autophosphorylation (5 min), apparent from the reduced electrophoretic mobility shift of TRPM7 (refer to Fig. 4), to acquire the ability to phosphorylate its substrates. (B) Quantification of myosin II phosphorylation by TRPM7 pre-incubated in absence (−ATP) or presence (+ATP) of ATP. <sup>32</sup>P incorporation was measured by phosphorimaging analysis. The phosphorylation levels measured for myosin incubated for 30 min with TRPM7 that was pre-incubated with ATP was set to 1 and all other values are reported relative to that sample. (C) TRPM7 autophosphorylation does not affect catalytic activity. Experiment was performed as described in part A but using MBP as substrate. (D) Quantification of MBP phosphorylation by TRPM7 pre-incubated in absence (−ATP) or presence (+ATP) of ATP. Data was derived as described in part B.</p>
