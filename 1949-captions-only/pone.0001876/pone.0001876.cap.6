                Figure 6.  Identification of phosphorylated residues in TRPM7 by LC-MS/MS.WT and KD TRPM7-C-long were incubated in the presence of MnATP for 0 or 30 min. Tryptic peptides were analyzed using LTQ-FT mass spectrometer. (A) Representative MS2 and MS3 spectra for a TRPM7 peptide phosphorylated on Ser-1614. (m/z observed of parent ion was 823.3848, mass accuracy 1.85 ppm, +2 charge state; NL indicates neutral loss of H3PO4 which triggers acquisition of MS3 spectrum). The b+-ion series is indicated in red whereas the y+-ion series is in blue. S* refers to dehydroserine. (B) Diagram depicting the phosphorylated residues identified in WT (red) and KD (blue) TRPM7-C-long incubated in presence (right) or absence (left) of ATP.
