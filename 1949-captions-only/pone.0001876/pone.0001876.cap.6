Tryptic peptides were analyzed using LTQ-FT mass spectrometer. (A) Representative MS<sup>2</sup> and MS<sup>3</sup> spectra for a TRPM7 peptide phosphorylated on Ser-1614. (m/z observed of parent ion was 823.3848, mass accuracy 1.85 ppm, +2 charge state; NL indicates neutral loss of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> which triggers acquisition of MS<sup>3</sup> spectrum). The b<sup>+</sup>-ion series is indicated in red whereas the y<sup>+</sup>-ion series is in blue. S* refers to dehydroserine. (B) Diagram depicting the phosphorylated residues identified in WT (red) and KD (blue) TRPM7-C-long incubated in presence (right) or absence (left) of ATP.</p>
