                Figure 7.  Deletion of the Ser/Thr-rich domain in TRPM7 reduces substrate phosphorylation.(A) Autophosphorylation of TRPM7-C-short only leads to a minor change in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. TRPM7-C-short and TRPM7-C-long were incubated in the absence or presence of MnATP for 30 min at 30°C and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. (B) TRPM7-C-short phosphorylates myosin II less efficiently than TRPM7-C-long. (i) TRPM7-C-short and TRPM7-C-long were incubated with GST-myosin IIB in the presence of Mn[γ−32P]-ATP. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, revealed by coommassie staining (middle panel) and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography (left panel). (ii) Equal amounts of each kinase was verified by Western blotting (right panel). (C) Quantification of myosin II phosphorylation by TRPM7-C-short and TRPM7-C-long. 32P incorporation was measured by phosphorimaging analysis. The phosphorylation levels measured for myosin II incubated with TRPM7-C-long was set to 1 and values obtained for TRPM7-C-short are reported relative to that value. (D) Deletion of residues 1158-1548 does not affect catalytic activity. (i) TRPM7-C-long and TRPM7-C-short WT and KD were incubated with MH1 peptide in presence of Mn[γ−32P]-ATP. The level of phosphorylation was measured by scintillation counting. Background activity as determined using the KD mutant was substracted from the WT TRPM7 samples and catalytic activity was reported relative to that of TRPM7-C-long, which was set to 1. (ii) Equal amounts of each kinase were verified by Western blotting.
