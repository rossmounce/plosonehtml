Alignment of amino acid sequences of TRPM6 and TRPM7 using Blast-2-Blast from NCBI. The gap is a result of low sequence similarity between the two proteins in the indicated region. (B) Autophosphorylation of TRPM6 leads to a dramatic shift in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. TRPM6-C-long and TRPM7-C-long were incubated in the absence or presence of MnATP, resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected using anti-HA antibodies. (C) TRPM6 autophosphorylation precedes myosin II phosphorylation. TRPM6-C-long was incubated with GST-myosin IIB in the presence of Mn[γ−<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP for the indicated times. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, revealed by coommassie staining (bottom panel) and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography (top panel). (D) Accelerated kinetics of myosin II phosphorylation after pre-incubation of TRPM6 with ATP. TRPM6-C-long was incubated in the absence or presence of MnATP to generate non-phosphorylated and completely autophosphorylated TRPM6. To initiate the phosphorylation of myosin II, <em>in vitro</em> kinase buffer containing Mn[γ−<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and GST-myosin IIB was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30°C and stopped by adding Laemmli buffer after the indicated times. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by coomassie staining (bottom panel) and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography (top panel).</p>
