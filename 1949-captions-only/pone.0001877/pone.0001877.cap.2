Values from individual male mice are indicated by closed circles connected with solid lines, and values from individual female mice are indicated by closed triangles connected with dashed lines. Delayed activity index of Tg mice and anticipatory activity index of both Tg and non-Tg mice were significantly lowered by ECS. (E) Time courses of delayed and anticipatory activity indices of male Tg mice receiving ECS. Each color of line represents different individuals (<em>n</em> = 9). The week when three ECS treatments were delivered is indicated by a red background.</p>
