                Figure 2.  Effect of ECS. Mice were oxygenized and delivered ECS three times within a week (days 54, 56, and 58; shown in Fig. 1B).Wheel-running activity (A), delayed (B) and anticipatory (C) activity indices, and day-to-day variation in activity (D) were estimated on the basis of the activity levels before (Pre) and after (Post) the treatment (days 11–53 and 66–89, respectively). Values from individual male mice are indicated by closed circles connected with solid lines, and values from individual female mice are indicated by closed triangles connected with dashed lines. Delayed activity index of Tg mice and anticipatory activity index of both Tg and non-Tg mice were significantly lowered by ECS. (E) Time courses of delayed and anticipatory activity indices of male Tg mice receiving ECS. Each color of line represents different individuals (n = 9). The week when three ECS treatments were delivered is indicated by a red background.
