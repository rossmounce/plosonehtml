The thick horizontal yellow line below FZC18 indicates the probe used. (B–D) Relative mRNA expression of V3C18 by QRT-PCR in human tissues (Human Total RNA Master Panel, Clontech, USA) (B) and in cell lines (C). Assays were performed in triplicate with a coefficient of variation &lt;10% and normalized to 18S. Brain (B) and liver (C) were used as calibrators. (D) Relative V3 mRNA expression in human liver samples. Small (≤2 cm), well-differentiated HCCs are compared to advanced HCCs. mRNA samples were blotted in triplicates onto nylon membranes and arrays hybridized with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled cDNA under linear-range conditions. Densitometry readings were normalized with an 18S probe. Bar graphs show mean±SD. The Mann Whitney's “U” test was used. NS, non significant; NT, non tumor livers.</p>
