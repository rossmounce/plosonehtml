                Figure 2.  V3Nter localizes at the cell surface and inhibits Wnt/β−catenin signaling and downstream protein expression.(A) V3Nter and V2Nter expression vectors. Thick horizontal color lines indicate the antibodies used. Blue box, 47-aa stretch from the Tsp-1C18 module. (B1-C3) Confocal fluorescence microscopy of mhAT3FS315 mouse HCC cells transiently transfected with V3Nter (B1-B3) or V2Nter (C1-C3) cDNAs and probed with anti-DUF-959, followed by anti-rabbit TRITC-labeled IgG (red). Three out of 15 representative images acquired at 500-nm intervals on the vertical axis are shown. V3Nter (B1-B3) highlights intercellular spaces. V2Nter (C1-C3) is detected in the cytoplasm. Movie S1 shows a tridimensional reconstruction of V3Nter cell surface staining using the 15 acquired images (original magnification x1000). Figure S1, B-D shows confocal microscopy of V3FL and V2FL. (D-F) Fluorescence microscopy of mouse HCC cells transfected with either V3Nter (D and E) or V2Nter (F) cDNAs and incubated with either anti-DUF-959, followed by anti-rabbit TRITC-labeled IgG (red) (D and F) or anti-V5 epitope tag, followed by anti-mouse FITC-labeled IgG (E). (D) V3Nter outlines cell membranes and cell-cell boundaries (arrow). (E) V3Nter highlights the cell surface (arrows). (F) Secretion of V2Nter covers the cell surface and is detected on neighboring cells as dispersing red speckles (arrows). (G) Dose-dependent changes in CRT in response to increasing amounts of transiently transfected cDNA vectors. Reporter gene assays using a β−catenin-TCF reporter driven by wild-type (SUPER8XTOPFLASH, white bars) or a negative control with mutated TCF binding sites (SUPER8XFOPFLASH, black bars). Results are means of three replicates from a representative experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. Error bars represent standard deviations. Figure S1, E and F shows changes in CRT in response to V3FL and V2FL. (H) Immunoblot of HCT116 cells transiently transfected and probed with the indicated cDNA vectors (top) and antibodies (right). Hsc70 is a loading standard.
