Thick horizontal color lines indicate the antibodies used. Blue box, 47-aa stretch from the Tsp-1C18 module. (B1-C3) Confocal fluorescence microscopy of mhAT3FS315 mouse HCC cells transiently transfected with V3Nter (B1-B3) or V2Nter (C1-C3) cDNAs and probed with anti-DUF-959, followed by anti-rabbit TRITC-labeled IgG <em>(red).</em> Three out of 15 representative images acquired at 500-nm intervals on the vertical axis are shown. V3Nter (B1-B3) highlights intercellular spaces. V2Nter (C1-C3) is detected in the cytoplasm. <a href="#pone.0001878.s005">Movie S1</a> shows a tridimensional reconstruction of V3Nter cell surface staining using the 15 acquired images (original magnification x1000). <a href="#pone.0001878.s001">Figure S1</a>, B-D shows confocal microscopy of V3FL and V2FL. (D-F) Fluorescence microscopy of mouse HCC cells transfected with either V3Nter (D and E) or V2Nter (F) cDNAs and incubated with either anti-DUF-959, followed by anti-rabbit TRITC-labeled IgG <em>(red)</em> (D and F) or anti-V5 epitope tag, followed by anti-mouse FITC-labeled IgG (E). (D) V3Nter outlines cell membranes and cell-cell boundaries <em>(arrow).</em> (E) V3Nter highlights the cell surface <em>(arrows).</em> (F) Secretion of V2Nter covers the cell surface and is detected on neighboring cells as dispersing red speckles <em>(arrows).</em> (G) Dose-dependent changes in CRT in response to increasing amounts of transiently transfected cDNA vectors. Reporter gene assays using a β−catenin-TCF reporter driven by wild-type (<em>SUPER8XTOPFLASH,</em> white bars) or a negative control with mutated TCF binding sites (<em>SUPER8XFOPFLASH,</em> black bars). Results are means of three replicates from a representative experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. Error bars represent standard deviations. <a href="#pone.0001878.s001">Figure S1</a>, E and F shows changes in CRT in response to V3FL and V2FL. (H) Immunoblot of HCT116 cells transiently transfected and probed with the indicated cDNA vectors <em>(top)</em> and antibodies <em>(right)</em>. Hsc70 is a loading standard.</p>
