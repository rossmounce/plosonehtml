(A and B) After hematoxylin staining, colonies (seen as dark spots) were digitized using a video camera and counted with Scion Image (NIH). Histograms show colony formation efficiencies relative to cells transfected with empty vector. (C) Hoescht 33342-stained cells photographed at ×200 magnification. Arrows indicate apoptotic cells. (D) Hoescht cell counts show mean±SD percent apoptotic cells out of triplicate 300-cell counts from 6-well plates (blindly at ×200 magnification) at each time point. SubG1 shows mean±SD percent apoptotic cells out of triplicate 1×10<sup>4</sup> cells from 6-well plates assessed by flow cytometry at each time point. (E) Representative FL2-H histograms of HepG2 cells show percent SubG1 population.</p>
