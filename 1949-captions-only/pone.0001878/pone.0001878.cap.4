Horizontal color lines below each module indicate the antibodies used. (B) Immunoblot of protein extracts from HCT116 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs, resolved in denaturing 7.5% PAGE-SDS and probed with anti-V5 <em>(red).</em> V3Nter shows ~80 kD and ~30–40 kD polypeptides. (C–E) Protein extracts from mhAT3FS315 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs. Denaturing 5% (C) or 7.5% (D–E) PAGE-SDS gels. (C) V2Nter and V3Nter appear as smears typical of proteoglycans. (D) <em>Asterisk,</em> immunoglobulins from medium containing FCS. V2Nter shows a ~50 kD polypeptide in cell layers <em>(L)</em> and conditioned medium <em>(M).</em> V3Nter shows ~80 kD and ~30–40 kD polypeptides in cell layers <em>(L).</em> By contrast, in medium <em>(M),</em> a 36 kD polypeptide predominates and the 80 kD form decreases in intensity. Note that 5 µg of protein was loaded for cell layers and 50 µg for conditioned media. The ~80-kD V3Nter polypeptide is detected at much higher levels in cell layers than in media. In addition, V2Nter polypeptides are detected as a high molecular weight smear above the 80 kD marker in conditioned medium. (E) mhAT3FS315 cells transfected with V3Nter cDNA. Cell extracts incubated at 37°C for 2 hr with N-glycosidase, Sialidase A or buffer alone and probed with the indicated antibodies. Deglycosylation reveals polypeptides of ~50 and 48 kD detected by anti-FZC18, anti-V5 and anti-DUF-959. A 36 kD polypeptide <em>(arrowheads)</em> is detected by anti-FZC18, anti-V5, but not by anti-DUF-959. [Anti-FZC18 detects nonspecific polypeptides between 30–40 kD <em>(brackets)</em>, consistently with <a href="#pone-0001878-g008">Figure 8G</a>].</p>
