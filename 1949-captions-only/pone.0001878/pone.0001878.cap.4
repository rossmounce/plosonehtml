                Figure 4.  Processing of V3Nter releases FZC18.(A) Schematic of V3Nter (left) and V2Nter (right) cDNA vectors. Horizontal color lines below each module indicate the antibodies used. (B) Immunoblot of protein extracts from HCT116 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs, resolved in denaturing 7.5% PAGE-SDS and probed with anti-V5 (red). V3Nter shows ~80 kD and ~30–40 kD polypeptides. (C–E) Protein extracts from mhAT3FS315 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs. Denaturing 5% (C) or 7.5% (D–E) PAGE-SDS gels. (C) V2Nter and V3Nter appear as smears typical of proteoglycans. (D) Asterisk, immunoglobulins from medium containing FCS. V2Nter shows a ~50 kD polypeptide in cell layers (L) and conditioned medium (M). V3Nter shows ~80 kD and ~30–40 kD polypeptides in cell layers (L). By contrast, in medium (M), a 36 kD polypeptide predominates and the 80 kD form decreases in intensity. Note that 5 µg of protein was loaded for cell layers and 50 µg for conditioned media. The ~80-kD V3Nter polypeptide is detected at much higher levels in cell layers than in media. In addition, V2Nter polypeptides are detected as a high molecular weight smear above the 80 kD marker in conditioned medium. (E) mhAT3FS315 cells transfected with V3Nter cDNA. Cell extracts incubated at 37°C for 2 hr with N-glycosidase, Sialidase A or buffer alone and probed with the indicated antibodies. Deglycosylation reveals polypeptides of ~50 and 48 kD detected by anti-FZC18, anti-V5 and anti-DUF-959. A 36 kD polypeptide (arrowheads) is detected by anti-FZC18, anti-V5, but not by anti-DUF-959. [Anti-FZC18 detects nonspecific polypeptides between 30–40 kD (brackets), consistently with Figure 8G].
