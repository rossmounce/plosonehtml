Dose-dependent decrease in CRT is detected in response to increasing amounts of transiently transfected FZC18 cDNA. Controls include SFRP1, SFRP5, V3Nter and V2Nter (250 ng cDNA). (B) Immunoblot of HCT116 cells transiently transfected with increasing amounts of FZC18 cDNA. The blots were probed with the indicated antibodies <em>(right).</em> Hsc70 is a loading standard. (C) Reporter gene assays using cyclin D1 promoter driving luciferase expression in transiently transfected HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Results are expressed relative to cells transfected with empty vector. (D) Colony formation assay in HCT116 cells transfected with FZC18 or V2Nter. Histograms show colony formation efficiencies.</p>
