                Figure 6.  Ectopic FZC18 binds Wnt3a and suppresses Wnt3a-dependent activation of β−catenin signaling in vitro.(A and B) Wnt3a pulls down V3Nter specifically via the FZC18 domain. EBNA-293 cells were cotransfected with V3Nter (A) or V2Nter (B) and His-tagged mouse Wnt3a. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP), resolved by 10% PAGE-SDS and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. IgGH and IgGL are immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. (C) Reporter gene assays using a β−catenin-TCF responsive reporter (SUPER8XTOPFLASH) or a negative control (SUPER8XFOPFLASH). HEK293T or Huh-7 cells were cotransfected with Wnt3a and the indicated vectors. Results are means of three replicates from a representative experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. Error bars represent standard deviations.
