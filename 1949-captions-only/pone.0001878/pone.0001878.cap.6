EBNA-293 cells were cotransfected with V3Nter (A) or V2Nter (B) and His-tagged mouse Wnt3a. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated <em>(IP)</em>, resolved by 10% PAGE-SDS and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. IgG<sub>H</sub> and IgG<sub>L</sub> are immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. (C) Reporter gene assays using a β−catenin-TCF responsive reporter <em>(SUPER8XTOPFLASH)</em> or a negative control <em>(SUPER8XFOPFLASH).</em> HEK293T or Huh-7 cells were cotransfected with Wnt3a and the indicated vectors. Results are means of three replicates from a representative experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. Error bars represent standard deviations.</p>
