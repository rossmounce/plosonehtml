                Figure 7.  FZC18 is negatively associated with Wnt/β−catenin pathway activity in vivo.Immunoperoxidase detection (brown) of FZC18, glutamine synthetase (GS) or β−catenin in normal and tumor livers. Hematoxylin counter-staining (blue). (A-C) In normal liver, FZC18 (A) is detected around portal tracts (PT). No FZC18 is seen around central veins (CV). GS (B) is detected around CV. (C) Faint cell-membrane β−catenin. (D–F) Contiguous sections of tumor liver tissue (TL #325) arising in a cirrhotic nodule. FZC18 (D) is detected in remaining non tumor hepatocytes (NT), compressed by the expansive growth of the tumor, but not in the tumor (T). GS (E) is strong in T and faint in NT. β−catenin (F) is detected in cell membranes in NT (thick arrow) and in cytoplasm and nuclei in T (thin arrows) (inset). (G–L) Contiguous sections of tumor liver tissue (TL #04). Nodule-in-nodule showing faint FZC18 (G), but strong GS (H) staining (asterisks), surrounded by tumor tissue showing strong FZC18, but faint GS staining. (J and K) Higher magnification. (I) Strong FZC18 staining (inset), associated with membranous β−catenin. (L) Mild FZC18 staining (inset), associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear β−catenin (arrows).
