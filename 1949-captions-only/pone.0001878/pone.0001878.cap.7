Hematoxylin counter-staining <em>(blue).</em> (A-C) In normal liver, FZC18 (A) is detected around portal tracts <em>(PT).</em> No FZC18 is seen around central veins <em>(CV).</em> GS (B) is detected around CV. (C) Faint cell-membrane β−catenin. (D–F) Contiguous sections of tumor liver tissue (TL #325) arising in a cirrhotic nodule. FZC18 (D) is detected in remaining non tumor hepatocytes <em>(NT),</em> compressed by the expansive growth of the tumor, but not in the tumor <em>(T).</em> GS (E) is strong in <em>T</em> and faint in <em>NT</em>. β−catenin (F) is detected in cell membranes in <em>NT (thick arrow)</em> and in cytoplasm and nuclei in <em>T (thin arrows) (inset).</em> (G–L) Contiguous sections of tumor liver tissue (TL #04). Nodule-in-nodule showing faint FZC18 (G), but strong GS (H) staining <em>(asterisks),</em> surrounded by tumor tissue showing strong FZC18, but faint GS staining. (J and K) Higher magnification. (I) Strong FZC18 staining <em>(inset),</em> associated with membranous β−catenin. (L) Mild FZC18 staining <em>(inset),</em> associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear β−catenin <em>(arrows).</em></p>
