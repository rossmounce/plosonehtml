                Figure 8.  In vivo processing of the N-terminus of V3C18 releases a 50 kD FZC18 precursor.(A) Schematic of V2 and V3 of C18 showing DUF-959, FZC18, Tsp-1C18 (thrombospondin-1) and ES (endostatin) modules. Thick horizontal color lines indicate the antibodies used. (B and C) Histologically representative 5-µm freeze-dried cryosections from human normal (NL) and tumor livers (TL) were scraped off slides with sterile scalpels, solubilized in 10% SDS buffer and dosed. Two hundred µg of whole protein extract was resolved by denaturing 5% (B) or 12% (C) PAGE-SDS, followed by immunoblot. NLs show a distinct ~170 kD polypeptide (B). TLs show variable levels of the ~170 kD polypeptide, a prominent polypeptide band below the 74 kD marker (B) and ~50 to 60 kD bands (C). After membrane stripping, mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody is used as a loading control. (D–G) A frozen human HCC tissue block (case TL 06, shown in B) was homogenized using a tissue grinder in non-denaturing buffer containing protease inhibitors at +4°C. Proteins were clarified by ultracentrifugation (130 000 g), fractionated by heparin-affinity chromatography and analyzed by denaturing 5% (D and F) or 12% (E and G) PAGE-SDS and immunoblot. (D) 170-kD V3C18 binds heparin with high affinity. (E) Non heparin-binding polypeptides from the N-terminus of C18: a ~50 kD polypeptide is detected by the three antibodies (V3Nter, arrow). (F and G) Digestion of heparin-binding proteins with bacterial collagenase releases N-terminal noncollagenous polypeptides containing FZC18 and DUF-959 epitopes. Collagenase activity is inhibited by EDTA, suggesting that V3Nter can be released by a metalloprotease. Three identical sample sets were gel-migrated and blotted in parallel, then cut into 3 stripes before immunodetections. [Anti-FZC18 detects nonspecific polypeptides between 30–40 kD (brackets)].
