                Figure 1.  Lidocaine alters leukocyte infiltration during acute inflammation and delays resolution.(A) Mice were injected with zymosan A in the absence or presence of lidocaine (0.008% or 0.08%) and peritoneal lavages were collected at indicated time points. Total leukocytes were enumerated by light microscopy, and PMN and mononuclear cells determined by differential leukocyte counting. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3–4. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone at the same time points. (B) Mice were injected with lidocaine (0.08%) 15 min prior to injection of zymosan A. Peritoneal lavages were collected at 24 h, and total leukocytes enumerated. Results are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone.
