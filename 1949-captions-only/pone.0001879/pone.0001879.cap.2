LXA<sub>4</sub>, LTB<sub>4</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> amounts were determined by ELISA. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from duplicates of n = 3, and were expressed as amounts (ng/ml). (B) Mice were injected with zymosan A together with lidocaine (0.08%), ATLa (300 ng), or lidocaine plus ATLa. Peritoneal lavages were collected at 24 h, and total leukocytes enumerated. Results are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3. *<em>p</em> = 0.03 **<em>p</em> = 0.01 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone. ***<em>p</em> = 0.04 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A and lidocaine.</p>
