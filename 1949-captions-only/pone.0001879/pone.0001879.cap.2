                Figure 2.  Lidocaine did not directly alter selective eicosanoid levels in cell-free exudates: LXA4 rescues lidocaine-delayed resolution.(A) Cell-free lavages from murine peritoneum were collected at indicated time points after zymosan challenge (1 mg/ml). LXA4, LTB4 and PGE2 amounts were determined by ELISA. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from duplicates of n = 3, and were expressed as amounts (ng/ml). (B) Mice were injected with zymosan A together with lidocaine (0.08%), ATLa (300 ng), or lidocaine plus ATLa. Peritoneal lavages were collected at 24 h, and total leukocytes enumerated. Results are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3. *p = 0.03 **p = 0.01 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone. ***p = 0.04 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A and lidocaine.
