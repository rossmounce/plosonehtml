                Figure 3.  Lidocaine impairs PMN apoptosis and macrophage ingestion of PMN in vivo and zymosan in vitro.(A) Apoptosis in vivo. Peritoneal cells were collected at 24 h or 48 h and labeled with FITC-annexin-V and PE-conjugated anti-Gr-1 Ab. The apoptotic PMN (annexin-V+Gr-1+) are expressed as % of total PMN (Gr-1+). Results are the mean±SEM from n = 3–4. *p&lt;0.01, **p&lt;0.001. (B) Phagocytosis in vivo. (right) Representative dot plots of FACS analysis. In the non-permeabilized lavage cells, Gr-1+ represents PMN, and F4/80+ represents macrophages; and in the permeabilized cells, F4/80+Gr-1+ cell population represents macrophages with ingested PMN. (left) Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3–4, and were expressed as percent of the F4/80+Gr-1+ cells. *p&lt;0.05. (C) Phagocytosis in vitro. Murine peritoneal resident macrophages were incubated with indicated compounds or vehicle alone for 20 min followed by addition of FITC-zymosan at a 10:1 ratio for 30 min. Cells were then quenched and fluorescence determined. Phagocytosis activity in the presence of 1 nM of LXA4 was taken as 100%. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3–4, and were expressed as % phagocytosis. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, compared to LXA4 alone.
