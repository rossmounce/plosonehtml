Peritoneal cells were collected at 24 h or 48 h and labeled with FITC-annexin-V and PE-conjugated anti-Gr-1 Ab. The apoptotic PMN (annexin-V<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>) are expressed as % of total PMN (Gr-1<sup>+</sup>). Results are the mean±SEM from n = 3–4. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.01, **<em>p</em>&lt;0.001. (B) <em>Phagocytosis in vivo</em>. (<em>right</em>) Representative dot plots of FACS analysis. In the non-permeabilized lavage cells, Gr-1<sup>+</sup> represents PMN, and F4/80<sup>+</sup> represents macrophages; and in the permeabilized cells, F4/80<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cell population represents macrophages with ingested PMN. (<em>left</em>) Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3–4, and were expressed as percent of the F4/80<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05. (C) <em>Phagocytosis in vitro</em>. Murine peritoneal resident macrophages were incubated with indicated compounds or vehicle alone for 20 min followed by addition of FITC-zymosan at a 10:1 ratio for 30 min. Cells were then quenched and fluorescence determined. Phagocytosis activity in the presence of 1 nM of LXA<sub>4</sub> was taken as 100%. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3–4, and were expressed as % phagocytosis. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05, **<em>p</em>&lt;0.01, compared to LXA<sub>4</sub> alone.</p>
