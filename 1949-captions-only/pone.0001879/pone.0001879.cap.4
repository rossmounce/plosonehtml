Both lavage fluids (A) and cell pellets (C) were collected at indicated time points and proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Changes in individual protein levels were measured by image analysis. Selected proteins that display significant differences between treatments are indicated by arrows, and identified by LC/MS/MS and peptide mapping (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). (B) (Left) S100 A9 protein levels. Supernatants from peritoneal lavages were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-S100A9 antibody. Relative intensities of immunoreactive bands were quantitated and normalized by albumin levels using an anti-albumin antibody. Data are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3–4. *<em>p</em> = 0.02. (Right) S100 A9 mRNA levels. Peritoneal cells were collected and total RNA isolated for RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for mouse S100A9. Relative intensities of RT-PCR products were quantitated and normalized by β-actin message levels. Data are expressed as mean±SEM from n = 3–4. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
