Cytokines and chemokines were expressed as (A) pg/ml or ng/ml in naïve mice and mice treated with zymosan alone, (B) percent inhibition of zymosan A-induced cytokine/chemokine levels by lidocaine. The amounts of cytokines and chemokines levels were determined by multiplexed sandwich ELISA. (C) TGF-β (active form) levels were determined by ELISA. (D) Human heparinized whole blood was incubated with either 0.008% or 0.08% of lidocaine in the presence of zymosan A (100 µg/ml) for 4 h, and plasma was collected. The amounts of cytokines and chemokines levels were determined by multiplexed sandwich ELISA. Results are the mean from duplicate determinations of n = 3–4. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone (B, C) or human whole blood incubated with zymosan A alone (D).</p>
