                Figure 6.  Volatile anesthetic isoflurane reduces leukocyte infiltration and promote resolution by shortening resolution interval.Mice were administered 1.4 MAC of isoflurane one hour prior to and after injection of zymosan A (1mg/ml, i.p.) (see timeline). The peritoneal lavages were collected at indicated time points. (A) Total leukocytes were enumerated by light microscopy, and PMN and mononuclear cells determined by differential leukocyte counting. Results are expressed as the mean±SEM from n = 3-4. *P&lt;0.05 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone at the same intervals. (B) Resolution Indices were calculated with isoflurane as in Figure S1. Isoflurane treatment reduces the magnitude (Ψmax) of inflammation and accelerates resolution by shortening the resolution interval (Ri.).
