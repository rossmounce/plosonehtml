                Figure 7.  Isoflurane regulates cellular proteins-proteomic analysis.Mice were administered 1.4 Mac of isoflurane one hour prior to and after injection of zymosan A (1mg/ml, i.p.). (A) The peritoneal lavage cells were collected at indicated time points and proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Changes in individual protein levels were measured by image analysis. Selected proteins that display significant differences between treatments are denoted, and were identified by LC/MS/MS and peptide mapping. (B) Peritoneal cell-free lavage fluids were collected. Cytokine and chemokine levels were determined and expressed as percent inhibition of zymosan A-induced cytokine/chemokine levels by isoflurane. *p&lt;0.05 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone. For raw values (pg/ml) of these selective cytokines, see Table 6.
