(A) The peritoneal lavage cells were collected at indicated time points and proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Changes in individual protein levels were measured by image analysis. Selected proteins that display significant differences between treatments are denoted, and were identified by LC/MS/MS and peptide mapping. (B) Peritoneal cell-free lavage fluids were collected. Cytokine and chemokine levels were determined and expressed as percent inhibition of zymosan A-induced cytokine/chemokine levels by isoflurane. *<em>p</em>&lt;0.05 when compared to mice treated with zymosan A alone. For raw values (pg/ml) of these selective cytokines, see <a href="#pone-0001879-t006">Table 6</a>.</p>
