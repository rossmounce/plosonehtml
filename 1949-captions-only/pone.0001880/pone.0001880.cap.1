                Figure 1.  Tissue Connectome.Color code: Central Nervous System RED; Peripheral Nervous System ORANGE; Testis YELLOW; Muscles GREEN; immune cells LIGHT BLUE; Immune Organs DARK BLUE; Respiratory System PINK; Pancreas and Islets DARK PINK; Adrenal Gland and Adrenal Cortex LIGHT PINK; Thyroid and Fetal Thyroid SEPIA; Others WHITE. The edges have been drawn between tissue nodes sharing: a) 30 or more genes; b) 20 or more genes; c) 5 or more genes. d) the number of edges as a function of tissue-selective genes shared by two or more tissues. The tissue indexes are reported in Table 1.
