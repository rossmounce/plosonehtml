                Figure 1.  Locations of the populations and distributions of the ADH1B rs1229984 and rs3811801 derived allele frequencies.Note: The map of part A showed the ethnic phyla in East Asia, and part B displayed the locations of the populations. Populations marked with stars were cited from literature [31], [34]. The codes of the star-marked populations are ISO639-3 codes. Populations shown by gray spots are previously published by our team [12]. The colorful spots are the populations collected in this study. Part C is the distribution of the derived allele frequency of rs1229984 (ADH1B*47His). Part D is the distribution of the regulatory region polymorphism rs3811801 derived allele frequency.
