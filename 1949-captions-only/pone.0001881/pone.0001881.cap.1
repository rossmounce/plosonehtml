Populations marked with stars were cited from literature <a href="#pone.0001881-Goedde1">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001881-Ma1">[34]</a>. The codes of the star-marked populations are ISO639-3 codes. Populations shown by gray spots are previously published by our team <a href="#pone.0001881-Han1">[12]</a>. The colorful spots are the populations collected in this study. Part C is the distribution of the derived allele frequency of rs1229984 (<em>ADH1B*47His</em>). Part D is the distribution of the regulatory region polymorphism rs3811801 derived allele frequency.</p>
