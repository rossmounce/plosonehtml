                Figure 3.  Haplotype frequencies of the ADH1B gene region including the regulatory region.Note: the SNPs in the haplotypes are rs2066701-rs2075633-rs4147536-rs1229984-​6810842-rs3811801,corresponding to SNPs 6–11 in Figure 2. Phyla, PN: Papuan-New Guinean, AU: Austronesian, TK: Daic, AA: Austro-Asiatic, TB: Tibeto-Burman, HM: Hmong-Mien, SN: Sinitic Han, KJ: Korean-Japanese, AT: Altaic (inland), UR: Uralic, AF: Afro-Asiatic. The patterns of the non-East Asian phyla (UR, AF, PN) are quite different from those of East Asian phyla. The patterns of the phyla in East Asia can be classified into four groups as the colors shown in the left side bar. The frequency data for all haplotypes are in Table S1.
