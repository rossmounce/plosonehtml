Plots in part A were based on the <em>ADH1B</em> haplotypes frequency data in <a href="#pone-0001881-g003">Figure 3</a>. Plots in part B used the haplotype frequency data of the whole <em>ADH</em> region in <a href="#pone-0001881-g002">Figure 2</a>. In part A, an ethnic related distribution is obvious, while in part B the distribution shows no strong distinct clusters corresponding to ethnicity.</p>
