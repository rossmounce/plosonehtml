                Figure 6.  Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) and Relative Extended Haplotype Homozygosity(REHH) of Altaic, Han and Hmong populations.Note: Colorful lines are data of core haplotype (3)AGA, and gray lines are data of other haplotypes. The data following the population codes are frequencies of the core haplotype in the populations. EHH and REHH of the other populations are in Figure S1.
