Populations from most areas of East Asia have been significantly selected for except those in the southwest. In part B, the selection area was compared with the high frequency areas of two <em>ADH1B</em> SNPs. The dotted line encloses the region in which the <em>ADH1B*47His</em> frequency is &gt;40%, and the broken line encloses the region in which the <em>ADH1B rs3811801</em> frequency is &gt;40%. The distributions of <em>ADH1B*47His</em> and selection area differ from each other, which indicates that they are unrelated. The high frequency area of rs3811801 derived allele is included in the selection area, indicating the possible effect of this allele in the selection on the <em>ADH1B</em> gene.</p>
