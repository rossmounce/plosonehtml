                Figure 8.  Significance P values of the positive selection on the ADH1B gene in East Asia.Note: The map of part A displayed the distribution of the significance P value of the positive selection on the ADH1B gene. Populations from most areas of East Asia have been significantly selected for except those in the southwest. In part B, the selection area was compared with the high frequency areas of two ADH1B SNPs. The dotted line encloses the region in which the ADH1B*47His frequency is &gt;40%, and the broken line encloses the region in which the ADH1B rs3811801 frequency is &gt;40%. The distributions of ADH1B*47His and selection area differ from each other, which indicates that they are unrelated. The high frequency area of rs3811801 derived allele is included in the selection area, indicating the possible effect of this allele in the selection on the ADH1B gene.
