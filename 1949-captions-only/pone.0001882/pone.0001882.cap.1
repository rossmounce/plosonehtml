Panel A: Dendrogram representing the result of hierarchical clustering of leukemia samples using DNA methylation data. The scale on the left represents the correlation distance metric. Panel B: Heatmap of top 150 genes from the first principal component of correspondence analysis, which separated ALL samples from AML. Genes are shown on the rows and samples on the columns, and data were row-centered. Low values corresponding to greater methylation are represented in blue and high values corresponding to less methylation are in red. Panel C: Hierarchical clustering of leukemia samples using H3K9 acetylation ChIP-chip. Panel D: Heatmap of top 100 genes from the first principal component of correspondence analysis, which separated ALL samples from AML. Low values corresponding to less H3K9 acetylation are represented in blue and high values corresponding to greater H3K9 acetylation are in red.</p>
