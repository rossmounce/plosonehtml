Panel A: Plot of differences between sample means (x axis) vs. âˆ’log<sub>10</sub> p values (y axis), illustrating the two criteria required for significance in HELP data. Blue dots represent genes with p&lt;0.02 and a difference in sample means&gt;1.5. Panel B: Heatmap of gene signature identified using gene expression arrays. Genes are shown on the rows and samples on the columns, and data were row-centered. Low values of gene expression are represented in blue and high values are in red. Panel C: Heatmap of gene signature identified using H3K9 acetylation arrays, constructed as described for Panel A. Low values corresponding to less H3K9 acetylation are represented in blue and high values corresponding to greater H3K9 acetylation are in red. Panel D: Heatmap of gene signature identified using DNA methylation (HELP) arrays, constructed as described for Panel A. Low values corresponding to greater methylation are represented in blue and high values corresponding to less methylation are in red. Panel E: Venn diagram illustrating overlap between the three gene signatures.</p>
