Median correlation was r = 0.84. Panel B: Comparative fold difference in mRNA levels (y axis) as detected by gene expression arrays and qRT-PCR for five genes that displayed differential H3K9 acetylation but had not been detected as differentially expressed on the microarrays. Panels C and D: Correlation for those same 5 genes between H3K9 acetylation levels (y axis) and gene expression levels (x axis) measured by either gene expression arrays (panel C) or qRT-PCR (panel D). Correlation between H3K9 acetylation and gene expression was significantly higher when the latter was measured by qRT-PCR, indicating that H3K9 acetyl ChIP-chip could predict genuine differences in gene expression levels that were missed by gene expression arrays, probably due to relative compression of the signal on the gene expression arrays as demonstrated in panel B.</p>
