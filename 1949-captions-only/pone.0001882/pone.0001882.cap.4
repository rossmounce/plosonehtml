Panel B: Smoothed histogram of gene-by-gene correlations between log(HpaII/MspI) values and H3K9 acetylation, showing a positive correlation between the two measures for many of the genes, which translates into a negative biological correlation (<em>i.e.</em> higher promoter methylation correlates with lower promoter H3K9 acetylation). Panel C: Graphical representation of the data from all three platforms for one of the cases (AML.2) as custom tracks in the UCSC genome browser<a href="#pone.0001882-Kent1">[40]</a>. Four representative genes are shown here to illustrate the correlation between the three platforms. H3K9 acetylation data (in blue) is represented as the ratio of the signal between the H3K9 acetyl channel and the input channel; DNA methylation (in red) is represented as log(HpaII/MspI), so that a negative deflection corresponds to a methylated HpaII fragment while a positive one corresponds to a hypomethylated fragment; finally, gene expression data (in green) is represented as median-centered log<sub>2</sub> of RMA-normalized intensities.</p>
