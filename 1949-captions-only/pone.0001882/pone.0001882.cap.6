Panel B: Table showing the median, maximum and minimum values in fold difference for the three groups, reflecting how a subgroup of genes that is missed by gene expression arrays but identified by DNA methylation display comparable differences in gene expression levels when using a more sensitive technique such as qRT-PCR.</p>
