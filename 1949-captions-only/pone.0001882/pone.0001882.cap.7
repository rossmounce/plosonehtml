                Figure 7.  Integration of data from all three platforms enhances the biological information captured.Panel A: Bar graph comparing the significance level of enrichment (y axis: âˆ’log(p-value)) for genes within specific canonical pathways for the integrated analysis and the individual platforms. Panel B: Bar graph showing a subset of canonical pathways that were detected as significant by the integrated analysis, but that had been missed by the individual platforms.
