The incision point is indicated as a dot. Lateral bars indicate the position of the electrodes. (b) Table recapitulating the tested voltages, survival after electric shocks and the success rate concerning GFP-expression. (c) Example of a coronal section through a GFP-electroporated forebrain at the level of the lateral ventricle (LV) at 2dpe. A section containing relatively few positive cells was selected to simplify identification of the different cell types. The section was counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to facilitate orientation. Strongly GFP positive cells with the morphology of radial glia are visible in the ventricular zone (arrowheads), while cells with generally lower levels of GFP expression are organized mainly parallel to the ventricular surface (see high magnification of the boxed area in the insert). Direction of processes is suggestive of migration towards the dorso-lateral edge of the ventricle (arrow). (d) Evaluation of electroporation efficiency. Histological sections were grouped in bins representing sections containing more or less than 200 cells. 75.8% of the sections were classed in the higher group. ST: striatum. Scale bar: 40 µm; 20 µm in the insert.</p>
