(b) At 2dpe radial glia cells are generally surrounded by cells showing weaker and variable GFP expression. These have no contact with the LV and show a generally tangential orientation (arrowheads). (c) Labelling of GFP positive cells in the ventricular zone (c) with anti-RC2 antibody (c') verifies their radial glia identity (merged image in c”). Mark that weaker GFP expressing neuronal precursors are not labelled for RC2, as expected. (d) a sub-population of GFP+ radial glia cell (d) expresses the mitotic marker PH3 (d'; 1dpe), merge in (d”) and are therefore proliferating. (e) Nuclear RFP-expression (in red) in combination with PSA-NCAM staining (green, antibody MenB) in the RMS at 4dpe identifies offspring of the electroporated cells as migratory neuronal precursors. (f) At 4dpe large numbers of GFP expressing cells arrive in the OB via tangential migration in the RMS. (g) At 6dpe GFP positive cells switch to radial migration and invade the granule cell layer (GCL). (h) After 15dpe large amounts of GFP expressing cells with complex morphologies can be identified in the OB. Higher magnification shows that these cells have neuronal morphology of the granule (i) and periglomerular (j) type. RMS: rostral migratory stream; GL: glomerular layer; LV: lateral ventricle. Scale bar: 20 µm in a,b,e; 15 µm in c,d; 300 µm in f,g; 100 µm in g; 30 µm in i,j.</p>
