                Figure 3.  Expression of hNCAM140 and p21 in the postnatal forebrain.(a–h) Expression of human NCAM 140 in wt (a–d) and NCAM deficient (e–h) mice. Co-electroporation of GFP (a) with a hNCAM-140 expression plasmid (b, hNCAM recognized by specific antibody 123C3) in the wildtype context led to slightly enhanced PSA expression in the PSA positive SVZ (c). In contrast, hNCAM140 expression in the NCAM-deficient context (f) induced specific expression of PSA (g, merge in h) in the transfected cells. (i–k) Phenotypic consequences of hNCAM140 expression in wt mice. Co-electroporation of hNCAM140 and GFP (j) induced an increase in cells with the characteristics of migratory neuronal precursors (arrowheads) in relation to radial glia cells. (k) Quantification, open bars: radial glia; black bars: neuronal precursors – control: radial glia 12.23 +/− 0.22 cells per section, neuronal precursors 8.8 +/− 0.24 cells per section, at least 3 sections per animal, n = 6; hNCAM140: radial glia 6.59 +/− 0.06 cells per section, p&lt;0.0001, neuronal precursors 25.53+/− 0.36 cells per section, p&lt;0.0001, at least 3 sections per animal, n = 7). (l) Overexpression of p21 via postnatal electroporation induced a significant reduction of proliferation in the affected cells as measured by BrdU incorporation [12] (control: 25.66 +/− 2.02%, at least 4 sections per animal, n = 7; p21: 7.79 +/− 2.15%, at least 4 sections per animal, n = 5; p&lt;0.001). Scale bar: 10 µm a–h, 30 µm in i,j.
