(B) Dose-response curve of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxicity in SK-N-BE cells. Cells were plated and challenged by oxidative stress for 24 h and cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay; *p&lt;0.05; ***p&lt;0.001 vs control group (0 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or 6-OHDA), Dunnett's <em>post-hoc</em> test. (C) Western blot assessing TAT-α-syn 0.5 µM and TAT-DJ-1 3 µM availability inside SK-N-BE cells. Cells were plated and incubated in presence of TAT-α-syn or TAT-DJ-1 for the reported time intervals. To demonstrate equal gel loading, α-tubulin immunoreactivity is also presented. (D) Protective effect of TAT-delivered α-syn and (E) TAT-delivered DJ-1 against oxidative stress. Cells were incubated with increasing amounts of TAT-α-syn or TAT-DJ-1 2–4 h before the toxic treatment and 24 h later cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 vs control group at the same TAT-α-syn or TAT-DJ-1 concentration (CT, corresponding also to 0 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or 6-OHDA), Tukey's <em>post-hoc</em> test. (F) Toxicity of micromolar amounts of TAT-α-syn. Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of TAT-α-syn for 24 h and cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay. **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (CT, corresponding to 0 µM TAT-α-syn), Dunnett's <em>post-hoc</em> test. (G) Amyloid aggregation of TAT-α-syn 3 µM was detected by thioflavin-T staining after 24 h incubation; a) SK-N-BE control cells; b) SK-N-BE cells incubated with TAT-α-syn 3 µM. The arrows indicate intracellular thioflavin-T-positive inclusions (magnification 20X).</p>
