                Figure 2.  DJ-1 downregulation by siRNA increases SK-N-BE susceptibility to oxidative challenge.(A) Preliminary Western blotting experiment aimed at modulating DJ-1 expression by siRNA. Two different siRNAs were tested by exposing SK-N-BE cells to 20 and 100 nM siRNA for 72 h. Each blot lane is representative of a triplicate assay in the same experiment (B) Western blotting assessing the specificity of the proposed silencing method. SK-N-BE cells were exposed for 72 h to β-actin targeted pre-designed siRNA and to a siRNA negative control (CT-) with no sequence similarity to DJ-1 mRNA. Each blot lane is representative of a triplicate assay in the same experiment. (C) Silencing DJ-1 expression by siRNA. Cells were incubated with 100 nM pre-annealed siRNA targeted to DJ-1. Starting 24 h after transfection, DJ-1 protein level was assessed by Western blotting and quantified by a digital image analyzer. The quantification (D) is representative of one of three independent experiments (n = 3 for each point); *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle) at the same time, Tukey's post-hoc test. (E) DJ-1 silencing was also independently assessed by immunocytochemisty: a) SK-N-BE control cells exposed for 72 h to siRNA lipid vehicle alone (magnification 10X); b) SK-N-BE cells incubated for 72 h with 100nM DJ-1 siRNA (magnification 10X). (F) DJ-1 downregulation increases cell susceptibility to oxidative stress. Cells were silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h, then the oxidative stimuli were added for a further 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay. CT-: siRNA negative control; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone); °p&lt;0.05; °°p&lt;0.01 vs siRNA lipid vehicle+H2O2 or 6-OHDA alone; Tukey' post-hoc test. (G) Specific effect of DJ-1 on oxidative stress response. Cells were silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h, then TAT-DJ-1 3 µM or a recombinant DJ-1 at the same concentration (rDJ-1, a purified form of DJ-1 without the TAT sequence) was added 2 h before the oxidative challenge. After 24 h, cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay. DJ-1 silencing in the same experiment was confirmed by Western blotting (not shown); **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), °p&lt;0.05; °°p&lt;0.01 vs siRNA lipid vehicle+H2O2 or 6-OHDA alone; Tukey's post-hoc test.
