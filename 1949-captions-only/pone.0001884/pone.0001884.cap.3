Then, the oxidative stimuli were added for a further 24 h. In the DJ-1 silenced group, before TAT-α-syn treatment, DJ-1 expression was silenced for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay; **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), Tukey's <em>post-hoc</em> test. (B) Cells were incubated with siRNA negative control (CT-) or with DJ-1 siRNA for 72 h. Then, in the DJ-1 siRNA cells, TAT-DJ-1 3 µM was added to culture medium and after 2 h TAT-α-syn was added to the indicated groups. After 2 h, the oxidative challenge was then carried out for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by erythrosine-dye exclusion assay. **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), Tukey's <em>post-hoc</em> test; #p&lt;0.01, two-way ANOVA for TAT-α-syn (x) TAT-DJ-1. (C) Cells were silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h, then TAT-α-syn 0.5 µM was added for 24 h. In the TAT-DJ-1 group, TAT-DJ-1 was added to the culture medium 2 h before TAT-α-syn. CT-: siRNA negative control; **p&lt;0.01 vs control group (no TAT-α-syn added); °p&lt;0.05 vs TAT-α-syn alone; Tukey's <em>post-hoc</em> test; #p&lt;0.01, two-way ANOVA for TAT-α-syn (x) TAT-DJ-1. (D) Western blot showing TAT-α-syn higher-molecular-weight immunoreactive bands after DJ-1 silencing. Cells were silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h, after that TAT-α-syn 0.5 µM was added for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to gradient SDS-PAGE (5–12%). The arrow indicates the monomeric form of TAT-α-syn around 20 KDa, while the bracket the presence of higher-molecular-weight immunoreactivity. Also α-tubulin immunoreactivity is shown to demonstrate equal gel loading.</p>
