                Figure 4.  TAT-DJ-1 affects HSP70 mRNA expression.A) Digital image of a capillary electrophoresis assessing the effect of DJ-1 on HSP70 mRNA expression. Cells were either incubated with TAT-DJ-1 for 24 h or silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h. Then total mRNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed and amplified to detect HSP70 (550 bp band) and aldolase-A (180 bp band), used as internal control. The bar graph (B) shows the RT-PCR assay values and is representative of one of three independent experiments (n = 4 for each group). CT-: siRNA negative control; **p&lt;0.01 vs control (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), Tukey's post-hoc test. (C) Western blot showing HSP70 protein expression. Cells were incubated with either TAT-DJ-1 for 24h or DJ-1 siRNA for 72 h, then harvested for Western blotting. The bar graph (D) shows the calculated values normalized to α-tubulin as internal control and is representative of one of three independent experiments (n = 3 for each group); ***p&lt;0.001 vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), Tukey's post-hoc test. (E) Western blotting assessing HSP70 expression level in SK-N-BE cells incubated with negative control TAT-fused proteins. Cells were incubated with TAT-GFP or TAT-α-syn(1-97) for 24 h and then harvested to perform HSP70 immunodetection.
