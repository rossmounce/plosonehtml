                Figure 5.  DJ-1 silencing prevents TAT-α-syn-mediated HSP70 upregulation.(A) In the DJ-1 silenced group, SK-N-BE cells were silenced for DJ-1 expression for 72 h, TAT-α-syn 0.5 µM was then added for 24 h and finally cells were harvested for Western blotting to assess HSP70, DJ-1 and TAT-α-syn immunoreactivity. The graph (B) shows blot quantification for HSP70 and DJ-1 expression using α-tubulin as internal standard (n = 3 for each group); **p&lt;0.01, vs control group (siRNA lipid vehicle alone), Tukey's post-hoc test.
