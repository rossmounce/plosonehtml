The symbol ⊙ stands for “antagonizes”. The free, soluble form of α-syn can be committed to aggregation and the related toxicity by DJ-1 downregulation (<em>upper pathway</em>), maybe through α-syn impaired degradation. In this situation, cell response to oxidative stress is impaired by DJ-1 deficiency, but also by α-syn aggregation-dependent indirect toxicity that prevents the protein neuroprotective role and stops α-syn-mediated HSP70 upregulation at protein level. In addition, α-syn aggregation has a direct toxic effect, probably pro-oxidant, that increases cell damage and triggers a positive feedback loop that promotes further α-syn aggregation. In non-aggregating conditions (<em>lower pathway</em>), in the presence of oxidative stress α-syn promotes cell survival and HSP70 up-regulation (Albani et al., 2004 <a href="#pone.0001884-Albani1">[36]</a>). In this situation, wild type DJ-1 contributes to keep α-syn in the soluble form. HSP70 is also a downstream molecular target of DJ-1, that increases HSP70 expression preventing α-syn aggregation <a href="#pone.0001884-Zhou2">[33]</a>. DJ-1 pathogenic mutations might impair this function, leading to cell damage through the upper pathway.</p>
