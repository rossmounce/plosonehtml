<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p3"></a><p>The primary endpoint was successful thyroid ablation defined as 1) absence of abnormal uptake in a diagnostic whole body <sup>131</sup>I scan, 2) undetectable (less than 1 ng/mL) serum thyroglobulin during both levothyroxine administration and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, and 3) absence of palpable metastases in the neck. All three conditions had to be met for ablation to be considered as successful. We performed a second efficacy analysis (not specified by the study protocol) taking absence of abnormal activity in a diagnostic radioiodine scan as the sole criterion for successful ablation. Other endpoints in the study were tolerability of radioiodine treatment, the number of subsequent radioiodine treatments required to complete thyroid ablation, absorbed activity in the neck following <sup>131</sup>I administration, and the time spent in an isolation unit following radioiodine administration.</p>

The study was approved by an ethics committee of Helsinki University Central Hospital, and conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

<h4>Study procedures</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation was achieved by abstaining from levothyroxine administration for a minimum of four weeks prior to radioiodine administration. A diet containing low iodine content was recommended prior to ablation. The median serum TSH concentration was 69.0 mU/L (range, from 6 to 1180 mU/mL) when measured 0 to 14 days prior to <sup>131</sup>I administration (in the 1100 MBq group the median was 67.5 mU/L, range, from 18 to 1180 mU/L; in the 3700 MBq group the median was 71 mU/L, range, from 6 to 242 mU/L; <em>P</em> = .55); 146 (91%) patients had TSH 30 mU/L or higher.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a><p>A small <sup>131</sup>I activity (7.4 MBq, 0.2 mCi) was administered orally four to five weeks after thyroidectomy to measure radioiodine accumulation in the thyroid bed. The percentage uptake was measured with an Atomlab 950 Thyroid Uptake System (Biodex, New York, USA) 48 hours after administration of 7.4 MBq radioiodine. The ablative radioiodine activity (1100 MBq or 3700 MBq) was administered approximately five days later as oral capsules that were swallowed with water.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p3"></a><p>The patients stayed in a hospital isolation unit after radioiodine administration until the radiation protection limit required by the Finnish authorities was met; the remaining whole body <sup>131</sup>I activity was required to be less than 400 MBq corresponding to approximately 15 µSv/h dose equivalent rate measured with a Geiger counter at one meter distance. Oral levothyroxine replacement therapy was initiated four days after radioiodine administration and adjusted individually based on serum TSH and free triiodothyronine measurements.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p4"></a><p>A whole-body iodine scan and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed four to seven days after ablative <sup>131</sup>I administration using a double-headed Toshiba 7200 A/UI gamma camera (Toshiba Medical Systems, Nasu, Japan) equipped with high energy parallel-hole collimators. SPECT was done in 139 (87%) cases; it was not performed in 21 cases due to logistic reasons. The effective radioiodine activity half-life (T½)<sub>eff</sub> in the neck was calculated using the physical (T½<sub>phys</sub>, eight days) and biological (T½<sub>biol</sub>) half-lives. The absorbed radiation dose to the thyroid bed was calculated in 121 (76%) cases <a href="#pone.0001885-Thomas1">[12]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p5"></a><p>The success of ablation was assessed four to eight months after <sup>131</sup>I administration. Serum thyroglobulin levels were measured both while the patient was receiving levothyroxine and during TSH stimulation, which was achieved by abstaining from levothyroxine administration or by administering recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) for patients judged to tolerate abstaining from levothyroxine poorly (n = 11; four in the low activity arm and seven in the high activity arm). Serum thyroglobulin was analyzed using immunofluorometry (normal reference range, &lt;24 ng/mL). In addition, a diagnostic whole body scan, carried out under TSH stimulation, was performed after administration of 185 MBq of <sup>131</sup>I. It was not performed when serum thyroglobulin was detectable (≥1 ng/mL) while the patient was receiving levothyroxine.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p6"></a><p>Radioiodine ablation was repeated whenever serum thyroglobulin was detectable or when abnormal uptake was present in the thyroid bed or at extrathyroid sites in a diagnostic radioiodine scan. The repeat administered activity was the same as the first administered activity except for 15 patients in the 1100 MBq group who received 3700 MBq and for one patient in the 3700 MBq group who received 2960 MBq. When a second repeat treatment was required, all but two patients received at least 3700 MBq.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p7"></a><p>Adverse effects related to radioiodine administration, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0, were recorded by the study participants on structured forms approximately four days before <sup>131</sup>I administration, and four to seven days, two to three weeks, and three months following treatment.</p>


<h4>Statistical methods</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>We estimated that one radioiodine treatment would be successful in 40% of the study participants allocated to the 1100 MBq group and in 60% of those allocated to the 3700 MBq group. Using power (1-β) 80%, α .05 and a one-sided test, 160 participants were to be recruited to the study. An interim safety analysis was carried out when 80 patients had been evaluated for efficacy; a stopping rule was to be applied if a 50% difference in the success rate was observed in favor of the higher administered activity group.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a><p>Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle with superiority approach. Frequency tables were analysed with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing. Distributions of the days spent in an isolation unit were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Confidence intervals for one proportion were calculated using normal approximation. A formal meta-analysis was conducted using pooled data from three previous studies and the present study. The combined relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval for the RR were estimated with a fixed effect assumption. The heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated using Cochran's test. All <em>P</em> values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses carried out using an SAS® version 8.2 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>

<h4>Patients</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>Eighty-one patients received 1110 MBq of <sup>131</sup>I and 79 received 3700 MBq as the ablative activity (<a href="#pone-0001885-g001">Figure 1</a>). Radioiodine was administered a median of 38 days after thyroidectomy (range, 27 to 124 days; 93% received treatment within six weeks from surgery).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a><p>All entered patients were eligible. Two patients in the 3700 MBq group could not be evaluated for completeness of thyroid ablation; one refused evaluation and another one died of acute myeloid leukaemia three months after radioiodine administration.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p3"></a><p>Randomization was balanced (<a href="#pone-0001885-t001">Table 1</a>). Three patients in the 1110 MBq group and one in the 3700 MBq group had no <sup>131</sup>I uptake in the neck with undetectable serum thyroglobulin following thyroidectomy; none had <sup>131</sup>I uptake comparable to an intact thyroid. Two patients allocated to the 3700 MBq group received only 2220 MBq due to a high radioiodine uptake in the thyroid bed after administration of a 7.4 MBq test dose (14.6% and 18.5% of the administered activity accumulated in the thyroid bed in these two cases).</p>
