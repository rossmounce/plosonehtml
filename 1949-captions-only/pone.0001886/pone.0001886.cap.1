                Figure 1.  mRNA levels of cytokines and extracellular matrix molecules in BM-MSCs and fibroblasts.Total RNA extracted from BM-MSCs (MSC) or dermal fibroblasts (FB) treated under hypoxic conditions was analyzed by Real-Time PCR for mRNA expression of genes as indicated in the figure. Fold changes vs dermal fibroblasts are shown. Data are mean±SD; n = 3; *P&lt;0.05 vs FB. KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; TGFb1, Transforming growth factor-β1; Ang, angiopoietin; SDF1, stromal cell-derived factor-1; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; SCF, stem cell factor; EPO, erythropoietin; TPO, thrombopoietin; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor; MCP1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; MIG, monokine induced by gama interferon.
