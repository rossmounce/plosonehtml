Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments and results from one of them are shown. The abbreviations are donated in <a href="#pone-0001886-t002">Table 2</a>. (B) ELISA measurement of cytokines in murine fibroblast- or BM-MSC- conditioned medium under hypoxic conditions. Data are expressed as meansÂ±SD (n = 3, *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01). PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Other abbreviations can be found in the legend for <a href="#pone-0001886-g001">Figure 1</a>.</p>
