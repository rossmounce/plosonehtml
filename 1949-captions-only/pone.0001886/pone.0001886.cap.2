                Figure 2.  Protein levels of cytokines in BM-MSC-conditioned medium.(A) Antibody-based protein array analysis human dermal fibroblast (FB)- or BM-MSC-conditioned medium under hypoxic conditions. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments and results from one of them are shown. The abbreviations are donated in Table 2. (B) ELISA measurement of cytokines in murine fibroblast- or BM-MSC- conditioned medium under hypoxic conditions. Data are expressed as meansÂ±SD (n = 3, *P&lt;0.01). PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Other abbreviations can be found in the legend for Figure 1.
