(B&amp;C) Percentages of cells in wound after FACS analysis (n = 5~6, *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05). (D) Representative images of confocal microscopy of day 7 wounds treated with vehicle medium, concentrated fibroblast- or BM-MSC-conditioned medium after immunostaining for CD68 (red). Nuclei were stained blue with Hoechst. scale bar, 20 Âµm.</p>
