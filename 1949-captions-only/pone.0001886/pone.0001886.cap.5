                Figure 5.  Analysis of cells in wounds.(A) FACS analysis of cells derived from each wound indicated that wounds treated with concentrated BM-MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-M) at 7 or 14 days had increased percentages of CD4/80 positive monocytes/macrophages compared to wounds treated with vehicle control medium (vehicle-M) or concentrated fibroblast-conditioned medium (FB-M). (B&amp;C) Percentages of cells in wound after FACS analysis (n = 5~6, *P&lt;0.05). (D) Representative images of confocal microscopy of day 7 wounds treated with vehicle medium, concentrated fibroblast- or BM-MSC-conditioned medium after immunostaining for CD68 (red). Nuclei were stained blue with Hoechst. scale bar, 20 Âµm.
