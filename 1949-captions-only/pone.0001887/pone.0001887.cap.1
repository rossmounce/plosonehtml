HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 1) for one hour with additional washing and incubated overnight. Medium from control VSV infected cells and VSV infected cells treated with 10 µM, 5 µM, 2.5 µM, and 1 µM of MG132 were used for plaque assay to detect virus replication. Results represent average data of two experiments. (B) Western blotting with anti-P-protein antibodies. HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 5) for 1 hour. After changing the medium, MG132 was added in the indicated concentrations and the cells were incubated for additional 4 h. Total protein extracts (5 µg) were analyzed with anti-P-protein Abs. Keratin 18 (K18) was a protein loading control. Intensity of each band was estimated with ImageJ software to calculate percentage of viral protein synthesis inhibition. (C) Immunoprecipitation of S<sup>35</sup> labeled P-protein. HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 5) for 4 h. Proteins were labeled with S<sup>35</sup> methionine/cysteine for last 30 min of infection and VSV P-protein was precipitated with specific antibodies from cytoplasmic protein extracts and analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. MG132 was added for 4 h in indicated concentrations. (D) Immunoprecipitation of S<sup>35</sup> labeled N-protein. The protein extracts described in panel C were precipitated with antibodies specific to N-protein. Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography.</p>
