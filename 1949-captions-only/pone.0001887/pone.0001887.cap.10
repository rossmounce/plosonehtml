                Figure 10.  Inhibition of VSV replication in MG132 treated fibroblasts depends on GCN2.(A) Attenuation of translation in MG132- (MG), and Bortezomib (Bort) -treated cells is GCN2-dependent. Control wt GCN2+/+ MEF and GCN2−/− MEF, or cells treated with proteasome inhibitors for 4 h were incubated with S35-methionine/cysteine for 30 min. Protein synthesis was estimated by electrophoresis and autoradiography. (B) Western immunoblotting analysis of GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to MG132. 10 µg of protein extracts from control and MG132 treated cells were analyzed with indicated antibodies. Efficiency's fold of eIF2α phosphorylation (Phosp(x)) was estimated with ImageJ software. (C, D) Replication of VSV was not affected by proteasome inhibitors in GCN2−/− MEF. Proteasome inhibitors were added 1 h after infection with VSV (MOI = 1) and cells were incubated over night. Replication of VSV was estimated by titration in two experiments (C), or by Western immunoblotting with anti P-VSV protein Abs (D). Tubulin (tub) is a protein loading control.
