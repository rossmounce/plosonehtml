                Figure 11.  Different activation of eIF2α phosphorylation by VSV and poliovirus infections.HeLa cells were infected with VSV for 4 h, infected with poliovirus for 4 h, or treated with 1 µM of thapsigargin for 1 hour. Cytoplasmic protein extracts from these and control cells were analyzed with Abs against eIF2α and phosphorylated form of eIF2α (panel A). Same membrane was analyzed with Abs against VSV P- protein and poliovirus capsid proteins (panel B).
