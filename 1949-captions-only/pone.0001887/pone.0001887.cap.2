HeLa cells were infected with VSV MOI = 1. The incubation of the cells with virus lasted one hour with additional washing. 5 µM of MG132 were added to cells at time of infection (15 h), 1 h (14 h), 2 h (13 h), and 3 h (12 h) after VSV infection. Results represent average data of two experiments. (B) VSV mRNA synthesis in MG132 treated cells. Northern blot analysis of 10 µg of total RNA from VSV (MOI = 5) infected for 4 h cells treated with MG132 at a time of infection (4 h), or 1 h after infection (3 h). Hybridization with P<sup>32</sup> labeled P-protein cDNA probe. RNA loading was standardized by hybridization with GAPDH-gene probe. The hybridization signal of each band was estimated by ImageJ software to calculate percentage of RNA synthesis inhibition. (C) Immunoblotting with anti P-protein Abs. HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 1) and treated with 5 µM of MG132 as indicated in panel A. Total protein extracts (5 µg) from these cells were purified and tested by Western blotting with anti-P-protein Abs. Keratin 18 was a protein loading control. (D) Immunoprecipitation of S<sup>35</sup>-methionine labeled P-protein from VSV infected cells. HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 5) and treated with 5 µM of MG132 at time of infection (4 h), 1 h after infection (3 h), or 2 h after infection (2 h). After 4 h of infection the cells were incubated with S<sup>35</sup>-methionine/cysteine for 30 min. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were purified and VSV P-protein was precipitated with anti-P-protein Abs. The efficiency of P-protein synthesis was estimated by electrophoresis and autoradiography.</p>
