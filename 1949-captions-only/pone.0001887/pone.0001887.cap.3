Titration of VSV from the medium of overnight infected HeLa cells. VSV infection (MOI = 1) for one hour was substituted by the regular medium with indicated concentration of proteasome inhibitors. VSV was titrated by plaque assay after overnight growth. (B) Analysis of P-protein synthesis in the cells treated with proteasome inhibitor 1. HeLa cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 5) for 4 h and treated with proteasome inhibitor 1 (PI) or MG132 (MG) at a time of VSV infection. The total protein extracts (5 µg) from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-P-protein Abs. The concentrations of proteasome inhibitors varied from 5 to 20 µM. Keratin 18 (K18) was a protein loading control. (C) Bortezomib suppressed VSV replication. HeLa cells were infected with VSV, treated with Bortezomib (100 nM) and MG132 (5 µM), and analyzed as described in panel B. K18 was a protein loading control.</p>
