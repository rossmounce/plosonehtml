After replacement of medium, the accumulation of virus in medium was estimated by titration. (B) MG132 inhibits TNF-specific degradation of IκBα. Control HeLa cells and HeLa cells pretreated with 5 µM MG132 for 2 h were incubated with 1 ng/ml of human TNF for 20 min. 10 µg of total protein extracts were analyzed with anti-IκBα Abs. (C) HeLa cells and HeLa cells pre-treated with MG132 were infected with poliovirus (MOI = 5) for 1 h. After medium replacement, protein extracts were collected at different times of infection. The accumulation of poliovirus capsid proteins was tested in Western blotting experiments from 10 µg of protein extracts. (D) The protein extracts described in section B were tested with anti-proteins 3C and 3A Abs. The accumulation of poliovirus proteins 3C, 3A and 3AB were detected in 10 µg of protein extracts. (E) Bortezomib treatment attenuated poliovirus replication. HeLa cells were pretreated with Bortezomib for 2 h, then infected and analyzed as described in panels C and D. K18 was a loading control. Hsp70 is a control of Bortezomib activity.</p>
