Hybridization with GAPDH gene was a RNA loading control. (B) The inhibition of proteasome activity does not affect the entrance of poliovirus into the cells. MG treated and control HeLa cells were pre-incubated with S<sup>35</sup>-labeled poliovirus (MOI = 100) for 1 h at 4°C. To estimate adsorption background, cells (ad) were washed with cold PBS. Virus internalization (in) was estimated by accumulation of S<sup>35</sup>-labeled poliovirus capsid proteins during additional 1 h incubation at 37°C. S<sup>35</sup>-labeled proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. (C) Poliovirus capsid proteins accumulate slower in MG132 pretreated cells. The extracts from poliovirus-infected cells were analyzed with anti-poliovirus capsid Abs. Control or MG132 2 h pretreated cells were incubated with poliovirus (MOI = 5) for 1 h. Virus containing medium was washed out and cells were incubated for indicated time. 10 µg of protein from infected cells were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-poliovirus capsid Abs.</p>
