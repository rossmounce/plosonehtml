                Figure 6.  Proteolytic cleavage of p65-RelA and eIF4G occurred later during poliovirus infection of the cells with inhibited proteasome activity.HeLa cells and MG 132 2 h pretreated HeLa cells were infected with poliovirus (MOI = 5) for 1 h. After change of medium, total protein extracts were collected every hour and tested with anti-p65-RelA C-terminus specific Abs (A) or with anti eIF4G N-terminus specific Abs (B). 10 Âµg of protein were tested in Western blotting experiments.
