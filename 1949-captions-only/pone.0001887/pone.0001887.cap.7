                Figure 7.  Poliovirus protein synthesis was delayed in MG132-pretreated cells.Control HeLa cells and HeLa cells pre-treated with MG132 for 2 h were infected with poliovirus (MOI = 5) for 2, 3 and 4 h. All cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine free medium supplemented with S35-methionine/cysteine for last 30 min before harvesting. To study general translation, 10 µg of cytoplasmic protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography (A). To study poliovirus capsid protein accumulation, capsid proteins were precipitated by specific Abs from 100 µg of cytoplasmic protein extracts and analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography (B).
