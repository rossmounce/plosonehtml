All cells were incubated with S<sup>35</sup> methionine/cysteine for last 30 min before the protein extracts purification. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. (B) Cytoplasmic protein extracts from control, VSV infected, and MG treated cells were precipitated with anti-actin Abs, and the complexes were purified on protein A agarose. S<sup>35</sup> labeled actin was analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. (C) Cytoplasmic S<sup>35</sup>-labeled protein extracts from MG-treated and poliovirus-infected cells were precipitated with anti-actin Abs and analyzed as described in panel B. All protein bands' intensity was detected by ImageJ software to calculate percentage of protein synthesis inhibition.</p>
