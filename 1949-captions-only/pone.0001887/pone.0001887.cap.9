Control HeLa cells, cells treated for 4 h with MG132, and 4 h VSV-infected cells were incubated for last 30 min with S<sup>35</sup> methionine/cysteine. Cytoplasmic proteins were precipitated with anti-hsp70 and anti-P-VSV Abs. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. (B) MG132 stimulated eIF2α phosphorylation. HeLa cells were treated with 1 µM of thapsigargin for 1 h and with 5 µM of MG132 for 4 h. 10 µg of protein extracts were analyzed with Abs specific for eIF2α and eIF2α- phosphate (eIF2α-P). Hsp70 is a marker of MG132 activated stress. Keratin 18 (K18) is a loading control.</p>
