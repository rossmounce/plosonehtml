                Figure 1.  Effect of tetracyclines following peripheral scrapie infection.PrPSc immunohistochemistry of brain tissue (A), spinal cord (B), spleen (C), and Peyer's patches (D) of hamsters at the terminal stage of disease after intramuscular inoculation of 263K scrapie infected brain homogenate alone at 10−4 dilution. All samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. The pictures are representative of the immunohistochemical results for all terminal animals. Magnification scale bar: 1 mm (A), 250 µm (B-C-D). (E) Survival of hamsters injected intramuscularly with a 10−4 dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed one hour later by a single intramuscular dose of doxycycline (10 mg/kg) at the same site. Untreated animals (□), Doxycycline (•). (F) Survival of hamsters injected intramuscularly with a 10−4 dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed one hour later by an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg of tetracycline, doxycycline or minocycline, then every 2 days up to 40 days post-infection. Untreated animals (□), Tetracycline (▵), Doxycycline, (•), Minocycline (○). (G) Survival of hamsters injected subcutaneously with a 10−4 dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed four days later by an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg of doxycycline, then every 2 days up to 44 days post-infection. Untreated animals (□), Doxycycline, (•).
