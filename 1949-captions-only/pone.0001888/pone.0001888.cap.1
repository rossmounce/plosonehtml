All samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. The pictures are representative of the immunohistochemical results for all terminal animals. Magnification scale bar: 1 mm (A), 250 µm (B-C-D). (E) Survival of hamsters injected intramuscularly with a 10<sup>−4</sup> dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed one hour later by a single intramuscular dose of doxycycline (10 mg/kg) at the same site. Untreated animals (□), Doxycycline (•). (F) Survival of hamsters injected intramuscularly with a 10<sup>−4</sup> dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed one hour later by an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg of tetracycline, doxycycline or minocycline, then every 2 days up to 40 days post-infection. Untreated animals (□), Tetracycline (▵), Doxycycline, (•), Minocycline (○). (G) Survival of hamsters injected subcutaneously with a 10<sup>−4</sup> dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed four days later by an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg of doxycycline, then every 2 days up to 44 days post-infection. Untreated animals (□), Doxycycline, (•).</p>
