                Figure 2.  Effect of tetracyclines following intracerebral scrapie infection.(A) Immunoblot analysis of 263K scrapie infected brain homogenate (1%) after incubation in the absence (lane 1), or presence of doxycycline (lanes 2, 3), liposome-containing doxycycline (lane 4) and empty liposomes (lane 5), followed by proteinase K digestion. The blots were probed with the antibody 3F4 (1:5,000). Molecular mass markers are indicated to the left. (B) Cerebral cortex of hamster four days after an intracerebroventricular infusion of 25 µg/20 µl liposome-containing doxycycline. Doxycycline-related fluorescence appears to be partly diffused in the neuropil and partly associated with nerve cell bodies and processes (arrows) and glial cells. Magnification scale bar: 50 µm. (C) Survival of hamsters injected intracerebrally with a 10−4 dilution of 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate followed 60 days later by a single intracerebroventricular infusion of 25 µg/20 µl doxycycline or minocycline-containing liposomes. By this time 50% of infected animals showed initial clinical symptoms of disease, i.e. hyperreactivity to tactile and acoustic stimulations. Untreated animals (□), LipoDoxycycline, (•), LipoMinocycline (○).
