                Figure 1.  Summary of the strategy used to search the P. falciparum genome for serpentine receptor-like genes.The genomic sequences available from PlasmoDB (release 4.3) were analyzed in three steps. In the first step, we used a local ORF-finder program to predict intronless ORFs longer than 500 nucleotides (green box) and searched these ORFs for seven transmembrane 7-TM proteins by using the TMHMM 2.0 transmembrane prediction program. In the second step, P. falciparum manually annotated genes (pink box) available in PlasmoDB were analyzed using TMHMM2.0 to select 7- and 8-TM proteins. In the third step, we show the automatically predicted sequences used in the work of Inoue et al. [17], which were retrieved by the authors from PlasmoDB (blue boxes â€“ Glimmer, Gene finder and FullPhat are gene-finding programs) followed by their analysis with HMMTOP transmembrane prediction program to select 7-TM proteins (gray box). As our third step we reanalyzed the 69 proteins described by Inoue et al. [17], now using TMHMM2.0. The redundant 7- and 8-TM proteins retrieved by the three steps were eliminated and the sequences were subsequently classified according to the criteria set listed on the bottom of the figure. The graphic on the left shows the absolute number of sequences for each criteria class during the analysis, emphasizing the four P. falciparum serpentine receptor-like proteins. SP, signal peptide; AS, anchor signal; AP, apicoplast signal.
