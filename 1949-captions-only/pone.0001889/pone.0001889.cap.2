                Figure 2.  Characteristics of serpentine receptor-like proteins (SRs) of diverse malaria parasites species.Each one of the four P. falciparum serpentine receptors sequences are grouped with its orthologs and differently colored: yellow, PF11_0321 (PfSR1); blue, PFL0765w (PfSR10); green, PFD1075w (PfSR12); pink, MAL7P1.64 (PfSR25). Identification numbers for most of the non-falciparum sequences are not available since these genes are not annotated in the databases; therefore, we point out the contig sequences from where they were retrieved with the nucleotides that comprise the selected gene. Scale-sized diagrams of genomic structure of serpentine receptor genes (Gene Model) and of predicted protein features are shown. Transmembrane domains predicted by TMHMM2.0 are shown in dark-green boxes, with the number of amino acids in the beginning and in the end of the 7-TM core. Potential signal peptides predicted by SignalP3.0 are shown as blue boxes with the potential cleavage sites. In the N-terminal domains of some of these receptors there are repetitive stretches of negatively charged residues (Glu/Asp-rich domains) or positively charged residues (Lys-rich domains). The position of potential N-glycosylation sites is pointed by red-arrows.
