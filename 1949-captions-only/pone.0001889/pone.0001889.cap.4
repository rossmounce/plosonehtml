Branches supporting bootstrap values &gt;90% are in orange, &gt;70% in green and &gt;50% in blue (1000 replicates). Scale bar: 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site. Accession numbers shown correspond to the following databases: GenBank for non-<em>Plasmodium</em> members of lung 7TM receptor family; ToxoDB for <em>T. gondii</em>; PlasmoDB for Plasmodium species. Identification number for non-falciparum <em>Plasmodium</em> species are shown as contig numbers, and complete protein sequences are available in <a href="#pone.0001889.s002">Data S2</a>.</p>
