                Figure 4.  Phylogenetic tree of the evolutionary conserved “lung 7TM receptor” family.The tree was compiled using the aligned amino acid sequences of the 7TM conserved core region from several eukaryote organisms. Branches supporting bootstrap values &gt;90% are in orange, &gt;70% in green and &gt;50% in blue (1000 replicates). Scale bar: 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site. Accession numbers shown correspond to the following databases: GenBank for non-Plasmodium members of lung 7TM receptor family; ToxoDB for T. gondii; PlasmoDB for Plasmodium species. Identification number for non-falciparum Plasmodium species are shown as contig numbers, and complete protein sequences are available in Data S2.
