                Figure 5.  Expression of serpentine receptors in the P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cycle.Parasites cultures were synchronized with sorbitol and total RNA extracted from six time points during the 48 h intraerythrocytic cycle. Each RNA sample, converted to cDNA, was used as a template in a Real-time PCR reaction done in triplicates. The fluorescence values for each transcript were normalized by the ones of the 18S transcript and the expression is related to the one of the late trophozoite stage (LT). Error bars represent standard errors of two independent experiments. ER – early ring, LR – late ring, ET – early trophozoite, LT – late trophozoite, ES – early schizont, LS – late schizont.
