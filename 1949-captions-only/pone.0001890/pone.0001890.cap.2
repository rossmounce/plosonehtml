                Figure 2.  Methylation status of HPP1, p16, and RUNX3.Normalized methylation values (NMVs) of HPP1 (1A), p16 (1B), and RUNX3 (1C) are shown. p: p-value of t-test. NMVs of genes in progression-positive cases [P(0-2) and P(0-2)+P(2-4) for the 2-year and 4-year models, respectively] were significantly higher than NMVs of progression-negative (P(2-4)+P(4-)+NP and P(4-)+NP for the 2-year and 4-year models, respectively).
