Based on this ROC curve, we chose an output value cutoff point defining the HR group to maximize specificity (&gt;90%, <em>red area</em>) rather than sensitivity. B: For the 4-year model, the best AUROC (0.7910) was achieved using 3 parameters: SL, pathology, and MI. Based on this ROC curve, we selected an output value cutoff point defining the LR group to maximize sensitivity (&gt;90%, <em>red area</em>) rather than specificity.</p>
