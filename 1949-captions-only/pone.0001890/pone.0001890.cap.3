                Figure 3.  Best ROC curves of 2- and 4-year prediction models.A: For the 2-year prediction model, the best AUROC (0.8387) was obtained using 4 parameters: SL, pathology, p16, and methylation index (MI). Based on this ROC curve, we chose an output value cutoff point defining the HR group to maximize specificity (&gt;90%, red area) rather than sensitivity. B: For the 4-year model, the best AUROC (0.7910) was achieved using 3 parameters: SL, pathology, and MI. Based on this ROC curve, we selected an output value cutoff point defining the LR group to maximize sensitivity (&gt;90%, red area) rather than specificity.
