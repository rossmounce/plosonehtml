                Figure 4.  Combining the 2-year and 4-year prediction models.A and B: 2×2 contingency tables for the 2-year and 4-year prediction models, respectively. Cutoff points for the 2-year and 4-year model output values were chosen to attain 90% specificity and sensitivity, respectively, as described above (Figure 3). C: combined 3×3 contingency table. Red and blue cross-lines correspond to red and blue lines in A and B. P(0-2), P(2-4), P(4-): specimens obtained from progressor patients &lt; = 2 years, 2–4 years, or &gt;4 years prior to progression, respectively. NP: specimens derived from non-progressor patients with more than a 4-year follow-up period.
