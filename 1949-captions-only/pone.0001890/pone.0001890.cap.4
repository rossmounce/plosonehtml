Cutoff points for the 2-year and 4-year model output values were chosen to attain 90% specificity and sensitivity, respectively, as described above (<a href="#pone-0001890-g003">Figure 3</a>). C: combined 3×3 contingency table. Red and blue cross-lines correspond to red and blue lines in A and B. P(0-2), P(2-4), P(4-): specimens obtained from progressor patients &lt; = 2 years, 2–4 years, or &gt;4 years prior to progression, respectively. NP: specimens derived from non-progressor patients with more than a 4-year follow-up period.</p>
