                Figure 5.  Progression-free survival in the 3 risk tiers.Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each of the 3 risk tiers are shown. The 2-year progression-free survival rates of HR, IR, and LR were 45%, 88.5%, and 97.8%, respectively. Four-year progression-free survival rates were 35%, 63.5%, and 93.5%, respectively. Differences in progression-free survival among these 3 risk tiers were statistically significant (log-rank test).
