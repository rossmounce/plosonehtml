                Figure 6.  Changes in 3-risk-group prediction during follow-up.The horizontal axis represents the time interval preceding the date of progression or nonprogression. Among 62 patients, 27 patients underwent biopsies at multiple timepoints before progression. Each green bar represents the follow-up period of each patient, and each circle shows the timing of biopsies and the risk level prediction (designated by each circle's color). Vertically overlapped circles with arrows indicate multiple tissue specimens obtained at a single endoscopy, while horizontally overlapped circles (no arrows) indicate specimens obtained at temporally neighboring but separate endoscopies.
