Among 62 patients, 27 patients underwent biopsies at multiple timepoints before progression. Each <em>green bar</em> represents the follow-up period of each patient, and each <em>circle</em> shows the timing of biopsies and the risk level prediction (designated by each circle's color). Vertically overlapped circles <em>with arrows</em> indicate multiple tissue specimens obtained at a single endoscopy, while horizontally overlapped circles (no arrows) indicate specimens obtained at temporally neighboring but separate endoscopies.</p>
