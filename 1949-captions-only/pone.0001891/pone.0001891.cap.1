                Figure 1.   E.coli cells in biofilms differing in organization display differential survival after colistin treatment.A). Microtitre plate biofilm assay with the parental E. coli SAR18 in the presence and absence of the de-repressed IncF plasmid and mutants in the IncF plasmid (traD, traX, and traQ,) stained with crystal violet. Values are normalized with respect to the mean of SAR18 F+ (traD) set as 100% B). A microtitre plate biofilm antibiotic tolerance assay, in which the indicated strains were challenged with 10 µg/ml colistin for 24h and bacterial survival determined by viable count as indicated by white bars. Untreated control is indicted by black bars. C). Microtitre plate biofilm antibiotic tolerance assay, in which the indicated strains were challenged with 0.3 µg/ml ciprofloxacin for 24h and bacterial survival determined by viable count as indicted by white bars. Untreated control is indicated by black bars. D). The survival of planktonically cultured stationary phase E. coli SAR18 in the presence and absence of the de-repressed IncF plasmid and mutants in the IncF plasmid (traD, traX, and traQ,) after a 24 h 10 µg/ml colistin or 0.3 µg/ml ciprofloxacin challenge. Black bars indicate CFU in untreated culture while white bars indicate treated cells as specified in the figure.
