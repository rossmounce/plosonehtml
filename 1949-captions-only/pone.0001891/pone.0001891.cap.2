                Figure 2.  The increased survival of cells in biofilms is dependent on a functional basS gene.A). Microtitre plate biofilm assay with the parental E. coli AF504 in the presence and absence of the de-repressed IncF plasmid and mutants in the IncF plasmid (traD,), insertion deletions of the basS and basR genes, and the curli overproducing opmR strain stained with crystal violet. Values are normalized with respect to the mean of AF504 F+ (traD) set as 100%. B). A microtitre plate biofilm antibiotic tolerance assay in which the indicated strains were challenged with 10 Âµg/ml colistin for 24 h and bacterial survival determined. The fraction untreated/treated is indicated for each strain.
