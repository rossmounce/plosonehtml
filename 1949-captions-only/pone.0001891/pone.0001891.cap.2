Microtitre plate biofilm assay with the parental <em>E. coli</em> AF504 in the presence and absence of the de-repressed IncF plasmid and mutants in the IncF plasmid (<em>traD,</em>), insertion deletions of the <em>basS</em> and <em>basR</em> genes, and the curli overproducing <em>opmR</em> strain stained with crystal violet. Values are normalized with respect to the mean of AF504 F<sup>+</sup> (<em>traD</em>) set as 100%. B). A microtitre plate biofilm antibiotic tolerance assay in which the indicated strains were challenged with 10 Âµg/ml colistin for 24 h and bacterial survival determined. The fraction untreated/treated is indicated for each strain.</p>
