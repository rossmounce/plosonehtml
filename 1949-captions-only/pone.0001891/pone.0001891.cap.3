                Figure 3.  A colistin tolerant subpopulation is formed in mature E .coli flow-chamber biofilms.CLSM micrographs of a mature AF504 gfp/F+ biofilm after A) control, B) 6.5h; and C) 24h 25 µg/ml of colistin challenge. The biofilm was stained with PI at the specified time points before image acquisition. Scale bars represent 50 µm D) CLSM micrograph showing the location of live (green) and dead (red) cells in E. coli AF504 gfp/F+ biofilm grown for 48 h and then exposed to 10 µg/ml of colistin for 24 h, an overview image taken with a 10× objective. Scale bar represent 300 µm. E) CLSM 3D micrograph image taken with a 40× objective of a single microcolony in the AF504 gfp/F+ biofilm. F) CLSM micrograph 3D structure showing the spatial distribution of living (green) and dead (red) cells of E. coli AF504 gfp/F+ in a 6 days old biofilm, that has been grown in antibiotic free media for 2 days and then exposed to 25 µg/ml colistin for 24 h and then switched back to antibiotic free medium.
