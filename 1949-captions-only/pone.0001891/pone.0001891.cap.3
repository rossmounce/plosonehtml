Scale bars represent 50 µm D) CLSM micrograph showing the location of live (green) and dead (red) cells in <em>E. coli</em> AF504 <em>gfp/</em>F<sup>+</sup> biofilm grown for 48 h and then exposed to 10 µg/ml of colistin for 24 h, an overview image taken with a 10× objective. Scale bar represent 300 µm. E) CLSM 3D micrograph image taken with a 40× objective of a single microcolony in the AF504 <em>gfp/</em>F<sup>+</sup> biofilm. F) CLSM micrograph 3D structure showing the spatial distribution of living (green) and dead (red) cells of <em>E. coli</em> AF504 <em>gfp/</em>F<sup>+</sup> in a 6 days old biofilm, that has been grown in antibiotic free media for 2 days and then exposed to 25 µg/ml colistin for 24 h and then switched back to antibiotic free medium.</p>
