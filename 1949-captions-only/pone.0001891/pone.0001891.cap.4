                Figure 4.  The colistin tolerance is influenced by biofilm structural organization and tolerance induction is basS dependent.A). CLSM micrographs showing the distribution of live and dead cells in biofilms of the SAR18/F+ (top left panel), SAR18/F+(traD) (top right panel), SAR18/F+(traX) (bottom left panel), and PHL628 gfp ompR234 (bottom right panel) after 24h challenge by 10 µg/ml colistin. Scale bars represent 50 µm. B). CLSM micrographs showing the distribution of live and dead cells in biofilms of AF504 gfp/F+ (left panel) and AF574 gfp basS::Kan/F+ (right panel) mutant showing the basS dependence of subpopulation formation after 24h challenge by 10 µg/ml colistin. Overview images taken with a 40× objective. Scale bars represent 100 µm.
