Fluorescence of <em>yfbE</em>-<em>gfp</em> transcriptional fusion expressed in bacteria grown in N-minimal media, pH 7.7, containing 38 mM glycerol with either 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (black bars), or 10 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 100 µM Fe<sup>3+</sup> (white bars) Data shown are the average of three experiments. Mean fluorescence units were detected by using a Becton Dickingson FACS Vantage SE cell sorter. Strains harboring the <em>attB</em>::<em>bla-rrnB</em>P1::<em>gfp</em>mut3b or the pJBA113 vector alone demonstrated constitutive fluorescence and no fluorescence in all growth conditions, respectively. B). Fraction of fluorescent cells in the microtitre plate biofilm assay with the parental <em>E. coli</em> AF504 in the presence and absence of the de-repressed IncF plasmid and mutants in the IncF plasmid (<em>traD,</em>), and the reciprocal insertion deletions of the <em>basS</em> and <em>basR</em> genes, harboring the <em>yfbE</em>-<em>gfp</em> transcriptional fusion. The threshold for GFP fluorescence was cells with a value above 600 arbitrary units. 99% of the constitutively expressing cells were above this threshold while 96% of the negative control was below. C). CLSM micrographs showing the expression of the <em>yfbE</em>-<em>gfp</em> transcriptional fusion in flow chamber biofilms of AF504/F<sup>+</sup> (left panel) and AF574 <em>basS/</em>F<sup>+</sup> (right panel). Green indicates GFP expressing cells all other cells appear red from treatment with SYTO62.</p>
