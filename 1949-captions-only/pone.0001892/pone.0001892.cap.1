                Figure 1.  Evolution of cooperation in real social networks.Black lines: Density of cooperators as a function of b, obtained by numerical simulations on the email (left) and PGP (right) networks. Red lines: Density of cooperators on random networks generated from the original ones by a rewiring procedure that preserves the degree distribution(see text). The equilibrium densities of cooperators have been obtained by averaging 500 generations, after a transient time of 750 generation steps. Each point corresponds to an average over 1000 independent simulations with 50% cooperators and defectors as the initial condition.
