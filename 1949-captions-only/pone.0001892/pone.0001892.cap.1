Red lines: Density of cooperators on random networks generated from the original ones by a rewiring procedure that preserves the degree distribution(see text). The equilibrium densities of cooperators have been obtained by averaging 500 generations, after a transient time of 750 generation steps. Each point corresponds to an average over 1000 independent simulations with 50% cooperators and defectors as the initial condition.</p>
