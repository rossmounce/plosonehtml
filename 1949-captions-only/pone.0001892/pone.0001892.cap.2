                Figure 2.  Community structures of the email and PGP networks.Top: Community structures of the email (A) and PGP (B) networks. Nodes correspond to communities (where size is proportional to their number of members) and links represent cross-connections (where width corresponds to the number of inter-connetions). Bottom: Typical examples of the communities detected in the email (C) and PGP (D) networks. Solid links join nodes of the community, dashed links join this community with others.
