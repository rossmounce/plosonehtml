In case A communities have been built as Erdos-Renyi random graphs (p<sub>intra</sub> = 1.5×10<sup>−1</sup>), and the probability of interconnection between communities (p<sub>inter</sub>) is 5×10<sup>−2</sup>. Communities in case D are constructed as independent scale-free networks (Barabasi-Albert with k<sub>0</sub> = 3), and after they have been sparsely interconnected with (p<sub>inter</sub> = 1.5×10<sup>−5</sup>). Case B has been obtained from D by increasing the probability p<sub>inter</sub> to 3.5×10<sup>−4</sup>, and case C corresponds to A reducing this probability to 7.5×10<sup>−4</sup>. Simulations have been performed as indicated in <a href="#pone-0001892-g001">Fig. 1</a>.</p>
