                Figure 3.  Evolution of cooperation in four synthetic networks.Cases A and D correspond, respectively, to the synthetic classes of networks akin to the email and PGP real networks. In case A communities have been built as Erdos-Renyi random graphs (pintra = 1.5×10−1), and the probability of interconnection between communities (pinter) is 5×10−2. Communities in case D are constructed as independent scale-free networks (Barabasi-Albert with k0 = 3), and after they have been sparsely interconnected with (pinter = 1.5×10−5). Case B has been obtained from D by increasing the probability pinter to 3.5×10−4, and case C corresponds to A reducing this probability to 7.5×10−4. Simulations have been performed as indicated in Fig. 1.
