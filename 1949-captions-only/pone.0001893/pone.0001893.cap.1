                Figure 1.  Urine-induced USVs in mice were species-specific, but not strain-specific in Exp. 1.(A) Fresh female mouse urine induced USVs in male mice, fresh female rat urine or human urine did not induce USVs in male mice. C57BL/6 mouse urine similarly induced USV in CD1 x 129 (C57â€“C129), vice versa (data not shown). (B) Dirty female cages induced a few USVs in male mice, and male mouse urine (second column) did not induce USVs in female mice.
