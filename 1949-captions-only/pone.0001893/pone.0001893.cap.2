                Figure 2.  Direct contact of males with females induced high levels of USV production in males, while odor and sight of the whole female mice body did not in Exp. 2.(A) Schematic representation of the experimental procedures. The experiments were divided into 4 stages. They are separated by cages, dark shutter, transparent shutter, and no shutter (free contact), respectively. (B) No USVs were detected when male and female were separated in two cages or in one cage but separated by a dark shutter. A few USVs were detected once the dark shutter was replaced by a transparent shutter. Full USV production was observed when the shutter was removed and male and female mice were free for direct contact. (C) USV burst out after two mice had direct contact. Representative USVs are shown.
