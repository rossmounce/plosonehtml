The experiments were divided into 4 stages. They are separated by cages, dark shutter, transparent shutter, and no shutter (free contact), respectively. (B) No USVs were detected when male and female were separated in two cages or in one cage but separated by a dark shutter. A few USVs were detected once the dark shutter was replaced by a transparent shutter. Full USV production was observed when the shutter was removed and male and female mice were free for direct contact. (C) USV burst out after two mice had direct contact. Representative USVs are shown.</p>
