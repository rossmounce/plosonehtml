(B) No USVs were detected when male were silenced by simple mouth taping; but when females were silenced, many USVs were detected, suggesting that USVs recorded during male-female interaction were emitted from the male. (C) After aggressive attacks from male mice, females produced a few squeaks, observed on sonograms as harmonic dense-layered calls. (D) When reunited with another female after 4 hour's separation as described before <a href="#pone.0001893-Moles3">[73]</a>, female mice emitted frequency-modulated USVs as those produced by male mice during male-female interaction. Three representative broken USVs were shown.</p>
