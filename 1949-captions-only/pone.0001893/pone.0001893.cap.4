OVX: female mice were paired with male mice 21 days after ovariectomy. OVX-H: like OVX, but the mice received hormone replacement (three injections, 2 of estrogen first and followed by 1 of progesterone) on three consecutive days. WT: untreated wild-type female mice. Upper panel: total USVs; bottom panel: frequency-modulated USVs. There were slightly more male USVs to both groups of OVX female mice.</p>
