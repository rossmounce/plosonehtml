                Figure 5.  Coincidence of mounting behaviour and production of USVs by males and squeaks by females in Exp. 4.Coincidence of mounting behaviour and production of USVs and squeaks were analyzed by comparing the sonograms of mouse calls before, during, and after mounting behavior with simultaneously recorded videos as described in Materials and Methods. (A) Representative USVs emitted by male mice before mounting. (B) Male USVs shifted from “sine” to “step-like” USVs after initiation of male- mounting-female. (C) Coincidence of frequency-modulated “step-like” USVs emitted by male mice and squeaks produced by female mice during mounting/intromission. (D) No call was detected within about 10 sec after the end of mounting (full data not shown).
