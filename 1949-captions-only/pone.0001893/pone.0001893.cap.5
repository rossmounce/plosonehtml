(A) Representative USVs emitted by male mice before mounting. (B) Male USVs shifted from “sine” to “step-like” USVs after initiation of male- mounting-female. (C) Coincidence of frequency-modulated “step-like” USVs emitted by male mice and squeaks produced by female mice during mounting/intromission. (D) No call was detected within about 10 sec after the end of mounting (full data not shown).</p>
