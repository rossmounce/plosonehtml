A smaller, non-significant reduction was seen in flat USVs. Each bar shows the mean number of USVs in each condition. (B) Time courses of flat USVs in wild-type and M5 KO mice. Flat USVs in M5 KO mice were reduced at min 3 and 5. (C) Time courses of frequency-modulated USVs in wild-type and M5 KO mice. Frequency-modulated USVs were also reduced at min 3 and 5. The white and the dashed bars represent wild-type and knockout mice, respectively.</p>
