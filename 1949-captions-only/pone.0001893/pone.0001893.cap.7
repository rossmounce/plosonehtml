                Figure 7.  USVs were lost in most of the M2 male KO mice tested, but not in M4 KO and D2 mice in Exp. 4.(A) Frequency-modulated USVs were markedly reduced in M2 KO mice during male-female interactions. (B) Frequency-modulated USVs were not changed in M4 KO mice. (D) No frequency-modulated or total USV changes were detected between wild-type and D2 KO male mice. The white and the dashed bars represent wild-type and knockout mice, respectively.
