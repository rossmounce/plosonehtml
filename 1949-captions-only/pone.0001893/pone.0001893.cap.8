                Figure 8.  Amphetamine administration dose-dependently stimulated USV production in isolated male mice, and altered the USVs produced during male-female interaction in Exp. 5.(A) D-amphetamine sulfate was given to the mice at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 6 mg/kg (i.p.), respectively. Amphetamine only stimulated spontaneous USV production in male wild-type mice (CD1x129) (triangles). D-amphetamine sulfate (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) did not induce USVs in isolated female or M5 KO mice (since no USV was induced, related data were omitted). As compared with saline injection on test day 1, during male-female interaction, male mice produced fewer USVs after 2 or 6 mg/kg amphetamine injection (i.p.) in males (squares, p&lt;0.05). (B) Comparison of bandwidths of sex- and amphetamine-induced USVs in males. One hundred of USVs were randomly selected from large scale of USVs induced by sex and amphetamine (5 mg/kg), respectively. Bandwidths were obtained by measuring the upper frequencies and lower frequencies with Avisoft SASLab Pro software according to the instruction. Amphetamine apparently induced more frequency-modulated USVs (bandwidth &gt;5-kHz) than sex (p&lt;0.01, Ï‡-test). Amph = amphetamine.
