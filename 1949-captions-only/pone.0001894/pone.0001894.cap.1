Titanium clips were used to ligate recipient artery. After transplantation the recipient carotid was cut in the middle and the cerebral circulation was restored in the allograft. Three weeks later, a S670 stent (3.0 diameter×12 mm length) was deployed in the middle of the allograft. (D) Photo of microsurgery showing the bypass allograft anastomosed to native common carotid. (E) Angiogram of the allograft after stent implantation. (F) Patent allograft (without contrast dye) showing the radiopaque stent located in the middle of the graft. A stent is also present in the contralateral native carotid artery.</p>
