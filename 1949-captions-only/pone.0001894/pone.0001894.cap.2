C: Dual labeling for the macrophage marker RAM-11 (brown) and the SMC marker α-SMA (blue) demonstrates similar basal NI location of macrophages with overlying SMCs. Note that larger allograft stent NI has a large number of cells that do not label with either of these cell markers. D: Labeling for the endothelial specific marker GSL I-B4 (brown) shows immunopositive cells within the NI, particularly in the stent NIs of the allograft and native artery. Orange arrow heads delineate the internal elastic lamina.</p>
