The yellow color is due to auto fluorescence of elastic fibers. Male cells (recipient origin) were detected in NI of female donor allograft without (A) or with stent (B). Male native carotid artery medial cells are SRY positive (C) and were used as positive controls. D: Arcturus HistoGene stained allograft arterial wall before and after NI microdissected by LCM. NI = neointima. E: Sample Q-PCR standard curve for GAPDH. F: Percent contribution of recipient cells to the NI in allograft body, allograft stent, and native vessels.Bars represent means±SEM.</p>
