                Figure 5.  Differentiation of circulatory cells in vitro.A: Rabbit PBMCs maintained in culture for 7 days: DiI-acLDL labeling (red, left panel); GSL I-B4 labeling (green, middle panel); Merged image showing both DiI-acLDL uptake and GSL I-B4 labeling in individual cells (yellow, right panel). B: Rabbit PBMCs after 28 days in culture: DiI-acLDL labeling is absent (red, left panel), α-SMA expression is evident (green, middle panel), and some cells that do not express α-SMA express the macrophage marker, RAM-11 (red, right panel). For both A and B: blue DAPI nuclear counterstain and ×400 magnification.
