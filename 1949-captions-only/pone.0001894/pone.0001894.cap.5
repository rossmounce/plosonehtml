B: Rabbit PBMCs after 28 days in culture: DiI-acLDL labeling is absent (red, left panel), α-SMA expression is evident (green, middle panel), and some cells that do not express α-SMA express the macrophage marker, RAM-11 (red, right panel). For both A and B: blue DAPI nuclear counterstain and ×400 magnification.</p>
