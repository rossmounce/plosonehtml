Asterisks mark the peripheral LBD neuron; Arrowheads mark positions of the Inka cell. C) <em>c929</em>(<em>dimm</em>) signals are highly congruent with DIMM antibody staining. Arrows mark the few DIMM cells that are not <em>c929</em>-positive. DIMM-positive neurons are also <em>c929</em>-positive in (D) the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS), and (E) in the sixteen cells of corpora cardiaca (CC) within the Ring Gland.</p>
