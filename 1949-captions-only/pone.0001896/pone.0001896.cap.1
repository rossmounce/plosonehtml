                Figure 1.  DIMM immunostaining and its correspondence to c929-GAL4 expression.A) Anti-DIMM staining in St 17 wild type embryo and (B) in a dimm mutant (Rev8/Rev4). Asterisks mark the peripheral LBD neuron; Arrowheads mark positions of the Inka cell. C) c929(dimm) signals are highly congruent with DIMM antibody staining. Arrows mark the few DIMM cells that are not c929-positive. DIMM-positive neurons are also c929-positive in (D) the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS), and (E) in the sixteen cells of corpora cardiaca (CC) within the Ring Gland.
