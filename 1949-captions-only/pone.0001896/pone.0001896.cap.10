                Figure 10.  The quantitative representation of DIMM co-expression among sets of cells expressing any of 22 different peptide markers in the 100 hr AEL larval CNS.16 of 22 peptide markers display DIMM co-expression in more than 40% of the peptide-expressing cells (horizontal bar). The degree of overlap is categorized as “Complete”, “Partial”, or “None”, as described in the text.
