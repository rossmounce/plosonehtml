They are distinguished by their <span class="underline">Large</span> size (long axon morphology and extensive arborizations), periods of <span class="underline">Episodic release </span>high levels of secretory activity and by specific modifications of secretory products (<span class="underline">Amidation</span> of <span class="underline">Peptides</span>). The top row compares two peptidergic neuronal classes in the <em>Drosophila</em> CNS, using the example of neuropeptide PDF expression. The DIMM-positive Neurosecretory Neuron produces high levels of amidated PDF. The DIMM-negative Interneuron produces more modest levels of amidated PDF, or more likely of Gly-extended (non-amidated) PDF. DIMM neurons express peptides that can be amidated. They may also express peptides or protein hormones that are not amidated, as illustrated for the example of Neurosecretory Neurons that express both CCAP (potentially amidated) and Bursicon (a non-amidated, glycoprotein hormone). Neurosecretory Neurons that lack DIMM express only non-amidated secretory products (bottom left). Motorneurons that co-release glutamate (Glu) with the non-amidated peptide Proctolin (bottom right) also lack DIMM. See text for further details.</p>
