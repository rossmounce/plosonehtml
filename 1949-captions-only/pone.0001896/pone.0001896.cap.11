                Figure 11.  Classification of peptidergic neurons in Drosophila according to several physical and biochemical attributes based on the observations reported in this manuscript.We propose that DIMM neurons are peptidergic Neurosecretory Neurons whose distinctive properties are enumerated by the acronym LEAP. They are distinguished by their Large size (long axon morphology and extensive arborizations), periods of Episodic release high levels of secretory activity and by specific modifications of secretory products (Amidation of Peptides). The top row compares two peptidergic neuronal classes in the Drosophila CNS, using the example of neuropeptide PDF expression. The DIMM-positive Neurosecretory Neuron produces high levels of amidated PDF. The DIMM-negative Interneuron produces more modest levels of amidated PDF, or more likely of Gly-extended (non-amidated) PDF. DIMM neurons express peptides that can be amidated. They may also express peptides or protein hormones that are not amidated, as illustrated for the example of Neurosecretory Neurons that express both CCAP (potentially amidated) and Bursicon (a non-amidated, glycoprotein hormone). Neurosecretory Neurons that lack DIMM express only non-amidated secretory products (bottom left). Motorneurons that co-release glutamate (Glu) with the non-amidated peptide Proctolin (bottom right) also lack DIMM. See text for further details.
