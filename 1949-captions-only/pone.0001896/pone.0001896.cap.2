                Figure 2.  A map of DIMM-expressing neurons in the 100 hr AEL larval CNS.Top: schematic of the CNS along with cross-sections of each segmental neuromere to illustrate dorsal-ventral positions of DIMM-expressing neurons. Details on positions of individual DIMM-positive neurons in the brain hemispheres are given in later figures. Bottom: use of EVE and EN expression patterns to assign DIMM neurons to individual segments. Left: triple-labeled St. 17 embryonic CNS stained for EVE (blue) EN (green) and DIMM (red); middle: double-labeled 100 hr AEL larval CNS stained for EVE (green) and DIMM (red); right: schematic of an idealized abdominal segment showing the interpretation used to assign segmental values to DIMM neurons in the VNC.
