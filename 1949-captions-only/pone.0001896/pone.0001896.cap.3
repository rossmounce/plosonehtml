(A) In the dorsal aspect, Cell #1 (MP0) lies adjacent to the CP1 secondary neuroblast lineage. (B) at a mid-dorsal position, Cell #8 is adjacent to DPMm1/2, Cells 12 and 13 are adjacent to DPLl3/4 and cells 6–7 are adjacent to CM1; (C) more ventral, Cell #14 is found close to DPLc1-4, Cell #15 close to DPL3/4 and Cell #17 close to BLD3/4.
