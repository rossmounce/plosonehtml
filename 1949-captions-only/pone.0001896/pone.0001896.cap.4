Overlap of DIMM and different peptides varies from complete to virtually none. (A) An example of a peptide system that exhibits complete overlap with DIMM: Hugin-YFP-neurons in S1 and S2 are all strongly DIMM-positive. (B) Of several COR-immunopositive neurons in the CNS, several are DIMM positive. (C–E). Examples of peptide systems that exhibit partial overlap with DIMM. (C) The most strongly stained Ast-A-positive neurons are also DIMM-positive. (D) Likewise, the most strongly stained CCAP-expressing neurons are DIMM-positive (arrow), while the weakly stained cell is DIMM-negative (arrowhead). (E) The dTK system shows only a single DIMM-positive cell (arrow) among many DIMM-negative dTK-expressing cells (arrowheads): it is the largest and most strongly-stained. (F) An example of little or no overlap with DIMM: anti-proctolin antibodies label several hundred neurons in the CNS, of which only one cell type–the Ap-let neuron <a href="#pone.0001896-Park1">[35]</a> is weakly stained by proctolin antibodies but is strongly DIMM-positive. NPs: neuropeptides.</p>
