                Figure 5.  Neuropeptide identities of DIMM cells in the SEG and Thoracic regions of the larval CNS.Neuromeres S2 and T3 are shown as representative of the two regions. The adjoining pie charts indicate the percentages of DIMM-positive neurons in all SEG and thoracic segments respectively that were associated with a specific peptide marker.
