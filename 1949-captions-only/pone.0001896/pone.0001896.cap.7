                Figure 7.  Neuropeptide identities of DIMM cells in the brain.Top diagram illustrates the positions of cells along the medial-to-lateral axis; bottom diagram indicates the positions of cells along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Cells are numbered arbitrarily, as listed in Table 1. The adjoining pie chart indicates the percentage of DIMM-positive neurons that was associated with a specific peptide marker.
