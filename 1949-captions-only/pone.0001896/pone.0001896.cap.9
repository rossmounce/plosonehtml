                Figure 9.  Schematics describing the distribution of cells scored positive for each of the 24 peptide markers found in the 100 hr AEL larval CNS.If the peptides are potentially amidated, this is noted below each marker name in parentheses (amidated). Blue cells are marked by the peptide marker, but lack DIMM staining; Red cells co-express DIMM. The proctolin schematic does not show the complete complement of ~400 proctolin-immunoreactive neurons. Schematics are distributed with ones showing greater percentages of DIMM co-expression are towards to the top of the figure and ones showing lesser percentages are towards the bottom.
