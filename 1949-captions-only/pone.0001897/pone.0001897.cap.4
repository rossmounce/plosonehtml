                Figure 4.  Directionality of the brain activation.Areas showing a negative ( dark blue, p&lt;0.01, blue, p&lt;0.005) or positive (orange, p&lt;0.01, yellow, p&lt;0.005) impulse response on average across 10 seconds in responses to all emotional sounds for the 15 novices and 15 experts at z = 31 compared to baseline (figs. A–D) and z = 13 (figs. E–H) (voxel-by-voxel paired t test compared to 0, corrected at p&lt;0.01).
