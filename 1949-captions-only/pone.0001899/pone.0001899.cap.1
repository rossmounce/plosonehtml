In free-context trials, participants could choose to accept agency (by pressing the response button that was aligned to the circle cue in a spatially compatible mapping) or to decline agency (by pressing the response button aligned with the diamond cue). In determined-context trials, participants were either informed that agency was theirs (both agency cues were circles) or that agency was not theirs (both cues were diamonds). Agency cues were presented for 2000 ms and were followed by a variable interval of 4000–5500 ms. Subsequently, ‘tasks cues’ were presented in the 2×2 grid with German abbreviations ‘FAR’ (color), ‘SPI’ (orientation), ‘GRÖ’ (size), and ‘LIN’ (line). Quadrants with bold lines indicated that a task was available for choice (varied between 1–3 degrees of freedom). Target and probe stimulus were presented until a response was given or an interval of 2000 ms was exceeded. Finally, feedback was presented for 500 ms.</p>
