Coordinates are given in Talairach space. Error bars reflect standard errors. A) Activation elicited by the agency cues: Cross-over interaction between agency and context. Note that we also obtained a significant cross-over interaction in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (7, âˆ’5, 12). The activation in BA 10 comprised 107 contiguous voxels; the activation in the Thalamus comprised 103 contiguous voxels. B) Activation elicited by the task cues: Region of interest analysis in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) showing the main effect of agency (self-agency&gt;external agency) only in free-context trials. The activation in the RCZ comprised 91 contiguous voxel.</p>
