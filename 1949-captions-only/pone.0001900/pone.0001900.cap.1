                Figure 1.  Treatment with TrkB agonists reduces food intake and weight in mice.a, Daily IV injection of 0.6, 2 or 4 mg/kg of NT4 (n = 6 per group) resulted in dose dependent reduction in average daily food intake over 5 days in adult male DIO mice (One way ANOVA, P = 0.0098, F = 4.967 with Dunnett's posttest, P&lt;0.01 for 4 mg/kg group compared to the vehicle group, while no statistically significant effects were observed at 0.6 or 2 mg/kg). b, Daily IV injection of 0.6, 2 or 4 mg/kg of NT4 (n = 6 per group) resulted in dose dependent reduction in body weight in adult male DIO mice (Two way ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001 with Bonferroni's posttests, data are presented as % change relative to baseline body weight). c, Weekly IV injection of 2 mg/kg BDNF (n = 7) or NT4 (n = 7) led to significant weight loss compared to the vehicle treatment (n = 8) in adult male DIO mice at 10 days after the first dose (One way ANOVA, P = 0.002, F = 9.08 with Dunnett's posttest). d, Single IV injection of 3 mg/kg TrkB agonist monoclonal antibody (n = 7) significantly reduced body weight relative to control IgG treatment (n = 7) in adult male DIO mice 10 days after dosing (Student's t test, 2 tailed, P = 0.04). e–f, Daily treatment of Leptin receptor-deficient, 12 week old female db/db mice for 30 days with IV-delivered 20 mg/kg of NT4 (n = 7) decreased daily food intake by 50–80% (e), and body weight by 40% (f) relative to the vehicle treated mice (n = 8).
