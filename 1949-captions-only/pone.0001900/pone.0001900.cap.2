                Figure 2.  Centrally, but not peripherally, delivered TrkB agonists suppress food intake in Rhesus monkeys.a, Vehicle infusion into normal adult Rhesus monkeys (baseline body weight 4–7 kg) via an ICV catheter did not substantially change the food consumption (n = 2 males and 2 females per group). b, Dose dependent and reversible decrease in food intake followed ICV infusion into normal adult Rhesus monkeys of increasing doses of NT4 or BDNF (n = 2 males and 2 females per group). c , Daily SC injections of 2 mg/kg NT4 (n = 1 male and 2 females per group) over 21 days in lean, adult Rhesus monkeys (baseline body weight 3–6 kg) did not significantly alter the level of daily food intake.
