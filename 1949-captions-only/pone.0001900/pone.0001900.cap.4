Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan revealed an increase in total fat (c), with no change in lean body mass (d). e–f, IV dosing twice a week with 2 mg/kg NT4 over a period of 6 weeks lead to weight gain (f) with no significant change in food intake (e) in obese baboons (n = 3 per group). g, A schematic model depicting the dual, anorexic and orexigenic axes of the TrkB signaling system.</p>
