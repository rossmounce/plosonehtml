S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0001901.s003">S2</a>, <a href="#pone.0001901.s004">S3</a> and <a href="#pone.0001901.s005">S4</a>). The response of each signature to Y-27632 was then defined as: Log(number of pixels in Y-27632 treated cells/number of pixels in non-treated cells). Thus, positive values indicate increase in abundance, negative values indicate decrease and zero indicates no change, in response to Y-27632. Crosses exclude letter-number combinations that do not correspond to a defined signature (according to <a href="#pone-0001901-g003">Fig. 3</a>), or that correspond to signatures defined as noise (see <a href="#pone-0001901-g003">Fig. 3</a>) or signatures absent in non-treated cells (see <a href="#pone-0001901-t002">Table 2</a>). (B) Changes in the abundance of compositional signatures in response to Rho-kinase inhibition and following its recovery. Each position of each signature in the scatter plot is determined by its response to the Y-27632 treatment (horizontal axis) and to the recovery treatment (vertical axis). The response to Y-27632 was calculated as described for (A). The response to recovery was calculated as Log(number of pixels after recovery of 60 minutes/number of pixels in Y-27632 treated cells). The signatures are marked with a letter Aâ€“D, indicating the particular labeling set, and a color indicating its number, consistently with <a href="#pone-0001901-g003">Figure 3</a>. The diagonal dashed line marks the expected trend if the response to Y-27632 and the recovery were exactly opposite processes.</p>
