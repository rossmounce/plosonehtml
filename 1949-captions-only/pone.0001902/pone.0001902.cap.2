                Figure 2.  NMR chemical shift and relaxation data that identify regions of structure and mobility in p12CAN.(A) Amino acid sequence of p12CAN (arrow denotes proteolytic cleavage site). Residues of CAN that adopt α-helical conformations in the N-MLV CAN crystal structure are denoted by colored rectangles. (B) NMR chemical shift indices for the backbone Cα atoms of p12CAN. Positive values denote helical regions, negative values denote regions of β-structure, and stretches of residues with near-zero values denote random coil conformations. For comparison, α-helical segments observed in the N-MLV CAN crystal structure are aligned at the top of the panel. (C) 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE (XNOE) data obtained for p12CAN. Values near 1.0 reflect reduced molecular motion, and smaller or negative values reflect motion on a fast (ps-ns) timescale.
