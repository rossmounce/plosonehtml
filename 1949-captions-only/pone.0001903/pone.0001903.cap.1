                Figure 1.  Inventory of nonchemosensory GPCRs (nGPCRs) in vertebrates.Nonchemosensory GPCRs belonging to the rhodopsin class (A), the secretin class (B), the metabotropic glutamate class (C), and the Frizzled class (F) were identified from the genomes of human (N = 359), rat (N = 359), mouse (N = 382), chicken (N = 310), pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (N = 431), and pufferfish Takifugu rubripes (N = 438)(see Tables S1 A and S1 B for a complete list). Receptors belonging to different classes are indicated by different colors in the stacked bars. The rhodopsin class nGPCRs are subdivided into eight subclasses (A1â€“A8) based on their phylogenetic relationships and the chemical properties of the ligand [19].
