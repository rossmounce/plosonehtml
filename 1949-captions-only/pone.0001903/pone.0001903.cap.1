Receptors belonging to different classes are indicated by different colors in the stacked bars. The rhodopsin class nGPCRs are subdivided into eight subclasses (A1â€“A8) based on their phylogenetic relationships and the chemical properties of the ligand <a href="#pone.0001903-Vassilatis1">[19]</a>.</p>
