A) The radar plot shows the number of paralogous nGPCRs derived from each of the 269 nGPCR ancestors in human, rat, mouse, chicken, <em>T. nigroviridis</em>, and <em>T. rubripes</em> (see complete list in <a href="#pone.0001903.s004">Tables S2 A and S2 B</a>). Each ring of the radar plot represents one copy of a paralogous gene, and the divisions of different classes of nGPCRs are indicated by dashed lines. The presence of duplicates is most widespread in <em>T. nigroviridis</em> and <em>T. rubripes</em>. B) Approximately 65% of pufferfish nGPCRs are derived from lineage-specific gene duplications whereas only 32.3–37.5% of nGPCRs in tetrapods evolved from gene duplications after the separation of tetrapods and teleosts (lower panel). Analyses based on a per ancestral gene basis showed more than 41% of MRCA nGPCRs evolved into more than one paralog in teleosts as compared to only 16.3–21.3% in tetrapods (upper panel).</p>
