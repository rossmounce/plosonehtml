                Figure 2.  Radial evolution of nGPCR genes in tetrapods and teleosts.Based on phylogenetic analyses of nGPCR homologs from different vertebrate species, we deduced that the genome of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of tetrapods and teleosts encoded at least 269 ancestral nGPCR genes belonging to the four main classes (207 class A, 38 class B, 14 class C, and 10 class F) of vertebrate nGPCRs. A) The radar plot shows the number of paralogous nGPCRs derived from each of the 269 nGPCR ancestors in human, rat, mouse, chicken, T. nigroviridis, and T. rubripes (see complete list in Tables S2 A and S2 B). Each ring of the radar plot represents one copy of a paralogous gene, and the divisions of different classes of nGPCRs are indicated by dashed lines. The presence of duplicates is most widespread in T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes. B) Approximately 65% of pufferfish nGPCRs are derived from lineage-specific gene duplications whereas only 32.3–37.5% of nGPCRs in tetrapods evolved from gene duplications after the separation of tetrapods and teleosts (lower panel). Analyses based on a per ancestral gene basis showed more than 41% of MRCA nGPCRs evolved into more than one paralog in teleosts as compared to only 16.3–21.3% in tetrapods (upper panel).
