                Figure 3.  Analysis of gene retention following whole genome duplication (WGD) in Tetraodon nigroviridis. A)Global distribution of 39 pairs of WGD-derived nGPCR duplicates on T. nigroviridis chromosomes (upper panel). Pairs of duplicates on two syntenic chromosome regions are indicated by green lines, similar to the distribution of WGD-derived syntenic regions mapped previously [36]. Schematic representation of the WGD-derived GPR61 duplicates on chromosomes 1 and 9 of T. nigroviridis (lower panel). The duplicates are flanked by different sets of genes found on the syntenic region of human chromosome 1 in a disequilibrate manner. Another pair of WGD-derived genes in the nearby regions, Alivin-2, also is indicated. B) The retention rate of WGD-derived nGPCRs duplicates (23.5%) is significantly higher than a high estimate (15%) for the entire genome (t-test, P = 0.00014)[36], [37], [43], [45], [47], [52]. To compare differences in gene retention rate, each nGPCR family was assigned with a fixed value, 0 for families with a singleton in T. nigroviridis, and 1 for those with WGD-derived duplicates in T. nigroviridis. *, significantly different from the expected value.
