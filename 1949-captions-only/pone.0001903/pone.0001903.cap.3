Pairs of duplicates on two syntenic chromosome regions are indicated by green lines, similar to the distribution of WGD-derived syntenic regions mapped previously <a href="#pone.0001903-Jaillon1">[36]</a>. Schematic representation of the WGD-derived <em>GPR61</em> duplicates on chromosomes 1 and 9 of <em>T. nigroviridis</em> (lower panel). The duplicates are flanked by different sets of genes found on the syntenic region of human chromosome 1 in a disequilibrate manner. Another pair of WGD-derived genes in the nearby regions, Alivin-2, also is indicated. B) The retention rate of WGD-derived nGPCRs duplicates (23.5%) is significantly higher than a high estimate (15%) for the entire genome (t-test, P = 0.00014)<a href="#pone.0001903-Jaillon1">[36]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001903-Woods1">[37]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001903-Christoffels1">[43]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001903-Vandepoele1">[45]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001903-Crollius1">[47]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001903-Brunet1">[52]</a>. To compare differences in gene retention rate, each nGPCR family was assigned with a fixed value, 0 for families with a singleton in <em>T. nigroviridis</em>, and 1 for those with WGD-derived duplicates in <em>T. nigroviridis</em>. *, significantly different from the expected value.</p>
