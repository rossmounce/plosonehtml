                Figure 4.  Preferential retention of nGPCR duplicates with a nonpeptide ligand after WGD in teleosts. A)The retention rate of WGD-derived duplicates for nGPCRs with a nonpeptide ligand(s) (Group I, 27.8%), but not nGPCRs with a polypeptide ligand (Group II, 18.4%), is significantly higher than the estimate for the entire genome (t-test, P = 0.00068). The Group I receptors include nGPCRs of subclasses A1-A4 and class C whereas the Group II receptors include those belonging to subclasses A5–A7, class B, and class F. To compare differences in gene retention rate, each nGPCR family was assigned with a fixed value, 0 for families with a singleton in T. nigroviridis, and 1 for those with WGD-derived duplicates in T. nigroviridis. *, significantly different from the expected value 15%. B) The average MW (mean±SEM, Log10 transformed) of the cognate ligands for nGPCRs with WGD-derived duplicates in T. nigroviridis (2.44±0.25) is significantly less than those of singleton (3.01±0.09) or the entire pool of nGPCRs (2.92±0.07). For statistical analysis, the MW of photons was arbitrarily set as one. *, significantly different from that of singleton nGPCRs.
