                Figure 5.  Sequence divergence of WGD-derived nGPCR duplicates in T. nigroviridis.Global distance tree based on concatenated sequences of the 39 families of nGPCRs with WGD-derived duplicates in T. nigroviridis. Distances are indicated next to individual branches. The tree was calculated using a Gonnet 250 matrix. Each pair of WGD-derived duplicates was subdivided into two subgroups (the conserved copy 1 and the divergent copy 2) and analyzed separately. For nGPCR families with more than one ortholog in tetrapods, one was chosen randomly for analysis.
