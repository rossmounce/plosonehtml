                Figure 6.  Putative mechanisms for the preferential retention of nGPCR genes after WGD. A)As compared to intracellular proteins that usually form complexes with many partners bi-directionally, a nonpeptide nGPCR, with part of its functional motifs dedicated to unidirectional interactions with an extracellular ligand, likely has a lower constraint on the divergence of the ligand-interaction domain [12], [13]. Mutations of the transactivation or the functional domain could subsequently lead to the generation of novel signaling circuit to the same cell population but with different pharmacological characteristics (indicated by a red dashed line) or new signaling pathway to a different cell population (indicated by a cell with yellow color). B) Schematic representation of the fitness associated with nGPCRs that interact with nonpeptide ligands during natural selection. In the event of gene duplication, the low constraint derived from interacting with a nonpeptide ligand would provide nGPCR duplicates with a higher probability for acquiring novelty and becoming fixed in the descendent genome, as compared to genes with average constraint. A beneficial mutation could occur in either the cis-regulatory element or functional domain (indicated by a schematic pattern change). An X sign across the gene indicates gene loss. An xx sign indicates deleterious mutations for an average gene.
