Each measurement is derived from the meanÂ±standard deviation (SD) of three independent biological replicates. (D) Characterization and quantification of GLVs by adsorptive headspace collection and GC-MS analyses performed on three repeats of three independent biological replicates from wounded and non wounded <em>Arabidopsis</em> genotypes show that hexenyl acetate is the predominant volatile produced in wounded leaves of plants with a functional <em>HPL</em>. Double-headed arrow represents a scale for signal intensity. (E) Analyses of the emission rate of hexenyl acetate in non wounded (grey bar) or mechanically wounded (black bar) <em>aos-HPL-OE</em> plants, performed three times on three independent biological replicates show that emission of hexenyl acetate is wound-inducible and transient.</p>
