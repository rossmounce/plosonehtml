The initial nymph deposition preference was determined within 2 days of aphid release. Bar graphs represent the actual numbers of alates. One-tailed binomial tests were used to determine significance (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05). (B) Population increase of aphids (fecundity) upon the release of a newly deposited nymph on a single plant of indicated genotype during 15 days of reproduction. The graphs indicate the mean numbers of aphids per plantÂ±SE. Each of the above-described tests was performed on ~30 individual plants per genotype.</p>
