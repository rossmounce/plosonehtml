                Figure 3.  Choice test with the leafminer (Liriomyza trifolii).Attraction of two-day old female leafminers to aos-HPL-OE versus aos-hpl plants was tested using glass Y-tube olfactometer. Each leafminer was introduced individually into the base of the Y-tube and its choice was recorded. The bar graph represents the numbers of herbivores examined and shows that they are equally attracted to the aos-HPL-OE and to the aos-hpl plants. One-tailed binomial tests were performed to determine the significance. (P = 0.443).
