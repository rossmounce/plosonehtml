Each leafminer was introduced individually into the base of the Y-tube and its choice was recorded. The bar graph represents the numbers of herbivores examined and shows that they are equally attracted to the <em>aos</em>-<em>HPL-OE</em> and to the <em>aos-hpl</em> plants. One-tailed binomial tests were performed to determine the significance. (<em>P</em> = 0.443).</p>
