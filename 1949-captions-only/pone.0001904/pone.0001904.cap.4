                Figure 4.  Function of JAs and C6-aldehydes in plant protection against necrotrophic fungus, Botrytis cinerea.Lesion development was monitored and compared between leaves isolated from (A) HPL-OE vs. Col, (B) aos-hpl vs. aos-HPL-OE, (C) gl-1 vs. aos-hpl, at 48, 72 or 96 hours post inoculation (hpi) with B. cinerea conidia. Each bar graph represents average lesion diameter±SD of 24 inoculated leaves. All leaves lacking jasmonates (aos-hpl, aos-HPL-OE) show larger lesions as compared to those with a functional AOS (Col, HPL-OE, gl-1). The lesion sizes were not affected by the presence or absence of HPL-derived metabolites. For comparison, representative photographs of each genotype 72 hpi is shown. Graphs are the means±SD of 24 replicates for each genotype. Bar = 1 cm. (D) Analyses of camalexin accumulation levels for leaves collected at 72 hpi (gl-1, aos-hpl and aos-HPL-OE) or 96 hpi (Col and HPL-OE) show negligible levels of camalexin in all plant genotypes with dysfunctional AOS. The HPL-OE lines contain 30% less camalexin than that in Col lines, potentially because of the reduced JA levels in these plants. Graphs are the means±SD of 24 replicates for each genotype. Within any given treatment, bars with different letters indicate significant differences (P&lt;0.005, Tukey's test).
