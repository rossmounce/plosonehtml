Each bar graph represents average lesion diameter±SD of 24 inoculated leaves. All leaves lacking jasmonates (<em>aos-hpl</em>, <em>aos-HPL-OE)</em> show larger lesions as compared to those with a functional AOS (Col, <em>HPL-OE</em>, <em>gl-1</em>). The lesion sizes were not affected by the presence or absence of HPL-derived metabolites. For comparison, representative photographs of each genotype 72 hpi is shown. Graphs are the means±SD of 24 replicates for each genotype. Bar = 1 cm. (D) Analyses of camalexin accumulation levels for leaves collected at 72 hpi (<em>gl-1</em>, <em>aos-hpl</em> and <em>aos-HPL-OE</em>) or 96 hpi (Col and <em>HPL-OE</em>) show negligible levels of camalexin in all plant genotypes with dysfunctional <em>AOS.</em> The <em>HPL-OE</em> lines contain 30% less camalexin than that in Col lines, potentially because of the reduced JA levels in these plants. Graphs are the means±SD of 24 replicates for each genotype. Within any given treatment, bars with different letters indicate significant differences (<em>P</em>&lt;0.005, Tukey's test).</p>
