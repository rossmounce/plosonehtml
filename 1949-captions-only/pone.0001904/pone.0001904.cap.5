                Figure 5.  Function of C6-aldehydes in plant protection against necrotrophic fungi Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola.Lesion development was monitored and compared between leaves from aos-hpl vs. aos-HPL-OE plants at 72h post inoculation (hpi) with conidia from either B. cinerea or from A. brassicicola. Each bar represents average lesion diameterÂ±SD of 24 replicates for each genotype.
