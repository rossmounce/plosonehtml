(B) Volatile bioassays using glass Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine the response of <em>A. colemani</em> to the volatile blend produced from mechanically wounded <em>aos-hpl</em> and <em>aos-HPL-OE</em> plant genotypes. The bar graph represents the number of parasitoids examined and shows that they are significantly attracted more to the wounded <em>aos</em>-<em>HPL-OE</em> than to the <em>aos-hpl</em> plants (<em>P</em> = 0.016). (C) Volatile bioassays using glass Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine the response of <em>A. colemani</em> to the presence or absence of synthetic hexenyl acetate in chambers containing wounded <em>aos-hpl</em> plant genotype. The bar graph represents the number of parasitoids examined and shows that they are significantly attracted towards the chamber of wounded <em>aos-hpl</em> plants with hexenyl acetate-spotted filters as compared to the plant chamber containing the same plant genotype but with hexane-spotted filters as the control (<em>P</em> = 0.034). One-tailed binomial tests were used to determine significance.</p>
