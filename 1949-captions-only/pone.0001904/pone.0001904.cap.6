                Figure 6.  Attraction of parasitoid wasp, Aphidius colemani, to the in vivo wound-induced or chemically synthesized hexenyl acetate.(A) Characterization and quantification of GLVs by adsorptive headspace collection and GC-MS analyses performed on three repeats of five independent biological replicates from intact and aphid infested aos-hpl and aos-HPL-OE genotypes show that hexenyl acetate is the predominant volatile produced in aphid infested plants with a functional HPL. (B) Volatile bioassays using glass Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine the response of A. colemani to the volatile blend produced from mechanically wounded aos-hpl and aos-HPL-OE plant genotypes. The bar graph represents the number of parasitoids examined and shows that they are significantly attracted more to the wounded aos-HPL-OE than to the aos-hpl plants (P = 0.016). (C) Volatile bioassays using glass Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine the response of A. colemani to the presence or absence of synthetic hexenyl acetate in chambers containing wounded aos-hpl plant genotype. The bar graph represents the number of parasitoids examined and shows that they are significantly attracted towards the chamber of wounded aos-hpl plants with hexenyl acetate-spotted filters as compared to the plant chamber containing the same plant genotype but with hexane-spotted filters as the control (P = 0.034). One-tailed binomial tests were used to determine significance.
