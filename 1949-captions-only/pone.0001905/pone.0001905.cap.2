                Figure 2.  Expression Modulation of Genes with Promoters Hyper- and Hypo-acetylated at H3K9.Hyper-acetylated genes (A) and Hypo-acetylated genes (B) were pre-selected by ChIP on chip data and validated by ChIP-qPCR for alterations in H3K9Ac, and then analyzed for changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR (n = 2). Bars are shown as the average of duplicate assay results for changes in expression levels in C1 relative to D1. Standard deviations are shown using error bars. Upper red dotted lines represent 2-fold increase and lower red dotted lines represent 2-fold decrease.
