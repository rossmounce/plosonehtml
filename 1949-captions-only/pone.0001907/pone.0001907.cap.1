A1 and C1 refer to ecotypes of <em>T. cristinae</em> (A = <em>Adenostoma</em> and C = <em>Ceanothus</em> hereafter). A2 and C2 refer to ecotypes of <em>T. podura</em>. A3 and C3 refer to the species pair <em>T. podura</em> and <em>T. chumash</em>, respectively. The ecotype pairs exhibit weaker divergence in morphology, host preference, and mtDNA than the species pair, and are also subject to divergent selection on fewer niche dimensions. A) Photographs of the three taxon pairs, and divergence in colour-pattern between them (brightness contrast, mean±95% C.I.). Host plants are also shown. B) Summary of divergence in host plant preferences and mtDNA (colours represent host plant use). Δ%C refers to the difference between each taxon pair in the percent of individuals choosing <em>Ceanothus</em> over <em>Adenostoma</em> in host preference trials [data from 78, 72, and the current study for <em>T. cristinae</em> ecotypes, <em>T. podura</em> ecotypes, and the species pair, respectively]. The phylogenetic trees are schematic for simplicity. The patterns depicted were robust to alternative methods for tree construction <a href="#pone.0001907-Nosil6">[75]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001907-Law1">[81 for details]</a>. C) The nature of selection on crypsis and physiology for each taxon pair. For crypsis, the term ‘survival’ is used as a general y-axis label, representing the fitness of each insect host form on each host species. For ecotypes, the y-axes specifically represent 1- the proportion of insects eaten in predation trials with scrub jays <a href="#pone.0001907-Sandoval3">[data from 72]</a>. For the species pair, the y-axis specifically represents the proportion of each insect species on each host plant at the end of the field experiment (shown in more detail in <a href="#pone-0001907-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Further evidence that selection is exerted by visual predation stems from the observation that: (a) survival was measured using predation trials, or (b) divergent selection in manipulative field experiments was detected in the presence, but not in the absence, of visual predation <a href="#pone.0001907-Nosil4">[see also 70]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001907-Nosil5">[71]</a>. For physiology, the y-axis represents lifetime fecundity in all cases (data on survival for the species pair are also reported in <a href="#pone-0001907-g002">Fig. 2</a>). The data depicted can be used to infer the presence versus absence of divergent selection, but should not be used to quantitatively compare the strength of selection (because somewhat different experimental procedures were used among taxa). For simplicity, error bars were removed for the current figure, but are depicted in <a href="#pone-0001907-g002">Fig. 2</a>. See text for statistical details.</p>
