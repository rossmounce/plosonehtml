Shown for each insect species is the percent of individuals choosing each host species in host choice trials. Numbers of individuals are denoted above the bars. Each <em>Timema</em> species preferred its native host. B) Results of the predation experiment. <em>T. podura</em> and <em>T. chumash</em> were released at equal proportion onto <em>Ceanothus</em> and <em>Adenostoma</em> bushes. Four weeks later the relative proportion of each insect species had diverged, but to a much larger extent when predation was present versus absent. Shown is the proportion of <em>T. chumash</em> (±1 S.E.) on each host species. C) Results of the physiology experiment. Norm-of-reaction plots showing means and standard errors (±1 S.E.) of survival of walking-sticks from <em>Ceanothus</em> or <em>Adenostoma</em> raised on their native or the alternative host-plant species. Survival was estimated as the mean number of insects observed alive within an enclosure, averaged across the multiple census periods. Physiological trade-offs in host plant use were evident.</p>
