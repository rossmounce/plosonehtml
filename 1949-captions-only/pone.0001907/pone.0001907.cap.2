                Figure 2.  Host preferences and tests for divergent selection on crypsis and physiology.A) Host-plant preferences of Timema collected from Adenostoma (T. podura) or Ceanothus (T. chumash). Shown for each insect species is the percent of individuals choosing each host species in host choice trials. Numbers of individuals are denoted above the bars. Each Timema species preferred its native host. B) Results of the predation experiment. T. podura and T. chumash were released at equal proportion onto Ceanothus and Adenostoma bushes. Four weeks later the relative proportion of each insect species had diverged, but to a much larger extent when predation was present versus absent. Shown is the proportion of T. chumash (±1 S.E.) on each host species. C) Results of the physiology experiment. Norm-of-reaction plots showing means and standard errors (±1 S.E.) of survival of walking-sticks from Ceanothus or Adenostoma raised on their native or the alternative host-plant species. Survival was estimated as the mean number of insects observed alive within an enclosure, averaged across the multiple census periods. Physiological trade-offs in host plant use were evident.
