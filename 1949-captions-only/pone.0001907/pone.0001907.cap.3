Population pairs using the same host (left, e.g., two populations in different geographic location that both use <em>Ceanothus</em>) are not exposed to divergent selection and show no progress towards speciation. Ecotype pairs (center) are exposed to divergent selection along a single axis (crypsis), and show only partial progress towards speciation. Species pairs (right) are exposed to divergent selection along both axes.</p>
