(b) Prediction of single-agent chemotherapy response in patient breast samples. Probability values of non-responders (NR) are shown in red, while probability values of responders (R) are shown in blue. Response was defined as complete pathologic response upon completion of TFAC neoadjuvant therapy. (c) Combined prediction of sensitivity to the TFAC chemotherapy regimen separated by non-responders (n = 99, red) and responders (n = 34, blue).</p>
