                Figure 3.  Effect of molecular variables on combined TFAC prediction.Left, TFAC probability values of basal-like (HER2, ER, and PR negative) and non basal-like patients as separated by non-responders (NR) and responders (R). Right, TFAC probability values of non-responders and responders separated by ER score less than or greater than 50, PR status, and HER2 status.
