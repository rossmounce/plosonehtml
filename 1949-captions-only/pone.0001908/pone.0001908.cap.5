                Figure 5.  Patterns of predicted oncogenic pathway activation and alternative chemotherapeutic options in human breast cancer tumors.Above, hierarchical clustering of a collection of breast tumors (n = 133) according to patterns of oncogenic pathway activation. Below, predictions of sensitivity to other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in breast tumors. Predictions were plotted as heatmaps in which a high probability of sensitivity (or response) is indicated by red, and low probability (or resistance) is indicated in blue. The percentage of responders in each cluster is reported.
