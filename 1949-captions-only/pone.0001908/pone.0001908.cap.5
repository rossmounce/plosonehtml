Below, predictions of sensitivity to other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in breast tumors. Predictions were plotted as heatmaps in which a high probability of sensitivity (or response) is indicated by red, and low probability (or resistance) is indicated in blue. The percentage of responders in each cluster is reported.</p>
