After 1 week <em>in vivo</em> the matrigel implant contained granular cells that stained with Giemsa solution (A) that were ultrastructurally similar (B) to those localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in stimulated leeches (<a href="#pone-0001910-g002">Fig. 2C</a>, arrowhead). These cells showed a cytoplasm filled with black granules (B, C). Again they were of a migratory phenotype with localized degradation of ECM (B, C arrowheads), and cathepsin B staining (D). Immunocytochemical characterization of cells infiltrating the MG supplemented with MCP-1/CCL2 (E–I). The cells expressed several markers typical of granulocytes: CD11c (E), CD14 (F), CD61 (G), CD68 (H); (I: negative control). After 1 week <em>in vivo</em> the MG was used to seed cell cultures (J–O). Phase-contrast images of granular cells obtained 3 days (J) and 1 week (K) post-seeding indicate increasing cell numbers (K). These Giemsa positive cells (L) also immuno-stained with a CD11c antibody (M), a marker of granulocytes, and with anti-BrdU (N) demonstrating that these cells attraversed S-phase in culture; O: negative control. After incubation with Dil-Ac-LDL, these cells also took up the fluorochrome-conjugated Ac-LDL (P). These results strongly indicate that the cells that migrated out of the matrigel <em>in vitro</em> consisted largely of cells maintaining a monocyte/macrophage function throughout <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> culture as indicated by expression of CD68 (Q, R). Bars: A, D, P–R 10 µm; B, C 1 µm; E–I 15 µm; J–O 20 µm</p>
