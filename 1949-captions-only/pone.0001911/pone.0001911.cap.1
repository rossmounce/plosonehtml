                Figure 1.  Lymphoid hyperplasia in p27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice.Spleens were dissected and T cells isolated from p27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 transgenic mice and analyzed for viability and total splenic T cells as described in the Materials and Methods. Control groups included p27 −/−, p27 +/−, and p27 +/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice. A) Representative images of spleens from mice of the indicated genotypes. B) Total splenic T cells were determined by staining with an anti-CD3 antibody as described in the Materials and Methods. The Mean±SD of at least three mice is shown for the genotypes indicated. * P value &lt;0.01 compared to all three other groups. C) Purified T cells from mice of the indicated genotypes were prepared and cultured as described in the Materials and Methods. Viability was determined over time by using the Guava Flow cytometer and Viacount reagent. The mean±SD for duplicate samples are shown.
