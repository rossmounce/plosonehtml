Control groups included p27 −/−, p27 +/−, and p27 +/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice. A) Representative images of spleens from mice of the indicated genotypes. B) Total splenic T cells were determined by staining with an anti-CD3 antibody as described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. The Mean±SD of at least three mice is shown for the genotypes indicated. * P value &lt;0.01 compared to all three other groups. C) Purified T cells from mice of the indicated genotypes were prepared and cultured as described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. Viability was determined over time by using the Guava Flow cytometer and Viacount reagent. The mean±SD for duplicate samples are shown.</p>
