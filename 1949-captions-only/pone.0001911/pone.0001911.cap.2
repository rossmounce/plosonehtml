The percentage of CD3-positive cells and the total number of splenic T cells (total # of splenic cells X %CD3) is shown. The data are representative of at least three mice from each genotype. B) The Mean Forward Scatter of CD3 positive splenic T cells was determined by staining with an anti-CD3 antibody as described in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. The Mean±SD of at least 5 mice is shown for the genotypes indicated. * P&lt;0.01 versus both the p27 +/− and p27 −/− mice using the unpaired Students T test. The p27 +/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice were not significantly different than the P27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice (P = 0.89).</p>
