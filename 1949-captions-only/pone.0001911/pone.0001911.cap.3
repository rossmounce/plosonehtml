B) DNA content analysis was performed on freshly isolated thymocytes on mice of the indicated genotypes between 4 and 6 weeks of age. The mean and SD of at least 3 mice per group is shown. * P&lt;0.01 versus the control p27 +/−, p27+/− Lck-Bcl-2 and p27 −/−mice using the unpaired Students T test. C) DNA content analysis was performed on freshly isolated thymocytes on mice of the indicated genotypes between 7 and 12 weeks of age. The mean and SD of at least 3 mice per group is shown. # P&lt;0.01 versus both the p27 +/− and p27 −/− mice using the unpaired Students T test. The p27 +/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice were not significantly different than the P27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice in this age group (P = 0.94).</p>
