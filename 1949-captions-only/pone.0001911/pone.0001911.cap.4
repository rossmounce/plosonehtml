                Figure 4.  Bcl-2 retains anti-proliferative activity in p27 −/− mice.Splenic T cells were isolated, purified, and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody as described in the Materials and Methods. A) At the time points indicated, T cells were harvested and analyzed for cell cycle using PI staining. The %S/G2/M at each time point is shown. This experiment is representative of at least three independent experiments. B) Shown is the %S/G2/M (mean±SD) cell cycle analysis at 24 and 40–42 hours following activation from multiple independent experiments from mice of the indicated genotypes. The differences between the Lck-Bcl-2 samples (p27 +/− vs p27 −/−) were not significant (NS). * P&lt;0.01 versus the control p27 +/− and p27 −/− mice using the unpaired Students T test. C) Proliferation of T cells of the indicated genotypes was determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. Values represent Mean±SD of quintuplet samples. All three groups are significantly different from one another with a P value of &lt;0.01 using the Students T test.
