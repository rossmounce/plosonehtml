                Figure 5.  Bcl-2 inhibition of Cdk2 phosphorylation is independent of p27.T cells from mice of the indicated genotypes were purified and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody prior to harvesting for immunoblot analysis at the time indicated. Immunoblots for total Cdk2, Phospho Thr-160, and Actin as a loading control are shown.
