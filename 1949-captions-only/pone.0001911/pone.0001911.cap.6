                Figure 6.  Bcl-2 delays the upregulation of Cyclins D2 and D3 independent of p27.T cells from mice of the indicated genotypes were purified and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody prior to harvesting for immunoblot analysis at the time indicated. Immunoblots for total Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2, Cyclin D3, and Actin as a loading control are shown.
