                Figure 7.  Bcl-2 synergizes with p27 deficiency to rapidly promote lymphoma formation.Mice of the indicated genotype were followed for thymic tumor free survival as described in the Materials and Methods. Kaplan-Meier lymphoma free survival analysis of mice of the indicated genotypes is shown. Lymphoma formation in p27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice was significantly (P&lt;0.01) accelerated compared to all three of the control groups (p27 +/−, p27 −/−, and p27 +/− Lck-Bcl-2). The other three groups were not significantly different from one another with regards to survival due to thymic tumors. As previously reported, a subset of p27 −/− mice did succumb to pituitary adenomas but these animals had no evidence of thymic lymphomas and were censored from this analysis of lymphoma formation (data not shown).
