H&amp;E staining shows a characteristic lymphoblastic lymphoma (Top left) that were frequently locally invasive (Heart) and involved distant organs such as the kidney and liver. Immunohistochemistry staining of the liver confirms the tumors are of T cell origin (Thy1 positive) and retain expression of human BCL-2.</p>
