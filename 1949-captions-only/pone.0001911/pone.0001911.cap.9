Data represent the Mean±SD of at least four animals from each group. In all cases, Lck-Bax38/1 mice had significantly reduced cellularity compared to the three transgene negative control groups shown on the left. *P&lt;0.05 vs the respective p27 +/+ and p27 +/− controls. B) Kaplan-Meier analysis for lymphoma free survival comparing p27 −/− Lck-Bax38/1 (♦) and p27 +/− Lck-Bax38/1 (Δ) mice is shown.</p>
