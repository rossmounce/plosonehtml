The figure is sorted by dosage (0 cGy, 50cGy, 200cGy, and 1000cGy). High expression is depicted as red, and low expression is depicted as blue. (B) The right panel is a graph of the predicted capabilities of the irradiation signature across all mice (including C57Bl6 and BALB/c strains, males and females and 3 sampling time points) versus a control, non irradiated sample. All predicted probabilities for the controls are listed.</p>
