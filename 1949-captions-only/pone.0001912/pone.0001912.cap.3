(B) Heat map images illustrating expression pattern of genes developed in one strain as predicting the other strain (C57Bl6 or BALB/c). High expression is depicted as red and low expression is depicted as blue. (C) A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of the classification for control versus 50 cGy (black), 200 cGy (green), and 1000 cGy (red) for the female BALB/c and female C57Bl6 samples is shown. The control probabilities for each prediction are shown. BK represents the application of female C57Bl6 metagenes to predict the status of female BALB/c mice, and BC represents using female BALB/c mice metagenes to predict the status of female C57Bl6 mice.</p>
