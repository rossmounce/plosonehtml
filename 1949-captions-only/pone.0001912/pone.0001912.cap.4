(B) Heat map images illustrating expression pattern of genes found in the 6hr time point as applied to the dosages 50 cGy, 200 cGy, 1000 cGy at 24 hr and 7 day time points. High expression is depicted as red, and low expression is depicted as blue. (C) A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of the classification for control (blue) versus 50 cGy (black), 200 cGy (green), and 1000 cGy (red) for the time points 6 hr (circles), 24 hr (squares), and 7 days (triangles) is shown. The control probabilities for each prediction are shown.</p>
