(B) The graph at left represents the predictive capabilities of the PB irradiation signatures in the female C57Bl6 mice in predicting dosage profiles at 50 cGy (black), 200 cGy (green), and 1000 cGy (red); the middle graph represents the predictive capabilities of the irradiation signatures when validated against the LPS-treated samples (squares); at right, the LPS signature was validated against the C57Bl6 irradiated mice and the predicted probabilities for 50 cGy (black), 200 cGy (green), and 1000 cGy (red) are shown.</p>
