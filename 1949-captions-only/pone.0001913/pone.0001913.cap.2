                Figure 2.  Mean fraction of false positive topologies (FPTOP) inferred (those topologies inferred but which did not match the simulated topology) and false positive trees (FP) without recombination.The left margin shows the number of nucleotides in each simulated sequences. The top margin shows the number of sequences simulated. The right margin shows the substitution rate of the sequences.
