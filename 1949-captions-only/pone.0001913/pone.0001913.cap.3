                Figure 3.  Mean fraction of false negative topologies (FNTOP) inferred (fraction of times that the simulated topology was not correctly inferred) and false positive trees (FN) without recombination.The left margin shows the number of nucleotides in each simulated sequences. The top margin shows the number of sequences simulated. The right margin shows the substitution rate of the sequences. Note, the fraction of true positives is 1 - FN.
