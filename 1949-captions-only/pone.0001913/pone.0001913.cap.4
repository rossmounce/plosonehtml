                Figure 4.  Mean fraction of false positive topologies (FPTOP) inferred (those topologies inferred but which did not match the simulated topology) and false positive trees (FP) with recombination.The top row was simulated with a constant substitution rate among sites, while the bottom row was simulated with gamma distributed site-rate heterogeneity. The top margin shows the recombination rate.
