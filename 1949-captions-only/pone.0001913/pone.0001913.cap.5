                Figure 5.  Mean fraction of false negative topologies (FNTOP) inferred (fraction of times that the simulated topology was not correctly inferred) and false positive trees (FN) with recombination.The top row was simulated with a constant substitution rate among sites, while the bottom row was simulated with gamma distributed site-rate heterogeneity. The top margin shows the recombination rate. Note, the fraction of true positives is 1 - FN.
