                Figure 6.  Mean branch length difference between matching branches with recombination.The top row was simulated with a constant substitution rate among sites, while the bottom row was simulated with gamma distributed site-rate heterogeneity. The top margin shows the recombination rate. Vertical lines separate those methods that were significantly different in a paired Mann-Whitney test (see Measures of Performance).
