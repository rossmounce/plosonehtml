C57BL/6 mice were sensitized to tetanus toxin (TT) and then tested to confirm they had developed a TT-induced DTHR. DTHR was induced in the pinnae of naïve C57BL/6 mice with simultaneous injection (35 µl) of antigen and splenocytes (8×10<sup>6</sup> cells/condition) harvested from antigen-sensitized mice. DTHR was quantified by measurement of ear thickness 24 hours after injection. (A) LAP (10 pg) and TGF-β1 (5 ng) were tested for the ability to reduce DTHR when used alone, with anti-TGF-β1 antibodies (1 µg) or anti-LAP antibodies (1 µg) (*p&lt;0.02 versus tetanus sensitized splenocytes + TT; †p&lt;0.01 versus tetanus sensitized splenocytes + TT, n = 5). Similar results were observed when this assay was repeated using C57BL/6 mice that had rejected a cardiac allograft (DBA/2-&gt;C57BL/6) as a model of transfer DTHR. (B) Anti-TSP-1 antibody or isogenic control IgG (all at 1 µg) were tested for their ability to interfere with rhLAP suppression of TT-induced DTHR (*p&lt;0.02 versus tetanus sensitized splenocytes + TT; †p&lt;0.01 versus tetanus sensitized splenocytes + TT, n = 3). (C) Transfer DTHR assay was performed with antigen, rhLAP and the inhibitory peptide, LSKL or its scrambled control SLLK (20 µM) (†p&lt;0.01 versus tetanus-sensitized splenocytes + TT, n = 2). (D) To determine if LAP used an IL-10 dependent pathway to inhibit the DTHR (as previously published) the DTHR transfer assay was repeated with anti-IL-10 antibodies and isotype control. (1 µg each) (*p&lt;0.01 vs. tetanus-sensitized splenocytes + TT, n = 3) All bars represent the mean±SEM. DTHR, delayed-type hypersensitivity response; Ag, Antigen; BKG, background ear girth.</p>
