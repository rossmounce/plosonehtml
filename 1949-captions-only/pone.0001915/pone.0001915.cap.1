                Figure 1.  Stimulation of peripheral blood cells by Toll-like Receptor ligands increases expression of CD38 on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.PBMC were cultured overnight in medium alone, or stimulated with individual TLR ligands (Poly-I:C, LPS, Flagellin, or CpG DNA) or with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR was monitored by flow cytometry among: (A) CD4+ T cells and (B) CD8+ T cells. Percentages of cells expressing each marker are shown. This experiment is representative of 5.
