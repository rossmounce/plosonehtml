Bars represent means and the lines standard errors of the mean (SEM) of 15 separate experiments using PBMC of healthy controls. Black boxes = CD4+ T cells and gray boxes = CD8+ T cells. * = nominally significantly different (p&lt;0.05 by Wilcoxon Sign Rank test when compared to results obtained in medium alone.</p>
