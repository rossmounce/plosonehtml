                Figure 3.  TLR ligands preferentially activate CD4+ central memory and effector memory T cells and CD8+ effector memory T cells.Intracellular Ki-67 expression (3A, 3C) and cell surface CD69 (3B, 3D) were analyzed after 7 days' incubation of PBMC in medium alone, or in medium supplemented with plate bound anti-CD3 antibodies, or the indicated TLR ligand. Figures 3A and B are representative results among phenotypically defined naïve (CD45RA+CD45RO−CCR7+), central memory (CD45RA−CD45RO+CCR7+), and effector memory (CD45RA−CD45RO+CCR7−) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Values represent percentages of cells staining for Ki-67 or CD69. Figures 3C and 3D reflect the mean data from 15 separate experiments. Values nominally significantly different from medium alone values (Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test) are shown with an asterisk.
