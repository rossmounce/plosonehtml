(B) Whole PBMCs, purified T cells (&gt;95% CD3<sup>+</sup>), or purified T cells separated from whole PBMCs by a transwell, were cultured in medium alone, or in medium supplemented with plate bound anti-CD3, poly I:C or flagellin A. Expression of CD38 on memory (CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>âˆ’</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was assessed by flow cytometry following overnight culture. Dotplots shown are representative of 8 separate experiments.</p>
