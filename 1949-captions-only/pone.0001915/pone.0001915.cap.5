After 6 days of incubation, the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were examined for dilution of CFSE dye and for binding of Annexin V. Numbers in right upper corners represent percentage of Annexin V-binding cells. Numbers in the left lower corner represent percentage of cells that diluted dye without Annexin-V binding. This experiment is representative of three separate experiments.</p>
