                Figure 5.  Activation as a result of TLR ligand exposure preferentially induces T cell death especially among CD4+ T cells.PBMCs were labeled with CFSE and incubated for 6 days in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody, medium alone or TLR ligands alone (PGN, poly-I:C, LPS (10 or 20 ng/ml), Flagellin A, Flagellin B or imiquimod). After 6 days of incubation, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were examined for dilution of CFSE dye and for binding of Annexin V. Numbers in right upper corners represent percentage of Annexin V-binding cells. Numbers in the left lower corner represent percentage of cells that diluted dye without Annexin-V binding. This experiment is representative of three separate experiments.
