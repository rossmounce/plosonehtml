                Figure 2.  FRET in donor-linker-acceptor constructs as detected by frequency-domain FLIM.The indicated constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and FRET efficiency E was determined as detailed in Material and Methods. Shown are mean (bars), standard deviation (SD) and standard error of the mean (SEM) of 20â€“400 cells. For further detail, see text.
