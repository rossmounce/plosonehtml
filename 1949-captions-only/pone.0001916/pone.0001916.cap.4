                Figure 4.  Typical FRET responses in HEK293 cell expressing CFPnd-Epac-cp173Venus to stimulation with IBMX/Forskolin.(A) CFP and YFP emission from a single HEK293 cell expressing the improved cAMP sensor were detected at 4 samples per second, following addition of IBMX and Forskolin. The YFP/CFP ratio dropped by almost 35% within minutes. Shown is a typical recording. (B) A single cell spectral fingerprint, obtained before (black) and after (grey) IBMX and Forskolin using a spectrometer. For further detail see Methods.
