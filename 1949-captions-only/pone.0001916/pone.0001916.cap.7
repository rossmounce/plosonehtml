For reproduction reasons, the confocal picture shows a mix of green (470–530 nm) and red (570–670) emission to closely match the image visible by eye. In contrast, CFP<sup>nd</sup>-EPAC-mRFP and CFP<sup>nd</sup>-EPAC-mCherry show a more homogeneous red color. (B) Cell-to-cell variability in maturation of CFP<sup>nd</sup>-linker-tdTomato causes significant deviations in the fluorescence decay times detected in the CFP channel, as measured by frequency-domain FLIM. Scale bar, 12 µm.</p>
