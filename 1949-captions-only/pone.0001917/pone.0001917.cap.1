The rewiring probabilities of the links placed originally on a regular lattice were 0.01 (left panels) and 0.04 (right panels), respectively. For the description of the canonical repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, as well as the best-takes-over (top panels) and Q-learning (bottom panels) strategy adoption rules see <a href="#s4">Methods</a> and the ESM1. The temptation level, T was 3.6. Networks showing the last round of 5,000 plays were visualized using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm of the Pajek program <a href="#pone.0001917-Batagelj1">[46]</a>. Dark blue dots and diamonds correspond to cooperators and defectors, respectively. The Figure shows that both the extent and distribution of cooperators vary, when using the best-takes-over strategy adoption rule (see top panels), while they are rather stable with the Q-learning strategy update rule (see bottom panels).</p>
