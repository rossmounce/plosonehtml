                Figure 1.  WRN is acetylated in vivo and it is stimulated by MMS treatment.(A) WRN was transiently overexpressed in 293T cells either alone or together with p300. 48 h after transfection, untreated, UV, H2O2 or MMS treated cells were labeled with 1 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate for 1 h. [3H]acetate labeled WRN was immunoprecipitated using an anti-WRN antibody and the complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and was analyzed either by autoradiography (upper panel) or Western analysis (lower panel) or coomassie-stained gel after the acetylation assay, which was subsequently, analyzed using autoradiography (middle panel). (B) Right and left top panels: 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1 mM MMS and WRN acetylation was followed for 1 h and 4 h (left panel) or 1 h (right panel), and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate for 1 h. [3H]acetate labeled WRN was immunoprecipitated using an anti-WRN antibody and the complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Lower panels: Western analysis of acetylated samples with an anti-WRN antibody. (C) Top panel: 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with H2O2 (1 and 4 h), γ-irradiation (1 and 4 h) or psoralen+UVA (1 and 16 h) and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate for 1 h. [3H]acetate labeled WRN was immunoprecipitated using an anti-WRN antibody and the complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Medium panel: the coomassie staining of the gel before autoradiography. Lower panel: Western analysis of acetylated samples with an anti-WRN antibody. (D) Top panel: After transfection, the cells were treated with 50 µM and 200 µM H2O2 and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate for 1 h. Lower panel: Western analysis of acetylated samples with an anti-WRN antibody. (E) 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors of WRN (lanes 1–3), p300 (lane 3), siRNA of p300 (lane 2) or siRNA negative control (lanes 1 and 4) individually or in combination. [3H]acetate labeled WRN was immunoprecipitated using an anti-WRN antibody and the complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and was analyzed either by autoradiography (first panel) or Western analysis (second panel). Two bottom panels are Western analysis of these cell lysates with anti-p300 and anti-β-Actin antibodies, which shows relative protein expression levels.
