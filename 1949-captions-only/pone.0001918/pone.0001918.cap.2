RQC, RecQ-conserved domain; NTS, nucleolar targeting sequence; HRDC, helicase and RNase D conserved domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal. Numbers indicate WRN amino acid sequence. (B) One microgram of WRN and WRN fragments were incubated with [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetyl-CoA in the presence or absence of p300. The lower panel shows a coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified WRN and GST-WRN fragments after the acetylation assay, which was subsequently, analyzed using autoradiography (top panel). (C) One microgram of GST (control) and GST-WRN fragments were incubated with [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetyl-CoA in the presence or absence of p300. The lower panel shows a coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel purified GST-WRN fragments after the acetylation assay that was analyzed using autoradiography (top panel).</p>
