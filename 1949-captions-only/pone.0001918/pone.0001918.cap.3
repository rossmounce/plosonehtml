                Figure 3.  Effect of acetylation on WRN catalytic activities.(A) One microgram of WRN was incubated with in the presence or absence of acetyl CoA or p300 or both. The top panel shows a WB of WRN after the acetylation assay, which was stripped and analyzed using anti-acetyl lysine antibody (bottom panel). These reaction mixtures were used in the measurement of WRN ATPase (B), helicase (C) and exonuclease activities (D). (B) Acetylation increases the ATPase activity of WRN. [32P]ATP and 150 ng of M13mp18 ssDNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of nonacetylated (open circles) and acetylated WRN (closed circles) (15, 45, 90, 135 nM). WRN was incubated with p300 (closed triangles) or with acetyl CoA (open triangles). ATP hydrolysis was analyzed on PEI-TLC plates developed in 1 M formic acid/0.8 M LiCl. Plates were scanned using a PhosphorImager. The percentage of ATP hydrolysis was determined by each sample using the ImageQuant software and subtracting background value in control having no enzyme. (C) The effect of acetylation on WRN helicase activity. Reactions containing increasing amounts (0.125 nM, 0.25 nM and 0.5 nM) of nonacetylated WRN (lanes 12 to 14) and acetylated WRN (lanes 3 to 5) were incubated with a 22 bp forked substrate (0.5 nM, 22Fork3/22Fork4) for 15 min at 37°C. Lanes 6 to 8, WRN in the presence of acetyl CoA. Lanes 9 to 11, WRN in the presence of p300. Lane 1, substrate only. Lane 2, heat-denatured substrate. Reaction products were run on a 12% native gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager. %D, percentage of single-stranded product displaced. (D) The effect of WRN acetylation on WRN exonuclease activity. Reactions contained 10 and 20 nM nonacetylated WRN (lanes 4–5) and acetylated WRN (lanes 2–3), and WRN plus p300 (lanes 6–7) were incubated with a 34 bp forked substrate (0.5 nM, 34ForkA/34ForkB) for 15 min at 37°C. Lane 1, no enzyme. Products were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95°C, run on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager.
