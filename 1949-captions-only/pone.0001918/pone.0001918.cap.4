These cell extracts were used in the measurement of WRN exonuclease activities (B). (B) Lysates from 293T cells with (lane 3) or without (lanes 1 and 2) transfection with p300 expression plasmid were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against immunoglobulin G (IgG) (lane 1) or WRN (lanes 2 and 3). The washed immunocomplexes were incubated with the exonuclease substrate (top, 0.5 nM, final concentration) as described.</p>
