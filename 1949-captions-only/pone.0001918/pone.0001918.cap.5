HeLa nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-WRN antibodies (lane 3) or control IgG (lane 2). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis with anti-p300 or anti-WRN antibodies, as indicated. Input, 10% loaded (lane 1). (B) HeLa nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-p300 antibodies (lane 3) or control IgG (lane 1). The immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-WRN or anti-p300 antibodies, as indicated. Input, 10% loaded (lane 2). (C) WRN and p300 were co-immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts either in the absence (lanes 4 and 5) or the presence (lanes 1 to 3) of ethidium bromide (Et.Br.; 50 µg/ml) with anti-WRN antibodies (lanes 2 and 5) but not with the control antibodies (lane 1), as indicated by Western analysis with anti-p300 antibodies (upper) and anti-WRN antibodies (lower). Inputs are 10% (lanes 2 and 5). (D) HeLa nuclear extracts (400 µL) were incubated with either GST alone (lane 2) or GST-tagged WRN fragments (lanes 3–6) that were prebound to glutathione beads. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and stained with amido black to ensure equal loading of the various WRN fragments. The membrane was probed with mouse anti-p300 antibody. The input (lane 1) corresponds to 5% of HeLa nuclear extracts used in the binding reactions. The <em>asterisk</em> indicates mobility of full-length GST-WRN helicase domain (aa 500–946).</p>
