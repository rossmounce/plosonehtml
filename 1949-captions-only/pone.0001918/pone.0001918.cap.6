                Figure 6.  Acetylation of WRN488–1432 stimulates its helicase activity.(A) A schematic representation of GST- WRN488–1432 fragment. (B) Recombinant WRN239–499 and WRN488–1432 fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and stained with amido black to ensure equal loading of the WRN fragments (bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2). The membrane was blotted with p300 protein and probed with mouse anti-p300 antibody (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). (C) One microgram of WRN488–1432 fragment was incubated with in the presence or absence of acetyl CoA or p300 or both. The top panel shows Western analysis results of WRN488–1432 fragment after the acetylation assay, which was stripped and analyzed using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody (bottom panel). These reaction mixtures were used in the measurement of helicase activity (medium panel). Medium panel: Reactions containing increasing amounts (7.5, 15, and 30 fmol) of nonacetylated WRN488–1432 fragment (lanes 2 to 4) and acetylated WRN488–1432 fragment (lanes 8 to 10) were incubated with a 22 bp forked substrate (0.5 nM, 22Fork3/22Fork4) for 15 min at 37°C. Lanes 5 to 7, WRN488–1432 fragment in the presence of p300. Lane 1, substrate only. Lane 11, heat-denatured substrate. Reaction products were run on a 12% native gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Bottom panel: Quantitation of percentage of unwinding product.
