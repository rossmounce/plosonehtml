(B) Recombinant WRN<sub>239–499</sub> and WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and stained with amido black to ensure equal loading of the WRN fragments (bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2). The membrane was blotted with p300 protein and probed with mouse anti-p300 antibody (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). (C) One microgram of WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragment was incubated with in the presence or absence of acetyl CoA or p300 or both. The top panel shows Western analysis results of WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragment after the acetylation assay, which was stripped and analyzed using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody (bottom panel). These reaction mixtures were used in the measurement of helicase activity (medium panel). Medium panel: Reactions containing increasing amounts (7.5, 15, and 30 fmol) of nonacetylated WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragment (lanes 2 to 4) and acetylated WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragment (lanes 8 to 10) were incubated with a 22 bp forked substrate (0.5 nM, 22Fork3/22Fork4) for 15 min at 37°C. Lanes 5 to 7, WRN<sub>488–1432</sub> fragment in the presence of p300. Lane 1, substrate only. Lane 11, heat-denatured substrate. Reaction products were run on a 12% native gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Bottom panel: Quantitation of percentage of unwinding product.</p>
