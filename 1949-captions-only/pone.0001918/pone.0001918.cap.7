                Figure 7.  Acetylation of WRN and WRN488–1432 stimulates their DNA binding activities.Reactions were run under the conditions described in Materials and Methods on a 5% acrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager. (A) Acetylated WRN and WRN-p300 complex have higher DNA binding affinity. (B) Acetylated WRN488–1432 has higher DNA binding activity.
