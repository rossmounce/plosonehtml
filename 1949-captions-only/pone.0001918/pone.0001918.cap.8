                Figure 8.  Acetylation of WRN stimulates strand displacement DNA synthesis by Polβ.(A) Reactions contained Pol β alone (1 nM) or together with increasing concentrations of WRN (6 and 12 nM) or acetylated WRN or WRN plus p300 or p300 plus acetyl CoA. The reactions were initiated by adding 12.5 nM one nucleotide gap substrate and were incubated for 25 minutes at 37°C, followed by analysis on a 20% denaturing gel. (B) Quantitation of short (1 nt) and long-patch (2–6) BER intermediates.
