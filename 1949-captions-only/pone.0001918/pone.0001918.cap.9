                Figure 9.  Sodium butyrate treatment enhances LP BER.Comparison of uracil-DNA mediated BER in extracts from wild-type (WT) and WRN KD cells treated with or without 5 mM sodium butyrate. (A) Substrate DNA and predicted BER reaction products and intermediates. The sizes of intermediates (LP BER, 2 nt addition; SN or LP BER, 1 nt addition) and complete BER (ligated 34mer SN BER) product are shown. (B) Phosphorimages of denaturing polyacrylamide gels showing in vitro BER products. The reaction conditions and products analyses are described in Materials and Methods. A 34 bp duplex substrate containing a uracil residue at position 16 was incubated with [32P]dCTP and ddGTP and WT or WRN KD cell extracts (with or without treatment with NaB), as indicated. The positions of the BER products are indicated. (C) Quantitation of LP BER products from three different experiments is plotted. (D) Top panel: After transfection, the cells were treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate for 24 h and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate for 1 h. [3H]acetate labeled WRN was immunoprecipitated using an anti-WRN antibody and the complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Lower panel: Western analysis of acetylated samples with anti-WRN antibody.
