                Figure 1.  Evaluation of the structure and total DNA content of hippocampal pyramidal tissues in P3 progeny of saline-treated and cocaine-treated mice.(a) Typical micrograph of HistoGene-stained coronal section through the hippocampus of a P3 Saline pup. (b) Micrograph of a comparable section from an age-matched offspring of a cocaine-treated mother. (c) Relative amounts of total DNA content between the offspring of saline-treated and cocaine-treated mothers at P3 and P30. Horizontal bars show mean difference in DNA content between Cocaine and Saline groups at each age, while vertical bars show the SEM (n  = 10/group/age). For either age group, the inter-sample ranges of coefficient of error (CE) values are provided at the bottom of the chart. C1, C2, C3, hippocampal regions; DG, dentate gyrus. Note the absence of detectable histological differences between micrographs a and b.
