                Figure 4.  Global DNA methylation and DNMT expression levels in the hippocampal pyramidal layer of P3 offspring from saline-injected or cocaine-treated dams.(a) Global levels of cytosine methylation in DNA samples of control and cocaine groups each expressed as percentage relative to the methylation signal in Epigentek's methylated DNA standard. (b) Expression levels of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b each calculated as a ratio relative to GAPDH as internal standard. Similar results were obtained with ß-actin used as internal standard. Each column represents mean±SEM of 10 samples. *p&lt;0.05 compared to the saline-control group.
