(b) Expression levels of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b each calculated as a ratio relative to GAPDH as internal standard. Similar results were obtained with ß-actin used as internal standard. Each column represents mean±SEM of 10 samples. *p&lt;0.05 compared to the saline-control group.</p>
