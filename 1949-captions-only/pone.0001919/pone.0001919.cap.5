The data is limited to the genomic elements that are present in at least 5 CGIs. The number of CGIs associated with a particular genomic element is represented by horizontal bars across from the element's name. The length of the bar is proportional to the number of CGIs; this number is also given at the end of the row. The number of CGIs with sequences matching more than one position in the genome is provided in parenthesis. The tendency for CGIs to be associated with more than one genomic element is reflected in the partial overlap of the bars on most rows. Note that overall there are more hypomethylated CGIs than hypermethylated CGIs.</p>
