For each chart, the name of the promoter is shown on the left vertical while the horizontal numbers mark the CpGs on the sequence; the CpGs are numbered from the 5'end of the clone. The vertical numbers on the right (1â€“5) indicate data rows for samples from each of 5 animals from the control (upper, DRN) and cocaine (lower, COC) groups. For each sample, three clones were sequenced, hence the three sub-rows available to each sample for methylation mapping. For each sub-row representing a clone, white squares indicate unmethylated CpGs while black-filled squares indicate methylated CpGs. If all three clones were consistent, the filled boxes would appear for each sub-row for that sample. If all 5 samples (mice) were consistent, then the filled boxes would extend vertically across all 5 rows. The relative density of filled boxes between the control (upper 5) samples and the cocaine (lower 5) samples provides a visual feedback on the relative levels of CpG methylation in these DNA regions. For example, clones of DYRK3 or COQ7 promoters contained lower proportions of methylated CpGs in the cocaine-treatment pups than in the saline-control offspring, whereas the converse applies in the case of GPR73 or MAPK1 clones.</p>
