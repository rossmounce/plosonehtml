                Figure 7.  Effects of maternal cocaine exposure on global DNA methylation and DNMT gene expression in 30-day-old pups.(a) Relative levels of global DNA methylation in hippocampal pyramidal tissues of P30 pups. Each bar represents the meanÂ±SEM (n = 10). *p&lt;0.05 compared to saline-control group. (b) Expression levels of DNA methyltransferases relative to GAPDH as internal standard. *p&lt;0.05 compared to the respective saline-control group.
