E. FcγRIII/CD16 surface expression on neutrophils of the same subjects in A and C. , *p&lt;0.0001, **p&lt;0.01, ns: non significant. P values were calculated using Mann Whitney U test. IC mAb: isotype control. Example of cells with positive (one asterisk) and negative (two asterisks) signal in FISH are indicated in panel A.</p>
