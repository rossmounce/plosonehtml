                Figure 1.  Upregulated FcεRI α chain mRNA and surface expression in neutrophils from allergic asthmatics.Neutrophils FcεRI α chain mRNA and surface expression in allergic asthmatics, allergic non asthmatics and healthy subjects were determined by FISH (A,B) real-time RT-PCR (F) and flow cytometry (C, D), respectively, as described in Methods. E. FcγRIII/CD16 surface expression on neutrophils of the same subjects in A and C. , *p&lt;0.0001, **p&lt;0.01, ns: non significant. P values were calculated using Mann Whitney U test. IC mAb: isotype control. Example of cells with positive (one asterisk) and negative (two asterisks) signal in FISH are indicated in panel A.
