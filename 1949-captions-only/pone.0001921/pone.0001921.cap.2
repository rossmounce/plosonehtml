                Figure 2.  Effect of pollen season on surface and mRNA expression of FcεRI in human neutrophils.FcεRI α chain surface (A, B) and mRNA expression (C, D) are up-regulated during the pollen season in human neutrophils from allergic asthmatics, but not in allergic non asthmatics or healthy donors. *p&lt;0.01, ns: non significant. P values were calculated using Wilcoxon signed rank test. (E, F) represent CD16 surface expression in neutrophils from the same subjects as in (A, B) and (C–D).
