                Figure 3.  TH-2 cytokines up-regulate FcεRI α mRNA expression in human neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatics.Neutrophils from three different asthmatics stimulated with IL-9, IL-4, or GM-CSF (10ng/ml) for 6h showed increased mRNA expression of FcεRI α chain as determined by Real-time RT-PCR. Data represents the mean±SEM of three independent experiments performed under the same condition. * P&lt;0.05 compared with medium alone and were calculated using Mann Whitney U test.
