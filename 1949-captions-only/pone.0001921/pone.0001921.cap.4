Representative FACS data of FcεRI α chain surface expression in neutrophil stimulated with IL-9, IL-4, or GM-CSF (all at 10ng/ml) for 18hrs. FACS was performed using mAb anti-FcεRI α chain (CRA-1). B. Each point represents mean±SEM values from four allergic asthmatic donors. Results are expressed as MFI of CRA-1 minus MFI of isotype control mAb (ΔMFI). * P&lt;0.05 compared with with medium alone and were calculated using Mann Whitney U test. (C) Total protein lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with IgE/anti IgE and Western blotting with CRA-1 as described in <a href="#s4">Methods</a>. Basophilic cell line (KU812) was used as positive control. Negative control corresponds to neutrophil protein lysate analyzed without IgE/anti-IgE immunoprecipitation. Data in C is representative of three separate experiments.</p>
