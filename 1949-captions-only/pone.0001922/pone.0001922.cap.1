Dashed circles group genes into pathways. (Aâ€“C), Compensatory pathways: (A) The information flow from one master gene (filled circle on the top) can go through either of the two pathways and get to another master gene (filled circle on the bottom). Thus mutation of any single genes in either pathway will not block the information flow, while a double mutation where both pathways are disabled will block the information flow and the cell will die, if this information flow is critical to its survival. However, synthetic lethal interactions are depleted from either pathway since a double deletion in either pathway will not cause lethal effect. (B) Genes involved in the same function generally have similar patterns of synthetic lethal interaction with genes from other pathways. Heavy red lines indicate that all genes grouped by the large dashed circle have synthetic lethal interaction with the other genes. (C) Multifunction effect. A gene (or a pathway) may have multiple functions. All single-function genes (empty circles) grouped by the dashed circle tend to have similar synthetic lethal interaction patterns. However, a multifunction gene, as indicated by the pink circle, may have a synthetic lethal interaction pattern (the additional synthetic lethal interactions shown with pink lines) that differs from the other genes grouped by the dashed circle. (D) Single pathway: A certain protein complex/pathway can sustain the mutation of one, but not two, member genes without loss of function.</p>
