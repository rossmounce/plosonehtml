                Figure 2.  Example pathway pairs identified by our method.Each example is shown in a pair: left: pathway 1, right: pathway 2. Heavy blue lines represent physical interactions (protein-protein interaction and/or protein-DNA interactions) between genes and red lines represent synthetic lethal interactions. Diamonds and Boxes represent genes with the dominant function for pathway 1 and pathway 2, respectively (see text for details). (A) The dynein-dynactin pathway and protein depolymerization. (B) Histone deacetylation and histone methylation. (C) Actin filament-based process and chitin metabolic process. (D) Positive regulation of RNA elongation and double-strand break repair via single-strand annealing. (E) Tubulin folding and spindle checkpoint. (F) Golgi to plasma membrane protein transport and retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi.
