                Figure 3.  Summary statistics of the pathway pairs we identified.Upper panel: Distribution of the sizes of the pathways of our analysis (GI only; box) and that of Ulitsky and Shamir ([8]; circle) and Kelley and Ideker ([1]; star). Bottom panel: The distribution of the completeness of the between-pathway synthetic lethal interactions in our identified pathway pairs.
