                Figure 5.  The distribution of the number of identified pathways as a function of the functional homogeneity.Upper panel: the functional homogeneity of all the pathways from each pathway pair identified by our method. Although a considerable percentage of pathways identified by our method had high homogeneity scores, many of them showed a low functional homogeneity due to multifunction effects. Bottom panel: at least one of the two pathways of each pathway pair identified by our method had high homogeneity. Note that the functional homogeneity score was still significantly lower than that of the pathways identified using physical interaction data.
