                Figure 1.  Modeled Electric fields of Standard and Sham TMS with Fig8 (A) and Circ (B) coils.Electric field for x (top panel) and y (middle panel) axes and strength (bottom panel) are plotted as both color and height on the 3-d images and sas color on the 2-d images. Black circles indicate approximate locations of peaks when commercially available coils are used (Fig8: within annulus, Circ: between the two circles).
