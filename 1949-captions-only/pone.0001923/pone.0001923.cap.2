Two consecutive pulses were delivered at 10 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) at 50% maximum output and EMF was measured. All EMF values are normalized to the 1<sup>st</sup> pulse. (B) Effects of distance, intensity and position. B-1. EMF measured at varying distances between custom Fig8 or Circ coils and search coil. Values are normalized to those of Standard TMS at 10 mm. B-2. EMF measured at varying TMS intensity with custom Fig8 and Circ coils. Values are normalized to those of Standard TMS at 50% maximal output. For clarity, all plots show data for Reversed pulses as inverted and collapsed with data for Standard pulses, as they showed no significant differences beside their polarities.</p>
