                Figure 2.  Electromagnetic force (EMF) measurements of Standard, Reversed and Sham TMS with Fig8 and Circ coils.(A) Effects of 1st pulse on 2nd pulse. Two consecutive pulses were delivered at 10 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) at 50% maximum output and EMF was measured. All EMF values are normalized to the 1st pulse. (B) Effects of distance, intensity and position. B-1. EMF measured at varying distances between custom Fig8 or Circ coils and search coil. Values are normalized to those of Standard TMS at 10 mm. B-2. EMF measured at varying TMS intensity with custom Fig8 and Circ coils. Values are normalized to those of Standard TMS at 50% maximal output. For clarity, all plots show data for Reversed pulses as inverted and collapsed with data for Standard pulses, as they showed no significant differences beside their polarities.
