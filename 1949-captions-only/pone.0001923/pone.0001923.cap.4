                Figure 4.  Perceptual Discrimination.Ability of five naive subjects (Sj1–Sj5; white bars) and two non-naïve investigators (Iv1, Iv2; red bars) to discriminate between stimulus conditions, expressed in terms of d' statistic (higher d' = greater discriminability). Discriminability between Real (Standard or Reversed) vs. Sham TMS through the Fig8 coil with stimulator at 70 and 90% of maximum stimulator output, and through the Circ coil at 50%. Also, discriminability between Standard and Reversed in the Circ coil with stimulator at 90%.
