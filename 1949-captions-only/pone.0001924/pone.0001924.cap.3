Greatly increased inflammatory mononuclear cell numbers were observed in sham treated EAE lymph nodes compared to DILNs from EPO treated EAE mice or normal mice. c) Cells were reacted with fluorophore labeled mAbs specific for surface markers (MHC class II and CD11c) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Note that the large expansion in dendritic cell population found in sham treated EAE mice was dramatically suppressed by EPO therapy. Data represents meanÂ±SEM for 6 individual mice. **, p&lt;0.0001.</p>
