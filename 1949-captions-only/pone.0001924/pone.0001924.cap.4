EPO therapy for 6 days delayed onset of clinical neurologic signs in animals and reduced the magnitude of clinical deficit in EAE mice (•) compared to sham treated control (○) EAE mice (*, p&lt;0.05). The clinical score was determined as the mean±SEM of 8 mice per group. Data represents the mean±SEM of 8 individual mice. b–c) DILNs were obtained from mice after 6 days treatment with either EPO or PBS. Cells were quantified for number of Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) and Th17 by flow cytometry. Panel b shows that about 3.4% Treg cells were detectable in normal mouse inguinal lymph node (left). A reduced number (2.4%) of Treg cells was detected in sham treated EAE control mice nodes (middle), whereas EPO therapy induced a 2-fold increase in Foxp3+ Treg cells on day 16 compared to sham treatment (right). Panel c shows &lt;0.2% of normal healthy lymph node cells stained positive for Th17 (left). Numbers of peripheral Th17 cells greatly increased on day 16 (15-fold) in EAE mice treated with PBS (middle, 3.2%). In marked contrast, EPO therapy (right) sharply reduced the number of peripheral Th17 cells in MOG-immunized animals.</p>
