                Figure 1.  Quantification of cytosolic and plasma membrane-bound Hsp70 in CX+/CX− and Colo+/Colo− carcinoma sublines.Western blot analysis of biotinylated whole cell lysates (cytoplasm, upper graph), and plasma membranes (lower graph) of CX+/CX− and Colo+/Colo− tumor sublines. A corresponding Western blot was stained with the Hsp70 specific mAb cmHsp70.1. The figure shows a representative blot from three independent experiments. The Hsp70 surface phenotypes of the tumor sublines, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, are summarized in Table 1.
