A corresponding Western blot was stained with the Hsp70 specific mAb cmHsp70.1. The figure shows a representative blot from three independent experiments. The Hsp70 surface phenotypes of the tumor sublines, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, are summarized in <a href="#pone-0001925-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
