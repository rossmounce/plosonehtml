Following incubation of CX+ and CX− tumor sublines with 1 and 10 mM MbCD for 1 h, cells were washed and viability was determined by trypan blue staining after a 12 h recovery period. (B) The images show filipin III binding to untreated (ctrl, left graphs) and to CX+/CX− tumor sublines treated with the sublethal concentration of 1 mM MbCD (right graphs) for 1 h. (C) Cell surface density of Hsp70 in untreated (ctrl) and MbCD (1 mM, 10 mM) treated CX+ cells. Viability was 97.7±0.4 for control and 95±0.7 for MbCD treated cells. The data represent mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) values of three independent flow cytometric analyses. *Indicates values that are significantly different from control (P = 0.006).</p>
