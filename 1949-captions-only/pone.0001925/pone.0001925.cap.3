                Figure 3.  Globotriaosylceramide content is significantly higher in Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor sublines compared to their negative counterparts.Comparative analysis of the cell surface density of glycosphingolipids such as Gb3 (globotriaosylceramide, CD77 Ab), LacCer (lactosylceramide, CDw17 Ab), DoCer (dodecasaccharideceramide, CD65s Ab, data not shown), GalCer (galactosylceramide, MAB 342 Ab), Cer (ceramide, MID15B4 Ab), and GM1 (Cholera Toxin subunit B) in CX+/CX− and Colo+/Colo− tumor sublines. *Indicates values for Hsp70 membrane-positive (CX+, Colo+) and the corresponding Hsp70 membrane-negative (CX−, Colo−) tumor subline that are significantly different (P&lt;0.03).
