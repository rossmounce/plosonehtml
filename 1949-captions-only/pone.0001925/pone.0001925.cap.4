The co-localization of Hsp70 and Gb3 is visualized in yellow as a merge of red and green in the lowest panel. Scale bar marks 20 µm. In comparison to CX+ and Fabry cells, the density of Gb3 on the cell membrane of Daudi cells is markedly increased, as indicated by a high mean fluorescence intensity of the CD77 staining. A double stain of Hsp70-FITC and Gb3-Cy3 indicates co-localization of both markers on the cell surface (lower right graph). Similar findings were obtained in experiments using the Colo+/Colo− tumor sublines (data not shown). On the right hand panel of <a href="#pone-0001925-g004">Figure 4C</a>, representative flow cytometric profiles of Daudi cells are shown; the upper graph represents the double staining pattern of the isotype-matched antibodies IgM-PE and IgG1-FITC; the graphs below show single staining of Daudi cells with Hsp70-FITC (second graph) and CD77-PE (third graph). The fourth graph represents the double-staining pattern of Daudi cells using Hsp70-FITC and CD77-PE antibodies.</p>
