(B) BSA-FITC did neither bind to K562 nor to Daudi cells, at any of the tested concentrations. (C) Specific blocking of Hsp70-FITC binding by anti-Gb3 monoclonal antibody CD77. Daudi cells were kept either untreated or incubated with anti-Gb3 (CD77), or anti-ceramide (MID15B4) antibodies (5 µg/ml) for 30 min on ice prior to incubation with Hsp70-FITC (60 µg/ml, 30 min on ice) and analysis by flow cytometry.</p>
