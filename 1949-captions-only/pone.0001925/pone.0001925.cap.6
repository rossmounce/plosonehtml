                Figure 6.  Hsp70 predominantly interacts with artificial raft liposomes containing Gb3.Quantification of the amount of recombinant Hsp70 protein associated with unilamellar raft-like liposomal pellet fraction consisting of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosph​ocholine(PC)/brain sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol (Chol), (PC/SM/Chol, 17/50/33); 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosph​ocholine(PC)/brain sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol (Chol)/brain cerebroside sulfatide (CerSul) (PC/SM/Chol/CerSul, 17/45/33/5); 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosph​ocholine(PC)/brain sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol (Chol)/galactocerebroside (GalCer) (PC/SM/Chol/GalCer, 17/45/33/5); and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosph​ocholine(PC)/brain sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol (Chol)/globotriasoylceramide (Gb3) (PC/SM/Chol/Gb3, 17/45/33/5). Data are the total amount of Hsp70 (ng) in the pellet fraction containing liposomes and are means (±SE) of 3 to 5 independent experiments.
