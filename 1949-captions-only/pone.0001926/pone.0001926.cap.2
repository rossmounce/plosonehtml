                Figure 2.  Overview of irRMSD values for pairwise comparison of protein-protein interfaces.Most interfaces for non-homologous complexes cannot be compared using backbone alignment method. Thus for the alignments of non-homologous complex interfaces, only an overview of irRMSD values for the comparison between Galinter and I2I-SiteEngine are shown. (Hm: S/D-homologous; NonHm: non-homologous; Gal: Galinter; I2I: I2I-SiteEngine; Dal: DaliLite)
