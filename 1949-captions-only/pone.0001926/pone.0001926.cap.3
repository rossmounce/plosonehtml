In all representations, the homologous side is in light blue and light yellow at the top, the mimic side is shown in dark blue and orange at the bottom. NCIVs at interfaces are shown as thin lines. A) Superposed inhibitors and catalytic triads for chymotrypsin (1acb) and subtilisin (1lw6) according to the Galinter alignment. The inhibitor for Chymotrypsin is shown in light blue and the inhibitor for subtilisin is shown in light yellow. The catalytic triads of chymotrypsin and subtilisin are shown as sticks in dark blue and orange, respectively. The chymotrypsin binding site is shown as a gray surface. B) Superposed NCIVs for chymotrypsin/inhibitor interface (1acbEI) and subtilisin/inhibitor interface (1lw6EI) according to the Galinter alignment. Only matched NCIVs are shown. Chymotrypsin/inhibitor NCIVs are shown in cyan, and subtilisin/inhibitor NCIVs are shown in yellow. C) Superposed NCIVs for CD4/gp120 interface (1rzjCG) and CD4M33-F23/gp120 interface (1yymMG) according to the Galinter alignment. CD4 is shown in dark blue and CD4M33-F23 is in orange. Only matched NCIVs are shown. CD4/gp120 NCIVs are shown in cyan, and CD4M33-F23/gp120 NCIVs are in yellow. Hydrogen bonds are shown as thick lines. D) An enlarged view of the matched NCIVs involving the hot spot phenylalanines. E) Superposed NCIVs according to the Galinter alignment of IL-2Rα/IL-2 interface (1z92BA) in dark and light blue, and of SP4206/IL-2 interface (1py2_A) in orange and light yellow. Only matched NCIVs are shown. IL-2Rα/IL-2 NCIVs are shown in cyan, SP4206/IL-2 NCIVs are in yellow. The hot spot residues Phe42, Tyr45, and Glu62 in IL-2 are shown as sticks. F) An enlarged view of the <em>mimic spot</em> around residue Glu62 in IL-2. PyMOL <a href="#pone.0001926-DeLano1">[46]</a> has been used to produce the representations.</p>
