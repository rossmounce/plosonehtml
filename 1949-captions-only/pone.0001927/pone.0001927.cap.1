                Figure 1.  A. Biological response to IFNß therapy in MS patientsTwo-way hierarchical cluster analyses using gene expression ratio's (biological response). This diagram contains genes that were at least two-fold up- or downregulated after IFNß therapy in at least seven patients. Upregulated genes after therapy are indicated by a red colour, downregulated by a green colour and genes that show no differences in expression after therapy are indicated in black. B. Cluster of IFN-induced genes Selection of genes clustering together based on similar biological response profiles within the patient group. The genes clustered together with a correlation of 0.925 and are known to be induced by IFN. The mean expression ratio of all genes in this IFN cluster is referred to as the biological IFN response.
