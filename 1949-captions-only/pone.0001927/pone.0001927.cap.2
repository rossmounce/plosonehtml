                Figure 2.  Correlation between baseline and biological response to IFNÃŸ therapy.Biological responses were calculated, using a set of IFN-induced genes (A and B) or a single IFN-induced gene (C and D) and correlated with baseline levels, resulting in a significant negative correlation. In C and D the expression levels of RSAD2 is measured by quantitative realtime PCR and normalized to the expression levels of GAPDH. A. IFN cluster as described in Figure 1B; B. Selection of 15 genes; C. Biological response after three months, using RSAD2 gene expression levels; D Biological response after six months using RSAD2 gene expression levels.
