In C and D the expression levels of RSAD2 is measured by quantitative realtime PCR and normalized to the expression levels of <em>GAPDH</em>. A. IFN cluster as described in <a href="#pone-0001927-g001">Figure 1B</a>; B. Selection of 15 genes; C. Biological response after three months, using RSAD2 gene expression levels; D Biological response after six months using RSAD2 gene expression levels.</p>
