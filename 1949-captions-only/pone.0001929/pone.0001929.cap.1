(b) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a mouse ventricular explant in culture for 3 weeks showing that the explant has an eosinophilic core of anuclear myocyte remnants and a new region of basophilic cells in the periphery (scale bar, 100 microns). (c) Explants were stained for the presence of smooth muscle actin and counterstained with hematoxylin. EDCs, which do not express smooth muscle actin (black arrows) bud through an epithelial-like layer of fibroblast-like cells (blue arrowheads) that express smooth muscle actin (DAB brown) to reach the surface of the explant (scale bar, 20 microns).</p>
