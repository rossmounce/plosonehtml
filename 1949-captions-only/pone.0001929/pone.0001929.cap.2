(b) View at the surface of a cardiac explant reveals numerous EDCs (black arrows) on the surface and immediately within the explant (scale bar, 5 microns). (c) An EDC (black arrow) near an epithelial-like cell (blue arrow) adjacent to the surface of a cultured cardiac explant after 3 weeks in culture (scale bar 5 microns). (d) Cells with ultrastructural attributes identical to EDCs are present deep within the cultured explants (scale bar, 20 microns). (e) EDC-like cells within the explant interstitium exhibit a large number of dense intercellular inclusions and presumptive lysosomes (scale bar, 20 microns). (f) is the insert from <a href="#pone-0001929-g002">figure 2e</a> (scale bar, 5 microns).</p>
