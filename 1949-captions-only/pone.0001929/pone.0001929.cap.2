                Figure 2.  Ultrastructural characteristics of EDCs.(a) EDCs have numerous electron dense cytoplasmic structures (white arrowheads) and pseudopodia (scale bar, 2 microns). (b) View at the surface of a cardiac explant reveals numerous EDCs (black arrows) on the surface and immediately within the explant (scale bar, 5 microns). (c) An EDC (black arrow) near an epithelial-like cell (blue arrow) adjacent to the surface of a cultured cardiac explant after 3 weeks in culture (scale bar 5 microns). (d) Cells with ultrastructural attributes identical to EDCs are present deep within the cultured explants (scale bar, 20 microns). (e) EDC-like cells within the explant interstitium exhibit a large number of dense intercellular inclusions and presumptive lysosomes (scale bar, 20 microns). (f) is the insert from figure 2e (scale bar, 5 microns).
