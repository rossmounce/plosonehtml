                Figure 4.  Production of EDCs in the cultured cardiac explants is dependent on the presence of retained circulation elements.Colonies of EDCs were quantified as a percentage of the total of explants per culture dish (one dish per heart, n = 4 hearts/group). *: p&lt;0.05 vs. the non-perfused explant group.
