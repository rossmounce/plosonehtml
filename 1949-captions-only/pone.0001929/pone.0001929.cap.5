Signal was developed with a nickel-enhanced DAB-reaction (blue/black; scale bar, 10 microns). (b) Minus anti-body negative control for the image shown in panel a. (c) Cultured cardiac explants from MLC2v-Cre/ZEG mice were stained simultaneously with the chromogenic dye X-gal (generates a blue signal in the presence of beta-galactosidase) and with nuclear fast red counterstain. The spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells were beta-galactosidase positive (blue arrows) whilst the EDCs were beta-galactosidase negative (scale bar, 20 microns) (d) GFP immune reactivity in EDCs (black arrows). Signal was developed with a nickel-enhanced DAB reaction. Red arrows indicate the edge of the explant (scale bar, 5 microns). (eâ€“f) Phase contrast and fluorescent illumination of the same field of cultured EDCs (scale bar, 100 microns).</p>
