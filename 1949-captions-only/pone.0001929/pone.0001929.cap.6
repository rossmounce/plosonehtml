                Figure 6.  Analysis of DNA from MLC2v-Cre/ZEG double transgenic mice.(a) Structure of the ZEG reporter transgene before and after Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of the beta-galactosidase encoding sequences (adapted from gttf.uchc.edu/images/Cre%20marker/Slide1​.jpg).Blue and black arrows indicate the positions of the PCR amplification primers used to distinguish native (450 bp amplification product) and recombined (450 bp amplification product) transgenes. (b) PCR amplification products using oligonucleotide primers to detect the Cre-mediated recombination event. DNA was from EDCs (lanes 1–4) and their corresponding explants (lanes 5–8), a positive control double transgenic mouse heart (lane 9) and a negative control double transgenic mouse kidney (lane 10). (c) PCR amplification products using oligonucleotide primers to detect the native ZEG reporter transgene. DNA samples were as in panel b.
