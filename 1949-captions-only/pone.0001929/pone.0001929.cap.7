(Scale bar, 2 microns). (c–d) Immunogold labelling of GFP in fresh non-cultured MLC2v-Cre/ZEG cardiac tissue (c), and in an endocytic compartment within an interstitial EDC-like cell (d) (Scale bars, 0.5 microns) (e) EDCs did not stain with an anti-CD 45 antibody (signal developed with a nickel-enhanced DAB reaction; scale bars, 20 microns) however (f) mouse spleen germinal centres processed in an identical manner as the EDCs in panel as expected showed a positive signal. (g) EDCs did not react with an anti-MAC-1 antibody (signal developed with a nickel-enhanced DAB reaction; scale bars, 20 microns) however (f) mouse splenic cords processed in an identical manner as the EDCs in panel g; had a positive signal.</p>
