                Figure 2.  Angular discrimination thresholds for static lines.Thresholds for detecting deviations in straight lines, such as those in Figure 1, are plotted against line length. Each panel shows data for an individual observer and each symbol type represents a different level of line blur (σ = 2', circles; σ = 5.65', squares; σ = 16', crosses). For the lowest blur level, performance improves with increasing line length and reaches a plateau of approximately 1°. As blur level increases, performance deteriorates for short line lengths but, as line length increases, thresholds improve to approach the threshold plateau for the lowest blur level. This suggests that, provided the line length is sufficiently long, thresholds are independent of blur level. This suggests a process of ‘scale invariance’, in which stimuli which are magnified versions of one another yield identical levels of performance.
