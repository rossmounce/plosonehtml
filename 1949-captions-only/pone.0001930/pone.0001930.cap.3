                Figure 3.  Scale invariance in detecting deviations in static lines.The data from Figure 2 are replotted on a ‘scale invariant’ abscissa, namely line length divided by blur. This collapses together the data at different blur levels and indicates that any two stimuli with identical geometry (same ratio of line length/blur) will produce the same level of performance, irrespective of the absolute size of the stimulus. For each observer, data are fitted with a bilinear function. These line fits indicate that the task of discriminating a deviation from linearity in a straight line is well described by a scale invariant mechanism in which performance reaches a plateau once line length exceeds approximately 40 times the level of blur of the line (the ‘knee’ point).
