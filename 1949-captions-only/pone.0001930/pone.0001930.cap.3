This collapses together the data at different blur levels and indicates that any two stimuli with identical geometry (same ratio of line length/blur) will produce the same level of performance, irrespective of the absolute size of the stimulus. For each observer, data are fitted with a bilinear function. These line fits indicate that the task of discriminating a deviation from linearity in a straight line is well described by a scale invariant mechanism in which performance reaches a plateau once line length exceeds approximately 40 times the level of blur of the line (the ‘knee’ point).</p>
