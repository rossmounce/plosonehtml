Individual panels show data for a single observer, and different symbols represent different levels of stimulus blur (σ = 2', circles; σ = 5.65', squares; σ = 16', crosses). Thresholds are considerably higher than those found for static line deviation judgments and fail to reach a plateau even at very long path lengths. Additionally, performance is not dependent on blob size: for any given path length thresholds are independent of blur. Data for each blur level are fitted by a power function whose exponent, averaged across blur levels and observers, is -0.58±0.07, indicating an approximate square root relationship between performance and path length. The data suggest that, for any given path length, some factor other than stimulus blur represents the limit to performance.</p>
