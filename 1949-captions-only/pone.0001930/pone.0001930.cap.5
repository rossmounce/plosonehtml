                Figure 5.  Path deviation thresholds for different viewing distances.Path deviation thresholds for moving blobs with a blur level of Ïƒ = 5.65' arc were measured at 4 viewing distances (VD), and are plotted against path length. Each panel shows data for a single observer and different symbols represent different distances. At all viewing distances, thresholds improve with increasing path length. At the shortest viewing distance (crosses), and hence largest size and highest velocity, longer path lengths are required to produce equivalent angular path deviation thresholds.
