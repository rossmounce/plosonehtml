                Figure 6.  Relationship between path deviation thresholds and path duration.The path deviation thresholds from Figure 5 are replotted against an abscissa of path length/stimulus velocity. This ratio is equivalent to the duration of the motion path in seconds, and this has the effect of collapsing together data from different viewing distances. This indicates that, irrespective of the path length, stimulus blur or velocity of motion, path deviation thresholds depend upon the duration of the motion path in seconds. For each observer, the data are fitted with a power function, whose exponent, averaged across observers, is 0.56Â±0.12, indicating that deviation thresholds are approximately inversely proportional to the square root of path duration.
