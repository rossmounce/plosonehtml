                Figure 7.  Path deviation thresholds for different stimulus velocities.Path deviation thresholds for moving blobs with a blur level of Ïƒ = 5.65' arc were measured at a viewing distance of 54 cm for 3 velocities (v). Panels A and B each show data for a single observer, plotted against path length, and different symbols represent different velocities. At all velocities, thresholds improve with increasing path length. As velocity increases, performance for any given path length is generally poorer. In panels C and D, the data from A and B are replotted against an abscissa of path length/stimulus velocity. This collapses together the data for different velocities and confirms that any two stimuli which are displayed for the same duration (same ratio of path length/velocity) will produce the same level of performance.
