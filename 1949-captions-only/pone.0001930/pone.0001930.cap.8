                Figure 8.  Modeling of angular discrimination performance for static lines.The results of Experiment 1 can be explained in the context of self-similar visual filters whose size is determined by stimulus blur. Panel A shows a receptive field arrangement which would produce a strong differential response to a deviation of a line dependent upon its direction of deviation. Filter size is determined by the stimulus blur. Shorter lines are clearly unsuited to produce the same differential response (B), whilst lines which extend beyond the filter result in no additional benefit (C). This explains the plateau in performance at very long line lengths (Figure 3). Spatially scaled versions of the filters result in the same level of performance (D).
