Example traces of fluctuation data for dual-color experiments. B. Data can be analyzed by correlation analysis to examine concentration, diffusion, and co-diffusion of red and green particles. C. 1dPCH examines the distribution of photon events per time interval, and reports concentration and ‘brightness’, or oligomeric status. D. 2dPCH reports simultaneously concentration, interaction, oligomerization, and binding stoichiometry of heterogeneous complexes. An example two-dimensional PCH histogram is shown, with frequency versus number of green photons and number of red photons per time bin. E. Example, two-dimensional plot of a fit of modeled 2dPCH data. If a monomer red or green probe has a brightness of 3000 CPSM, for example, the plot demonstrates points one would expect to find values for with non-interacting monomeric species, or interacting monomeric species, or interacting dimeric species, as labeled.</p>
