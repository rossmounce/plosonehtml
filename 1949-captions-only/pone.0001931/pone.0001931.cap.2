Autocorrelation and cross-correlation curves of Ste11-GFP and Ste50-mCherry and Ste11-GFP and Ste50-<sup>L73A-L75A</sup>-mCherry. Curves are the averages of multiple cells. B. Results for G1 cycling cells, and cells upon pheromone or osmotic stress pathway activation in live yeast cells (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). Results were quantified as previously described, as the percentage of bound particles relative to total <a href="#pone.0001931-Slaughter1">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001931-Rigler1">[39]</a>.</p>
