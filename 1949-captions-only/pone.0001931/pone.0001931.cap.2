                Figure 2.  Cross-correlation analysis determines protein co-diffusion.A. Autocorrelation and cross-correlation curves of Ste11-GFP and Ste50-mCherry and Ste11-GFP and Ste50-L73A-L75A-mCherry. Curves are the averages of multiple cells. B. Results for G1 cycling cells, and cells upon pheromone or osmotic stress pathway activation in live yeast cells (see Materials and Methods). Results were quantified as previously described, as the percentage of bound particles relative to total [27], [39].
