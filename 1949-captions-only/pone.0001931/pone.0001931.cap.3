                Figure 3.  1dPCH analysis of Ste50-GFP and Ste11-GFP probes homo-oligomerization.A. Example curves for GFP and mCherry (mCH.) controls in live yeast. B. Notched box plots of PCH fits, ranging from 18 to 30 individual, 7 second data traces from 5 to 10 cells. For auto-fluorescence measurements, data represents 7 measurements for mCherry and 15 measurements for GFP. 50 Âµs bins were used to generate the PCH distributions. C. Notched box plots of 1dPCH fits of GFP tagged species, with lines (same color scheme as in B) representing average brightness values of monomer, dimer, and trimer controls for a basis of comparison.
