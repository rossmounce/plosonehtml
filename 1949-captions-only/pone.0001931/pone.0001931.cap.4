Data were fit to a one-component model or two-component model, as explained in the text. Symbols and bars represent the averages and standard deviations, respectively. Schematic representations of average stoichiometry observed; possible geometries of the interactions (see main text) are displayed next to the corresponding regions of the graph.</p>
