A model was assumed where Ste50 could exist as either a monomer with fixed brightness, or oligomer with unconstrained brightness and number (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>, and main text). Results are displayed to show the percentage of each component. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. B. Average brightness values for autofluorescence, GFP, GFP-GFP, and GFP-GFP-GFP from the data in <a href="#pone-0001931-g003">Figure 3</a>, fit to a line. Error bars are the standard deviation. The line represents the best fit of the data to a linear model with a slope of 1959 and intercept 1193, which was then extrapolated toward higher brightness. Average brightness observed for the Ste50 oligomer from the analysis described above are marked on the extrapolated part of the plot.</p>
