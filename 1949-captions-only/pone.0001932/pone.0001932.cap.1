                Figure 1.  The effect of sample size and data range on the values of the normalization constant.The normalization constant b was estimated by nonlinear regression for sets of allometric data generated with the function Y = 2rc1.5X0.75 , where 2rc1.5 = b and where random variation was added to both Y and X. Nonlinear regression was then used to estimate the value of b from the data generated either by assuming a constant exponent a = 0.75 (ba = 0.75) or by allowing the value of a to be estimated by regression (producing ba = estimated). For each value of rc, the graphs show 600 instances of normalization constants estimated using data with either N = 20 or N = 120, and with a range approaching 3-fold, 10-fold or 25-fold differences in the values of X. Each instance is shown as a ‘+’ sign.
