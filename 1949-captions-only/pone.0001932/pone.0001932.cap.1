Nonlinear regression was then used to estimate the value of <em>b</em> from the data generated either by assuming a constant exponent <em>a</em> = 0.75 (<em>b</em><sub>a = 0.75</sub>) or by allowing the value of <em>a</em> to be estimated by regression (producing <em>b</em><sub>a = estimated</sub>). For each value of <em>r<sub>c</sub></em>, the graphs show 600 instances of normalization constants estimated using data with either N = 20 or N = 120, and with a range approaching 3-fold, 10-fold or 25-fold differences in the values of <em>X</em>. Each instance is shown as a ‘+’ sign.</p>
