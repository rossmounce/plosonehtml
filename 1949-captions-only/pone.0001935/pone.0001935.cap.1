                Figure 1.  Schematic cartoon showing the S3â€“S4 linker and the S4 N-terminal region of the Kv7.1 channel where the cysteine scan was performed.In red labels are shown the three endogenous cysteines accessible from the external solution, which could potentially form metal or disulfide bridges (C136, C214 and C331, located in the S1, S3 and S6 transmembrane segments, respectively).
