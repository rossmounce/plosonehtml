                Figure 2.  Effects of external Cd2+ or Cu-Phen on WT Kv7.1 (A and B), non-injected oocytes (C) and mutants F222C (D) and A226C (E).Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of either 100 µM CdCl2 or 100 µM Cu-Phen. Currents were evoked by depolarizing steps from −140 mV to +40 mV in 15 mV increments (holding potential, −80 mV; tail potentials −60 mV), as shown in the scheme protocol between panels A and B. Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated.
