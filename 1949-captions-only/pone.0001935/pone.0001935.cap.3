                Figure 3.  Conductance-voltage relations of WT Kv7.1 and mutants Q220C, V221C, F222C, S225C, A226C, I227C and R228C.Curves were fitted to one Boltzmann function. The following values were obtained: V50 = −24.1±2.3 mV, s = 16.3±2.1 mV (WT); V50 = −18.7±1.5 mV, s = 19.9±2.3 mV (Q220C); V50 = −20.5±3.5 mV, s = 33.8±7.1 mV (V221C); V50 = −8.3±1.3 mV, s = 20.5±2.2 mV (F222C); V50 = −1.9±1.5 mV, s = 13.8±1.7 mV (S225C); V50 = −18.0±1.1 mV, s = 13.4±1.0 mV (A226C); V50 = −13.6±1.7 mV, s = 23.7±3.2 mV (I227C); V50 = +3.9±4.1 mV, s = 18.5±3.5 mV (R228C). n = 6–20.
