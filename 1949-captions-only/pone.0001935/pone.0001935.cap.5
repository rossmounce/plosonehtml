                Figure 5.  Effects of external Cd2+ on the double mutants I227C-C136A (A), I227C-C214A (B) and I227C-C331A (C).Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of 100 ÂµM CdCl2. Currents were evoked as in Figure 2. Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations.
