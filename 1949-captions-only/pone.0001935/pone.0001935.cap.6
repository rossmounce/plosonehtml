Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated. (C) R228C channels were opened by depolarization to +30 mV in a train of 60 sweeps at 0.2 Hz, in the absence (black traces) or presence of 100 µM Cu-Phen (red traces). The increase in current was calculated by the ratio of the amplitude of the 60<sup>th</sup> sweep to that of the 1<sup>st</sup> sweep. (D) Representative traces of an oocyte expressing R228C, preincubated for 10 min with 100 µM Cu-Phen at −80 mV and then washed out for 5 min with ND96 at −80 mV. Currents were evoked either by a depolarizing step to +30 mV (red trace) or by a hyperpolarizing step to −140 mV (black trace), after which a fast reapplication of Cu-Phen was applied (red or black trace after the arrow). Also shown, is the reversal by DTT of the current increase produced by the fast reapplication of Cu-Phen at +30 mV. Similar results have been obtained in 5 other cells.</p>
