                Figure 6.  Effects of external Cd2+ and Cu-Phen on mutant R228C.Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of 100 µM CdCl2 (A) or 100 µM Cu-Phen (B). Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated. (C) R228C channels were opened by depolarization to +30 mV in a train of 60 sweeps at 0.2 Hz, in the absence (black traces) or presence of 100 µM Cu-Phen (red traces). The increase in current was calculated by the ratio of the amplitude of the 60th sweep to that of the 1st sweep. (D) Representative traces of an oocyte expressing R228C, preincubated for 10 min with 100 µM Cu-Phen at −80 mV and then washed out for 5 min with ND96 at −80 mV. Currents were evoked either by a depolarizing step to +30 mV (red trace) or by a hyperpolarizing step to −140 mV (black trace), after which a fast reapplication of Cu-Phen was applied (red or black trace after the arrow). Also shown, is the reversal by DTT of the current increase produced by the fast reapplication of Cu-Phen at +30 mV. Similar results have been obtained in 5 other cells.
