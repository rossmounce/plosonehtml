                Figure 7.  Effects of external Cd2+ (A) or Cu-Phen (B) on the double mutant R228C-C136A and of Cd2+ on R228C-C214A (C) and R228C-C331A (D).Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of 100 µM CdCl2 or 100 µM Cu-Phen. Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated.
