                Figure 8.  Effects of external Cd2+ (A) or Cu-Phen (B) on mutant S225C.Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of 100 µM CdCl2 or 100 µM Cu-Phen. Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated. (C) Shown are representative traces of an oocyte expressing mutant S225C before (red trace) and after (black trace) 10 min preincubation with Cu-Phen (100 µM) at −80 mV plus 5 min wash at −80 mV with ND96. Currents were evoked by a step depolarization to +30 mV. Similar results have been obtained in 6 other cells. Effects of Cu-Phen on the double mutants S225C-C136A (D), S225C-C214A (E) and S225C-C331A (F). Currents were evoked as in Figure 2. Current-voltage relations were determined as indicated.
