                Figure 1.  Low-grade glioma cells concurrently express multiple cell surface markers characteristic of adult human glial progenitors.Dot-plot profiles of glial progenitor cell surface markers and CD133 expression on low-grade glioma cells from two representative patients (#1 (A) and #4 (B)) are shown. Freshly isolated glioma cells were simultaneously stained with the indicated antibodies. The hematopoietic cells were distinguished with anti-CD45 staining. The numbers in each quadrate represent the percentages of the cells stained positively or negatively by the respective antibodies.
