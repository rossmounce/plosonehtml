                Figure 3.  Maintenance of glial progenitor-like phenotype, but enhanced CD133 expression in high-grade gliomas.In addition to multiple glial progenitor cell markers, a high proportion of glioma cells co-expressing CD133 was detected in most of the high-grade glioma specimens. Dot-plot profiles of glial progenitor cell surface markers and CD133 expression on high-grade glioma cells from representative patients (#14 (A) and #22 (B)) are shown. Freshly isolated glioma cells were simultaneously stained with the indicated antibodies. The hematopoietic cells were distinguished with anti-CD45 staining. The numbers in each quadrate represent the percentages of the cells stained positively or negatively by the respective antibodies.
