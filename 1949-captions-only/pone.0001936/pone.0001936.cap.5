Data shown are the ratio of the percentages between O4<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>−</sup> and A2B5<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>−</sup> phenotype or between O1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>−</sup> and A2B5<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>−</sup> phenotype in each patient. The ependymoma patient was not included in this analysis.</p>
