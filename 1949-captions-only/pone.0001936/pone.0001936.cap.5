                Figure 5.  Glioma cells are compromised in downstream differentiation at the O4 stage.Glioma cells were stained with APC conjugated anti-CD45 and anti-CD31 mAbs in combination with staining for A2B5, or O4 or O1. Data shown are the ratio of the percentages between O4+/CD45−CD31− and A2B5+/CD45−CD31− phenotype or between O1+/CD45−CD31− and A2B5+/CD45−CD31− phenotype in each patient. The ependymoma patient was not included in this analysis.
