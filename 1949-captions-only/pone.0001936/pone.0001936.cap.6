                Figure 6.  CD133 expression correlates inversely with grade II to IV glioma patient survival time.The survival time calculated from the day of operation was plotted against the percentage of CD133+ cells in the CD45− cell fraction from the specimens of each patient. UD: undetectable CD133 expression. Bold black bars indicate the median survival time for patients in groups with CD133+ cells either lower or higher than 30% of total CD45− cells.
