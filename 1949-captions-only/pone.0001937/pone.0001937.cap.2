                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA (A) and whole proteome analysis (B).The phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from various Shewnaella species was constructed by neighbor-joining method using the programs of MEGA package. 1000 trial of bootstrap analysis was used to provide confident estimates for phylogenetic tree topologies. The phylogenetic tree based on the whole proteome sequences of the strains was constructed as described in the materials and methods with 100 trial of bootstrap.
