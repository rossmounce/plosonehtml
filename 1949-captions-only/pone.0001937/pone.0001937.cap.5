For each measurement, triplicate cultures were measured simultaneously, and the average value was recorded. A: Growth of the strains at 0.1 MPa and 20 MPa. Wild type WP3 was grown at 0.1 MPa (□), or at 20 MPa (▪); WP3Δorf2 mutant grown at 0.1 MPa (▴) or 20 MPa(Δ); B: Growth of the strains at 4°C and 20°C. Wild type WP3 was grown at 4°C (□), or at 20°C (▪); WP3Δorf2 mutant grown at 4°C (▴) or 20°C (Δ).</p>
