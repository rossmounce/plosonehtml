                Figure 5.  Growth curve of WP3 and its mutant.The growth of WP3 and the WP3Δorf2 mutant under different temperature and pressure conditions were monitered by measuring the optical density of the cultutes at 0D600. For each measurement, triplicate cultures were measured simultaneously, and the average value was recorded. A: Growth of the strains at 0.1 MPa and 20 MPa. Wild type WP3 was grown at 0.1 MPa (□), or at 20 MPa (▪); WP3Δorf2 mutant grown at 0.1 MPa (▴) or 20 MPa(Δ); B: Growth of the strains at 4°C and 20°C. Wild type WP3 was grown at 4°C (□), or at 20°C (▪); WP3Δorf2 mutant grown at 4°C (▴) or 20°C (Δ).
