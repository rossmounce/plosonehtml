The cells from liquid culture were shown to have polar flagellum (A); while the cells from ager plates also contain lateral flagellum (B). The transcription level of four genes (swp1499, swp1511, swp1508, swp1519) for polar flagellum synthesis and four genes (swp5109, swp5114, swp5118, swp5125) for lateral flagellum synthesis under different temperatures and pressures were checked by Quantitative RT-PCR as described in the <a href="#s3">materials and methods</a>. C: The transcription changes of genes at 20 MPa as compared with that at 0.1 MPa. The transcription levels of the genes at 0.1 MPa are set as control; D: The transcription change of genes at 4°C as compared with that at 20°C. The transcription levels of the genes at 20°C are set as control</p>
