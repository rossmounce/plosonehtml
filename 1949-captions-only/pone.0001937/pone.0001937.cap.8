Triplicates of each strain were spotted onto the soft agar, the motile ability of the strains were compared by observing the movements of the strains after 3 days at 20°C, or 7 days at 4°C. The growth of WP3 and the mutants at 4°C was monitered by measuring the optical density of the cultutes at 0D<sub>600</sub>. The mean values with standard deviations (indicated by vertical bars) from triplicate experiments are given. Δ represents the wild type WP3; • mutant WP3Δ1508; ○WP3Δ5118 ▾WP3Δ5125.</p>
