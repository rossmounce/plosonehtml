                Figure 1.  Penetratin binding to LUV.Penetratin binding was followed by detection of tryptophan fluorescence in LUV recovered after centrifugation. Penetratin concentration varied and LUV concentration was maintained constant. Peptide/Lipid ratio is given by weight. In the absence of membranes, no fluorescence was recovered after centrifugation. SM/Chol (1/1), PC/PG (9/1), SM/Chol/PG (4/5/1). (a.u.); arbitrary units. Mean of three independent experiments.
