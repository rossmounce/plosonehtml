                Figure 2.  Penetratin effects on GUV in liquid disordered (non-raft) and liquid ordered (raft-like) domains.GUV obtained by electroformation were incubated with Penetratin or fluorescent Penetratin as described in the methods section. Tubulation was only observed in membranes in the liquid disordered state. DOPC (A), egg yolk PC (B,C) and PC/PG (9/1) (D) GUV. Peptide induced vesicles adhesion was observed in all GUV (only shown for PC/PG) (E). Peptides showed no tubulation effect in membranes in the liquid ordered state (“raft-like” SM/Chol (1/1)) (F,G). In SM/Chol membranes supplemented with 10% PG, Penetratin clusterizes at the GUV surface (H,J) and then provokes a grape-like vesiculation phenomenon (I) see also videos S1,S2,S3 in supplement. Dark field images were obtained with CF-Penetratin. Phase contrast images were obtained with cargo-free Penetratin. Bars 20 µm.
