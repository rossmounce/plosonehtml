Tubulation was only observed in membranes in the liquid disordered state. DOPC (A), egg yolk PC (B,C) and PC/PG (9/1) (D) GUV. Peptide induced vesicles adhesion was observed in all GUV (only shown for PC/PG) (E). Peptides showed no tubulation effect in membranes in the liquid ordered state (“raft-like” SM/Chol (1/1)) (F,G). In SM/Chol membranes supplemented with 10% PG, Penetratin clusterizes at the GUV surface (H,J) and then provokes a grape-like vesiculation phenomenon (I) see also <a href="#pone.0001938.s001">videos S1</a>,<a href="#pone.0001938.s002">S2</a>,<a href="#pone.0001938.s003">S3</a> in supplement. Dark field images were obtained with CF-Penetratin. Phase contrast images were obtained with cargo-free Penetratin. Bars 20 µm.</p>
