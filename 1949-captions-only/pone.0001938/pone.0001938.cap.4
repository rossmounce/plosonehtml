                Figure 4.  LUV aggregation and deformation by Penetratin as a function of lipid composition.LUV of different composition in the presence of Penetratin were observed by cryo-electron microscopy. PC (A), PC/PG (9/1) (B), SM/Chol (1/1) (C), and SM/Chol/PG (4/5/1) (D). Bars 50 nm. Inset in B shows an amplification of the Penetratin membrane bridges. Notice the perturbation of the phospholipid bilayer. Bar for inset 20 nm.
