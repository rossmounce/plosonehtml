Typical spectra of lamellar phases are observed for both PC and SM/Chol (1/1) preparations in the absence of peptide. In the presence of Penetratin, an isotropic signal was observed for PC membranes consistent with the presence of highly curved membranes (B). Penetratin showed no effect on the liquid ordered (raft-like) membrane (D).</p>
