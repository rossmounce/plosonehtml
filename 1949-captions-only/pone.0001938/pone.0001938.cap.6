                Figure 6.  Effects of Penetratin observed by small angle and wide angle X-ray diffraction.A to D small angle X-ray diffraction. Diffractograms are not corrected for the base line; (A) PC membranes, (B) PC membranes in the presence of Penetratin showing a “distorted baseline” (star) corresponding to the form factor contribution. The broad signal was tentatively related to the formation of small vesicles, (C) SM/Chol (1/1) membranes in the presence of Penetratin. (D) Diffractogram is subtracted for the distorted baseline. PC membranes in the presence of Penetratin show first (L1) and second (L2) order Bragg peaks of a lamellar phase (d-spacing in the ratio 1:1/2). The peaks as compared to (A) in the absence of peptide are shifted to the left indicating an increase in the repeat distance from 6.01 to 7.05 nm. In addition, Penetratin induces the splitting of peaks and the separation of a lamellar phase with considerably larger repeat distance (arrowheads). (E) Effects of Penetratin as observed by the wide angle X-ray diffraction. Peaks of PC MLV membranes are shown in the absence (top) and in the presence of Penetratin (middle). Peak of SM/Chol membranes is also shown in the presence of Penetratin (bottom). The arrowhead indicates the unresolved contribution assumed to correspond to the increased inter-acyl chains spacing. All experiments presented were done at 25°C.
