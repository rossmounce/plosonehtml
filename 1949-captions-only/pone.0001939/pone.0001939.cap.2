                Figure 2.  Lineage reconstruction of ML2 and ML4.Reconstructed trees of 26 cells of ML2 (10 week old mouse) and 25 cells of ML4 (13 week old mouse) are shown. Terminal nodes represent single analyzed cells (colors are used for different cell types), while intermediate nodes (uncolored) represent hypothesized precursor cells. Reconstruction was performed using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (with the distance function ‘Absolute-distance’, see Methods). The vertical axis represents number of cell divisions, and the estimated depth for each cell is obtained by projecting it to this axis. These estimates were obtained by a method we developed, which is based on the correlation between genetic distance and cell depth [15]. Reconstructed trees show that none of the analyzed cell types is completely and solely clustered on a subtree, demonstrating that none of cell types is a single exclusive clones.
