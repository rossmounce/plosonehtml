                Figure 3.  Lineage reconstruction of ML7.Reconstructed tree of 67 cells of ML7 (5.5 week old mouse) is shown (see Figure 2 for explanation of reconstructed trees). This experiment mainly focused on satellite cells (muscle stem cells), which were isolated from various muscles and myofibers from the mouse body. Although no myofiber is a single exclusive clone, we show that satellite cells from the same myofiber have a significantly larger lineage measure, reflecting that they tend to share a longer common developmental path (see Figure 4F).
