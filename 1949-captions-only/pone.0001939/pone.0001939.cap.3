This experiment mainly focused on satellite cells (muscle stem cells), which were isolated from various muscles and myofibers from the mouse body. Although no myofiber is a single exclusive clone, we show that satellite cells from the same myofiber have a significantly larger lineage measure, reflecting that they tend to share a longer common developmental path (see <a href="#pone-0001939-g004">Figure 4F</a>).</p>
