                Figure 1.  Purification and identification of Vg.(A) Purification of Vg and determination of carbohydrate, lipid and phosphorus components. The proteins were run on a 7.5% native PAGE. lane 1, marker; lane 2, plasma (diluted 20-fold) of fish injected with E2; lane 3, plasma (diluted 20-fold) of fish injected with 0.9% NaCl; lane 4, purified Vg; lanes 5, 6 and 7, purified Vg stained with Schiff reagent, methyl green and Sudan black B, respectively. The protein induced by E2 stained positive for carbohydrate, lipid, and phosphorus. (B) Peptide mass mapping of the purified protein.
