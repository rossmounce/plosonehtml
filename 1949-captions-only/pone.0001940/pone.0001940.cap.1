The proteins were run on a 7.5% native PAGE. lane 1, marker; lane 2, plasma (diluted 20-fold) of fish injected with E<sub>2</sub>; lane 3, plasma (diluted 20-fold) of fish injected with 0.9% NaCl; lane 4, purified Vg; lanes 5, 6 and 7, purified Vg stained with Schiff reagent, methyl green and Sudan black B, respectively. The protein induced by E<sub>2</sub> stained positive for carbohydrate, lipid, and phosphorus. (B) Peptide mass mapping of the purified protein.</p>
