                Figure 3.  Binding of Vg to various ligands.LPS, LTA, PGN, laminarin and β-1,3-glucan dissolved in re-distilled water were applied to a 96-well microplate, and air-dried overnight at room temperature, followed by ELISA. BSA, serum proteins (SPs) and total muscle proteins (TMPs) of H. otakii at the same concentrations were treated similarly as controls. Data were expressed as mean values±SEM (n = 3). The bars represent the standard error of mean values. Although Vg slightly binds to BSA and SPs and TMPs of H. otakii, its affinity to the immobilized ligands is significantly higher (p&lt;0.05). (A–E) Binding of Vg to LPS, LTA, PGN, β-1,3-glucan and laminarin.
