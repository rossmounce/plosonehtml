BSA, serum proteins (SPs) and total muscle proteins (TMPs) of <em>H. otakii</em> at the same concentrations were treated similarly as controls. Data were expressed as mean values±SEM (n = 3). The bars represent the standard error of mean values. Although Vg slightly binds to BSA and SPs and TMPs of <em>H. otakii</em>, its affinity to the immobilized ligands is significantly higher (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05).
