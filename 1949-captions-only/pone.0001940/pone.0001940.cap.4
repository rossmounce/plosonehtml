The controls were performed in the presence of BSA instead of Vg and in the absence of Vg. Phagocytosis was observed at 60 min after mixing macrophages with microbes. (A, C and E) Phagocytosis of <em>E. coli</em>, <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. pastoris</em> by macrophages at 60 min; (B, D and F) Phagocytosis of <em>E. coli</em>, <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. pastoris</em> by macrophages at 105 min. Scale bars: 10 Âµm.</p>
