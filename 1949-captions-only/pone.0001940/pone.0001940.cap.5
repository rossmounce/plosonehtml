Phagocytosis was observed at 60 min after mixing macrophages with microbes. The microbes pre-incubated with Vg were readily phagocytosed by the macrophages, while those precubated with BSA or PBS alone were not. The PA and PI values of the macrophages phagocytosing Vg-treated <em>E. coli, S. aureus</em> and <em>P. pastoris</em> were significantly higher than those of the cells phagocytosing BSA-treated and untreated microbes (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the PA and PI values of the cells engulfing BSA-treated and untreated microbes. Data are expressed as mean valuesÂ±SEM from three experiments. The bars represent the standard error of the mean, and asterisks denote statistically significant differences (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05).
