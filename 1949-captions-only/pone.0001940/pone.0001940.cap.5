                Figure 5.  Phagocytic ability (PA) and phagocytic index (PI) of macrophages engulfing E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris.Both Vg in PBS and BSA in PBS as well as PBS alone were pre-incubated with the FITC-labeled microbes, E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris, and then incubated with the macrophages freshly isolated. Phagocytosis was observed at 60 min after mixing macrophages with microbes. The microbes pre-incubated with Vg were readily phagocytosed by the macrophages, while those precubated with BSA or PBS alone were not. The PA and PI values of the macrophages phagocytosing Vg-treated E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris were significantly higher than those of the cells phagocytosing BSA-treated and untreated microbes (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the PA and PI values of the cells engulfing BSA-treated and untreated microbes. Data are expressed as mean valuesÂ±SEM from three experiments. The bars represent the standard error of the mean, and asterisks denote statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05). (A) PA of macrophages engulfing E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris. (B) PI of macrophages engulfing E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris.
