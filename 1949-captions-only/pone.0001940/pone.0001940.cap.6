                Figure 6.  Binding of FITC-labeled Vg to macrophages.Macrophage suspensions and FITC-labeled Vg were incubated together at room temperature for 30 min, and then 60 µl of cell suspensions was sampled to make smears for microscopic examination under an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope. For control, red blood cells were used, and treated similarly. A and C are the images under a fluorescent field, and B and D are the images under a bright light field. (A and B) Macrophages. (C and D) Red blood cells. Scale bars: 10 µm.
