The bias is significant, although it looks slight here, and is even stronger in the real model predictions for England and Wales (<a href="#pone-0001941-g002">figure 2<em>b</em></a> and <a href="#pone-0001941-g003">3<em>b</em></a>) <em>(d)</em>, <em>(e)</em> This can be corrected by increasing the coupling strength (Î˜ in equation 3).</p>
