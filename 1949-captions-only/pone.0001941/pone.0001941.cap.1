                Figure 1.  Simulated metapopulation for edge analysis.(a) The spatial distribution of towns (all dots), the large black dot represents a core city or central town (analogous to London) and the edge towns in red (analogous to coastal towns) have inland towns in navy (analogous to any non-edge towns) that are equidistant from the central town and similar in size. (b), (c) The model always predicts a reduced correlation coefficient and an increased fadeout rate between an edge town and the central town than between a similar inland town and the central town. The bias is significant, although it looks slight here, and is even stronger in the real model predictions for England and Wales (figure 2b and 3b) (d), (e) This can be corrected by increasing the coupling strength (Î˜ in equation 3).
