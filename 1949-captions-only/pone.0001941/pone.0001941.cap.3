Time is shown as biweeks on the x-axis, where 26 biweeks are equal to one year. <em>(b)</em> The biennial outbreaks in London, the largest city in this system, drive the cycles of England and Wales. Susceptibles are depleted during large outbreaks and accumulate during epidemic troughs until the next outbreak. Major peaks occur at the beginning of the school term every second year. Time is shown as biweeks on the x-axis, where 26 biweeks are equal to one year.</p>
