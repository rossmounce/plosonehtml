                Figure 3.  Epidemic Seasonality: Inland and Coastal.(a) The biennial epidemic seasonality does not differ between the inland towns (dark green line indicates inland seasonal mean, light gray shading is +/− one standard deviation) and the coast (magenta line indicates coastal seasonal mean and pink shading is +/− one standard deviation); both peak at the same times and the cycle repeats every two years. Time is shown as biweeks on the x-axis, where 26 biweeks are equal to one year. (b) The biennial outbreaks in London, the largest city in this system, drive the cycles of England and Wales. Susceptibles are depleted during large outbreaks and accumulate during epidemic troughs until the next outbreak. Major peaks occur at the beginning of the school term every second year. Time is shown as biweeks on the x-axis, where 26 biweeks are equal to one year.
