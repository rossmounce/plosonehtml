                Figure 4.  Adjustments to gravity model using train use data.(a) Map of England and Wales. Red dots show coastal locations, size of dots reflects amount of train use, black dots in the center of red dots indicate train use &gt;10,000 weekly passengers. (b) Left Panel: Left shows data, right shows initial gravity model predictions, gray = coast, black = inland. Right Panel: Left shows model predictions with increased spatial coupling along entire coast, right shows model with increased spatial coupling for towns along coast with &gt;10,000 weekly train passengers (red), gray = coast, black = inland. (c) Total number of fadeouts against log population size as predicted by gravity model when the spatial coupling coefficient is increased for only the coastal towns which average &gt;10,000 weekly train passengers per week. This adjustment results in an even distribution of coastal fadeouts (red), as they appear in the data. Initial model predictions show coastal fadeouts are clustered along the top of the distribution (figure 2b).
