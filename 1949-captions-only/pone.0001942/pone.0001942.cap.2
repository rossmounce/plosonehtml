Numbers refer to posterior probabilities obtained via Bayesian inference (BI, top; roman) and bootstrap support from Maximum Parsimony (MP, middle; bold) and Neighbor Joining (NJ, bottom; italic) analyses for the associated nodes. Support values are only shown for selected nodes. (-) indicates conflicting topologies obtained under MP and/or NJ compared with the shown BI topology. Alternate topologies are shown in the electronic supplementary material (<a href="#pone.0001942.s005">Figure S4</a>). Color coding refers to species groups included in the <em>virilis-repleta</em> radiation.</p>
