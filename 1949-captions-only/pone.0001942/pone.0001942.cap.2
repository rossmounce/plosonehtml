                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic trees constructed from the Adh, amd and Ddc partitions.Branch lengths and topology taken from the Bayesian inference trees (GTR+I+G model). Numbers refer to posterior probabilities obtained via Bayesian inference (BI, top; roman) and bootstrap support from Maximum Parsimony (MP, middle; bold) and Neighbor Joining (NJ, bottom; italic) analyses for the associated nodes. Support values are only shown for selected nodes. (-) indicates conflicting topologies obtained under MP and/or NJ compared with the shown BI topology. Alternate topologies are shown in the electronic supplementary material (Figure S4). Color coding refers to species groups included in the virilis-repleta radiation.
