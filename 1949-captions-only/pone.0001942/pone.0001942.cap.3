Scale bars 1 mm. (D) Posterior scutellar setae are crossed (insert) and turned upright, which in combination with the erect dorsocentral setae give the flies their distinct bristly look. Scale bars 0.5 mm. (E) Male internal genitalia visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Views from ventral (v), dorsal (d) and lateral (l) side. Aedeagus (aed), as well as hypandrium (hyp) display a close resemblance to the species of the <em>canalinea</em> group. Note the peculiar asymmetric shape of the spurs (spu, extending from the tip of the aedeagus), gonopod (gon) and paraphysis (par). (F) Stereomicroscope image of aforementioned characters. (G) The epandrium (epa) in <em>D. endobranchia</em> (left) is fused with the cerci (cer), a feature common in the <em>virilis-repleta</em> section, while rarely encountered in the <em>immigrans-tripunctata</em> section (here exemplified by <em>D. quinaria</em> (right, Tucson stock 15130–2011.00)). (H) Scanning electron micrograph of the female terminalia. The 8<sup>th</sup> circumanal tergite (arrow) lacks the characteristic paragential fringe of the <em>canalinea</em> group. Scale bars in (E–H) equal 0.1 mm.</p>
