                Figure 3.  Morphological characteristics of D. endobranchia.(A) female and (B) male, left lateral view (C) Dorsal view of the female. Scale bars 1 mm. (D) Posterior scutellar setae are crossed (insert) and turned upright, which in combination with the erect dorsocentral setae give the flies their distinct bristly look. Scale bars 0.5 mm. (E) Male internal genitalia visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Views from ventral (v), dorsal (d) and lateral (l) side. Aedeagus (aed), as well as hypandrium (hyp) display a close resemblance to the species of the canalinea group. Note the peculiar asymmetric shape of the spurs (spu, extending from the tip of the aedeagus), gonopod (gon) and paraphysis (par). (F) Stereomicroscope image of aforementioned characters. (G) The epandrium (epa) in D. endobranchia (left) is fused with the cerci (cer), a feature common in the virilis-repleta section, while rarely encountered in the immigrans-tripunctata section (here exemplified by D. quinaria (right, Tucson stock 15130–2011.00)). (H) Scanning electron micrograph of the female terminalia. The 8th circumanal tergite (arrow) lacks the characteristic paragential fringe of the canalinea group. Scale bars in (E–H) equal 0.1 mm.
