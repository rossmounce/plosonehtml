(B) Impact of the perturbations projected onto a helical wheel diagram. The cut-off for significance was ∥ΔΔG<sub>0</sub><sup>c</sup>∥≥1.5 kcal.mol<sup>−1</sup>. The red, blue and green circled mutated residues shift the gating equilibrium in favor of the closed, open and inactivated state, respectively. (C) Impact of the perturbations expressed as a bar graph along the S4 sequence. The color coding is as in B. The black bars correspond to residues whose perturbation is not significant (∥ΔΔG<sub>0</sub><sup>c</sup>∥&lt;1.5 kcal.mol<sup>−1</sup>).</p>
