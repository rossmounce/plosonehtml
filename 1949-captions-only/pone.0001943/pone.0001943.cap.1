                Figure 1.  Summary of the tryptophan scan of Kv7.1 S4.(A) Sequence alignment of the S4 segment of human Kv7.1 with various Kv channels. (B) Impact of the perturbations projected onto a helical wheel diagram. The cut-off for significance was ∥ΔΔG0c∥≥1.5 kcal.mol−1. The red, blue and green circled mutated residues shift the gating equilibrium in favor of the closed, open and inactivated state, respectively. (C) Impact of the perturbations expressed as a bar graph along the S4 sequence. The color coding is as in B. The black bars correspond to residues whose perturbation is not significant (∥ΔΔG0c∥&lt;1.5 kcal.mol−1).
