                Figure 2.  Mutations stabilizing Kv7.1 to the open state.(A) and (B) Representative current traces of WT and A226W, respectively. From a holding potential of −90 mV, the membrane was stepped for 3 s from −70 mV to +60 mV in 10 mV increments and then repolarized for 1.5 s to −60 mV to generate the tail currents. (C) and (D) Normalized conductance was plotted as a function of step voltages, for the mutants (black squares) A226W (n = 6) and V241W (n = 11), respectively, and compared to WT (n = 20) (open squares). The activation curves were fitted using one Boltzmann function. (E) Representative current traces of R231W. Membrane was stepped for 3 s from −140 mV to +60 mV in 20 mV increments and then repolarized for 1.5 s to −60 mV. (F) Current-voltage relations of R231W (n = 8) (black squares) and WT (open squares). Current density (pA/pF) was plotted as a function of step voltages.
