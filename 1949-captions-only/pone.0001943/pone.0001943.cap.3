(C) and (D) Normalized conductance of the mutants (black squares) L239W (n = 5) and L236W (n = 10), respectively, compared to WT (open squares). (E) and (F) Representative current traces of R228W and I235W, respectively, recorded as in <a href="#pone-0001943-g002">Figure 2 A</a>. (G) Normalized conductance of R228W (n = 8) (black squares), compared to WT (open squares). (H) The time t<sub>1/2</sub> needed to reach half-maximal current amplitude was determined for R228W, I235W and WT (n = 8â€“20).</p>
