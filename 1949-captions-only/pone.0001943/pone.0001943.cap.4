                Figure 4.  Mutations stabilizing KCNQ1 towards the inactivated state.(A) and (B) Representative current traces of WT and L233W and Q244W, respectively, recorded as in Figure 2 A. (C) Normalized conductance of L233W (n = 13) (black squares), compared to WT (open squares). (D) Percent of macroscopic inactivation of WT, Q244W and L233W (n = 7â€“20) as measured by the ratio between the sustained and the peak current amplitudes.
