                Figure 5.  Summary of the tryptophan scan of Kv7.1 S4 in the presence of KCNE1.The cut-off for significance was ∥ΔΔG0c∥≥1.5 kcal.mol−1. The red and blue bars of the mutated residues shift the gating equilibrium in favor of the closed and open state, respectively. The black bars correspond to residues whose perturbation is not significant (∥ΔΔG0c∥&lt;1.5 kcal.mol−1).
