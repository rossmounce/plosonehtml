                Figure 6.  Effect of KCNE1 co-expression with mutant G229W.Representative current traces of WT IKS (A) and mutant G229W expressed without (B) or with KCNE1 (C). From a holding potential of −90 mV, the membrane was stepped for 3 s from −70 mV to +60 mV in 10 mV increments and then repolarized for 1.5 s to −60 mV to generate the tail currents. Conductance-voltage relations (D) and current-voltage relations (E) of WT Kv7.1 and mutant G229W co-expressed with KCNE1.
