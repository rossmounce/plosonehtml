                Figure 7.  Effect of KCNE1 co-expression with mutant R231W and I235W.Representative current traces of mutant R231W expressed without (A) or with KCNE1 (B). Conductance-voltage relations (C) and current-voltage relations (D) of WT Kv7.1 and mutant R231W co-expressed with KCNE1. Representative current traces of mutant I235W expressed without (E) or with KCNE1 (F). Conductance-voltage relations (G) and current-voltage relations (H) of WT Kv7.1 and mutant I235W co-expressed with KCNE1.
