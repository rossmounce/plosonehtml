                Figure 8.  Effect of KCNE1 co-expression with mutant R237W and R243W.Representative current traces of mutant R237W expressed without (A) or with KCNE1 (B). Conductance-voltage relations (C) and current-voltage relations (D) of WT Kv7.1 and mutant R237W co-expressed with KCNE1. Representative current traces of mutant R243W expressed without (E) or with KCNE1 (F). Conductance-voltage relations (G) and current-voltage relations (H) of WT Kv7.1 and mutant R243W co-expressed with KCNE1.
