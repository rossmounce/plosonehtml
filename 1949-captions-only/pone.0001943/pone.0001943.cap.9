(B) Effects of external Cu-Phen on mutant R228C. Oocytes were bathed in ND96 in the absence and presence of 100 µM Cu-Phen. Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations were determined as indicated. (C) Shown are representative traces and current-voltage relations of R228C+WT KCNE1 channels, when oocytes were bathed with ND96 in the absence of presence of 100 µM Cu-Phen. Also shown, is the reversal by DTT of the current decrease produced by Cu-Phen. (D) Representative traces of R228C+WT KCNE1 channels, when oocytes were bathed with ND96 containing 100 µM Cu-Phen. Currents were evoked by a train of step depolarization to +30 mV. Similar results have been obtained in 5 other cells.</p>
