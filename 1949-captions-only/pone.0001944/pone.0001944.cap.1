The raw data of both phantom solutions and human subjects were processed on GE analysis software (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Fourier transform was done with an exponential weighting function of 2 Hz. The area of the GSH signal was measured on Image J (<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>) software.</p>


<h4>Evaluation of clinical variables</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to evaluate the severity of negative symptoms and psychotic symptoms (positive and negative symptoms), respectively. The Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) was used to evaluate and exclude the effects of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms which could affect the severity of symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Functional disability was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale.</p>


<h4>Cognitive function tests</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Several cognitive function tests were used. In the Word Fluency Task (letter, category), subjects were given an initial letter (letter fluency task) or a certain category (category fluency task) as a cue <a href="#pone.0001944-Sumiyoshi1">[26]</a>. Both tasks consisted of three trials, and the number of words produced in one minute for each trial was recorded for evaluation. In the Stroop Test, a list of twenty four colored dots (D), a baseline test, and 24 colored words incongruent with the color (C) were used. The difference between the reaction time (C-D) was assessed <a href="#pone.0001944-Carter1">[27]</a>. In the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), subjects were instructed to sort cards according to a rule (color, shape, or number). The numbers of achieved categories and perseverative errors were assessed <a href="#pone.0001944-Shad1">[28]</a>. In the Trail-Making Test part (TMT) A, subjects drew lines as quickly as possible to connect 25 consecutively numbered circles. In the TMT part B, subjects connected 25 consecutively numbered and lettered circles by alternating between the two sequences. The time taken to complete each part of the test was recorded in seconds <a href="#pone.0001944-Reitan1">[29]</a>. In the Digit Span Distractibility Test (DSDT), subjects were asked to remember a tape-recorded string of digits read by a female voice while ignoring the digits read by a male voice (distracter) <a href="#pone.0001944-WilderWillis1">[30]</a>.The percentages of digits correctly recalled in conditions with and without distracters were assessed separately.</p>


<h4>Genotyping</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a><p>Genetic analysis for the genes involved in GSH metabolism-GCLM, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), and several classes of glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM1, GSTO1, GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTT2)-as performed by the methods described previously <a href="#pone.0001944-Tosic1">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0001944-Matsuzawa1">[31]</a>–<a href="#pone.0001944-Hashimoto4">[33]</a>.</p>


<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a><p>All calculations were performed with SPSS software (SPSS version 12.0J, Tokyo, Japan). Student's t-test (unpaired) was employed for the comparison of GSH levels between schizophrenic patients and normal control subjects and of the scores of the cognitive function tests between the two groups. For the genotyping results, the differences between patients and controls were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Pearson's correlation coefficients were examined to identify any correlations of GSH levels with the clinical severity (BPRS, SANS, and DIEPSS) of schizophrenic patients and with the scores of cognitive function tests of all subjects. A value of p&lt;0.05 was used as the standard for statistical significance in all analyses.</p>

<h4>GSH concentration between schizophrenic patients and healthy comparisons</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>We used eight phantom solutions of different GSH concentrations (0.3–30 mM) to acquire reference spectra for quantification. As shown in <a href="#pone-0001944-g001"><strong>Figure 1B</strong></a>, acquired GSH phantom spectra clearly increased their areas at chemical shift 2.95 ppm in a concentration-dependent manner. In <a href="#pone-0001944-g001"><strong>Figure 1C</strong></a>, plots show a linear correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.994) between the GSH signal area and the GSH concentration. The areas of GSH spectra acquired from human subjects <em>in vivo</em> were applied to the linear concentration curve for quantification (<a href="#pone-0001944-g001"><strong>Figure 1D</strong></a>). As shown in <a href="#pone-0001944-t001"><strong>Table 1</strong></a>, GSH concentration (0.808±0.26 mM (mean±SD)) in the posterior medial frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients (n = 20) did not differ (t = 1.416, df = 34, p = 0.166) from that (0.928±0.24 mM (mean±SD)) of age- and gender-matched normal healthy controls (n = 16)(<a href="#pone-0001944-t001"><strong>Table 1</strong></a>). Furthermore, there were no correlations between GSH levels and clinical variables (age, education, estimated IQ, age at onset of illness, duration of illness, GAF, and amount of medication) in the subjects.</p>


<h4>Correlation between GSH concentration and clinical variables</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1"></a><p>We examined the correlation between GSH level and the severity of clinical symptoms (scores of SANS, BPRS and DIEPSS) in the schizophrenic patients (n = 20). Interestingly, there was a significant negative correlation (r = −0.68, p&lt;0.001) between GSH level and SANS total score in schizophrenic patients (<a href="#pone-0001944-g002"><strong>Figure 2</strong></a>). Of five subscale-symptom groups in SANS, significant negative correlations with GSH level were detected in four subscales (S1: affective flattering-blunting (r = −0.57, p = 0.009), S2: alogia (r = −0.67, p = 0.001), S3: avolition-apathy (r = −0.52, p = 0.02), S4: anhedonia-asociality (r = −0.62, p = 0.004)), but not in attention impairment (r = −0.27, p = 0.252). Furthermore, we also found a significant correlation (r = −0.60, p = 0.005) between GSH levels and the negative symptom subscore on BPRS. However, there were no significant correlations between GSH level and BPRS total score (r = −0.41, p = 0.076), BPRS positive symptom score (r = −0.43, p = 0.059) and DIEPSS score (r = −0.32, p = 0.167). Because these correlations might have been affected by medication, we controlled for the doses of antipsychotics using partial correlation coefficients. Even when the administered antipsychotics (chlorpromazine equivalents) were adjusted for using partial correlation coefficients, the relationships between GSH level and SANS score (partial correlation coefficient = −0.60, p = 0.007) or BPRS negative score (partial correlation coefficient = −0.52, p = 0.02) remained significant.</p>
