(A): T2-weighed magnetic resonance imaging of the targeted region. The blue boxes show the voxel size (28 x 22 x 30â€‰mm) in the posterior medial frontal cortex of a human brain. (B): representative data of reference phantom spectra of GSH (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 mM). Note that the GSH signal increases according to the phantom concentration. (C): Quantification of GSH. Plots showing a linear correlation (r2 = 0.994) between the GSH signal area at 2.95 ppm and the concentration of GSH. (D): Representative data of GSH signals of the posterior medial frontal cortex of a human subject. The GSH level was calculated as 0.735 mM by applying the linear concentration curve on (C).</p>

The raw data of both phantom solutions and human subjects were processed on GE analysis software (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Fourier transform was done with an exponential weighting function of 2 Hz. The area of the GSH signal was measured on Image J (<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>) software.</p>


<h4>Evaluation of clinical variables</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a><p>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to evaluate the severity of negative symptoms and psychotic symptoms (positive and negative symptoms), respectively. The Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) was used to evaluate and exclude the effects of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms which could affect the severity of symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Functional disability was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale.</p>
