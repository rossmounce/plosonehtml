Correlation between GSH concentration and cognitive functions
As shown in Table 2, significant differences were observed between schizophrenia patients and normal controls in all cognitive function tests: Word Fluency (letters: t = 4.67, df = 34, p&lt;0.001; category: t = 3.57, df = 34, p&lt;0.01), Stroop Task (t = −3.47, df = 34, p&lt;0.01), WCST (category: t = 3.95, df = 34, p&lt;0.001; perseverative error : t = −4.61, df = 34, p&lt;0.001), Trail Making Test (TMT-A: t = −3.21, df = 34, p&lt;0.001; TMT-B: t = −3.43, df = 34, p&lt;0.01; TMT-B-A; t = −2.17, df = 34, p = 0.03), and DSDT (without distracter: t = 1.35, df = 34, p = 0.18; with distracter; t = 3.23, df = 34, p&lt;0.01).
