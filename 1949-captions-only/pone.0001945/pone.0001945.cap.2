To activate basal (Basal) or apical dendritic synapses (Apical), a stimulating electrode was placed at the <em>stratum oriens</em> [Stim.(SO)] or <em>stratum radiatum</em> [Stim.(SR)] of area CA1, respectively. fEPSPs were recorded with an extracellular electrode [Rec.(field)]. LTP was induced with tetanic stimulation at time 0 (arrow). Open and filled symbols represent 7- to 9-week-old mice and postnatal 9- to11-day-old mice, respectively. Square and circle symbols indicate recordings from basal and apical dendritic synapses, respectively. Error bars represent s.e.m. (<em>n = </em>7 to 9).</p>
