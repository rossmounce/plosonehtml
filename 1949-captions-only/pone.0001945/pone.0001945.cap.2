                Figure 2.  Developmental asymmetry of LTP at hippocampal CA1 synapses.Schematic diagrams of the arrangement of electrodes for extracellular recording. To activate basal (Basal) or apical dendritic synapses (Apical), a stimulating electrode was placed at the stratum oriens [Stim.(SO)] or stratum radiatum [Stim.(SR)] of area CA1, respectively. fEPSPs were recorded with an extracellular electrode [Rec.(field)]. LTP was induced with tetanic stimulation at time 0 (arrow). Open and filled symbols represent 7- to 9-week-old mice and postnatal 9- to11-day-old mice, respectively. Square and circle symbols indicate recordings from basal and apical dendritic synapses, respectively. Error bars represent s.e.m. (n = 7 to 9).
