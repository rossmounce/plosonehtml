                Figure 3.  Postembedding immunogold labeling for ε2 subunits in Sch/Com-CA1 synapses in iv mice.(A) Immunogold particles (5 nm) for ε2 subunit are concentrated at synapses (arrows) on spines of pyramidal neurons. Scale bar, 200 nm. (B &amp; C) Cumulative probability curves of ε2 particle density in pyramidal cell spine synapses in the stratum oriens (closed circles) and in the stratum radiatum (open circles) in iv/iv and iv/+ mice at postnatal day 9. This distribution is significantly different (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p&lt;0.05) between the stratum oriens and the stratum radiatum in iv/iv but not in iv/+ mice. (D) Averaged ratios (stratum oriens/stratum radiatum) of ε2 particle density at pyramidal synapses (n = 3 each, t-test *P = 0.08 **P = 0.04, absence of an asterisk indicates P&gt;0.10).
