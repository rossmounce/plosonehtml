                Figure 4.  Right isomerism of the iv/iv mouse hippocampus.Left and right CA3 pyramidal neurons and their axons are colored red and blue, respectively. A postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neuron is at the center, colored black, and it represents postsynaptic neurons in both left and right hemispheres. Closed and open circles are ε2-dominant and ε2-nondominant synapses, respectively. Apical, apical dendrites; Basal, basal dendrites.
