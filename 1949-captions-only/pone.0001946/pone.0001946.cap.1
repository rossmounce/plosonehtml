                Figure 1.  G4 growth curve illustrates how lysis time (L) and burst size (B) were determined.Data are means and standard errors for the number of plaque-forming units (PFU = number of infected cells+free phage particles) at various times during the course of infection. The curve was drawn by hand through the data for illustrative purposes. Two bursts occur during this time window. The first burst started around 15 minutes, the second burst started around 30 minutes.
