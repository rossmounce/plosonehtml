Both quantities are shown on the same scale as the experimental measures, in which growth rate is calculated as the phage concentration after 45 minutes divided by the initial phage concentration. Growth rate on <em>E. coli</em> was calculated as ln<em>B<sub>Ec</sub></em>/(1/(<em>k<sub>Ec</sub>N</em>)+<em>L<sub>Ec</sub></em>)×45 minutes, and profitability of <em>S. typhimurium</em> was calcualated as ln<em>B<sub>St</sub></em>/<em>L<sub>St</sub></em>×45 minutes. Both quantities are described in equation 5.</p>
