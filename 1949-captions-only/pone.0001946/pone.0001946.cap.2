                Figure 2.  Predictions of the optimal foraging model using parameters measured in φX174.Given that φX174 consumes the more profitable host E. coli, we determined the E. coli densities over which φX174 benefits by also consuming the less profitable host S. typhimurium. φX174 should consume S. typhimurium only at host densities where the profitability of S. typhimurium (dashed line) exceeds the growth rate achieved on a diet of only E. coli (solid line). Both quantities are shown on the same scale as the experimental measures, in which growth rate is calculated as the phage concentration after 45 minutes divided by the initial phage concentration. Growth rate on E. coli was calculated as lnBEc/(1/(kEcN)+LEc)×45 minutes, and profitability of S. typhimurium was calcualated as lnBSt/LSt×45 minutes. Both quantities are described in equation 5.
