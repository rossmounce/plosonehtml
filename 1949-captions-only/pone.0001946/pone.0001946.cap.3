                Figure 3.  The generalist phenotype of φX174 is costly at high host density (108 bacteria/mL) but advantageous at low host density (106 bacteria/mL).Data are the differences between ln(growth rate) in mixed host cultures containing E. coli and S. typhimurium (ES) and ln(growth rate) in pure host cultures containing only E. coli (E). The dotted line represents equal growth in both host composition treatments. Each data point represents the mean of 5 replicates±95% confidence intervals.
