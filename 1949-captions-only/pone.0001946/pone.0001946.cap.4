                Figure 4.  Evolutionary response in the attachment rate to S. typhimurium during adaptation to two-host microcosms.For individual populations, responses were calculated as k10−k0, where ki was the mean attachment rate measured after i generations (passages) of adaptation to growth at high or low host density. Data are grand means±95% confidence intervals based on four replicate evolution experiments. The black dot (low density) indicates a difference significantly greater than 0 (1-tailed paired t-test, P = 0.0056).
