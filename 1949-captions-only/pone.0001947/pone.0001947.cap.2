                Figure 2.  DTAB causes anterior-posterior axis defects.a) Chemical structure of DTAB. b) Embryos treated with higher concentrations of DTAB showed more anterior-posterior patterning defects than those treated with lower concentrations. Zebrafish embryos were treated from 1hpf to 48hpf with different concentrations of DTAB. c) Embryos treated earlier in development, and thus for longer duration were more severely affected than those treated later. Embryos were exposed to 3 ÂµM DTAB from different times of development to 48hpf and compared to embryos treated with the vehicle DMSO. Vehicle (DMSO) treated controls developed normally. All observations were made at 48hpf.
