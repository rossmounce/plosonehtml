DTAB treated embryos exhibited an upregulation of <em>cyp26a1</em> transcripts in the tail and head. Embryos were treated with 12.5 µM DTAB or DMSO control from 4hpf onwards until fixation. Embryos were fixed at 75% epiboly (G–L), 10-somite (M–N), 18-somite (C–F) and 26-somite (A,B) stages. A–B, E–F, M–N are lateral views with anterior to the left and dorsal to the top. C–D are dorsal views with anterior to the left. G–L are dorsal views with the animal pole to the top.</p>
