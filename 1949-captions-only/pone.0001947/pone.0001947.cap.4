DEAB alone caused pericardial edema, twisted body axis and downregulation of <em>cyp26a1</em>. DEAB treatment did not affect the <em>ntl</em> staining while RA and DTAB treatment led to a loss of <em>ntl</em> staining in the dorsal margin. DTAB, RA and DTAB+DEAB caused an increase in <em>cyp26a1</em> staining but DEAB alone caused downregulation of <em>cyp26a1</em>. Embryos were treated with DTAB (12.5 µM), RA (1 µM), DEAB (10 µM) and DTAB+DEAB or DMSO from 1hpf to 48hpf (for the bright field photography) and to 70% epiboly (for <em>in situ</em> hybridization for <em>ntl</em> and <em>cyp26a1</em>). Live bright field embryos are shown anterior to the left and dorsal to the top. <em>In situ</em> hybridized embryos, are shown, dorsal view with the animal pole to the top. b) DTAB and RA treatment caused an expansion in the distance between the <em>krox20</em> and <em>myoD</em> positive domains. DEAB caused a compression of the ‘neck’ region and led to a decrease in the distance between <em>krox20</em> and <em>myoD</em> domains. Embryos treated with DMSO, DTAB (1.6 µM), RA (0.125 µM) and DEAB (10 µM) were fixed at 9-somite stage and hybridized for <em>krox20</em> (rhombomeres 3 &amp; 5) and <em>myoD</em> (somites). Following <em>in situ</em> hybridization the embryos were de-yolked and flattened under a coverslip for better visualization.</p>
