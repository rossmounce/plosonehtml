                Figure 5.  DTAB selectively activates RARβ and RARγ receptors.RA showed high efficiency in activating the RAR and RXR receptors. DTAB was a potent activator of RARβ and RARγ, but showed reduced efficiency towards RARα and RXRs. Hek293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, a β-gal transfection-control plasmid and an RA receptor plasmid, as indicated. Cells were treated with 10−9 M to 10−5 M concentrations of DTAB or RA at 24 hours after transfection and harvested at 48 hours post transfection for luciferase and β-gal reporter assays. RA treated cells are shown by solid green squares and line and DTAB treated cells by solid blue triangles and line. Control cells transfected with only the luciferase and β-gal reporter plasmids (with no RA receptor plasmid) and treated with various concentrations of RA are shown by dashed gray line and gray circles. All luciferase readings were normalized to β-gal transfection controls. β-gal readings remained approximately equal throughout each experimental set showing equal transfection efficiency and cell viability. X-axis denotes RA or DTAB concentration. Y-axis represents arbitrary luminescence values. All RA and DTAB activities were normalized to the respective no-treatment controls. The maximum activity was set to 100% and all values calculated thereof.
