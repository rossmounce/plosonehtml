(A) Relative positions of SNPs analyzed in this study. GWA SNPs from WTCCC and Cardiogenics CAD/MI case-control study are shown above the four SNPs genotyped in this work (gt SNPs). From left to right: rs6855911, rs7442295, rs6449213, and rs12510549. (B) Graphic illustration of genes in this genomic region. Relative positions of RefSeq genes with gene names are presented. Exons are depicted as vertical blocks and orientation of genes is indicated by arrows on the horizonal lines representing introns. <em>GLUT9</em> gene is highlighted with bold letters. (C) Delineation of LD structure. Pairwise <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>-values between markers from HapMap phase II release 22 for the CEPH (CEU) sample were calculated and presented. Red denotes perfect LD with <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 1 and decreasing <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>-values are shown in brighter color with white representing <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.</p>
