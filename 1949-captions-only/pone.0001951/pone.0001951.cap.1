(C) The bar graph depicts the bits of mutual information between the MDM2 SNP309 locus and the age of tumor onset, gender and the age of tumor onset and lastly between all three variables. The associated p-values are depicted below. (D) The cumulative incidence of tumor diagnosis for both the individuals T/T in genotype (black squares) and T/G or G/G (SNP309) in genotype (grey diamonds) is plotted as a function of age. A square or a diamond represents at least one individual. (E) The cumulative incidence of tumor diagnosis for both males (black squares) and females (grey diamonds) is plotted as a function of age.</p>
