The associated p-values are depicted below. The MDM2 SNP309 locus and the age of tumor diagnosis share significant mutual information only in females and not in males. Statistical significance is represented by the black labeling of the bar graph and the p-values depicted below. The cumulative incidence of all non-gender specific tumor types for both the individuals T/T in genotype (black squares) and T/G or G/G in genotype (grey diamonds) is plotted as a function of age for females (B) and males (C). A square or a diamond represents at least one individual.</p>
