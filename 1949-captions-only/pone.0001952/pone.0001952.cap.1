<h5>Safety and reactogenicity.</h5><a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>Local adverse events observed during the trial included tenderness, pain, swelling, induration, erythema or redness and itching. All local AEs related to the vaccination resolved within 1 to 2 weeks without treatment. Neither vaccine nor placebo recipients experienced any grade 3 or severe reactions.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.sec1.p2"></a><p>The most common adverse event reported was tenderness (58%). This was followed by swelling (18%), induration (9%) and pain at the injection site (10%). 93% of these events were graded as grade 1 or mild in intensity. 75% of the vaccinees experienced tenderness , followed by swelling (42%), local pain (25%), induration(23%), itching (8%), and redness at the injection site (5%). 58% of participants in the placebo control group compared with 80% of total participants in the vaccine groups experienced at least one local adverse event (<a href="#pone-0001952-t001">Table 1</a>). All the events in the placebo group were graded as mild. Out of those vaccinated, 65% experienced events that were graded mild and 15% (6 subjects) experienced moderate adverse events. There was a trend towards more adverse reactions and slightly more moderate adverse reactions with increasing vaccine dose and number of immunizations (<a href="#pone-0001952-t002">Table 2</a>). 8 events of grade 2 or moderate intensity that occurred in the six participants included induration (4 events) and swelling (2 events). 5 were from the highest dose cohort (200) and one from the lowest dose cohort(20). The moderate AE (swelling) in the volunteer receiving 20 dose followed the second immunization.</p>
