                Figure 1.  Subnuclear distribution of U1-70K is affected by protein phosphorylation but not by transcription and dephosphorylation.Confocal images of Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing GFP-U1-70K that were either left untreated (control) or treated with staurosporine, okadaic or actinomycin-D (Act-D) for 2 hours. Inhibition of phosphorylation redistributes U1-70K to larger speckles (Staurosporine). Shown are representative images presented as projections of 10 z-stack slices each 0.5 µm apart of at least 50 examined protoplasts. Bar = 5 µm.
