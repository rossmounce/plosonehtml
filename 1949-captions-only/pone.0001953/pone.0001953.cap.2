Successive images taken after bleaching illustrate the level of return of fluorescence to bleached areas. (A and B) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) images of control cells demonstrate that the GFP-U1-70K recovers fully within less than 10 seconds (A, nucleoplasm) or 20 seconds (B, speckle) indicating that U1-70K turns over very rapidly in speckles and nucleoplasm. (C) FRAP images of a representative protoplast treated with staurosporine show very little or no recovery. (D and E) FRAP images of a representative protoplast treated with actinomycin-D show a control level mobility in the nucleoplasm (D) and significantly reduced mobility in a speckle (E). Bar = 5 µm. (F) Quantification of FRAP data in speckles and the nucleoplasm reveals that U1-70K displays slower mobility in the speckles than in the nucleoplasm. Each data point is the average of 7 to 11 nuclei. Error bars are SEMs. (G) Quantification of FRAP data of U1-70K in nuclei treated with actinomycin-D or staurosporine demonstrates that the mobility of U1-70K is reduced by inhibition of transcription or phosphorylation. Each data point is the average of 5–10 nuclei. Error bars are SEMs.</p>
