Numbers after “Δ” are the deleted amino acids in U1-70K. Stars indicate the location of putative nuclear localization signals (NLS; amino acid sequences are shown below the stars). Table on the right shows the subcellular and subnuclear localization of the U1-70K deletion mutants. (+, present; −, absent). RRM, RNA recognition motif; Arg-rich, arginine-rich region; (B) Confocal images of Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing full-length U1-70K or a deletion mutant as indicated on each panel. Images in the right most column show a zoomed-in nuclear region of images shown under the GFP column. These results show that U1-70K has two independent nuclear- and speckle-targeting signals located in the N-terminal region up to the RRM domain and in the C-terminal arginine-rich region. Bars = 5 µm.</p>
