                Figure 5.  Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)-based mapping of SR45 domains interacting with U1-70K.(A) BiFC vectors harboring U1-70K and a series of deletion mutants of SR45 were made by fusing full-length U1-70K to the N-terminal YFP fragment, YFPN (amino acids 1–155) and of SR45 full-length and deletion mutants to the C-terminal YFP fragment YFPC (amino acids 156–239) as described in Materials and Methods. Numbers after “Δ” show the deleted SR45 amino acids. C-myc, c-myc peptide; HA, hemagglutinin peptide. RS1 and RS2, arginine/serine-rich domain 1 and 2; RRM, RNA recognition motif. (B) BiFC images of Arabidopsis protoplasts co-transfected with U1-70K-YFPN and a full-length or deletion mutant of SR45-YFPC as indicated on each panel show that SR45 interacts with U1-70K through its RS1 or RS2 domain. Bar = 5 µm. (C) Western blot analyses show protein expression levels of U1-70K-YFPN and of full-length and deletion mutants of SR45 fused to YFPC. The U1-70K-YFPN was detected with an anti-c-myc-HRP (upper panel) and SR45 and its deletion mutants fused to YFPC were detected with an anti-HA-HRP antibody (lower panel).
