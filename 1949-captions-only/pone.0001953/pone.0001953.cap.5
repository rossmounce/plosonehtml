Numbers after “Δ” show the deleted SR45 amino acids. C-myc, c-myc peptide; HA, hemagglutinin peptide. RS1 and RS2, arginine/serine-rich domain 1 and 2; RRM, RNA recognition motif. (B) BiFC images of Arabidopsis protoplasts co-transfected with U1-70K-YFP<sup>N</sup> and a full-length or deletion mutant of SR45-YFP<sup>C</sup> as indicated on each panel show that SR45 interacts with U1-70K through its RS1 or RS2 domain. Bar = 5 µm. (C) Western blot analyses show protein expression levels of U1-70K-YFP<sup>N</sup> and of full-length and deletion mutants of SR45 fused to YFP<sup>C</sup>. The U1-70K-YFP<sup>N</sup> was detected with an anti-c-myc-HRP (upper panel) and SR45 and its deletion mutants fused to YFP<sup>C</sup> were detected with an anti-HA-HRP antibody (lower panel).</p>
