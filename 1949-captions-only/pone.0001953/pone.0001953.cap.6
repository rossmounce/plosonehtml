                Figure 6.  Effect of phosphorylation and transcription on the subnuclear localization pattern of SR45/U1-70K BiFC complexes.Arabidopsis protoplasts co-expressing a U1-70K-YFPN and an SR45 full length and deletion mutants as indicated on each panel were treated with staurosporine or okadaic acid. Images show staurosporine re-organized the SR45/U1-70K BiFC complexes into irregular shaped speckles. Bar = 5 Âµm.
