Shown are images immediately before bleach (pre-bleach) and at selected time-points after bleaching. Control is an untreated protoplast; stau. is a protoplast treated with staurosporine for two hours. Bar = 5 Âµm. (C and D) Quantification of FRAP of SR45/U1-70K BiFC complexes in protoplasts. The data suggest that SR45/U1-70K complex moves very slowly in the cells and this movement is not affected by phosphorylation. For discussion, see text. Each data point is the average of 7 nuclei. Error bars are SEMs.</p>
