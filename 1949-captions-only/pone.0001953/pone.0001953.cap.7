                Figure 7.  FRAP analyses of SR45/U1-70K BiFC complex.(A and B) An area indicated by an arrow in a protoplast co-expressing SR45-YFPC and U1-70K-YFPN was bleached with a high intensity 488 laser and imaged at regular intervals for up to 400 seconds. Shown are images immediately before bleach (pre-bleach) and at selected time-points after bleaching. Control is an untreated protoplast; stau. is a protoplast treated with staurosporine for two hours. Bar = 5 Âµm. (C and D) Quantification of FRAP of SR45/U1-70K BiFC complexes in protoplasts. The data suggest that SR45/U1-70K complex moves very slowly in the cells and this movement is not affected by phosphorylation. For discussion, see text. Each data point is the average of 7 nuclei. Error bars are SEMs.
