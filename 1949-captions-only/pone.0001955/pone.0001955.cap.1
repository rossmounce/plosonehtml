                Figure 1.  Establishment of an efficient fusion assay.A) Fusion efficiency of the assay. The MEFs and ESCs were stained with the fluorescent dyes Vybrant DiD and Vybrant DiO respectively before fusion. Fusion efficiency was determined by FACS analysis at 5 h post-fusion, using an unfused mixture of cells as a negative control. Note that previous studies have shown that cell surface dyes rarely diffuse across the cell membranes of stained cells [41]. The dual-labeled cells in the unfused population was most likely due to non-specific binding between the ESCs and MEFs. The green fluorescent dye Vybrant DiO was only used in the determination of fusion efficiency but not in a typical reprogramming experiment (due to interference with the observation of GFP signal). B) Morphology change of MEFs during reprogramming. The forward- and side-scatter profiles of the GFP positive cells were FACS analyzed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-fusion. The morphology of the reprogrammed MEFs changed with time to resemble that of the ESCs. C) Quantification of GFP expression. The number of GFP positive cells was FACS analyzed at 24 and 48 h post-fusion (right panel), using wildtype MEFs that did not carry the Oct4-gfp transgene but had undergone identical fusion treatment with ESCs as a negative control (left panel). The number of GFP positive cells from wt MEFs was subtracted from that of Oct4-gfp MEFs in all calculations.
