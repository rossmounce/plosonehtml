Candidate genes were overexpressed in <em>Oct4-gfp</em>, G418-resistant MEFs via lentivirus infection 72 h before fusion. B) Successful lentiviral overexpression was verified by Western blotting, as well as expression of the positive control mCherry. C) Infected MEFs were harvested at 24 h before fusion and stained with the fluorescent dye Vybrant DiD. Prepared MEFs were plated with unstained ESCs. GFP expression was FACS analyzed at 24 and 48 h post-fusion. G418 was added to the fused cells at 48 h post-fusion, and the formation of G418-resistant, GFP positive colonies was assayed 10 days post-fusion. D) The visible overexpression of mCherry in infected MEFs indicated the effectiveness of our lentiviral overexpression system. Scale bar represents 50 Âµm.</p>
