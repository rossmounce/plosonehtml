                Figure 3.  Overexpression of Sall4 enhanced Oct4-gfp expression and ES cell-like colony formation in MEFs during reprogramming.The percentage of GFP positive MEFs at: A) 24 h and B) 48 h post-fusion. C) The number of GFP positive, G418-resistant colonies in 1 well of a 6-well plate, 10 days post-fusion. The overexpression of Sall4 positively enhanced both Oct4-gfp expression and colony formation of MEFs upon reprogramming.
