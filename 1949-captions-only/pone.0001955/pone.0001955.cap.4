Sall4, mCherry and luciferase were overexpressed in <em>Oct4-gfp</em> MEFs via lentivirus infection. Half of the infected MEFs was fused to ESCs as described, while the other half was not. Only MEFs overexpressing Sall4 and fused to ESCs showed an increased number of GFP positive cells when compared to the negative controls, indicating that overexpression of Sall4 alone did not induce GFP expression. The numbers of GFP positive cells in the infected cells relative to that of the uninfected cells were shown. B) Overexpression of Sall4 did not increase cell doubling time in MEFs. mCherry and two different constructs of Sall4 were overexpressed in MEFs, which were plated onto 6 well plates and assayed for cell number every 24 h. Note that another clone of Sall4 of identical sequence was used as a duplicate. C, D) Infection of Sall4-expressing lentiviruses did not increase the colony formation efficiency in ESCs. Both ESCs and previously reprogrammed MEFs that were tetraploid were infected with lentiviruses expressing Sall4, mCherry or luciferase. D) The infected cells were plated either on gelatin or on feeder cells. The number of colonies formed was assayed after 7 days.</p>
