Sall4 d12, as well as two clones of wt Sall4 of identical sequences, were overexpressed in <em>Oct4-gfp</em> MEFs, which were then fused to ESCs and assayed for GFP expression as described. B) The overexpression of Sall4 d12 resulted in a similar increase in the number of <em>Oct4-gfp</em> cells as wt Sall4, as well as a similar increase in the number of reprogrammed colonies.</p>
