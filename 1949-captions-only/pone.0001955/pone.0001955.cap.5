                Figure 5.  The N-terminal domain is not required for Sall4 function in reprogramming.A) Sall4 d12 mutant behaved similarly to wt Sall4 in reprogramming. Sall4 d12, as well as two clones of wt Sall4 of identical sequences, were overexpressed in Oct4-gfp MEFs, which were then fused to ESCs and assayed for GFP expression as described. B) The overexpression of Sall4 d12 resulted in a similar increase in the number of Oct4-gfp cells as wt Sall4, as well as a similar increase in the number of reprogrammed colonies.
