                Figure 4.  The formation of peptide-ellipticine complexes.(a) Photographs of the complexes with the three peptides at different peptide concentrations and the ellipticine in pure water as a control. The normalized fluorescence spectra of ellipticine in the complexes with EAK16-II (b), EAK16-IV (c) and EFK16-II (d). The insets show the spectra of the complexes with low peptide concentrations.
