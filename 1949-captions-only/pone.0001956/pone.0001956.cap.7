<h4>Cellular toxicity of the complexes and their dilutions</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>From the characterization of the complexes above, it can be summarized that peptide sequence will affect the molecular state of ellipticine in the peptide-ellipticine complexes/assemblies. EAK16-II and EAK16-IV can solubilize protonated ellipticine or encapsulate ellipticine microcrystals, depending on the peptide concentration. EFK16-II, on the other hand, can stabilize neutral ellipticine molecules in addition to the other two states in aqueous solution; the amount of neutral ellipticine that can be carried by EFK16-II assemblies is peptide concentration dependent. The size and structure of the complexes also depend on the type of peptide and peptide concentration. To gain more insight concerning these differences in the molecular state of ellipticine as well as the size and structure of the complexes, we investigated their cellular toxicity against two cancer cell lines and the stability of the complexes upon dilution in water. The information regarding the complex stability after dilution would be useful for later animal studies and preclinical experiments.</p>

For A549 cells (<a href="#pone-0001956-g008">Figure 8a</a>), all peptide-ellipticine complexes reduce the cell viability to less than 0.3 compared with the viability of non-treated cells (viability is 1). The toxicity of complexes is 2-folds higher than that of the ellipticine control with the absence of peptides (light green bar). The peptide controls have some toxicity to the cells, causing the decrease of viability to the values between 0.6 and 0.8. The much lower cell viability resulted from the peptide-ellipticine complexes compared with that from the ellipticine control is probably due to the fact that the peptides can stabilize large amounts of ellipticine in aqueous solution as shown in <a href="#pone-0001956-g005">Figure 5</a>. Interestingly, the cells treated with the complexes formulated with 0.5 mg/mL EAK16-II and EAK16-IV have almost zero viability. This may indicate that protonated ellipticine is more effective at killing A549 cells than other forms of ellipticine in the complexes. Such a result seems to contradict to the already known fact that neutral ellipticine is the active form to suppress the cancer cell growth <a href="#pone.0001956-Garbett1">[33]</a>.</p>
