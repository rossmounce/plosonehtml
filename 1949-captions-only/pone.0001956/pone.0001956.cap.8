                Figure 8.  Cellular toxicity of the peptides and their complexes with ellipticine for A549 cells (a) and MCF-7 cells (b).The viability of non-treated cells is 1 (M: cells were treated with culture medium). For the solvent control, cells were treated with pure water (dark green bar); for the drug control, cells were treated with ellipticine in pure water with the absence of peptides (light green bar). Blue bars represent the peptide controls where no ellipticine was added.
