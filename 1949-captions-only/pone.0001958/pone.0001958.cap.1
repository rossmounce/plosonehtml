All values are normalized to RER1 and Î²2m mRNA levels and are relative to WT brain, set to 100. Error bars are SD. Data were generated in two independent experiments. (** <em>P</em>&lt;0.001). (B) Levels of H4K5, H4K8, H4K16, H3K14 acetylation and of H3K9 trimethylation in KIKI and WT mice brains (n = 8). We performed ChIP experiments with antibodies for murine histones H3 and H4 that carry each of the indicated modifications. We used primer pairs from the first intron of the mouse frataxin gene just upstream of the point of insertion of the GAA repeat in KIKI mice. Relative recovery, determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, is expressed in relation to GAPDH and the recovery in samples from WT animals is set to 100 for each antibody. Error bars are SEM. of four independent immunoprecipitations, each quantified in triplicate. (C) Histogram showing the number of genes differentially expressed in KIKI mouse brain (cerebral hemispheres), cerebellum and heart compared to WT mice. Genes with increased expression in KIKI mice are in red, genes with decresed expression in KIKI mice are in green. Only genes showing changes at P&lt;0.005 are counted.</p>
