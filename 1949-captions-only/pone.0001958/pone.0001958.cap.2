                Figure 2.  Effects of HDACI 106 on histone acetylation and FXN mRNA.(A) Structure of HDACI 106. (B) Histone H4 acetylation in normal fibroblast cells (GM08333 Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) was measured by Western blot of total cell lysate after 24 hr incubation with indicated compounds. 9b (N1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-N7-phenylheptanediamide) has been described [22]. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO prior to addition to cell culture to give the final concentration indicated above at 0.1% DMSO. (C) FXN mRNA levels were measured in RNA from isolated PBMCs from carrier/patient pairs (1â€“3) after a 48 hour incubation with 106 or DMSO (at 0.1%). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to determine relative FXN levels between each carrier/patient pair using GAPDH as a control housekeeping gene. Error is represented as the standard deviation of the mean from 3 determinations. Primary lymphocytes were obtained from donor blood from FRDA patients and their carrier relatives (under an approved Human Subjects Protocol, with appropriate informed consent) as described [22].
