(B) Histone H4 acetylation in normal fibroblast cells (GM08333 Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) was measured by Western blot of total cell lysate after 24 hr incubation with indicated compounds. 9b (<em>N</em><sup>1</sup>-(2-methoxyphenyl)-<em>N</em><sup>7</sup>-phenylheptanediamide) has been described <a href="#pone.0001958-Herman1">[22]</a>. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO prior to addition to cell culture to give the final concentration indicated above at 0.1% DMSO. (C) <em>FXN</em> mRNA levels were measured in RNA from isolated PBMCs from carrier/patient pairs (1â€“3) after a 48 hour incubation with 106 or DMSO (at 0.1%). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to determine relative <em>FXN</em> levels between each carrier/patient pair using GAPDH as a control housekeeping gene. Error is represented as the standard deviation of the mean from 3 determinations. Primary lymphocytes were obtained from donor blood from FRDA patients and their carrier relatives (under an approved Human Subjects Protocol, with appropriate informed consent) as described <a href="#pone.0001958-Herman1">[22]</a>.</p>
