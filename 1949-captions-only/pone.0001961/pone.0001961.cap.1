Arrows indicate PGP- positive fibers not double-labelled. <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, Colocalization of phospho-mTOR (<em>green</em>) and myelinated fiber marker N52 (<em>red</em>) in footpad of glabrous skin <em>(C)</em> and hairy skin <em>(D)</em>. Arrows in <em>C</em> indicate N52- positive fibers not double-labelled. Asterisks (*) indicate double-labelled fibers in the area of Meissner corpuscles (sensory receptors within dermal papillae). <em>E</em>, Colocalization of phospho-mTOR and N52 in the dermis of the glabrous skin. In <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>E</em> the single staining for each antibody and the merged image are shown from left to right. In <em>A-E</em> double staining appears in <em>yellow</em>. mc, Meissner corpuscles; ep, epidermis; d, dermis; f, follicle. <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>, single focal planes; <em>B-D</em>, merge of 22–24 z-focal planes (20–21 µm depth). Scale bars, <em>A-E</em>: 50 µm.</p>
