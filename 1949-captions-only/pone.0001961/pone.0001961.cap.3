Animals received an injection of rapamycin or vehicle in the center of the plantar surface 30 min or 2 h before sacrifice. The intensity of the bands for each antibody was normalized with the intensity of the β3-tubulin signal. There was a significant reduction in 4E-BP1/2 and S6K phosphorylation 30 min after rapamycin injection. The reduction in S6 phosphorylation was seen 2 h after rapamycin injection. n = 3–4 in each condition. <em>B</em>, Confocal images of phospho-S6K immunostaining (<em>green</em>) in the glabrous skin 30 min after intraplantar injection of rapamycin or vehicle in the center of the plantar surface of the hindpaw. PGP staining is shown in <em>red</em> and double staining appears in <em>yellow.</em> White arrows indicate double-labelled fibers. Note the overall decrease of phospho-S6K labelling after rapamycin injection. ep, epidermis; d, dermis. Merge of 24 z-focal planes (22 µm depth). Scale bar, 50 µm. <em>C</em>, Semi-quantification of phospho-S6K immunofluorescence in the plantar skin nerve fibers. The <em>y</em> axis represents the percentage of normalised phospho-S6K pixels above a threshold of 50. Measurements were made from confocal images as in <em>B</em>. Diagrams of the plantar surface of the rat paw indicating the area sampled (rectangle) are also included. * <em>P</em>&lt;0.05; ** <em>P</em>&lt;0.01.</p>
