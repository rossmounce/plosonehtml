                Figure 5.  Rapamycin increases A- but not C- nociceptor-evoked paw withdrawal thresholds.Time-course effects of rapamycin or appropriate vehicle, on paw withdrawal thresholds to fast and slow heat ramps that preferentially activate A- and C- nociceptors respectively. N = 3 in each group. Mean±SEM heat withdrawal threshold (°C) for the injected hindpaw is illustrated in each panel. Vertical dashed line indicates the drug injection time. * P&lt;0.05; ** P&lt;0.01.
