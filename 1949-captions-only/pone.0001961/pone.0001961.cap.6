Rapamycin or vehicle were injected intraplantar 4 h before capsaicin administration. All injections were made in the center of the plantar surface of the paw. <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, Secondary mechanical hyperalgesia in the lateral plantar hindpaw was generated by injecting capsaicin into the central plantar surface of the hindpaw. Rapamycin or vehicle pre-treatment was delivered intraplantar in the lateral part of the surface of the hindpaw 4 h before capsaicin injections (see inset diagrams). <em>B</em>, Effect of lateral intraplantar injection of rapamycin or vehicle on mechanical withdrawal threshold on central plantar injection of capsaicin using Von Frey hairs. <em>C</em>, Effect of rapamycin or vehicle on withdrawal response duration to pinprick stimulation after capsaicin. MeanÂ±SEM for the injected (left) hindpaw is illustrated in each panel. M, medial; L, lateral. *** <em>P</em>&lt;0.001.</p>
