                Figure 7.  Changes in physiological properties of mechano-sensitive fibers after rapamycin treatment.A. MeansÂ±SEM are shown. CV, conduction velocity; vFT, Von Frey threshold. Von Frey thresholds are given as the median with the 1st and 3rd quartiles in brackets. B. Box plot of Von Frey thresholds for mechano-sensitive AM- and C- fibers. Data have been normalized by logarithmic (ln) transformation. Horizontal dark bars indicate the median.
