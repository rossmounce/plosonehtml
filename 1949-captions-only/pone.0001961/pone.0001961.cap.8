Rapamycin attenuates mechanical pinprick hyperalgesia in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model.Effect of lateral intraplantar injection of rapamycin, or its vehicle, on withdrawal response duration (s) after nociceptive mechanical stimulation (pinprick stimulus) of the lateral plantar surface of the paw of SNI animals, or sham animals.
