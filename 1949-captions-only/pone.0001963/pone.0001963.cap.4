                Figure 4.  Examples of correlations between the first r-SV and amino acid indices.The abscissa of each panel indicates the value of elements in the first right singular vector of a PSSM where the signs are determined by making the value for cysteine positive. The ordinates are (A) the relative mutability [25], (B) the interior composition of amino acids in intracellular proteins of mesophiles[26], (C) the hydropathy scale[28], and (D) the conformational parameter of beta-turn[27]. The labels on the ordinates indicate the identifiers of the AAindex database (Table 1).
