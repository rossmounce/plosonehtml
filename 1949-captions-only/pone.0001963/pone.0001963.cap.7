                Figure 7.  Decomposed PSSM scores of conserved sites in the globin family.The labels B10, C2, CD1, CD4, E7, F4, and F8 on the top of panels are site identifiers of the globin family defined by Bashford et al.[45] (in the parentheses is the most conserved residue at each site). Rows of the partial matrices  (α = 1, …, 5) as well as M−m1 are plotted for the selected sites. The PSSM is based on the PDB entry 3sdhA[44].
