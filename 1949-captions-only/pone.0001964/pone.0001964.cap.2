                Figure 2.  γCOP is required for efficient luminal protein secretion and matrix expansion in the trachea.(A–I) Confocal micrographs of DT of wild type (A, D, G, J), γCOP mutant (B, E, H, K), btl&gt;γCOP; γCOP/γCOPP1 rescued embryos (C, F, I,). btl&gt;GFP-CAAX embryos were stained for the tracheal luminal antigens 2A12 (A–C), Verm (D–F) and Gasp (G–I) (green), GFP (magenta) and with a chitin binding probe (CBP), white in (J,K). All micrographs are single confocal sections except (J–K), which represent confocal projections. The inserts in J and K show y-z projections. γCOP mutant embryos show strong intracellular retention of tracheal luminal markers. Transgenic re-expression of γCOP largely rescues the luminal secretion phenotype of γCOP mutant embryos. (K and M) The luminal ECM is defective in the trachea of γCOP mutants. Scale bars are 10 µm in A–K and 0.5 µm in L and M.
