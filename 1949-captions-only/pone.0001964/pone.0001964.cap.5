                Figure 5.  γCOP mutant embryos show normal epithelial organization.(A–O) Confocal micrographs show DTs and SG of early stage 16 wild type (A, C, F, F′, H, H′, K, M), γCOP mutant embryos (B, D, G, G′, I, I′, L, N) and sar1 mutant embryos (E, J, J′, O). All micrographs are single confocal sections except (F′–J′) which represent projections. GFP stainings of btl&gt;GFP-CAAX embryos label tracheal cells (magenta). The first two columns from the left represent tracheal DT and the next three columns show SG. Embryos were stained for the apical marker Crb (A–E), the adherens junction marker E-cad (F–J) and septate junction marker Coracle (K–O) (either green or white). No defects in the localization or organization of epithelial markers were detected in γCOP mutant embryos. (P–S) Wide field images of live wild type (P, P′), γCOP (Q, Q′), sar1P1 (R, R′), and Atpα (S) embryos injected with 10 kDa fluorescent dextran (P, Q, R, S). The DT is visualized by expression of GFP-CAAX (P′, Q′, R′). The transepithelial barrier function in the trachea is not affected in γCOP and sar1P1 mutant embryos. Scale bars are 10 µm.
