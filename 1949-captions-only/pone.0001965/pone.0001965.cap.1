The positions of the transcriptional repressor domain (TN), the homeodomain (HD), the NK2-specific domain (SD), and the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) are shown. (B) Soft agar colony formation of A673 cells infected with the indicated RNAi and cDNA constructs. Error bars indicate standard deviations of duplicate assays. (C) Western blot analysis of A673 cells infected with the indicated RNAi and cDNA constructs, using anti-NKX2.2 antibody (to determine the expression of endogenous NKX2.2 following knockdown using the NKX-RNAi construct), anti-FLAG (to assess the expression of cDNA constructs), or anti-tubulin (as a loading control). The positions of endogenous NKX2.2 (end. NKX2.2) and of the exogenous NKX2.2 constructs (exog. NKX2.2) are indicated.</p>
