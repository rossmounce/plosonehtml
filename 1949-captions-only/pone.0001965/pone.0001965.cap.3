                Figure 3.  NKX2.2 downregulated target genes are enriched in the EWS/FLI downregulated dataset.(A) Venn diagram representation of the overlap between EWS/FLI downregulated genes and NKX2.2 downregulated genes. The Chi square-determined p-value is indicated. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using EWS/FLI-regulated genes as the rank-ordered dataset and NKX2.2 downregulated genes as the geneset. EWS/FLI-regulated genes are shown on the x-axis, with upregulated genes toward the left, and downregulated genes toward the right. The positions of genes that were downregulated by NKX2.2 are indicated by the black vertical lines in the center portion of the panel. Ranking metric scores are shown in the bottom portion of the panel. The normalized enrichment score (NES) and p-value are shown.
