                Figure 4.  Role of TLE corepressors in NKX2.2-mediated gene repression.(A) Western blot showing retroviral-mediated expression of dominant-negative TLE (AES) in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells as compared to an empty vector control (“none”). Tubulin is shown as a loading control. (B) Tissue culture growth of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells expressing AES was unchanged as compared to empty vector control bearing cells (“none”). These data are a representative example from multiple experimental replicates. (C) Colony formation of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells in soft agar was inhibited by AES expression, as compared to empty vector control infected cells (“none”). Error bars indicate standard deviations of duplicate assays.
