The OD595 of crystal violet staining is shown on the y-axis, and is proportional to cell number. (B) Addition of the indicated concentrations of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat caused a dose-dependent decrease in soft agar colony formation of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells. Error bars indicate standard deviations of duplicate assays. (C) 0.6 ÂµM of vorinostat is sufficient to cause an increase of acetylated histone H4 in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells, as observed by Western blot, as compared to vehicle control. Total histone H4 levels are shown as a loading control. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using vorinostat-regulated genes in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells as the rank-ordered dataset and NKX2.2 downregulated genes as the geneset. Vorinostat-regulated genes are shown on the x-axis, with upregulated genes toward the left, and downregulated genes toward the right. The positions of genes that were downregulated by NKX2.2 are indicated by the black vertical lines in the center portion of the panel. Ranking metric scores are shown in the bottom portion of the panel. The normalized enrichment score (NES) and p-value are shown. (E) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using vorinostat-regulated genes in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells as the rank-ordered dataset and the 72 genes downregulated by both EWS/FLI and NKX2.2 as the geneset. The normalized enrichment score (NES) and p-value are shown. (F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using NKX2.2-regulated genes as the rank-ordered dataset and NKX2.2 ChIP-chip targets as the geneset. The normalized enrichment score (NES) and p-value are shown.</p>
