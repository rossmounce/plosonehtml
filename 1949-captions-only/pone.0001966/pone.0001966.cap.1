<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a><p>First, perceptual distances of rotated syllables from each other were constructed using data from a same/different discrimination task performed by an initial group of native-speaking Italian listeners with no prior experience with rotated speech. Subjects were presented with three rotated syllables in a row, and were instructed to indicate whether the third sound was similar to any of the other two. The number of false “same” judgments given to stimulus pairs that differed in the identity of a single consonant or vowel was used as a metric of perceptual distance, on the assumption that pairs of stimuli perceived to be more similar to each other should have a higher incidence of erroneous “same” judgments.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a><p>Data on the phonological distances of rotated sounds was then collected by compelling a second, independent set of native-speaking Italian listeners (with no previous exposure to rotated stimuli) to provide phonological descriptions of the same spectrally-rotated syllables used in the discrimination experiment. Participants typed onomatopoetic descriptions of rotated syllables on a computer keyboard (in Italian, unlike English, there is good correspondence between phonological patterns for vowels and consonants for written and spoken forms). Using these primary data, identification matrices were compiled for both rotated consonants and vowels, which represent the proportion of cases in which each rotated vowel or consonant (a row of the matrix) is identified with each unrotated vowel or consonant (the columns of the matrix). Phonological distances were quantified using the numbers in the identification matrix row values of two rotated sounds, on the assumption that sounds that are more phonologically distant should exhibit a more divergent pattern of identification values across vowel and consonant categories.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec1.p6"></a><p>By using stimuli that none of the subjects reported hearing as speech, and comparing phonological distance with perceptual distance data collected from two independent, naïve groups of subjects, we could assure that any pattern of resemblances between these two data sets reflects the naïve perceptual status of the stimuli. If the pattern of perceptual differences significantly resembles the pattern of phonological distances, there are two possible explanations: either variation in rotated syllables is naïvely perceived in a phonetic-like manner to some extent, or perception is solely based on physical acoustic similarity, and two sounds that are acoustically similar will be given similar phonological descriptions. These explanations can be tested by quantifying the acoustic distance relations among stimulus sounds and examining whether phonological and acoustic distances independently account for variation in discrimination performance.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec1.p7"></a><p>In order to be able to measure the physical acoustic similarities between sounds in a perceptually-valid, uniform and reliable way, we focused on a subset of the information in the stimulus sounds, the vowels. Vowels were selected because consonants vary widely in their meaningful acoustic features–for example, high-frequency bursts of wide-band noise are important for fricatives, while glides and liquids do not contain these but instead rely on changing frequency relations between more discrete tonal energy bands called formants <a href="#pone.0001966-Wright1">[10]</a>. Any attempt to compare acoustic similarity among consonants that do not contain the same structural acoustic features runs up against the unsolved problem of how to weight differences in shared and unshared features in a perceptually meaningful way. Consonants also depend on dynamically-varying acoustic properties which are more difficult to measure robustly. Vowels, on the other hand, are an important class of speech sounds that all have a similar acoustic structure, allowing a subset of perceptually-relevant acoustic features to be measured and compared in a robust and uniform way. Physical acoustic distances for each pair of vowels were defined by the differences in center frequencies of the three lowest energy bands or formants in their Discrete Fourier Transform spectrum, measured in the steady-state portion at the center of each vowel. By looking in detail at the correspondence between discrimination errors, phonological identification results and acoustic physical distance measures for the vowel portions of the stimuli, the relative roles of processing based on phonology and processing based on physical acoustic similarity could be quantitatively evaluated.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p8" name="article1.body1.sec1.p8"></a><p>If rotated vowel sounds are not initially processed phonologically, naïve discrimination errors should be inversely related to physical acoustic distance; any relations between phonological distance and discrimination errors should be due to phonological distances mirroring acoustic distances. Under this model, acoustic distances will significantly explain some proportion of the variance in discrimination performance, and phonological distances will not explain any significant variance in addition to that explained by acoustic distance. If, on the other hand, the sounds are initially processed by the native language phonological system, there should be an independent effect of phonological distance on the discrimination of such sounds–phonological distances should explain a significant proportion of the variance in discrimination performance in addition to that explained by acoustic distances.</p>

<h4>Discrimination performance</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a><p>The naïve perception of rotated speech syllables was evaluated using a “same or different” discrimination experiment with a set of 20 naïve participants, none of whom reported perceiving any of the rotated syllables as speech. Subjects listened to trials containing three stimuli in a row, and judged whether the third stimulus was the same as the first or second stimulus or different from both. Separate runs tested discrimination of rotated consonant and vowel pairs, each using 10 subjects; the stimuli within each trial of a single run differed only by a consonant or a vowel respectively (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). The number of erroneous “same” judgments over all the repetitions of each pair in different consonantal or vowel contexts was used to construct vowel and consonant discrimination error matrices for each subject, in which each cell represents the number of discrimination errors for the pair of vowels or consonants in the corresponding row and column (10 pairs from 5 vowels, 105 pairs from 15 consonants). These data averaged across subjects provided the matrix of discrimination errors for each vowel or consonant pair. Significant heterogeneity was found in the proportion of discrimination errors among different rotated vowel pairs, and among different rotated consonant pairs (Friedman nonparametric two-way ANOVA <a href="#pone.0001966-Siegel1">[11]</a>, F<sub>r</sub> = 59.9, df = 9, p&lt;0.0001 for vowels; F<sub>r</sub> = 221, df = 104, p&lt;0.0001 for consonants), demonstrating that rotated syllables initially have differential perceptual identities.</p>


<h4>Phonological identification</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a><p>To assess whether phonology could play a role in the initial perceptual status of rotated sounds, we needed to assess the naive perceptual identity of rotated syllables when processed phonologically. An independent group of ten native-speaking Italian participants, who were naïve to rotated speech and to the purpose of the experiment, described their phonological perception of the rotated syllables by typing them onomatopoetically on a computer keyboard. The participants were told to describe each sound with a syllable, as would be used to explain what it sounded like to a friend who is not present, and were free to listen to each sound as many times as they liked before recording a response. All 10 participants reported that they did not perceive any of the rotated syllables as speech. Participants requested to hear each stimulus an average of 4.03±0.96 times before providing a description (ranging from 2.60±1.07 times to 7.10±3.69 for particular stimuli), indicating that the stimuli were not easy to consciously identify with speech sounds. The phonological identity of each rotated vowel and consonant was obtained from these descriptions. The phonological identities were averaged over all the repetitions of consonants and vowels in different contexts, and identification matrices were constructed for each subject. The close forms for the vowel ‘e’ and the vowel ‘o’ were combined into the same category as their respective open forms, since these were not separable by written symbols. Identification matrices for consonants and vowels showed high similarities among the individual participants, and were combined to produce summary identification matrices of the onomatopoetic responses of all participants (<a href="#pone-0001966-t001">Tables 1</a> &amp; <a href="#pone-0001966-t002">2</a> for vowels and consonants, respectively; additional information on the relatively rare identifications of rotated consonants as vowels is given in the Supporting Information <a href="#pone.0001966.s001">Text S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0001966.s006">Tables S5</a>, <a href="#pone.0001966.s007">S6</a>). Phonological distances between pairs of rotated vowels and consonants (5 vowels yield 10 paired comparisons, 15 consonants yield 105 paired comparisons) were obtained from these phonological descriptions by calculating the differences between the perceptual identification percentages of each pair of rotated vowels and consonants (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>).</p>
