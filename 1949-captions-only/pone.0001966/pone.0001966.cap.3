The dotted lines outline the elliptical centers of Italian vowel categories <a href="#pone.0001966-Peterson1">[13]</a> and are labeled with their corresponding phonetic identities; the color of each ellipse codes vowel identity and is used to indicate the most common percept of each vowel stimulus (the color of its plotting symbol).</p>
