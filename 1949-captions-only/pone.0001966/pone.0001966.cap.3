                Figure 3.  Second formant frequency (F2, y-axis) as a function of first formant frequency (F1, x-axis) for spectrally-rotated vowels.The letters used as plotting symbols denote the identity of each stimulus vowel before rotation (a = /a/, e = /e/, i = /i/, o =  /o/, u = /u/). The dotted lines outline the elliptical centers of Italian vowel categories [13] and are labeled with their corresponding phonetic identities; the color of each ellipse codes vowel identity and is used to indicate the most common percept of each vowel stimulus (the color of its plotting symbol).
