                Figure 4.  Discrimination error versus (a) acoustic distance (in Hz) and (b) phonological distance (normalized units) for vowels.Each data point in each diagram represents the average number of errors made over all subjects for each vowel pair discrimination in each consonantal context (10 vowel pairs√ó15 consonantal contexts = 150 data points). The data shown in (b) is represented in a different format in Figure 2b, where all of the 15 consonantal contexts involving the same vowel pair discrimination have been combined (for a total of 10 data points).
