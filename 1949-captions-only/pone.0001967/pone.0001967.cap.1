The isotype-matched control mAb is shown in the shaded profile. (B) Correlation analysis of Sn expression and viral load. Sn expression on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes from HIV seropositive subjects (<a href="#pone-0001967-t001">Table 1</a>, n = 24) was determined by flow cytometry and quantified as a geometric mean for each subject. Pearson's correlation analysis showed statistical significance between Sn expression and the log of the subject's viral load (p&lt;0.0017). (C) Correlation analysis of Sn expression and CD4 (counts/ml) revealed no significant relationship (p&lt;0.08).</p>
