                Figure 1.  Sn expression on CD14+ monocytes from HIV seropositive individuals.(A) Representative frequency histograms of relative Sn expression on CD14+ monocytes isolated from subjects with high viral load (HVL, 214,000 RNA copies/ml, thick black line), low viral load (LVL, 6,350 RNA copies/ml, thin black line) and a seronegative control (dotted line). The isotype-matched control mAb is shown in the shaded profile. (B) Correlation analysis of Sn expression and viral load. Sn expression on CD14+ monocytes from HIV seropositive subjects (Table 1, n = 24) was determined by flow cytometry and quantified as a geometric mean for each subject. Pearson's correlation analysis showed statistical significance between Sn expression and the log of the subject's viral load (p&lt;0.0017). (C) Correlation analysis of Sn expression and CD4 (counts/ml) revealed no significant relationship (p&lt;0.08).
