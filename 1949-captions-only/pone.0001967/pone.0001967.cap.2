Sn expression on IFN-α-, IFN -γ- or TNF-α-treated cells (thick black lines) and untreated cells (thin black line) were relative to an isotype-matched mAb control (shaded region). Results shown are representative histograms from three independent experiments using monocytes from three seronegative donors.</p>
