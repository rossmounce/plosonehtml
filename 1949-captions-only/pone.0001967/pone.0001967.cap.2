                Figure 2.  Interferon-α and -γ induce Sn expression on CD14+ monocytes and THP-1 cells.Cells were cultured in 500 U/ml IFN-α, 100 U/ml IFN-γ or 10 ng/ml TNF-α at 37°C for 48 h and analyzed for Sn expression by flow cytometry. Sn expression on IFN-α-, IFN -γ- or TNF-α-treated cells (thick black lines) and untreated cells (thin black line) were relative to an isotype-matched mAb control (shaded region). Results shown are representative histograms from three independent experiments using monocytes from three seronegative donors.
