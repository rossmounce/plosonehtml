THP-1 cell line was transduced with a plasmid encoding Sn cloned downstream of the high-level constitutive promoter CMV. Cell lysates were standardized, reduced with DTT and 10 µg of protein were loaded into each well: monocytes (lane 1), IFN-α-induced monocytes (lane2), THP-1 (lane 3) and TSn (lane 4) (M, molecular size marker). (B) Histogram of relative distribution of Sn on the cell surface of TSn clone. TSn (thick black line) and THP-1 cells (thin black line) were evaluated for Sn expression by flow cytometry using anti-Sn mAb 7D2 relative to the background isotype-matched control mAb (shaded region).</p>
