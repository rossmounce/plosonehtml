                Figure 4.  Sn binds HIV-1 in vitro.(A) TSn binds HIV-1 in an Sn-dependant manner. TSn and THP-1 were incubated with lab-adapted HIV-1NL4-3, an HIV-1 clade B primary isolate or clade C primary isolate for 1 h at 37°C, washed and then assayed for HIV-1 p24 by ELISA. HIV-1 binding to Sn was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with Sn mAb 7D2 or by pretreatment of HIV-1 with broad-spectrum sialidase. Pretreatment with IgG1 isotype control or CD4 mAbs did not reduce binding. Data presented are the average of 3 separate experiments. (B) IFN-α-treated CD14+ monocytes bind HIV-1 in an Sn-dependant manner. HIV-1 binding assays were also performed on CD14+ monocytes from seronegative controls treated with 500 U/ml IFN-α to induce Sn expression. Pretreatment with Sn mAb 7D2 and sialidase dramatically reduced HIV-1 binding while pretreatment with IgG1 isotype control or CD4 mAbs had little effect. Data represents monocytes from four separate donors. Error bars represent SD.
