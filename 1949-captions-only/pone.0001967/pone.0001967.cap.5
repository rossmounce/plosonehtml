Cells were incubated with HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> for 1 h, washed and then cocultured with TZM-bl cells for 48 h. HIV-1 infection of TZM-bl was defined by luciferase expression and quantified as relative light units (RLU). Cells pretreated with Sn mAb 7D2 showed significantly reduced capacity to facilitate <em>trans</em> infection of TZM-bl cells while mAb IgG1 isotype control had no effect. (B) HIV-1 receptor inhibitors block <em>trans</em> infection. Receptor and coreceptor requirements for <em>trans</em> infection of TZM-bl cells were tested by incubating TZM-bl cells with receptor inhibitors including mAbs to CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5, and small molecules AMD3100 or TAK779 prior to adding TSn with bound HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>. The CD4, CXCR4, CCR5, AMD3100 and TAK779 receptor inhibitors were tested individually with TZM-bl and did not induce luciferase expression (data not shown). As a control, productive infection of TSn cells was prevented by addition of indinavir (100 µM). Data presented are the average of three separate experiments. Error bars represent SD.</p>
