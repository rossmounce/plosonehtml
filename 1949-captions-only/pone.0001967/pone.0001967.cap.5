                Figure 5.  Sn-dependent trans infection of reporter cells TZM-bl.(A) Sn-expressing cells, TSn and IFN-α-induced monocytes, bind HIV-1 and infect TZM-bl cells in trans. Cells were incubated with HIV-1NL4-3 for 1 h, washed and then cocultured with TZM-bl cells for 48 h. HIV-1 infection of TZM-bl was defined by luciferase expression and quantified as relative light units (RLU). Cells pretreated with Sn mAb 7D2 showed significantly reduced capacity to facilitate trans infection of TZM-bl cells while mAb IgG1 isotype control had no effect. (B) HIV-1 receptor inhibitors block trans infection. Receptor and coreceptor requirements for trans infection of TZM-bl cells were tested by incubating TZM-bl cells with receptor inhibitors including mAbs to CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5, and small molecules AMD3100 or TAK779 prior to adding TSn with bound HIV-1NL4-3. The CD4, CXCR4, CCR5, AMD3100 and TAK779 receptor inhibitors were tested individually with TZM-bl and did not induce luciferase expression (data not shown). As a control, productive infection of TSn cells was prevented by addition of indinavir (100 µM). Data presented are the average of three separate experiments. Error bars represent SD.
