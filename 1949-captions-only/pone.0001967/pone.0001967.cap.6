Monocytic cells, TSn or THP-1 cells, were added and cocultured for 48 h. The capacity of Sn to capture HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> in the cell culture medium and <em>trans</em> infect TZM-bl cells was analyzed for TSn, THP-1 and cell-free virus. Luciferase expression in HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>-infected TZM-bl cells was quantified as relative light units (RLU). Results were compiled from 3 separate experiments. Error bars represent SD.</p>
