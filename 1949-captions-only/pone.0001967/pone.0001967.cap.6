                Figure 6.  Sn-expressing cells capture HIV-1NL4-3 and enhance infectivity.TZM-bl cell cultures were seeded with various concentrations of HIV-1NL4-3 (800â€“8000 pg/ml). Monocytic cells, TSn or THP-1 cells, were added and cocultured for 48 h. The capacity of Sn to capture HIV-1NL4-3 in the cell culture medium and trans infect TZM-bl cells was analyzed for TSn, THP-1 and cell-free virus. Luciferase expression in HIV-1NL4-3-infected TZM-bl cells was quantified as relative light units (RLU). Results were compiled from 3 separate experiments. Error bars represent SD.
