                Figure 2.  Example of individual TE profiles obtained by Transposon Display with Aara8, Ozymandias, and Crusoe.Each peak in the TE profile corresponds to one TE insertion in the individual analyzed. Because the probability that two TE copies would be inserted independently at the same site in two different individuals is negligible, fragments of the same size were assumed to be of identical descent, and each TE fragment of a given size was considered to be a single insertion. The matrices of the presence/absence of peaks were used to estimate genetic distances and do the PCoA analyses shown in Fig. 3, 4, and 5.
