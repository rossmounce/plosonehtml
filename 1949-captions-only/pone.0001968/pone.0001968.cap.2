Because the probability that two TE copies would be inserted independently at the same site in two different individuals is negligible, fragments of the same size were assumed to be of identical descent, and each TE fragment of a given size was considered to be a single insertion. The matrices of the presence/absence of peaks were used to estimate genetic distances and do the PCoA analyses shown in <a href="#pone-0001968-g003">Fig. 3</a>, <a href="#pone-0001968-g004">4</a>, and <a href="#pone-0001968-g005">5</a>.</p>
