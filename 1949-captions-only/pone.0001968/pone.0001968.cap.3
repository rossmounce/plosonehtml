                Figure 3.  Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCoA) of the Aara8 profiles obtained by the Transposon Display technique.The ellipses, calculated for each population, were centered on the gravity centre of each scatterplot, and the size of their axes was equal to 1.5 (the square root of the eigen values of the covariance matrix) times the standard deviation of the coordinates of the projections on the first and second axes. The percentage of variance explained by the first two axes was 75.4%, and the F value of MANOVA test between individuals of each molecular form was equal to 18.6 (p&lt;0.001).
