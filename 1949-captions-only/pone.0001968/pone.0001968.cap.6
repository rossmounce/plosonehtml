                Figure 6.  Frequencies of the 20 insertion sites sequenced in the M (red squares), and S (green squares) molecular forms.Insertion sites localized on the chromosomes: Crusoe-1-2, Ozym-1. Insertion sites localized on the unknown chromosome: Aara8-2-3-5. Insertion sites integrated within other transposable elements or repeated sequences: Aara8-1-4-6, Ozym-2-5, Crusoe-3-4. Insertion sites not isolated: Aara8-7, Ozym-3-4-6-7, Crusoe-5-6.
