                Figure 7.  Position on chromosomes 2 and 3 of the three TE insertions specific to the M molecular form (in box).The loci Ag2H325, Ag2H417, Ag2H769, Ag3H555, Ag3H170, Ag3H750 from [8], kdr from [4], and Ion channel and LIM from [17], have been shown to differentiate the two M and S forms in previous studies. The chromosomal inversions of the An. gambiae genome are indicated below the chromosome arms. The GPRor39, GPRor38, and UNK1 loci, indicated by asterisks, have been shown to discriminate between the two forms only in Cameroon [16].
