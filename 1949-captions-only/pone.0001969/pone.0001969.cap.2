Statistical analysis of all the strains revealed a significant difference, the p-value for the ANOVA analysis was 9.6e<sup>−15</sup>, and for the Kruskal-Wallis test was 2.4e<sup>−5</sup>. Animals are not included that did not develop local disease before the end of the experiment or before reaching a moribund state. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.</p>
