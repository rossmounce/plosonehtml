                Figure 2.  Rapidity of otologic disease onset.Scatter plot showing the number of days it took for chinchillas inoculated with each of the S. pneumoniae clinical strains to develop moderate or worse (score ≥2) otologic disease, where each triangle represents a single animal. Statistical analysis of all the strains revealed a significant difference, the p-value for the ANOVA analysis was 9.6e−15, and for the Kruskal-Wallis test was 2.4e−5. Animals are not included that did not develop local disease before the end of the experiment or before reaching a moribund state. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.
