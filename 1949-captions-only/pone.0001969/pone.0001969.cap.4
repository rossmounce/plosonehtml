                Figure 4.  Days to moribund condition.Scatter plot illustrating the timing to the development of a moribund condition for each of the fourteen pneumococcal strains in the chinchilla model of otitis media. No moribundity was observed in the cohorts inoculated with TIGR4(4) or the unencapsulated strain BS293. Each triangle represents a single animal. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.
