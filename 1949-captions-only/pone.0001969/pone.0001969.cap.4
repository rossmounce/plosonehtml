No moribundity was observed in the cohorts inoculated with TIGR4(4) or the unencapsulated strain BS293. Each triangle represents a single animal. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.</p>
