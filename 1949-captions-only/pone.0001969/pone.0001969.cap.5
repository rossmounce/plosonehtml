Statistical analysis of all the strains did not reveal a significant difference among them. Each triangle represents a single animal. Animals are not included that did not develop disease before the end of the experiment. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.</p>
