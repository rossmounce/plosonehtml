Statistical analysis of all the strains revealed a significant difference (ANOVA p-value = 0.03 and Kruskal-Wallis p-value =  0.00118). Each triangle represents a single animal. Animals were not included that did not develop systemic disease before the end of the experiment. Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.</p>
