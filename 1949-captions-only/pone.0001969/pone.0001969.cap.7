Statistical analysis of all the strains revealed a significant difference (ANOVA p-value = 2.69e<sup>−9</sup> and Kruskal-Wallis p-value = 4.2<sup>−6</sup>). Colors represent different serotypes, and shades of the same color different strains of the same serotype or in the case of BS68(9) two cohorts from different experiments. NA: non applicable.</p>
