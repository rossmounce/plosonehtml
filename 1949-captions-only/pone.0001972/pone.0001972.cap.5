                Figure 5.  Representative macroscopic images of the uteri and mammary gland.Uterus of non-mature unmanipulated mouse is compared to those of non-pubertal mouse grafted with immature cortex (NNC), two months after transplantation and of pubertal mice grafted with immature cortex (NAC), six months after transplantation. All images are at the same magnification. Scale bar, 1 cm. Representative whole mount of mammary glands from non mature mouse is compared to the mammary gland from a pre-pubertal mouse grafted with immature cortex (NNC) at mid pregnancy.
