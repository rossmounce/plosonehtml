The upper band (3.8 kb) corresponds to the paternal methylated allele (P) and the lower band (0.3 kb) corresponds to the maternal unmethylated allele (M). Probe is marked by thick black line. (B) <em>H19</em> ICR methylation was analyzed in DNA from three tissues: kidney (Ki), muscle (Mu), and tongue (To) in unmanipulated (white) or grafted animals (black). ***, p&lt;0.001 for kidney compared to both other groups (muscle and tongue) (C) <em>H19</em> ICR ratio was represented in unmanipulated (control, white) or grafted animals (black) in three tissues according to the manipulated group. (D) <em>Lit1</em> KvDMR1 methylation was determined by Southern blotting after digestion with <em>Sma I</em> (Sm) and <em>Apa I</em> (Ap) enzymes. The upper band (2.6 kb) corresponds to the maternal methylated allele (M) and the lower band (0.9 kb) corresponds to the paternal unmethylated allele (P). Probe is marked by thick black line. (E) <em>Lit 1</em> KvDMR1 ratio was compared in muscle (Mu) and tongue (To) from unmanipulated (white bar) or grafted animals (black bar). ***, p&lt;0.001 for tongue vs muscle.</p>
