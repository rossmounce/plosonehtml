                Figure 1.  Genetic diversity among 22 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested by CGH.The dendogram was produced by weighted pair group method (WPGMA) clustering using a Pearson correlation based distance measure defined on regional z-score values. The red color indicates deletions in the clinical isolates compared to the reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv, whereas the green color shows extra regions in the clinical isolates not present in the reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv.
