                Figure 2.  Regions chosen for PCR verification based on the CGH array analysis.The dendogram based on CGH array analysis of 22 M. tuberculosis isolates from Myanmar (11 Beijing, 4 ST42, 2 ST89 and 5 previously unreported [UR] shared-types [ST]) was produced by weighted pair group method (WPGMA) clustering using a Pearson correlation based distance measure defined on regional z-score values, corresponding to P-values between 1e-3 and 1e-16. The green color indicates extra regions that are present in the clinical isolates, but not in the reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv, whereas the red color depicts deletions in the clinical isolates compared to the reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv.
