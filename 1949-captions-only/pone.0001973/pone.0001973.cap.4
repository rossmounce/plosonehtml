                Figure 4.  Gene graph of the M.tuberculosis H37Rv 1754c-1765c, Mb1785-1787, MT1808 and MT1812-1813 regions.The graph is based on region z-scores, with each line representing one isolate analyzed by CGH. Region z-scores of more than Â±4.42 (absolute value) occurring in one or more samples, corresponding to a standard normal P-value of 0.00001 (1e-5) indicate deletions (above the 0-line) or extra regions (below 0-line). Red lines represent isolates of the Beijing lineage, green lines; ST42 lineage and blue lines; non-Beijing isolates other than ST42.
