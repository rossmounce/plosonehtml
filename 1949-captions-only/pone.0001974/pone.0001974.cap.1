Birth rate (number of male-female pairings relative to number of litters born) is almost identical between MaD1 and Outbred-S mice when examined over 12 generations (B). When raising a second litter (examined in Generation 6), previously neglectful mice exhibited significantly higher levels of maternal neglect relative to previously nurturing MaD1 mice (C).
