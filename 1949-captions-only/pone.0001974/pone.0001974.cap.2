Litter size was smaller for neglectful mice, but levels did not reach significance(C). Prior to mating, decreases in self-grooming (D) and increases in activity (E) were seen in neglectful relative to nurturing mice (D). For A–C, data from Generations (G) 12 and 15 were combined and for D and E, data from G6, G12, and G15 were combined. Time in light in a light/dark box test, did not differ between mice that would become either neglectful or nurturing when examined in G15 (F). Mice were first examined for anxiety at age 50 when they were group housed and then again after being singly housed for one week. In G17, neglectful mice spent significantly less time floating in the forced swim test relative to nurturing mice (G). Bars represent means±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05; ***  = p&lt;0.001.</p>
