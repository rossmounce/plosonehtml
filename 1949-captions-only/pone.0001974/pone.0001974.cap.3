                Figure 3.  Pups born to previously neglectful mice elicit decreases in maternal care.When raised by either previously nurturing MaD1 mice or Outbred-S mice, pups that were born to previously neglectful MaD1 mothers received significantly higher levels of maternal neglect relative to pups born to previously nurturing MaD1 mice (A). Similarly, the proportion of pups weaned was significantly lower for pups born to previously neglectful MaD1 mothers when raised by either previously nurturing MaD1 mothers or Outbred-S mothers (B). Previously neglectful (relative to nurturing) MaD1 mice weaned a lower proportion of pups when the pups were from nurturing mothers, but the differences did not reach significance (p = 0.071). Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05; **  = p&lt;0.01.
