Similarly, the proportion of pups weaned was significantly lower for pups born to previously neglectful MaD1 mothers when raised by either previously nurturing MaD1 mothers or Outbred-S mothers (B). Previously neglectful (relative to nurturing) MaD1 mice weaned a lower proportion of pups when the pups were from nurturing mothers, but the differences did not reach significance (p = 0.071). Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05; **  = p&lt;0.01.</p>
