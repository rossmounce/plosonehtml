                Figure 4.  Cross-fostered offspring raised by previously neglectful (relative to nurturing) MaD1 mothers show deficits as adults.When results from all offspring were combined, previously neglectful MaD1 mothers negatively impacted offspring adult performance in terms of body weight pre-mating (A), flipping rate pre-mating (B), body weight on postpartum Day 0 (C), and number of maternal defense attacks (D). Additionally, when just offspring from previously nurturing MaD1 mothers were examined, they exhibited significantly lower levels self-grooming pre-mating when raised by a neglectful mother (E). When just offspring from Outbred-S mothers were examined as adults, deficits in terms of proportion of pups that survive to postpartum Day 10 (a marker of maternal neglect) (F), and the average weight of pups on postpartum Day 10 (G) were observed when these mice were raised by neglectful MaD1 mothers. Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05; **  = p&lt;0.01.
