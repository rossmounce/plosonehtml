Significantly higher levels of c-Fos are found in ZI, VTA, and substantia nigra (SN), all of which are involved in dopamine production. Both nucleus accumbens shell (AcS) and core (AcC), which respond to dopamine signaling, also show increased c-Fos in neglectful mice. Other regions examined for c-Fos are shown in <a href="#pone-0001974-t001">Table 1</a>. Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05; **  = p&lt;0.01.</p>
