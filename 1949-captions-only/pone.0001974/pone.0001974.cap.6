Significant elevations of pTH-ir area are found in ZI, but not other dopamine producing regions, in neglectful mice (N = 7) in comparison to nurturing dams (8) (B). TH-ir area does not differ between neglectful (N = 8) and nurturing (N = 8) mice. ZI = zona incerta, VTA = ventral tegmental area, A14 POA = A14 region of preoptic area. Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05.</p>
