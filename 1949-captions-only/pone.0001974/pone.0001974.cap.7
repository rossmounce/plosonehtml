                Figure 7.  Altered pDARPP-32 expression with maternal neglect.Previously neglectful dams (N = 5) have significantly darker optical density of pDARPP-32 expression in Ac and CP when compared to previously nurturing dams (N = 6). Ac = nucleus accumbens, LS = lateral septum, CP = caudate-putamen, BST = bed nucleus of stria terminalis, dorsal, CeA = central amygdala. Bars represent meansÂ±SE. *  = p&lt;0.05.
