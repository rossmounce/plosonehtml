NK cells were stained after 5 days of coculture with uninfected (top) or HIV-1-infected (bottom) MDDC. A representative experiment showing the expression of three NK cell receptors differently modulated by HIV-1-infected MDDC, CD85j (down-regulated), CD161 (up-regulated) and NKp30 (not significantly changed). (b) Overall modifications in the percentage of NKR expression on NK cells after coculture with HIV-1-infected MDDC. Results are expressed as the percentage decrease (negative values) or increase (positive values) in NK cells expressing the different receptors after coculture with HIV-infected MDDC in comparison to coculture with uninfected MDDC. Means+SE of 9 independent experiments. * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01</p>
