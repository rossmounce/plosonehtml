Results are expressed as percentage of receptor expression in the given subset+SE. (b) MDDC were infected with HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> and then cultured alone (DC) or incubated with total NK cells (NK) or with the CD85j<sup>+</sup> or CD85j<sup>−</sup> NK cell subsets. HIV-1 replication was measured by p24 production at the indicated time points. Mean+SE of p24 levels in 8 independent experiments using cells from different donors. p24 levels in NK/MDDC cocultures were compared to those in MDDC cultures * p&lt;0.02, **p&lt;0.001. (b) MDDC were one-round infected with HIV-1/BaL pseudotypes and then cultured alone (DC) or incubated with total NK cells (NK) or with the CD85j<sup>+</sup> or CD85j<sup>−</sup> NK cell subsets. Ninety-six hours later, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured. Results are expressed as means±SE of luciferase activity of 4 independent experiments. CD85j<sup>+</sup> NK cells induced higher levels of inhibition than CD85j<sup>−</sup> NK cells. * p&lt;0.05</p>
