                Figure 3.  Decrease in CD85j+ NK cell cytotoxic activity against DC after co-culture with HIV-1-infected DC.(a) Cytolytic activity of total NK cells (NK), CD85j-enriched NK cells (CD85j+) and CD85j-depleted NK cells (CD85j−) derived from 5-day cocultures with uninfected MDDC (top panels) or HIV-1-infected MDDC (bottom panels) were analyzed for their lysis of HIV-1/GFP infected MDDC. Lysis of target MDDC replicating HIV (GFP+) and not replicating HIV (GFP-) are measured by caspase staining (quadrants B1 and B2, respectively). A representative experiment is shown. (b) Percentages of lysis of HIV-1/GFP+ MDDC target cells by total NK cells or by the CD85j+ or CD85j− subset coculture with uninfected MDDC (HIV-, left panel) or with HIV-1-infected MDDC (HIV+, right panel). Results of 4 independent experiments are summarized. Boxes and whisker plots show the percentiles and median distribution of caspase-stained MDDC. Significant differences between NK cells from cocultures with uninfected MDDC and NK cells from cocultures with HIV-1 Bal-infected MDDC are indicated, **p&lt;0.01.
