Lysis of target MDDC replicating HIV (GFP+) and not replicating HIV (GFP-) are measured by caspase staining (quadrants B1 and B2, respectively). A representative experiment is shown. (b) Percentages of lysis of HIV-1/GFP+ MDDC target cells by total NK cells or by the CD85j<sup>+</sup> or CD85j<sup>−</sup> subset coculture with uninfected MDDC (HIV-, left panel) or with HIV-1-infected MDDC (HIV+, right panel). Results of 4 independent experiments are summarized. Boxes and whisker plots show the percentiles and median distribution of caspase-stained MDDC. Significant differences between NK cells from cocultures with uninfected MDDC and NK cells from cocultures with HIV-1<sub> Bal</sub>-infected MDDC are indicated, **p&lt;0.01.</p>
