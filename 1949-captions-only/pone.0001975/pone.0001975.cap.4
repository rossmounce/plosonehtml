                Figure 4.  Maintenance of CD85j+ NK cell suppression of HIV-1 replication in DC despite the loss of cytotoxic activity after co-culture with HIV-1-infected DC.(a) NK cells (NK) or the CD85j+ or CD85j− NK cell subsets were added to HIV-1/GFP-infected MDDC 2 hours after infection. (b, c) NK cells or the CD85j+ or CD85j− NK cell subsets derived from 5-day cocultures with HIV-1Bal-infected MDDC (b) or uninfected MDDC (c) were added to HIV-1/GFP-infected MDDC. Kinetics of HIV-1/GFP replication are expressed as percentages of MDDC cells expressing GFP (means+SE) at the indicated time points in eight independent experiments (a) or three independent experiments (b,c) Significant differences between HIV-1/GFP-infected MDDC cultures without NK cells (DC) and MDDC/NK cocultures on day 14 are indicated * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.001.
