HIV/GFP-infected MDDC were added to the inserts and GFP expression was monitored over time. The percentages of NK cells expressing GFP in the inserts placed on the different cell cultures are shown: MDDC cultures without NK cells (DC), with total NK cells (NK), with CD85j<sup>+</sup> NK cells (CD85j<sup>+</sup>) and with CD85j<sup>−</sup> NK cells (CD85j<sup>−</sup>). Means+SE of 4 independent experiments. Significant differences between HIV-1/GFP-infected MDDC in transwell on MDDC/NK cocultures and on MDDC alone * p&lt;0.05.</p>
