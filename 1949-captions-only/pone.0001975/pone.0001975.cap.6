Blocking reagents were also added during coculture. MDDC infection was evaluated by measuring p24 in the supernatants 10 days later. The results are expressed as the percentage suppression of p24 (mean+SE) in comparison with HIV<sub>Bal-</sub>infected MDDC not exposed to NK cells in 8 independent experiments. Significant differences in the levels of p24 suppression after incubation with the three anti-HLA class I Abs, with rCD85j or with rCD8j more the three anti-HLA class I Abs in comparison to CD85j<sup>+</sup> NK cells cultured with infected DC without Abs are indicated by asterisks: * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.001 (b) Flow cytometric analysis of rCD85j binding to uninfected MDDC (top panels) or to HIV<sub>Bal</sub>-infected MDDC (bottom panels). MDDC staining with rCD85j as revealed by anti-hIgG-PE Abs (A and D). MDDC staining with a mix of anti-HLA Class I-PE mAbs after incubation with rCD85j (B and E), or with rCD85j and anti-hIgG-PE Abs after incubation with a mix of anti-HLA Class I MAbs. A representative experiment of three is shown. Without rCD85j blockade, nearly all MDDC were stained by anti-HLA-PE (not shown). The concentrations of anti-HLA class I Abs used in blocking experiments (10 Âµg/ml of each anti-HLA class I A,B,C, E and G) totally prevented the detection of HLA class I molecules on MDDC by using labelled anti-HLA class I Abs (not shown). Percentages of positive cells and MFI (<em>italic</em>) are shown. Range of positive rCD85j cells was between 8.2 and 21.9.</p>
