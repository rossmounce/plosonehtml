                Figure 1.  Antimicrobial activity of murine and human macrophage-like cell lines against B. mallei.Intracellular survival of B. mallei was studied over a 20 h period in murine (i.e., J774 and AMJ) and human (i.e., THP1 and U937) macrophage-like cell lines. Data from 8â€“14 independent observations gathered in 3 separate experiments are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges.
