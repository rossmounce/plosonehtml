                Figure 2.  Anti-Burkholderia activity of IFNγ-primed macrophages.The intracellular survival of B. mallei was assessed in control and IFNγ-primed J774 cells. Selected groups of macrophages were treated with 200 U/ml IFNγ 16 h before infection. Data from 6 independent observations gathered on 2 separate experiments are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges. *P&lt;0.01 compared to unstimulated control macrophages.
