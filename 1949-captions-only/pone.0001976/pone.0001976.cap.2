Selected groups of macrophages were treated with 200 U/ml IFNγ 16 h before infection. Data from 6 independent observations gathered on 2 separate experiments are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.01 compared to unstimulated control macrophages.</p>
