Selected groups of macrophages were treated with 200 U/ml IFNγ 16 h before infection. The number of <em>B. mallei</em> recovered from the macrophages was estimated 5 h after the infected macrophages were treated with gentamicin. Data from 16 independent observations gathered on 3 separate experiments are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges. *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 compared to unstimulated control macrophages. **<em>P</em>&lt;0.05 compared to IFNγ-primed macrophages from C57BL/6 mice.</p>
