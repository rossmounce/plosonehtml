                Figure 4.  Antimicrobial activity of reactive nitrogen species generated by Burkholderia-infected macrophages.The ability of B. mallei to generate NO2− in RPMI+ medium is shown in A. Selected samples were treated with 10 µM of the flavin inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). The NO2−-producing capacity of macrophages responding to B. mallei was assessed in low NO3− DMEM medium (B). The survival of B. mallei to increasing concentrations of the NO donor spermine NONOate is shown in C. The effects of 100 µM spermine NONOate on the viability of B. mallei was studied overtime (D). Untreated or spermine-treated B. mallei were used as controls. Data in panel A are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges. The rest of the data represent the mean ± sem.
