Selected samples were treated with 10 µM of the flavin inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). The NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>-producing capacity of macrophages responding to <em>B. mallei</em> was assessed in low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> DMEM medium (B). The survival of <em>B. mallei</em> to increasing concentrations of the NO donor spermine NONOate is shown in C. The effects of 100 µM spermine NONOate on the viability of <em>B. mallei</em> was studied overtime (D). Untreated or spermine-treated <em>B. mallei</em> were used as controls. Data in panel A are represented in box-and-whiskers plots as median, intraquartile and total ranges. The rest of the data represent the mean ± sem.</p>
