                Figure 5.  iscR-deficient B. mallei is hypersusceptible to NO-mediated cytotoxicity.The aconitase activity of B. mallei exposed to spermine NONOate (NO) for 30 min can be seen in panel A. Panel B shows the cytotoxicity of 10 µM spermine NONOate against wild-type (WT) or iscR-deficient B. mallei. The intracellular survival of WT and isogenic iscR-deficient B. mallei was recorded in IFNγ-treated macrophages isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice (B6) or iNOS-deficient congenic controls (C). The % survival after 2 h of infection was estimated according to the number of bacteria originally added to the macrophages. The aconitase activity present in overnight cultures of wild-type or iscR-deficient B. mallei is shown in D. Selected groups of bacteria were treated with 500 µM spermine NONOate for 30 min before the aconitase activity present in cytoplasmic extracts was recorded. Panels A &amp; D represent data of two independent experiments. Data in panel B &amp; C are the mean ± sem from 4–8 independent observations.
