Panel B shows the cytotoxicity of 10 µM spermine NONOate against wild-type (WT) or <em>iscR</em>-deficient <em>B. mallei</em>. The intracellular survival of WT and isogenic <em>iscR</em>-deficient <em>B. mallei</em> was recorded in IFNγ-treated macrophages isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice (B6) or iNOS-deficient congenic controls (C). The % survival after 2 h of infection was estimated according to the number of bacteria originally added to the macrophages. The aconitase activity present in overnight cultures of wild-type or <em>iscR</em>-deficient <em>B. mallei</em> is shown in D. Selected groups of bacteria were treated with 500 µM spermine NONOate for 30 min before the aconitase activity present in cytoplasmic extracts was recorded. Panels A &amp; D represent data of two independent experiments. Data in panel B &amp; C are the mean ± sem from 4–8 independent observations.</p>
