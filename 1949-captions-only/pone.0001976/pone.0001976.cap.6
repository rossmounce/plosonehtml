                Figure 6.  Susceptibility of Burkholderia to ROS generated by macrophages.The susceptibility of B. mallei to increasing concentrations of H2O2 is shown in A. Kinetic analysis of the viability of B. mallei in response to 200 µM H2O2 is shown in B. The cellular localization of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments (C) and GFP-expressing B. mallei (D) was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The host cell nucleus labeled with DAPI (blue), B. mallei (green) and actin (red) are visualized in the merge panel (E). The micrograph is representative of a total of 285 bacteria examined from 33 cells collected in 2 independent experiments. The location of B. mallei in the cytoplasm of control (F) and IFNγ-primed (G) macrophages from C57BL/6 mice was visualized by transmission electron microscopy 3.5 h after infection. Bars in F and G denote 2 and 0.5 µm, respectively. The micrographs are representative of 97 Burkholderia-containing phagosomes from 5 independent experiments. Production of superoxide by B. mallei-infected macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 mice was assessed spectrophotometrically as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (H). Data in panels A, B and G represent the mean ± sem from 6 independent observations.
