Kinetic analysis of the viability of <em>B. mallei</em> in response to 200 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is shown in B. The cellular localization of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments (C) and GFP-expressing <em>B. mallei</em> (D) was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The host cell nucleus labeled with DAPI (blue), <em>B. mallei</em> (green) and actin (red) are visualized in the merge panel (E). The micrograph is representative of a total of 285 bacteria examined from 33 cells collected in 2 independent experiments. The location of <em>B. mallei</em> in the cytoplasm of control (F) and IFNγ-primed (G) macrophages from C57BL/6 mice was visualized by transmission electron microscopy 3.5 h after infection. Bars in F and G denote 2 and 0.5 µm, respectively. The micrographs are representative of 97 <em>Burkholderia</em>-containing phagosomes from 5 independent experiments. Production of superoxide by <em>B. mallei</em>-infected macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 mice was assessed spectrophotometrically as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (H). Data in panels A, B and G represent the mean ± sem from 6 independent observations.</p>
