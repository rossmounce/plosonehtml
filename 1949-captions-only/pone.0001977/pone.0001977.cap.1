                Figure 1.  RI and AIL breeding schemes.The left panel of this figure diagrams breeding of a small recombinant inbred (RI) strain set. Each strain is essentially a set of repeated intercrosses starting with inbred parental strains. The animals are considered inbred at 20 generations. The right panel is an example of breeding an advanced intercross line. (Typically such lines consist of 50–100 animals at each generation rather than the 8 shown.) Letters A–H indicate 8 unique F2 animals, and their offspring “inherit” these identifiers. Breeding pairs are chosen for minimum relatedness at each generation.
