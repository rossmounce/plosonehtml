First (1) parental happlotypes are regenerated if they are not already known and (2) the parents are permuted. Next (3) the population of offspring is regenerated using the permuted genotypes and (4) permuted maps are generated using the non-permuted phenotypes. Finally, (5) the significance of the permuted maps are compared at a pointwise and whole genome basis with the original map.</p>
