Note that for ease of graphing on a -log scale we have adjusted P&lt;1/10000 to P = 0.0001, so the maximum –log P = 4. Simple mapping results are on the left hand scale, while GRAIP results are on the right. On the Chr.4 coat color locus simple mapping value is truncated at LOD = 25, to simplify reading the graph. Shaded gray regions are significant at genome-wide P = 0.05 or better in the GRAIP results.</p>
