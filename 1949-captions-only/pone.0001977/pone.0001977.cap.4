(A) Comparison of simple mapping and GRAIP for BXDs treated as individuals. Red traces are simple mapping output, and the red bar is P = 0.05 for the naïve permutation. Black traces are GRAIP mapping output (5000 permutations) and shaded gray region is significant at genome-wide 0.05 or better in the GRAIP results. (B) simple mapping output for BXD strain means. Black bar indicates P = 0.05 for the naïve (appropriate, in this case) permutation.</p>
