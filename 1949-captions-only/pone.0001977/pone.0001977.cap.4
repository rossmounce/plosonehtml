                Figure 4.  BXD coat color QTL-maps.Coat color QTL maps treating BXD observations as independent individuals versus mapping strain means. (A) Comparison of simple mapping and GRAIP for BXDs treated as individuals. Red traces are simple mapping output, and the red bar is P = 0.05 for the naïve permutation. Black traces are GRAIP mapping output (5000 permutations) and shaded gray region is significant at genome-wide 0.05 or better in the GRAIP results. (B) simple mapping output for BXD strain means. Black bar indicates P = 0.05 for the naïve (appropriate, in this case) permutation.
