Note that the maximum and minimum values of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile on this chromosome alone are separated by a difference in LOD of 8.3 for coat color and 1.3 for body weight, which indicates that the same LOD score is equivalent to a considerably different P value depending on position and original phenotype.</p>
