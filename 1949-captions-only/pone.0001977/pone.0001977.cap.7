                Figure 7.  Variation in LOD score distribution by position on Chr 1.Distribution of 95th percentile LOD scores by marker for 10,000 GRAIP permutations of coat color and body weight QTL mapping in the AIL population. Note that the maximum and minimum values of the 95th percentile on this chromosome alone are separated by a difference in LOD of 8.3 for coat color and 1.3 for body weight, which indicates that the same LOD score is equivalent to a considerably different P value depending on position and original phenotype.
