                Figure 1.  Survival curves and skintest responses in M. tuberculosis infected guinea pigs.Survival curves of BCG vaccinated guinea pigs (triangles) and unvaccinated guinea pigs (open squares) after M. tuberculosis infection. The animals were sacrificed when they had lost 15% of the maximum weight or had clinical symptoms indicative of severe TB (Fig 1A). Mean skin test reaction (+/−SEM) for M. tuberculosis-infected unimmunized and BCG vaccinated guinea pigs (n = 7), measured as erythema after intradermal injection of 2 ug E6/C10 (Fig. 1B) or 10 T.U. PPD (Fig. 1C). Each animal received a maximum of 4 tests with more than 8 weeks interval and this schedule did not sensitize naïve animals. The experiment was repeated twice with the same overall result and data shown for a representative experiment.
