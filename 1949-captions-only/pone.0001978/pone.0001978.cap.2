Each symbol represents a skin reaction from one animal tested either at week at 4, 8 or 12 weeks post infection (the first skin test for each animal). There is a negative correlation between E6/C10 skin test response and survival time post skin testing (P&lt;0.0001) but no correlation between PPD responses and survival (P = 0.095). Triangles represent data points from BCG vaccinated animals and open squares represent data points from na√Øve animals.</p>
