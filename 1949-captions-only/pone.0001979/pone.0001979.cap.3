                Figure 3.  Linearized phylogenetic tree with node ages calculated with Multidivtime [64] using 12S, 16S and Cytochrome b gene partitions.Fossil calibration points (C1â€“C7), key divergence times and inferred freshwater colonization events are indicated on the phylogeny along with 95% reliability intervals.
