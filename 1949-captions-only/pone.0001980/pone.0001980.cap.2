                Figure 2.  Primers studied. The core T7 polymerase binding site (in blue) and the 3′ spacer sequence (in red) are highlighted.Note that the 3′ spacer sequence in the T7 primers is not identical. In all cases the 3′ spacer is different from the Eberwine T7 primer sequence listed on top.
