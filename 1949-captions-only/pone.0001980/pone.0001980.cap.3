                Figure 3.  Density plots of oligonucleotide probes sets hybridized with RNA amplified with indicated T7 primers (listed in fig 2).Horizontal axis is the log intensity scale. A and B, platforms that show T7 primer 3′spacer sequence bias, C and D, platforms that show little or no T7 primer 3′spacer sequence bias. Density analyses were performed on oligonucleotides containing 6 mer sequences (A and C), and on 9-mer sequences (B and D) based on the 3′spacer sequences from primer 1 and 2 (blue) or primer 3 and 4 (red). Arrows indicate the right-shifted density lines for the probes having the 3′spacer sequence present in the primer that was used in the study (indicated at the top of the graphs). Control lines are plotted in black, grey or pink lines. The black line represents density data for all probes lacking T7 motifs; the pink lines are individual random motifs for 6-mer or 9-mer sequences (n = 50), and the grey lines represents data from individual random probes (n = equal to the size of the subset of probes containing the T7 motif used in the study).
