The “Operon (b)” study used primer 3 to amplify the total RNA. Plotted is the M versus A value for four probes that were selected from 61 probe sequences (all containing the 8-mer motif <span class="gene">CTTCTCCC</span> present in the primer used) because these four report a significant up or down regulation in the Operon(d) study. Indicated are the normalized and averaged MA values for microarrays (n = 10) hybridized with the same sample on the two platforms (error bars for standard deviation). The ratios observed for amplified RNA are situated closer to the zero level. From the individual microarray measurements 34 out of the 40 spots were a significant outlier in the unamplified RNA study. 22 (or 65%) of them lost the status of being a significant outlier after the amplification procedure. Operon Ids for the probes listed: H300004675 (black), H300006007 (red), H300008441 (green) and H300014662 (blue).</p>
