An aliquot of an overnight culture a [<em>PSI+</em>] Strg6 strain (which grows as white colonies) was spread on Petri plates containing rich YPD (as indicated in the <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a> section). Small filters (similar to the ones used for antibiograms) were then placed on the agar surface and individual compounds from the Prestwick chemical library® (5 µl of 2 mg/ml solutions) were applied to each filter, except for the top left filter where DMSO, the compounds vehicle was added (negative control) and for the bottom right filter where 5 µl of a 300 mM GuHCl solution in DMSO was added (positive control). The Petri plates were then incubated three days at 25°C. When a compound was active against [<em>PSI+</em>], a halo of red colonies appeared around the filter where it was spotted. Petri plates where Guanabenz (GA, left) and Tacrine (TA, right) were spotted are shown. The molecular structures of Guanabenz and of Tacrine are depicted on the top of the Petri plates. The red halos corresponding to GA- or TA-cured cells are indicated by arrows. Brown halos correspond to toxic compounds (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). b. GA and TA were then tested against [URE3] prion using SB34 strain and the same kind of assay. As confirmations GA and TA were retested against [<em>PSI</em>+] prion. The same quantity (5 µl of a 5 mM solution) of GA (left) or TA (right) was applied on the filters thus allowing direct comparison of effect of both molecules on the two yeast prions.</p>
