Their effects on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation were determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-PrP antibody. At the tested range of concentration, only GA was able to promote PrP<sup>Sc</sup> clearance. The effect of GA on the steady-state level of PrP<sup>C</sup> was determined in uninfected MovS6 cells (b lower gel). (c) Cell lysates of untreated scrapie-infected MovS6 cells were directly incubated with the indicated concentrations of GA or, as controls to the corresponding quantity of DMSO, the compound vehicle. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was then detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-PrP antibody. Molecular weights (MW, in kilodaltons) are indicated to the right of the blots.</p>
