                Figure 2.  Guanabenz efficiently promotes ovine PrPSc clearance in an ex vivo cell-based assay.Scrapie-infected MovS6 cells were treated for six days with the indicated concentrations of TA (panel a) or GA (panel b, upper gel) and then lysed. Their effects on PrPSc accumulation were determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-PrP antibody. At the tested range of concentration, only GA was able to promote PrPSc clearance. The effect of GA on the steady-state level of PrPC was determined in uninfected MovS6 cells (b lower gel). (c) Cell lysates of untreated scrapie-infected MovS6 cells were directly incubated with the indicated concentrations of GA or, as controls to the corresponding quantity of DMSO, the compound vehicle. PrPSc was then detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-PrP antibody. Molecular weights (MW, in kilodaltons) are indicated to the right of the blots.
