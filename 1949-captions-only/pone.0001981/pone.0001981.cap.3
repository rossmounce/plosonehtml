The same quantity (5 µl of 5 mM solutions) of GA and of six chemical derivatives was spotted on filters as described in <a href="#pone-0001981-g001">Figure 1</a>. Note the lack of activity of GA analogs against [<em>PSI+</em>] yeast prion (upper right panel): for each of them, one of the two chlorines present in GA is missing (PSI 136, 137, 140, 208 and GAi). In contrast, adding one additional chlorine significantly increases the activity of the drug (GAh). GA, GAi and GAh were then tested for their ability to promote PrP<sup>Sc</sup> clearance in the MovS6 cell-based system described above. Molecular weights (MW, in kilodaltons) are indicated on the right of the blots. b. Four other antihypertensive and/or known agonists or antagonists of α1- or α2-adrenergic receptors were tested against both [<em>PSI+</em>] and [URE3] yeast prions (top right) and mammalian prion using the MovS6 cell-based assay (bottom right).</p>
