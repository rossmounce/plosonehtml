Two independent experiments (shown respectively in panels a and b) have been performed, in which the dose and overall number of treatments varied, as indicated. Dextran Sulfate 500 (DS500, a) or GA solvent alone (5% glucose, a and b) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In each treated group, triplicates of healthy mice were euthanized ~50 days post-infection and the rate of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detectable in their spleens was determined by Western blot (see <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>). The same amount of spleen tissue material has been loaded on the gels. For each triplicate, Western blot of spleen PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and densitometric quantification are shown. Each dot of the graph represents the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> content of a single spleen. The dark horizontal line is the mean value. Statistical significance (<em>p</em>) was assessed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. ns: not significant. Note that GA did not significantly affect spleen PrP<sup>Sc</sup> level, although it showed a beneficial effect on mouse survival in both sets of independent experiments (see <a href="#pone-0001981-t001">Table 1</a>).</p>
