In the case of 3D7S8.4, a linear range of regression was observed up to ~100 generations. Thus, the <em>var</em> on/off rates for 3D7S8.4 were determined up to 100 generations, whilst for the 3D7AH1S2, the estimations were made up to 200 generations, as the linear regression was maintained for a longer time period. The <em>var</em> on/off rates for 3D7S8.4 and 3D7AH1S2 were determined by the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method, where ΔΔCt = (Ct<sub>var</sub>−Ct<sub>house-keeping</sub>)<em>t<sub>n</sub></em>−(Ct<sub>var</sub>−Ct<sub>house-keeping</sub>)<em>t<sub>0</sub></em>. The value for the first data collection (<em>t<sub>0</sub></em>) was set as the baseline level (i.e. 15 and 25 generations for 3D7S8.4 and 3D7AH1S2, respectively.) The fold-change in the transcription compared to the baseline level was plotted, and the on/off rates of particular <em>var-</em>genes were estimated by the exponential function of the slope of the regression.</p>
