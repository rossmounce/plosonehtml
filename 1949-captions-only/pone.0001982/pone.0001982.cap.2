                Figure 2.  Changes in var-gene expression and adhesive phenotypes in clonal P. falciparum 3D7S8.4 over 200 generations of in-vitro growth.The transcription levels were determined by qPCR and are presented as Î”Ct values being the difference in cycle threshold between the var-gene and the seryl-tRNA synthetase housekeeping gene (control). The transcription levels of varcommon and of var-genes that were dominantly expressed at particular time points are shown. The adhesive phenotypes of the IE of the two parasites were followed for rosetting, CSA- and CD36-binding as described in Table 1 and the methods section.
