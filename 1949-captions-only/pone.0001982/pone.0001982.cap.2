The transcription levels of <em>var<sub>common</sub></em> and of <em>var</em>-genes that were dominantly expressed at particular time points are shown. The adhesive phenotypes of the IE of the two parasites were followed for rosetting, CSA- and CD36-binding as described in <a href="#pone-0001982-t001">Table 1</a> and the <a href="#s4">methods</a> section.</p>
