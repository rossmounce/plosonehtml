                Figure 3.  Comparisons of global transcriptomes of 3D7S8.4 as studied by microarray analysis.RNA was obtained from 15 vs. 33 generations and 15 vs. 199 generations. (A) off-switching of the originally dominant var PFD0630c and on-switching of PFL0030c (var2csa) was already seen at 33 generations; (B) var2csa (PFL0030c) was highly up-regulated in long-term cultured parasites and almost no PFD0630c was detected (background signal level) at 199 generations.
