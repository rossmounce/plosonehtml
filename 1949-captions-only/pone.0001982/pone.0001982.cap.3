(A) off-switching of the originally dominant <em>var</em> PFD0630c and on-switching of PFL0030c (<em>var2csa</em>) was already seen at 33 generations; (B) <em>var2csa</em> (PFL0030c) was highly up-regulated in long-term cultured parasites and almost no PFD0630c was detected (background signal level) at 199 generations.</p>
