                Figure 4.  Expression of var2csa and other var-genes after long-term cultivation of P. falciparum in vitro.(A) The pie charts show the relative transcription level of each var-gene in the different clones. The original 3D7S8.4 clone (15 generations) dominantly expressed the PFD0630c, but sub-populations of other var-genes were also detected. In contrast, the var2csa gene was found to be highly expressed in 16 out of 17 sub-clones (3D7S8.4.2-3D7S8.4.17) but in one (3D7S8.4.1) generated from the long-term cultured ~200 generations 3D7S8.4. (B) Expression levels of different var-genes in the 3D7S8.4 sub-clones, 3D7S8.4.1-17. var2csa was highly expressed in all the subclones except for 3D7S8.4.1 (â€¢), which dominantly transcribed PF08_0103. varcommon was expressed in all the parasites though at a relatively low level. (C) Northern-blot analysis of var2csa expression in total RNA extracted from the sub-clones 3D7S8.4.1, 3D7S8.4.2 and 3D7S8.4.17. The membrane was hybridized with a var2csa DBL1-2x probe. Comparable amounts of total RNA from each sample were loaded as shown in the ethidium bromide-stained gel (lower panel).
