                Figure 5.  Detection of PfEMP1 in different P. falciparum clones by flow cytometry- and immunoblotting.The IEs were labeled (A) with IgG from plasma pools of P. falciparum exposed males (Males), females (Females) or non-infected Danes, and (B) IEs used in (A) were labeled with IgG from rabbit-sera raised against different domains of VAR2CSA (DBL-1x; DBL-2x, DBL-3x, DBL-5e, DBL-6e) or with a serum raised to an irrelevant control antigen (ID2), positive control (FCR3CSA) is shown in red. (C) The blot illustrates the PfEMP1 expression in whole cell-lysates of late trophozoite infected RBCs of the 3D7S8.4 early and late generation clones. Parasites with bolded lettering are described in greater detail in D. The blot was incubated with a PfEMP1 antibody raised against the conserved part of the acidic terminal segment (ATS). Anti-PfHsp-70 reactivity was used as loading control. Uninfected RBCs were included as negative control. Gb337 and Gb337CSA are included as positive controls of VAR2CSA expressing parasites. Whilst Gb337 is heterogeneous in its PfEMP1 expression, upon repeated panning on CSA, only the higher molecular weight protein is expressed. D) The graph illustrates the inter-relationship of the transcript versus protein levels of the dominant var-gene(s) in the 3D7S8.4 early and late generation clones.
