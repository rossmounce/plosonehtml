                Figure 6.  Repositioning of var-genes in the peri-nuclear area as seen by FISH in P. falciparum 3D7S8.4 and 3D7AH1S2 ring-stage parasites at onset and after 200 generations of in vitro growth.(A &amp; B) Representative pictures illustrate different localization patterns of telomeric clusters (rep20, red probe) compared with that of a var-gene (green probe) in nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). Telomeric clusters appear as horseshoe-like bundles where condensed heterochromatins are located. (C) The var-genes expressed at the onset of the experiment (PFD0630c/PFF0845c) did not reposition and did not show any correlation between their transcriptional states and peri-nuclear positions in the same parasites. (D) In contrast, in early generation parasites (15â€“21 generations) var2csa is in a silenced state and co-localizes with the telomeric clusters. After 194-206 generations var2csa transcription is active in both parasites (3D7SS8.4, 3D7AH1S2) with a concordant repositioning from telomeric clusters to a zone without condensed genetic material.
