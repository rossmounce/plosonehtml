Telomeric clusters appear as horseshoe-like bundles where condensed heterochromatins are located. (C) The <em>var</em>-genes expressed at the onset of the experiment (PFD0630c/PFF0845c) did not reposition and did not show any correlation between their transcriptional states and peri-nuclear positions in the same parasites. (D) In contrast, in early generation parasites (15â€“21 generations) <em>var2csa</em> is in a silenced state and co-localizes with the telomeric clusters. After 194-206 generations <em>var2csa</em> transcription is active in both parasites (3D7SS8.4, 3D7AH1S2) with a concordant repositioning from telomeric clusters to a zone without condensed genetic material.</p>
