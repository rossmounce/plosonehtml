Significant differences between “early” versus ”late” generation clones (3D7S8.4 vs 3D7S8.4.1; 3D7S8.4 vs 3D7S8.4.2 and 3D7AH1S2 vs 3D7AH1S2 late) were determined using an unpaired Student´s t-test at a 5% significance level. Analysis was performed in SPSS version 12.0. *P&lt;0.05; Significantly higher multiplication rate was observed in the late S2-clone. The same trend was also observed in the other VAR2CSA expressing late generation clone S8.4.2, the difference here however was not statistically significant (P = 0.067).</p>
