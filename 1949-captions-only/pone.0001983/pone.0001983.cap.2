                Figure 2.  PC61 does not affect the viability or proliferation of GL26 cells in vitro or in vivo.(A) GL26 cells were incubated for 48 h with 100 µg/ml PC61 or 100 µg/ml rat IgG1 isotype control. Cells were then harvested and stained with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide to identify apoptotic cells. No significant increase in apoptosis was noted when cells were incubated with PC61 or isotype control immunoglobulins compares with untreated controls (p&gt;0.05). A large increase in apoptosis was observed when cells were incubated for 4 h with H2O2 (p&lt;0.001). Error bars represent the standard error from 3 replicates and the assay was repeated 3 times. One Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to calculate significant differences (***p&lt;0.001). (B) Proliferation of GL26 cells was measured by detecting BrdU incorporation into DNA. No significant difference in proliferation was observed (p&gt;0.05) when cells were incubated with PC61 (rat IgG1αCD25) compared with isotype controls (rat IgG1), or untreated cells (***p&lt;0.001 compared to negative (no cells) control, ns = non significant). (C) Athymic nu/nu mice (Balb/c background) were challenged with a single intracranial injection of GL26 cells and treated 15 d later with 1mg either PC61 or isotype control immunoglobulins injected i.p. Survival was monitored and mice were euthanized when moribund. No significant difference in survival was observed using a log rank test (p&gt;0.05) (n = 5).
