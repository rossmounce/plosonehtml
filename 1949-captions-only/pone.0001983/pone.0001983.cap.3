GL26 cells were implanted in the brain of all mice on day 0 and were treated by the intratumoral delivery of saline on day 17 with depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells using PC61 on day 15 (green) or on day 24 (red). Control groups of tumor bearing mice received rat IgG1 isotype control on day 15 (blue), or no systemic administration of immunoglobulins (Black) as indicated. Mice were used either for survival studies, or euthanized at day 27 post-tumor implantation for analysis of immune cell populations by flow cytometry. (B) Kaplan-Meier curve displaying survival of the 4 groups of mice described in (A). Ten mice were used in each group and a log-rank test was used to calculate significance between untreated group and PC61 treated groups. *p&lt;0.05 compared with untreated mice and isotype control treated mice. (C) DTH test was performed on long-term survivor mice 100 d after tumor implantation. Mice had originally been treated with PC61 on day 15 (green lines). Irradiated GL26 cells in PBS in the right rear footpad (filled box) or PBS control in the left rear footpad (open box) of mice. The thickness of the footpad was determined 0 h, 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after injection of irradiated cells or PBS. Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to calculate significant differences. (D–F) Tregs (CD3ε<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) infiltrating tumors (D), draining lymph nodes (E) or spleens (F) were quantified in mice administered rat IgG1 isotype control (iso) or PC61 on day 15 (15) or day 24 (24) as indicated in the graphs (left). Dot plots (right) display representative data from 5 mice per group. The percentages of T regs with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the tumors, draining lymph nodes (dLN) or spleen are indicated in representative dot plots. One Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test were used to determine significant differences (***p&lt;0.001).</p>
