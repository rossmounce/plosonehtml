Tregs were depleted on either day 15 or day 24 by ip injection of PC61. Immune cells were isolated from the spleen, the cervical LN and the intracranial tumor at day 27 post-tumor implantation to determine the percentage of CD4+ T cells and CD8a+ T cells in each tissue. The percentage of tumor infiltrating immune cells that were CD4+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4+ CD8a-) (A) and CD8a+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4- CD8a+) (B); the percentage of immune cells in the draining lymph nodes that were CD4+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4+ CD8a-) (C) and CD8a+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4- CD8a+) (D); and the percentage of immune cells in the spleen that were CD4+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4+ CD8a-) (E) and CD8a+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4- CD8a+) (F) are shown in graphs (left). Representative dot plots for each treatment group are displayed on the right (gated for live leukocytes with FSC vs SSC and CD3ε+ T lymphocytes). The percentages of each immune cell population with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the tumors, draining lymph nodes (dLN) or spleen are indicated in representative dot plots. One Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test were used to calculate significant differences. (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01).</p>
