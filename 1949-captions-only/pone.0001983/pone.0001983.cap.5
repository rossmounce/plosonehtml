                Figure 5.  Antigen presenting cells do not change in tumor or dLN in untreated animals but increase in spleen after depletion of Tregs with PC61.GL26 cells were implanted in the brain striatum of C57BL/6 mice. Rat IgG1 isotype control immunoglobulins (-) were administered on day 15 and PC61 was administered on day 15 or day 24 as indicated. The percentage of tumor infiltrating macrophages (MÎ¦; CD11b+ CD45+ I-Ab+) (A,C,E) and myeloid Dendritic cells (mDC; CD11c+ CD45+ I-Ab+) (B,D,F) were quantified at day 27 post-tumor implantation using flow cytometry in the tumor (A,B) dLN (C,D) and spleen (E,F). The percentages of each immune cell population with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the tumors, draining lymph nodes (dLN) or spleen are indicated in representative dot plots. 5 and 10 mice were analyzed per group. One Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to determine statistical significance.
