Tregs were depleted on either day 15 (green) or day 24 (red) by ip injection of PC61 or on day 15 with the isotype control (blue). Immune cells were isolated from the spleen, the cervical LN and the tumor. Mice were either used for survival studies or euthanized on day 27 for analysis of immune cell populations by flow cytometry and ELISPOT. (B) Kaplan-Meier curve displaying survival data from 10 mice per group. Statistically significant differences to Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK treated mice only (black line, no PC61 depletion) were calculated using the log-rank test (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01). Administration of PC61 to mice 24 days after tumor implantation (7 days after treatment with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK) significantly reduced long term survival. (C) Tumor bearing mice were treated with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK alone (black lines) or with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK with PC61 depletion on day 15 (green lines). Long term survivors (60 d after tumor implantation) were assessed for a DTH response to irradiated GL26 cells injected into the right footpad (compared to PBS only in the left footpad). Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to calculate significant differences between groups (***p&lt;0.001 mice treated with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK no depletion, <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001983.e001&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>p&lt;0.01 Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK treated mice depleted with PC61 on day 15). (D) IFNγ ELISPOT showing the total number of IFNγ producing T lymphocytes that were stimulated with DC loaded with GL26 tumor extracts. T lymphocytes were purified from mice 10 d after treatment with either Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK (+) or saline (−) as indicated. Black bars are T lymphocytes from mice that did not receive CD25 depleting immunoglobulins. Green bars are T lymphocytes purified from mice depleted with PC61 2 days before treatment with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK (day 15 after tumor implantation) and red bars are T lymphocytes purified from mice depleted with PC61 7 days after treatment with Ad-Flt3l and Ad-TK (day 24 after tumor implantation). (E–G) Tregs (CD3ε<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) infiltrating tumors (E), draining lymph nodes (F) or spleens (G) were quantified in mice administered rat IgG1 isotype control (Iso) or PC61 on day 15 (15) or day 24 (24) as indicated in the graphs (left). Administration of PC61 to mice resulted in long term depletion of Tregs in peripheral sites (spleen and lymph nodes) and at the tumor. Dot plots (right) display representative means±SEM of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs quantified from 5 mice per group. The total number of T regs in the tumors (E) and the percentages of T regs with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLN) or spleen (F and G) are indicated in representative dot plots. Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test were used to determine significant differences (***p&lt;0.001).</p>
