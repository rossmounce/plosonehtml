                Figure 7.  PC61 inhibits T cell clonal expansion in the tumors in response to treatment with Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK.(A) Administration of PC61 to mice resulted in depletion of CD25+ T lymphocytes in the spleen compared with administration of isotype controls. (B) C57BL/6 mice were challenged with tumor cells on day 0, and treated on day 17 by intratumoral delivery of Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK. Tregs were depleted on either day 15 or day 24 by ip injection of PC61. Immune cells were isolated from the spleen, the cervical LN, and the tumor at day 27 post-tumor implantation to determine the percentage of CD4+ and CD8a+ T cells in each tissue. (C–E) Total numbers of tumor infiltrating immune cells (CD45+) (C), CD4+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4+ CD8a−) (D) and CD8a+ T cells (CD3ε+ CD4− CD8a+) (E) and the percentage of CD4+ T cells (F) and CD8a+ T cells (G) in the draining lymph nodes of mice were determined. Panels on the right hand side (C–G) display representative dot plots for immune cells purified from tumor bearing mice treated with isotype rat IgG1 (day 15), PC61 (day 15) or PC61 (day 24) as indicated. The total number of CD45+ , CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the tumors are shown in representative dot plots (C–E). The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLN) are shown in representative dot plots (F and G). Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to analyze differences between groups (C) and a two tailed t test was used to determine differences between saline and Ad-Flt3l/Ad-TK treated groups (D–G).
