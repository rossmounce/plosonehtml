Macrophages (A) CD4+ T cells (B) and CD8a+ T cells were assessed at day 27 post-tumor implantation using flow cytometry. Dot plots display CD8a against CD4 and are representative of between 5 and 10 mice per group. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the spleen are indicated in representative dot plots. Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post test was used to determine statistical significance.</p>
