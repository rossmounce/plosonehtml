                Figure 9.  Antigen presenting cells increase in Tumor dLN and spleen after depletion with PC61 or in response to Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK.GL26 cells were implanted in the striatum of C57BL/6 mice. Rat IgG1 isotype control immunoglobulins (-) were administered on day 15 and PC61 was administered on day 15 or day 24 as indicated. Mice were treated with intratumoral injection of Ad-Flt3L and Ad-TK (black bars) or saline (white bars). The percentage of tumor infiltrating macrophages (MΦ; CD11b+ CD45+ I-Ab+) (A,C,E) and mDC (mDC; CD11c+ CD45+ I-Ab+) (B,D,F) were quantified at day 27 post-tumor implantation using flow cytometry in the tumor (A,B) dLN (C,D) and spleen (E,F). 5 and 10 mice were analyzed per group. The total numbers of APCs in the tumors are indicated in representative dot plots (A–B). The percentage of APCs with respect to the total number of CD45+ cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLN) or spleen are depicted in representative dot plots (C–F). Two Way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine statistical significance. (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001).
