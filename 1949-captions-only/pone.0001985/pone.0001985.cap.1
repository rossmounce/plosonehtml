Data are expressed as mean±s.d. of three independent experiments. Time-dependent of COX-2 and IL-32 mRNA accumulations (C) in cell lysates are shown by Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis and protein productions (D) shown by western blot analysis, in which A549 cells were harvested at indicated time points after influenza A virus infection (1 MOI) or 48 h treatment with poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml). The gel or blot is a representative of three experiments with similar results.</p>
