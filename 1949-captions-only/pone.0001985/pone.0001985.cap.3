Transfected cells by COX-2 plasmids were incubated for 12 h and then maintained for 36 h with different final concentrations of NS398 as indicated, respectively. Luciferase activity was measured. Results are expressed as the mean±s.d. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and normalized by Renilla activities. A549 cells were transfected with different indicated amounts of pcDNA3.1-COX-2 or pcDNA3.1. RT-PCR for IL-32 and β-actin (internal control) (B) in cell lysates, Elisa for IL-32 (C) in culture supernatants were performed. (D) A549 cells were treated with poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml) for 12 h and then different concentration of NS398 was added as indicated for another 36 h. IL-32 and β-actin mRNA level were examined by RT-PCR. (E) A549 cells were stimulated by poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml) with or without 80 µM NS398 for 48 h. Time-dependent of IL-32 expression in culture supernatants were measured. The data represent mean±s.d. of three separate experiments.</p>
