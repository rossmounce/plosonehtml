Luciferase activity was then measured 48 h post transfection. A549 cells were transfected with different amounts of Flag2A-IL-32 as indicated or Flag2A and stimulated by poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml) for 48 h. RT-PCR for COX-2 and β-actin (B) in lysated cells, measurement of PGE<sub>2</sub> release (C) in culture supernatants were taken. Reporter plasmid pCOX-2-Luc (D) and pRL-TK were cotransfected along with siRNA-IL-32 or siRNA-control into A549 cells and treated with poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml) for 48 h. Luciferase activity was then measured. (E) A549 cells were transfected with siRNA-IL-32 or siRNA-control and stimulated by poly(IC) (50 µg/ml)+IFN-γ (150 U/ml) for 48 h. Time-dependent PGE<sub>2</sub> release in culture supernatants was measured. The data represent mean±s.d. of three separate experiments.</p>
