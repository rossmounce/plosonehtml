PGE<sub>2</sub> release (A) and IL-32 production (B) in culture supernatants were measured. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA-IL-32 or siRNA-control and infected by influenza A virus (1 MOI) for 48 h. PGE<sub>2</sub> release (C) and IL-32 production (D) in culture supernatants were measured. The data represent mean±s.d. of three separate experiments.</p>
