                Figure 5.  Selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 suppresses IL-32 expression and IL-32-specific siRNA upregulates COX-2 in influenza A virus infected A549 cell.A549 cells were infected by influenza A virus (1 MOI) and treated with or without 80 µM NS398, 5 mM Aspirin for 48 h as indicated on the horizontal axis. PGE2 release (A) and IL-32 production (B) in culture supernatants were measured. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA-IL-32 or siRNA-control and infected by influenza A virus (1 MOI) for 48 h. PGE2 release (C) and IL-32 production (D) in culture supernatants were measured. The data represent mean±s.d. of three separate experiments.
