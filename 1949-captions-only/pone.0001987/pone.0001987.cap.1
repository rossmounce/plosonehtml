These lines also exhibit differences in mortality rate: <em>BF54</em> shows the same mortality rate when paired with <em>mth<sup>Δ6</sup></em> as when paired with <em>mth<sup>R3</sup></em> (B), while <em>S97</em> shows a higher mortality rate when paired with <em>mth<sup>Δ6</sup></em> than when paired with <em>mth<sup>R3</sup></em> (C).</p>
