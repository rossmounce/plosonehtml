                Figure 1.  A sample comparison of paired survivorship curves and paired mortality rates for two wild lines.Males from lines BF54 and S97 show differences in survivorship, as BF54 over mthΔ6 survived the same as BF54 over mthR3, while S97 over mthΔ6 survived more poorly than S97 over mthR3 (A). These lines also exhibit differences in mortality rate: BF54 shows the same mortality rate when paired with mthΔ6 as when paired with mthR3 (B), while S97 shows a higher mortality rate when paired with mthΔ6 than when paired with mthR3 (C).
