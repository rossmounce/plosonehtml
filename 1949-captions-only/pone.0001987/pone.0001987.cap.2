Females are above (A and B), males below (C and D). Positive ratios indicate greater risk of death, so the positive ratios for <em>BF51</em> females (A and B) mean that this line showed lower expected lifespan over the <em>mth</em> mutants than over the <em>mth</em> wild-type allele. The heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of relative risk represents the functional diversity in lifespan among the wild <em>mth</em> lines. Error bars show 95% confidence. Error bars which do not cross the y-axis signify a failure to complement in that line.</p>
