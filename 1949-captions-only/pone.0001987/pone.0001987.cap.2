                Figure 2.  Risk ratios for each line over one of the mth mutants relative to that line over mthR3.The comparisons using mthÎ”6 are on the left (A and C); the comparisons using mth1 are on the right (B and D). Females are above (A and B), males below (C and D). Positive ratios indicate greater risk of death, so the positive ratios for BF51 females (A and B) mean that this line showed lower expected lifespan over the mth mutants than over the mth wild-type allele. The heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of relative risk represents the functional diversity in lifespan among the wild mth lines. Error bars show 95% confidence. Error bars which do not cross the y-axis signify a failure to complement in that line.
