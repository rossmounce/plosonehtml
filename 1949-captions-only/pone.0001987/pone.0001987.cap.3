                Figure 3.  Average lifetime fecundity per line for all genotypic combinations.Non-parallel slopes between lines in the three lab-derived mth backgrounds indicate the functional variation in lifetime fecundity among the wild lines. The general increase in eggs laid across the x-axis represents a correlation of increasing fecundity with decreasing background mth expression; all lines but T50 showed lowest fecundity when paired with the wild-type mthR3 allele. Error bars show 95% confidence.
