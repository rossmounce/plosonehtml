                Figure 4.  Odds ratios for each line over one of the mth mutants (mthΔ6 or mth1) relative to the line over mthR3.The comparison using mthΔ6 is on the left (A); the comparison using mth1 is on the right (B). Positive ratios indicate greater risk of death. The heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of relative odds represents the functional diversity in stress resistance among the wild mth lines. Error bars show 95% confidence. Error bars which do not cross the y-axis signify a failure to complement in that line.
