<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a><p>Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups were compared, with p-values obtained by Fisher's exact or chi-square tests. Behavior change outcomes were examined using 3- and 6-month follow-up data for participants reporting risky behavior at baseline and were tabulated by group assignment as binary outcomes (cessation vs. ongoing risky behavior) with Fisher's exact test p-values. Participants could report multiple concurrent risky behaviors, but each outcome was analyzed separately. A Bonferroni correction (Î± = 0.05/3 = 0.0167) was used to assess statistical significance among the 3 risks with 6-month follow-up the primary time point. For all analyses, we assumed that any participant enrolled in the study who failed to return for follow-up continued their reported risky behavior, constituting a worst-case sensitivity analysis. We also performed alternate outcomes analyses with complete cases only, assuming participants lost to follow-up were similar to those completing follow-ups. Pre-planned sub-group analyses of outcomes were performed by participants' gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, hepatitis C co-infection, HIV viral load, source of HIV infection, previous treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, main or casual sex partners, and HIV status of sex partner(s). Univariate summary statistics of mean changes and standard deviations were calculated for specific behaviors in each risk among those completing follow-up. Measures of change included number of drinks per week (for participants drinking over the recommended limit), number of binge drinking episodes, total days of all drug use, absolute percent change in self-reported condom use with main and casual partners, and number of casual sex partners. Differences between groups were compared with t-test p-values. All analyses were done on SAS version 9.1 statistical software (SAS Corporation, Cary NC, USA).</p>

<h4>Description of sample</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a><p>We invited 971 patients to participate in <em>Positive Choice</em>; 19 (2%) failed to meet eligibility criteria and 35 (4%) refused to participate. The remaining 917 patients met eligibility criteria and completed a baseline risk assessment (<a href="#pone-0001988-g003">Figure 3</a>). Of these, 476 participants (52%) reported 1 or more risky behaviors and were stratified by risk combination, then randomized. Five participants reported illicit drug use as their only risk but not within the previous month; we excluded these 5 participants, resulting in a sample of 471 participants for analysis. We achieved high retention for follow-ups; 82% percent of the intervention group and 83% of the control group completed 6-month sessions. Our sample was middle aged, the majority male, and racially/ethnically diverse (<a href="#pone-0001988-t001">Table 1</a>). Most participants had at least a high school diploma. There were no significant differences in demographics or clinical variables between intervention and control groups. There were more participants who exceeded the recommended number of drinks per week in the intervention group than control (51 vs. 37, p = 0.050).</p>
