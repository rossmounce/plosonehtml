                Figure 2.  Examples of pre-score calculation for miR-124 and four randomly selected miRNAs in the miR-124 transfection profile at 24 h.The g(i) function is shown as the black curve in (A); the f(i) functions in (A) and the g(i)â€“f(i) function in (B) for miR-124 and the randomly selected miRNAs are shown as the red lines and green lines, respectively. The dashed lines show the positions at which maximum deviations (pre-scores) are achieved for these miRNAs.
