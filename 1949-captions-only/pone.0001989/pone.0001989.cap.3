                Figure 3.  Average AC scores and p-values for miR-1 in the miR-1 transfection profile at 12 h (A and B) and 24 h (C and D) based on perturbed miR-1 target prediction scores.The x-axis shows the perturbing percentage from 0% to 50%. At each perturbing percentage, 100 perturbed binding score profiles of miR-1 are produced by exchanging the binding scores of target and non-target genes of miR-1. The standard deviations of AC scores and p-values are also shown.
