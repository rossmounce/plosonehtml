                Figure 4.  Box-plots of AC scores for the 211 miRNAs in the miR-124 transfection profiles at 12 h (A) and 24 h (B) based on the continuous and discretized binding score data.C corresponds to the continuous binding score data; D1, D2, D3, and D4 correspond to the discretized binding score data with cut-off value of 12, 60, 80 and 100, respectively. The AC score for miR-124 is marked as blue rectangle.
