Subjects produced horizontal-plane arm movements involving shoulder and elbow rotation to guide the motion of a cursor to a series of visual targets, projected using a computer controlled LCD projector onto a screen suspended 20 cm above the hand and reflected into view by a semi-silvered mirror positioned 10 cm below the screen. This created the illusion that the targets were positioned in the plane of the subject's arm movements.</p>
