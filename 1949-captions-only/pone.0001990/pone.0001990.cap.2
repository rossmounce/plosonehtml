                Figure 2.  Movement perpendicular distance is shown over the course of movements in the CWFF, CCWFF and CWFF.Data plotted in dark grey represent subjects who grasped the same handle in all three sessions. Data plotted in light grey represent subjects who grasped a given handle shape for the CWFF and a different handle shape for the CCWFF. Each data point represents the mean perpendicular distance over 6 movements, averaged over subjects.
