                Figure 5.  Believers versus non-believers.a: Mean perpendicular distance for movements in the CWFF, CCWFF and CWFF are shown for subjects who reported believing that they were grasping two different objects in the CWFF and CCWFF sessions (“believers”, indicated by traces marked with triangles), and those who reported believing that they were grasping the same object in all sessions (“non-believers”, indicated by traces marked with open circles). For each group data are further decomposed into subjects who grasped the same cylindrical handle for all three sessions (dark traces), and those who grasped the cylindrical handle for CWFF sessions and a spherical handle for the CCWFF session (light traces). Each data point represents the mean perpendicular distance over 6 movements, averaged over subjects. b: Catch-trial performance for believers and non-believers. Each data point represents mean perpendicular distance averaged over subjects for single movements.
