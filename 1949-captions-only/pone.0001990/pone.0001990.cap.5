For each group data are further decomposed into subjects who grasped the same cylindrical handle for all three sessions (dark traces), and those who grasped the cylindrical handle for CWFF sessions and a spherical handle for the CCWFF session (light traces). Each data point represents the mean perpendicular distance over 6 movements, averaged over subjects. b: Catch-trial performance for believers and non-believers. Each data point represents mean perpendicular distance averaged over subjects for single movements.</p>
