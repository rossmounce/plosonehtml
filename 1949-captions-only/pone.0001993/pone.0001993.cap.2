                Figure 2.  Protective virus neutralization after intradermal or subcutaneous vaccination against yellow fever.Comparison of reciprocal serum dilutions at which 80% of yellow fever virus is neutralized in constant virus â€“ varying serum dilution test after intradermal and subcutaneous YF vaccination in primary vaccinated participants (n = 155). Bars represent 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Virus neutralizing capacity of serum in both groups was performed at similar time points but indicators are juxtaposed for visual enhancement. VN = virus neutralization.
