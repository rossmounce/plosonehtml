                Figure 3.  Pre- and post vaccination virus neutralizing capacity of serum of previously vaccinated participants.Pre- and postvaccination (2 weeks) serum dilutions at which 80% VN occurred in previously vaccinated participants. When 80% VN was not reached by the least diluted serum (1:16), samples were defined as &lt;16 (reciprocal serum dilution). VN = Virus neutralization.
