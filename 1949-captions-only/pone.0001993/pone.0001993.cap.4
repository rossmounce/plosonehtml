                Figure 4.  Virus neutralizing capacity of YF-RNA negative and positive sera.Comparison of reciprocal serum dilutions, of serum obtained 4 weeks after vaccination, at which 80% VN occurred between positive and negative YF-17D RNA detection by RT-PCR in primary vaccinated participants (N = 24). Bars represent the median reciprocal serum dilution. VN = Virus neutralization.
