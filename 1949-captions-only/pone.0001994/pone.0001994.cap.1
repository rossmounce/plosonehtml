Letter S denote soluble fractions, letter T denotes membrane fractions, letters LM denote low density membrane fraction, (A) Proteins identified in three technical stromal replicates of Chloroplast preparation 1, (B) Proteins identified in three biological replicates of stromal samples â€“ chloroplast preparation 1 (technical replicate 2), chloroplast preparation 2, and chloroplast preparation 3, (C) Proteins identified in stromal and membrane (two technical replicates thereof) fractions of Chloroplast preparation 2, (D) Proteins identified in the three different fractions of Chloroplast Preparation 3, (E) Overlap between three sample types from all replicates combined. Number in parentheses is the percentage of proteins localized in chloroplast according to TargetP.</p>
