Corrections were made for shared peptides as described in the <a href="#s4">Material and Method</a> section. Each bin on the x-axis corresponds to 0.25 order of magnitude, with the total population spanning five orders of magnitude. The bins are grouped into seven abundance classes (I–VII, with I representing proteins of highest abundance). The percentage of chloroplast predicted nuclear-encoded proteins by TargetP (% cTP) is indicated. (A) Frequency distribution for the 946 proteins in the initial (unfiltered) dataset from stromal samples, (B,C,D) Frequency distribution of stromal protein after application of successive filters, as follows i) after known non-stromal chloroplast proteins (<em>i.e.</em> thylakoid, lumen, envelope) were removed (B), when only including proteins observed in 2 or more independent preparations (C), after removal of non-chloroplast contaminants (D).</p>
