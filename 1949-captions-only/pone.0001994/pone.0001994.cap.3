                Figure 3.  Cross-correlation between relative concentrations of stromal proteins quantified by spectral counting and by image analysis of gel separated proteins.Stromal protein quantified in a previous study from image analysis of stained 2-dimensional native gels (weighted for experimental protein mass) [14] were directly correlated to MS based quantified from the current LTQ data set. Log10 abundance of stromal proteins were calculated from normalized SPC and corrected for predicted full tryptic peptides of the mature proteins within mass window of 700â€“3500 Da. This showed strong positive correlation as indicated by a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.56.
