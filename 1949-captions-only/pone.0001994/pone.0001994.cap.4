Abbreviations are as follows: SPP, general stromal processing peptidase; PDF1A,B, methionine deformylases 1A,B; MSRA4,B2, methionine sulfoxide reductases; AP, amino-peptidases; CPN10,20,60, chaperone 10,20 and 60 of the GroEL/ES system; cpHSP70, heat shock protein 70; GrpE, nucleotide exchange factor; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; ClpB3, chaperone B3; cpSRP – chloroplast signal recognition particle subunit 43 and 54, involved in protein targeting components cpSRP43, cpSRP54; cpSecA – ATP-dependent Sec targeting component; cpTIG, a homologue of <em>E. coli</em> trigger factor involved in protein folding at the ribosome; ROC4, protein isomerase with unknown function; ClpP/R/S,T,C,D- subunits of the complete Clp protease system, DegP2 – protease of the Deg family; AtPrep1 - a Zn-protease suggested to be involved in degradation of processed cTPs; Zn-oligopeptidase A, homologue of a peptidase that in <em>E. coli</em> was suggested to degrade small peptides down-stream of the Clp protease system; TPPII, tripeptyl peptidase.</p>
