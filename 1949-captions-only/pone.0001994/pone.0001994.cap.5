Precursor ion is indicated with red asteric. Singly charged <em>y</em> ions are indicated by <em>blue</em> lines with corresponding aa residues shown on top - peptide sequence should be read <em>right-to-left</em>, starting with the most massive <em>y</em>(20) ion. Singly charged b ions are indicated by <em>red</em> lines with corresponding aa residues shown top â€“ peptide sequence should be read <em>left-to-right</em>, starting with the lightest <em>b</em>(4) ion.
