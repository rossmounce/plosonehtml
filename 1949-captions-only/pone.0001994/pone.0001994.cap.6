N-terminally acetylated residue was assumed to represent true cTP cleavage site. (B) Sequence logo of cTP cleavage site, constructed for proteins, for which only non-modified semi-tryptic peptides within 10 residues from predicted cTP cleavage site were observed by MS. N-terminal residue of the semi-tryptic peptide closest to predicted cTP cleavage site was assumed to represent true cTP cleavage site. (C) Sequence logo of 203 stromal proteins for which the most N-terminal peptide (full tryptic or the semi-tryptic peptide) was within 10 residues of the predicted cTP, (D) Sequence logo of the predicted cTP of all 898 annotated <em>Arabidopsis</em> chloroplast proteins, but only those proteins (831) were used with a predicted cTP length of at least 20 aa residues. (E) Sequence logo of the predicted cTP of 802 rice proteins representing the best homologues for 898 annotated <em>Arabidopsis</em> chloroplast proteins, but only those proteins (714) were used with a predicted cTP length of at least 25 aa residues.</p>
