                Figure 7.  Chloroplast transit peptide analysis of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins and predicted rice homologues.Sequence logos of the first 20 N-terminal residues (A,C) and aa distribution and frequency across the normalized (binned) cTP length (B,D) for 898 annotated Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins (A,B) and the 802 predicted rice homologues (C,D). Only those proteins were used with a predicted cTP length of at least 20 aa residues (831 and 714, respectively from Arabidopsis and rice).
