Schematic representation of constructs of HA-A3G and R88-A3G. HA-tag or Vpr14-88 was fused in frame to the N-terminus of Apobec3G (A3G). An HIV-1 protease cleavage site (PCS) was inserted between R88 and A3G. B). HA-A3G or R88-A3G was expressed in 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected with the HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor. After 48 hours, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-HA and anti-Vpr antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-A3G antibody. C). Cleavage of R88-A3G in virus produced from HIV-1 expressing cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with HxBru-Vif<sup>âˆ’</sup> provirus and the HA-A3G or R-A3G expressing plasmid. After 48 hours, produced viruses were pelleted from supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion, lysed, and directly loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-A3G polyclonal antibody (upper panel) or with anti-p24 monoclonal antibody (lower panel). The positions of R88-A3G and the cleaved product of A3G are indicated at right side of gel.</p>
