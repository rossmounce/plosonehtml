Then, equal amounts of produced viruses (as adjusted by the Gag-p24 level) were used to infect HeLa-CD4-CCR5-β-Gal cells and CD4+ C8166 T cells. A). At 48 hours post-infection, HIV-1 infected cells were detected by MAGI assay (left panel) and counted by Elispot Reader (right panel). B). At 48 hours post-infection, virus production in of C8166 cells were monitored by measurement of HIV-1 Gag-p24<sup>gag</sup> antigen in the supernatants with p24 ELISA assay (upper panel). Cell-associated HIV-1 Gag-p24 (middle panel) and Vif (lower panel) were detected by Western blotting with anti-p24 or anti-Vif antibodies, respectively. C). pNL4.3-GFP viruses were first produced from 293T cells co-transfected by pNL4.3/GFP provirus with HA-A3G or R88-A3G. Then, equal amounts of pNL4.3-GFP viruses were used to infect C8166 T cells. At 72 hours post-infection, the percentage of infected (GFP-positive) cells was measured by FACS analysis. D). Dose-dependent effect of R88-A3G on HIV-1 infectivity. Different amounts of R88-A3G plasmid (0, 0.2, 1, 2, 4 µg) and pNL4.3-GFP proviral DNA (3 µg) were used to co-transfect 293T cells. Viruses from each transfected cell culture were collected and equal Gag-p24 amounts of viruses were used to infect C8166 T cells. 72 hours later, percentage of infected (GFP-positive) cells was measured by FACS analysis (left panel). Meanwhile, the expression of R88-A3G in the corresponding transfected 293T cells was detected by Western blotting with anti-A3G antibody (right panel).</p>
