Effect of Vif on the degradation of R88-A3G. HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor was transfected alone or co-transfected with pcDNA-hVif expressor in 293T cells. At 48 hour post-transfection, cells were pulse radiolabeled with [<sub>35</sub>S]-methionine for 30 min, and labeled cells were collected and lysed at 0, 1.5 and 5 hours after pulse-labeling. Then, the level of HA-A3G in each lysed-cell sample was detected by anti-HA immunoprecipitation (upper panel). The level of R88-A3G in each lysed-cell sample was evaluated by anti-Vpr immunoprecipitation (middle panel). To detect HIV-1 Vif expression in different transfected cell samples, an aliquot of transfected cells from each culture was lysed and directly loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Vif antibody (lower panel). B). R88-A3G was efficiently incorporated into viral particles in the presence of Vif. 293T cells were co-transfected with HxBru-Vif+ (3ug) and HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor (2ug). After 48 hours cells were collected and the produced virus particles were collected from supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. Both cell and virus lysate samples were directly loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-A3G and anti-p24, as indicated (upper panel). The ratio of R88-A3G or HA-A3G incorporation into the viral particle relative to the total amount of R88-A3G or HA-A3G was also quantified by laser densitometry (lower panel). The data presented herein are the means and standard deviations from two independent experiments.</p>
