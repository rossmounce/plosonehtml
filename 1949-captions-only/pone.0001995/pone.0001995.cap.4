                Figure 4.  Expression of R88-A3G does not affect virus maturation, but significantly inhibits viral cDNA synthesis.A). R88-A3G does not affect virus maturation. HxBru-Vif− and Vif+ viruses produced from 293T cells co-transfected with corresponding provirus and HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor were pelleted, lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation with human anti-HIV serum. The immunoprecipitates were submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-anti-RT antibody (upper panel) and anti-p24 antibodies (lower panel). B). R88-A3G inhibits viral cDNA synthesis at early stage of viral infection. Dividing C8166 T cells were infected with equal amounts of different HxBru-Vif+ virus stocks, which were produced from 293T cells co-transfected with the provirus and HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor. At 12 hours post-infection, 1×106 cells were lysed and the total viral DNA was detected by PCR using HIV-1 LTR-Gag primers, as described in Materials and Methods. In parallel, the content of cellular β-globin DNA in each sample were also examined by specific PCR analysis (lower panel).
