R88-A3G does not affect virus maturation. HxBru-Vif<sup>−</sup> and Vif<sup>+</sup> viruses produced from 293T cells co-transfected with corresponding provirus and HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor were pelleted, lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation with human anti-HIV serum. The immunoprecipitates were submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-anti-RT antibody (upper panel) and anti-p24 antibodies (lower panel). B). R88-A3G inhibits viral cDNA synthesis at early stage of viral infection. Dividing C8166 T cells were infected with equal amounts of different HxBru-Vif<sup>+</sup> virus stocks, which were produced from 293T cells co-transfected with the provirus and HA-A3G or R88-A3G expressor. At 12 hours post-infection, 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed and the total viral DNA was detected by PCR using HIV-1 LTR-Gag primers, as described in <a href="#s4">Materials and Methods</a>. In parallel, the content of cellular β-globin DNA in each sample were also examined by specific PCR analysis (lower panel).</p>
