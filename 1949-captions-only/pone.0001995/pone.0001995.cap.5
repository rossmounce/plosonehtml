                Figure 5.  The R88-A3G is stably expressed in CD4+ C8166 cells and its presence does not affect cell growth and CD4 receptor expression.C8166 T cells (10×106) were transduced with lentiviral vectors containing R88-A3G (pYEF1-R88-A3G-puro), HA-A3G (pYEF1-HA-A3G-puro) transgenes or empty vector (pYEF1-MCS-Puro), and puromycin-resistant cell population was selected by puromycin (0.5 µg/ml). Once the puromycin-resistant cell population was obtained, different analyses were performedfor their characterization. A). To detect R88-A3G and HA-A3G expression in C8166 T cells, transduced cells were infected with HxBru-Vif− and HxBru-Vif+ virus. After 72 hours of infection, the produced viruses in the supernatant were concentrated by ultracentrifugation over 20% sucrose cushions. Then, virus pellets were lysed and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-A3G and anti-p24 antibodies. B). The CD4 receptor expression levels observed on vector- and R88-A3G-transduced C8166 T cells were analyzed by using anti-CD4 staining and a flow cytometry assay. C). The cell cycle profile of vector- and R88-A3G-transduced C8166 T cells was analyzed by measurement of the cellular DNA content by staining with 30 µg/ml of propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry assay. D). To assess the growth of vector- and R88-A3G-transduced C8166 T cells, a WST assay was performed to determine cell viability at different time points. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Results are shown as the mean ± SD of representative experiments.
