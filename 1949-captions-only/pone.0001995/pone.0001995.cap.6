Equal amounts of pNL4.3-GFP virus were used to infect vector-, HA-A3G-, or R88-A3G-transduced C8166 cell lines. After 48 hours of infection, virus-containing supernatants (passage 1) were collected, and the same volume of infectious supernatant was used to infect fresh and transduced C8166 cells (passage 2). The same procedure was performed again until virus-containing supernatants at assage 3 were obtained. Then, levels of HIV-1 Gag-p24 antigen in supernatants from passages 1, 2, and 3 were measured by HIV p24 ELISA assay. B). To test the effect of R88-A3G on virus infectivity, equal amounts (adjusted by Gag-p24 level) of virus from passage 1 were used to infect fresh R88-A3G-transduced C8166 cells. At different time points, the supernatants were collected and the HIV Gag-p24 level was measured to monitor virus replication. Also, at day 6 post-infection, the percentage of HIV-infected (GFP-positive) cells was evaluated by the flow cytometry assay (C).</p>
