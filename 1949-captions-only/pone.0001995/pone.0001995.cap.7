                Figure 7.  HIV-1 virus generated from CD4+ T cells stably expressing R88-A3G lost infectivity in human primary blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs).Equal amounts of pNL4.3-GFP viruses produced from vector- or R88-A3G-transduced C8166 cells (in figure 6, passage 1) were used to infect 1Ã—106 PHA-stimulated human PBMCs for 8 hours. After infection, PBMCs were washed and at different time intervals, virion-associated Gag-p24 antigen levels in the supernatant were measured by anti-p24 ELISA (A). Values were representative of data obtained from two independent experiments. At 5 days post-infection, the numbers of infected (GFP-positive) cells in mock-infected, or differently HIV-1 infected hPBMC cells, as indicated, were visualized under fluorescence microscopy (B).
