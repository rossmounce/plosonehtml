After infection, PBMCs were washed and at different time intervals, virion-associated Gag-p24 antigen levels in the supernatant were measured by anti-p24 ELISA (A). Values were representative of data obtained from two independent experiments. At 5 days post-infection, the numbers of infected (GFP-positive) cells in mock-infected, or differently HIV-1 infected hPBMC cells, as indicated, were visualized under fluorescence microscopy (B).</p>
