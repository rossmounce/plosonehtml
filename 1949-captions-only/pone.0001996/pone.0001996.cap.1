                Figure 1.  Targeting of EBNA1 into the rosa26 locus.(A) Molecular cloning strategy. A loxP flanked transcriptional stop cassette (stop) and the selectable maker gene for G418 resistance (neor) precede the EBNA1 gene in the rosa26 intron bracketed by exon 1 (e1) and exon 2 (e2) (top). After Cre-mediated deletion EBNA1 is transcribed from the ubiquitously expressed rosa26 locus in Bruce4 EBNA1 cells (bottom). (B) Southern blot analysis of several Bruce4 EBNA1 cell lines after Cre-mediated deletion of the stop cassette. The radioactive probe, depicted in (A), distinguishes between the initial targeted situation (8.7 kb) and deletion of the stop cassette (4.8 kb). (C) Expression of EBNA1 in different Bruce4 EBNA1 cell lines as confirmed by immunodetection (arrowhead). EBNA1-positive 293 cells serve as positive control, negative controls are mouse embryonic fibroblasts and parental mESCs (Bruce4).
