                Figure 2.  Recombinant EBV genomes.The maxi-EBV construct p3053 encompasses the prototypic EBV genome of the B95.8 strain [16], while the mini-EBV constructs p3314 lacks most lytic genes but encodes all latent viral genes [17]. Both plasmids can be selectively propagated in bacteria (F-factor replicon) under chloramphenicol selection (camr in p3314, not marked in p3053) and in eukaryotic cells under G418 selection (neor). p3053 also encodes gfp. Only latent viral genes are depicted, blue stands for EBNA genes and orange for LMP genes. Selected promoters are shown with arrowheads. ‘W’ stands for BamHI-W-repeats; oriP stands for the plasmid origin of replication, oriLyt is the active replication origin during virus synthesis. Terminal repeats (TR) are indispensable for encapsidation of virion DNA.
