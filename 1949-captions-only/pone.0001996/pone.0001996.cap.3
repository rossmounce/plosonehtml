(B) Gardella gel hybridizations reveal the extrachromosomal status of the recombinant EBV genomes. Raji cells, which contain about 50 EBV genomes per cell served as a positive control. In each single lane, 5Ã—10<sup>6</sup> Bruce4 EBNA1 cells carrying different recombinant EBVs as indicated were loaded. (C) Detection of cellular transcripts (actin, Oct4, Nanog) and viral transcripts (EBNA2, LMP1, LMP2) by RT-PCR amplification. Selected Bruce4 EBNA1 clones stably transduced with the indicated recombinant EBV constructs are shown.</p>
