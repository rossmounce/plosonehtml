                Figure 3.  mini- and maxi-EBVs in Bruce4 EBNA1 mESCs.(A) GFP expression of the stably introduced maxi-EBV constructs p3053 and p3298 in Bruce4 EBNA1 cells. (B) Gardella gel hybridizations reveal the extrachromosomal status of the recombinant EBV genomes. Raji cells, which contain about 50 EBV genomes per cell served as a positive control. In each single lane, 5Ã—106 Bruce4 EBNA1 cells carrying different recombinant EBVs as indicated were loaded. (C) Detection of cellular transcripts (actin, Oct4, Nanog) and viral transcripts (EBNA2, LMP1, LMP2) by RT-PCR amplification. Selected Bruce4 EBNA1 clones stably transduced with the indicated recombinant EBV constructs are shown.
