                Figure 4.  RT-PCR analysis of the Cp and Wp promoters indicated incorrect splicing and premature termination of viral EBNA transcripts in mESCs.RT-PCR analyses of EBNA-specific transcripts with primer pairs, which selectively amplify Cp or Wp originating transcripts. The expected patterns of multiply spliced exon combinations are schematically depicted. (A) C1/W2 primer pairs amplify transcripts, which originate from Cp. (B) W0W1'B/W2 primer pairs detect transcripts from Wp. The agarose gels show the RT-PCR patterns of different EBV-transduced Bruce4 EBNA1 clones together with the positive controls derived from B95.8 cells. (C) Off-size PCR products were isolated from gels as shown in B and directly sequenced. Their composition is schematically shown.
