Cobblestone indicates the appearance of cell areas in which hematopoietic precursors develop. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of selected cell cultures gated on lymphocytes of EB5 mESCs, the Bruce4 EBNA1 clone C1 and two derivatives transduced with the recombinant EBV genomes p3053 and p3314 as indicated. Numbers indicate the percentage of B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup>), IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells and IgM<sup>+</sup>/IgD<sup>+</sup> B cells within the lymphocyte gate. Cells were analyzed between day 20 and day 23 of the differentiation protocol.</p>
