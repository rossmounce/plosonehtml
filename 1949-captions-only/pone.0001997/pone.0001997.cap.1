Four corners of the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) are shown, with the length of each axis segment representing 10 Âµm to depict the scale in 3D. B) Close-up view of a spiny dendritic section, volume rendered in grayscale, with superimposed 3D model formed by sequential green frustra. A single capsule formed by a cylindrical dendritic segment capped by two hemispheres at consecutive nodes is outlined in blue. Spine candidate voxels V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are shown with their corresponding distance to surface (<em>DTS</em>) values (red arrows). The dark grey envelope around the dendrite represents the <em>MSH</em>, measured from the surface of the 3D model, as indicated by the white dashed line. C) Octree calculated for the top fork of the dendritic section shown in (A). The root node is outlined in red. Recursive subdivision of the 3D space results in increasingly smaller cubes surrounding the model. The inset on the right illustrates bulk rejection of voxels in a single leaf (red shaded cube) that does not intersect the <em>MSH</em> zone (grey envelope surrounding model) created by a small dendritic section. D) Volume-rendered spiny dendrite with voxels representing exterior maxima drawn as red cubes (voxel size exaggerated to enhance visibility). The number of exterior maxima is usually much greater than the number of spines, since multiple maxima may occur on a single spine (white arrow), or along the surface of the dendrites (red arrow).</p>
