A) Voxels of first layer shown in red. White frame shows each corner of the layer's AABB. B) Fourth iteration of the cluster-building algorithm produces the green layer, and correspondingly larger bounding box. C) In the last iteration, the diagonal of the bounding box exceeds the user-provided maximum spine width (<em>MSW</em>), as the green layer floods into the dendrite (green arrow). The yellow layer is the first to exhibit a spread ratio exceeding <em>SR</em><sub>(crit)</sub> (yellow arrow). Hence, the layer immediately preceding this becomes the spine base (orange layer, orange arrow). Scale bar shown as red horizontal edge of lower left corner of AABB represents 0.45 Âµm. D) Schematic of cluster layer-building, showing exterior maximum (red cube at maximum point); floor of layer 6 (proximal end of purple layer) and depth of layer 6 (distance from exterior maximum to floor).</p>
