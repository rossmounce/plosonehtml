The thick blue line indicates the resulting width of the structure as calculated by Rayburst, and provides an approximate scale of 0.7 µm. B) Side profile of the Rayburst core, demonstrating how the rays extend in the XY plane only, avoiding the effects of optical smearing in the Z direction. C) Bar graphs showing the blue Rayburst diameters calculated at each layer as a function of the layer number, for three representative spines of type, mushroom, thin and stubby. These profiles of Rayburst diameters are used to classify spine types. <em>HD</em>: head diameter; <em>ND</em>: neck diameter. For attached spines, the last layer's Rayburst diameter (black bar) is set to infinity.</p>
