From this computation an aspect ratio (<em>AR</em>) is calculated for the cluster to determine whether a spine has been found. For valid spines, the presence of a neck indicates a mushroom or thin spine, whereas absence of a neck indicates a stubby or thin spine. The aspect ratio and the width of the head (head diameter; <em>HD</em>) are used to resolve the final spine types.</p>
