                Figure 5.  Flowchart of Algorithm Used for Spine Classification.The spread profile of the cluster is used to determine the base of the spine. From this computation an aspect ratio (AR) is calculated for the cluster to determine whether a spine has been found. For valid spines, the presence of a neck indicates a mushroom or thin spine, whereas absence of a neck indicates a stubby or thin spine. The aspect ratio and the width of the head (head diameter; HD) are used to resolve the final spine types.
