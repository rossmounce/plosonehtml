Compared to the raw data (A), the deconvolved data exhibit good relative intensity equalization of spines and dendrites, and significantly reduced Z-axis “stretching” from optical smear, in the ZY projection (B). Note the difference in scale in XY vs ZY projections, reflecting the fact that voxel dimensions are twice as big in Z as in X and Y; (voxels are [0.05 µm, 0.05 µm, 0.1 µm]). C, D) Comparison of spines detected by one of the manual operators (red circles, C) and automatically by NeuronStudio (green circles, D). E,F) Close-up XY view of a spiny branch comparing spines detected manually (red circles, E) and automatically (green circles, D). Examples of typical mismatches between the manual and automatic detection methods are highlighted with double circles (double red circles: Manual-only detection; double green circles: <em>NS-only</em> detection), and by white arrows (misses). The short, stubby spine projecting downward from the dendrite is missed by the manual operator (white arrow, E), but detected by NeuronStudio (double green circles, F) A very faint, thin spine that is missed by NeuronStudio (white arrow, F) is detected by the manual operator only (double red circles, E). G,H) Close-up ZY view of a spiny branch comparing manual with automated spine detection. Example of a stubby spine projecting in the Z direction, that is typically missed by the manual operator (white arrow, G) but detected by <em>NS-only</em> (double green circles, H).</p>
