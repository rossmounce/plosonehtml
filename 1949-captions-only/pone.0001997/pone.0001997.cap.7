A) Image stack is shown as a 2D maximal projection with arrows indicating positions of three representative spines (numbered 1,2,3) oriented perpendicular to the image plane, that cannot be detected from a 2D projection. B) The same dataset shown as a 3D volume rendering. The three spines are somewhat more visible in the 3D XY view. C) XY view of spines detected in 3D by NeuronStudio with spine voxels represented in different colors, superimposed on volume rendered data. Arrows point to spines 1, 2, and 3, not visible in 2D, that can be detected by NeuronStudio in 3D. D) ZY view of the same dataset as shown in (C), rotated through 90Â° to show the prominence of these spines in 3D.</p>
