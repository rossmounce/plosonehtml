                Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the hanging drop method as considered in (A) Fowlis et al. [3], (B) Sibille et al. [4] and (C) Luft et al. [5] models.The interfacial area for mass transfer corresponds, respectively, to a spherical cap, to the cross-sectional area of a capillary tube and to an adjustable parameter of the model.
