<h4>Mass transfer resistance within the droplet</h4>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1"></a><p>In the theoretical study done by Fowlis et al. on the several resistances that determine the evaporation rate during the hanging drop method, the diffusion of water molecules from the interior of the droplet to the surface was estimated to be of higher magnitude than the diffusion of vapor across the air space <a href="#pone.0001998-Fowlis1">[3]</a>. The same authors consider, moreover, that the convection motion under a gravitational field promotes homogeneous composition of the solution in the droplet and decreases the importance of the diffusion step in the liquid phase to a point that is no longer significant for the whole process. The results presented in <a href="#pone-0001998-g004">Figures 4</a> and <a href="#pone-0001998-g005">5</a> seem to confirm that hypothesis whenever inorganic salts were used as precipitant; good predictions of the equilibration rates were obtained by considering that the rate limiting step was the vapor diffusion from the droplet to the reservoir. As previously referred, <a href="#pone-0001998-g004">Figure 4B</a> documents a contrasting case where the evaporation rates of droplets containing MPD were noticeably slower than the predictions. It is believed that the use of precipitants such as MPD or polyethylene glycol (PEG) may affect the rate of diffusion of water molecules and create a concentration gradient within the droplet (<a href="#pone-0001998-g006">Figure 6</a>). The additional diffusion resistance may explain the contradiction observed when solutes with a stronger vapor pressure lowering effect (like MPD relatively to ammonium sulfate) led to slower equilibration rates of water <a href="#pone.0001998-Mikol1">[7]</a>. Incorporating the additional diffusion resistance in the theoretical model will be firstly done by changing the boundary conditions at the droplet surface. Equation 5, concerned with the vapor pressure profile for <em>r</em>&lt;<em>R<sub>a</sub></em>, is now subject to the boundary conditions <em>p</em>|<em><sub>r</sub></em><sub> = <em>R</em></sub> = <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> and <span class="inline-formula"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001998.e033&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"></span>, where <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> is the effective interfacial vapor pressure. On the other hand, the interfacial vapor pressure is in equilibrium with the interfacial composition in the liquid phase represented in <a href="#pone-0001998-g006">Figure 6</a> by the water molar fraction, <em>x</em><sub>1<em>i</em></sub> (<em>x</em><sub>2<em>i</em></sub>, if one refers to the precipitant). Apart from the alteration in the boundary condition, the boundary value problem is solved as in the previous section to obtain a new equation for <em>I</em><sub>1</sub> that is analogous to Equation 24:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001998.e034&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(28)</span></span><br>The relationship between <em>x</em><sub>2<em>i</em></sub> and the precipitant molar fraction in the bulk of the droplet, <em>x</em><sub>2<em>d</em></sub>, is given as a function of the mass transfer coefficient of water in solution, <em>k<sub>c</sub></em>, using the following expression for the current <em>I</em><sub>1</sub>:<a name="" id=""></a><span class="equation"><img src="/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001998.e035&amp;representation=PNG" class="inline-graphic"><span class="note">(29)</span></span><br></p>
