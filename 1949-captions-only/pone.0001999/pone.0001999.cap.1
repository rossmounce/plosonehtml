                Figure 1.  Triggering TLR7 and/or 8 results in strong anti-HIV activity that varied with the origin of human lymphatic tissue.Dose-dependent blocking of HIV by the compounds tested (▪ = 3M-001, ▴ = 3M-002, ♦ = R-848) when exposing tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells to (A) the R5-tropic strain 49.5 (n = 2) or (B) the X4-tropic strain NL4-3 (n = 6 for 3M-001 and 3M-002 and for data points 3, 10, 30 µm, otherwise n = 2). (C) No toxic effects were noted in lymphoid tissue at 3 µm of any of the TLR agonists, as measured by the WST-1 assay (n = 6). Anti-HIV activities (D) in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells and (E) in PBMC. Data obtained with R-848 were partially published before [12]. Data were first analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and if tested significantly different, by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test.
