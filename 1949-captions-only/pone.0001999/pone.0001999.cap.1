(C) No toxic effects were noted in lymphoid tissue at 3 µm of any of the TLR agonists, as measured by the WST-1 assay (n = 6). Anti-HIV activities (D) in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells and (E) in PBMC. Data obtained with R-848 were partially published before <a href="#pone.0001999-Schlaepfer1">[12]</a>. Data were first analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and if tested significantly different, by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test.</p>
