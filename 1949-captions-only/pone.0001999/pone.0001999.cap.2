Represented is the fold increase of HIV replication in PMBC depleted of DC as compared to matched samples. (B) The TLR agonists 3M-002 and R-848 which trigger TLR8 and 7/8 respectively resulted in clumping and activation of MoMDC. This was not the case with 3M-001, which triggers solely TLR7. (Câ€“E) Triggering TLR8 or 7/8 resulted in marked activation of MoMDC as quantified by the cell-surface expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 (n = 4). Data were first analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and if tested significantly different, by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test.</p>
