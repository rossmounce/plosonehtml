                Figure 3.  NK cells and CD8+ T-cells are the effector cells responsible for the anti-HIV effects in PBMC after triggering TLR8 or TLR7/8.PBMC from different donors were either depleted of CD8+ T-cells or NK or both, treated with the various TLR7 and/or 8 agonists and infected with the X4-tropic strain NL4-3 two days later. HIV infection was monitored by measuring p24 antigen in the supernatant over time. Statistical analysis was done by paired t-test.
