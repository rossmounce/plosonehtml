Transwells were added with the purpose to separate the HIV infected CD4+ T-cells by a semi-permeable membrane (indicated by the dashed line) from autologous uninfected PBMC devoid of CD4+ T-cells. TLR agonists were added to the culture medium as indicated in the figure. Infected PBMC where the TLR agonists were added to the insert served as positive control for the TLRs' efficient antiviral activity. Notably, CD4+ T-cells do not express TLR7 and 8 and thus do not react to the TLR agonists added. In this setup any inhibitory HIV activity observed when HIV infected CD4+ T-cells were separated by a semi-permeable membrane from the PBMC (devoid of CD4+ T-cells) must be due to factors secreted by the PBMC into the medium, which then diffuse through the semi-permeable membrane (n = 3). This setup with separated cells was compared to PBMC which have been treated identically. Control indicates PBMC infected with HIV. B) Blocking the IFN-α/β receptor (IFN-α/β R) does not reverse the TLR7/8 triggering mediated inhibition of HIV. Neutralizing antibodies to IFN-α/β R was added at 10 µg/ml 30 minutes prior to R-848 to PBMC which was infected two days later with HIV. All values were indicated as relative to the matched control which was arbitrarily set to 1.</p>
