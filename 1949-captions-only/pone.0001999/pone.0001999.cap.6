Fusion of these cell lines will result in Tat driven LTR <em>lacZ</em> gene expression which we quantified histochemically by staining for Î²-galactosidase activity (n = 2). (B and C) Percentage of C4+ T-cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR4 was quantified by flow-cytometry two days after triggering TLR7 and/or 8 of PBMC Dashed lines indicate the matched samples. (D) Replication incompetent lentiviral viruses pseudotyped with VSV envelope which encodes a luciferase reporter gene were used to assess whether TLR7 and/or 8 triggering affects the early step in the replication cycle of HIV. Notably VSV uses a totally different entry mechanism than HIV which is highly unlikely to be affected by the TLR7 and/or 8 agonists. (E) Assessment whether TLR agonists have any effects on HIV replication at the transcriptional level or later in the HIV replication cycle. For this purpose, CD4+ T-cells were infected with HIV and spreading infection was blocked by adding the fusion inhibitor enfurvitide. These CD4+ T-cells with integrated HIV were co-cultured with either autologous PBMC devoid of CD4+ T-cells previously stimulated by TLR7 and/or 8 agonists vs unstimulated autologous PBMC devoid of CD4+ T-cells. Thus, any change in HIV output would be due to the effects on either transcription or later events in the HIV replication cycle due to TLR7 and/or 8 triggering (analysis of variance: n.s.; n = 6).</p>
