                Figure 1.  Group clustered resting-state networks.Group clustering of 3 Tesla resting-state fMRI data of a group of 26 subjects revealed 7 resting-state networks (RSNs). 1a shows a functional connected network consisting of the posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial frontal regions and bilateral parietal/temporal regions, a RSN known as the default mode network. 1b and 1c show lateralized parietal-frontal networks, networks that are often reported in attention and memory processing. 1d shows a joint network of both sensorimotor and visual networks. Iteratively clustering partitioned this cluster in 3 sub-clusters, shown in clustermap d'. The results showed separate clusters for primary visual regions (cluster d'-1), primary sensorimotor regions (cluster d'-2) and extra-striate visual regions (cluster d'-3). 1e shows a network of bilateral insular regions and posterior cingulate cortex. 1f and 1g represent singular clusters consisting of, respectively, a posterior part of Brodmann Area 7 and an anterior part of the cingulate cortex. The clustered networks show resemblance with previous reported RSNs.
