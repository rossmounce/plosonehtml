Iteratively clustering partitioned this cluster in 3 sub-clusters, shown in clustermap d'. The results showed separate clusters for primary visual regions (cluster <em>d</em>'<em>-1</em>), primary sensorimotor regions (cluster <em>d</em>'<em>-2</em>) and extra-striate visual regions (cluster <em>d</em>'<em>-3</em>). 1e shows a network of bilateral insular regions and posterior cingulate cortex. 1f and 1g represent singular clusters consisting of, respectively, a posterior part of Brodmann Area 7 and an anterior part of the cingulate cortex. The clustered networks show resemblance with previous reported RSNs.</p>
