To examine the effect of <em>rc</em> on the final group clustering, the individual clustering procedure was repeated with 3 settings of <em>rc</em>, being 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The overclustering parameter was kept fixed on 20. Group clustering (graph complexity threshold set to 9; number of RSNs set to 7) was repeated with the 3 sets of individual clustering results, resulting in 3 group clusterings. For all of the 7 group clusters the overlap of these clustering solutions was computed. Figure clearly shows large overlap for all of the 7 group clusters, indicating that the setting of <em>rc</em> did not affect the final group clustering. However, when <em>rc</em> was increased to 0.6 and up, more and more paths were removed from the individual graph. This clearly affected the individual clustering and the group clustering, changing the spatially layout of the clusters (data not shown).</p>
