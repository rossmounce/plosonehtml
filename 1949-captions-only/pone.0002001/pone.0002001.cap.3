For each individual dataset, the individual clustering (stage A) was repeated with varying number of clusters (assumed to result in overclustering), ranging from 15 to 35 (with steps of 5). This resulted in 5 clustermaps per individual dataset. Next, the group clustering (stage B) was repeated with the 5 sets of individual clustermaps (graph complexity threshold set to 9; number of RSNs set to 7). For each of the 7 resulting group clusters, the 5 cluster solutions were summated, creating an overlap map (cluster <em>a</em>â€“<em>g</em>) with voxel values ranging up to a maximum of 5. The maximum of 5 indicated an overlap off all 5 cluster solutions. Figure shows highly similar cluster results over the 5 different group clusterings, as suggested by the large overlap for each of the 7 clusters. As expected, the results demonstrated that the overclustering at the individual level did not change the nature of the group clustering.</p>
