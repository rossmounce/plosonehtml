The group clustering stage (stage B) was repeated (using the individual clustermaps consisting of 20 clusters) with different settings for the group cut-off threshold varying around the found optimum of 9 (ranging from 7 to 11). The number of clusters was set to the found optimum of 7 (see main text). Next, for each of the 7 clusters, the 5 group cluster solutions were summated, creating an overlap map with voxels ranging up to a maximum of 5. The maximum of 5 indicated the overlap of all 5 clustering solutions. Figure shows large overlap between the 5 group clusterings, for all of the 7 clusters. This large overlap demonstrates that varying the cut-off threshold around the found optimum only minor influenced the group results, indicating that the automatic parameter setting procedure resulted in a stable clustering solution.</p>
