A group graph was constructed, consisting of the cortical voxels that resulted from the group averaged cortical segmentation map and edges connecting all possible voxel pairs. The weight <em>W</em>(<em>i,j</em>) of the edge connecting voxel <em>i</em> and voxel <em>j</em> reflected the cluster consistency across the group of subjects and was computed as follows. For each individual clustermap, the individual cluster-similarity between voxel <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> was defined as 1 if in the individual clustermap voxel <em>i</em> and voxel <em>j</em> were grouped in the same cluster and 0 otherwise. Figure box shows the clustermaps of subject 1 and 2 and the last subject (subject S). In subject 1 the voxels <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> were not clustered in the same cluster, hence the cluster-similarity between voxel <em>i</em> and voxel <em>j</em> was set to 0. In contrast, in subject 2 and in subject S voxel <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> were clustered in the same cluster and therefore the cluster-similarity values between these voxels in these subjects were set to 1. At the group level, <em>W</em>(<em>i,j</em>) was computed as the summation of the cluster-similarities between voxel <em>i</em> and voxel <em>j</em> over the group of S subjects. <em>Step B2 Setting cluster parameters</em>. The group graph was clustered with increasing number of clusters P and increasing graph complexity cut-off thresholds Q. An optimal fit was computed as the clustering fit with the first minimum normalized cut cost value in descending direction of the number of P clusters, to maximize the number of meaningful clustered RSNs. <em>Step B3 Computing group clustermap.</em> The cortical voxels were labeled according to the optimal clustering fit, resulting in the group clustermap. The group clustermap represents networks of voxels that were consistently clustered into the same resting-state network across the group of subjects.</p>
