The relative levels of DDB1 and DDB2 mRNAs were normalized to those of β-actin mRNA. (B) DDB1 and DDB2 proteins were analysed in the total protein (50 µg) extracted from cells by Western blotting, using polyclonal anti-DDB1 and anti-DDB2 antibodies. Coomassie blue membrane staining was used as the protein loading control. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Relative band intensities for RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were quantified by densitometry. Data from RT-PCR analysis are expressed as the ratio for DDB1 or DDB2 mRNA levels/ β-actin mRNA levels. Data from Western blot analysis are expressed as relative densitometric units. Statistically significant differences from the HMEC values for DDB1 and DDB2 are indicated as ** and *<em>P</em>&lt;0.05, respectively.</p>
