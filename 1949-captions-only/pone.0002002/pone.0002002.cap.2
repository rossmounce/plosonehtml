The relative levels of DDB1 and DDB2 mRNAs were normalized to those of Î²-actin mRNA. Statistically significant differences between ER-positive and ER-negative samples are indicated as <em>P&lt;</em>0.05. The mean values are indicated by a bar in the graph for each group of tumors and DDB1 or DDB2 mRNA levels.</p>
