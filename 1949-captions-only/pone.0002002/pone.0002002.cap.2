                Figure 2.  DDB2 is expressed in human breast tumors from patients.Total RNA was extracted from eight ER-positive and eight ER-negative breast cancer samples, then subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. The relative levels of DDB1 and DDB2 mRNAs were normalized to those of Î²-actin mRNA. Statistically significant differences between ER-positive and ER-negative samples are indicated as P&lt;0.05. The mean values are indicated by a bar in the graph for each group of tumors and DDB1 or DDB2 mRNA levels.
