Total RNA was extracted from parental MCF-7 cells (Wt) and from cells stably transfected with either the DDB2-siRNA vector (clones cl.2 and cl.3) or the scrambled siRNA vector (control siRNA), then subjected to RT-PCR analysis. The relative levels of DDB1, DDB2, DHFR, cyclin E and PCNA mRNAs were normalized to those of β-actin mRNA. DDB1 and DDB2 protein levels were analysed in the total protein (50 µg) extracted from MCF-7 cell clones stably expressing DDB2 siRNA and from control cells, by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-DDB1 and anti-DDB2 antibodies. Coomassie blue membrane staining was used as the protein loading control for Western blot analysis. (B) Parent cells (Wt), control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells and the two DDB2 siRNA-transfected cell clones (DDB2 siRNA cl.2 and cl.3) were plated in 24-well dishes (1×10<sup>4</sup> per well) in complete medium and cell numbers were counted for 4 days. Means are shown for three experiments. Cell population doubling time was calculated from the cell growth curve during the exponential growth phase. (C) Wt cells, control siRNA and DDB2 siRNA transfected cells were seeded (500 cells) in 100-mm dishes and grown for 12 days. Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted and data from three independent experiments were expressed as the % of colony formation = (colonies formed/cells seeded)×100%. Statistically significant differences from the parental (Wt) cell value are indicated as * <em>P</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
