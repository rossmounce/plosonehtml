The DDB2 protein level was assessed by Western blot analysis, using equal amounts of protein (50 µg) extracted from parent cells (MDA Wt), empty vector-transfected cells (MDA Neo) and DDB2-overexpressing cells (MDA DDB2), and using DDB2 polyclonal antibody. Coomassie blue membrane staining was used as the protein loading control. (B) Parent cells (MDA Wt), empty vector-transfected cells (MDA Neo) and DDB2-transfected cell clone (MDA DDB2) were plated in 24-well dishes (1×10<sup>4</sup> per well) and cultured in complete medium. Cell numbers were counted on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Means are shown for three experiments. Cell population doubling times were calculated from the cell growth curves during the exponential growth phase. (C) MDA Wt, MDA Neo and MDA DDB2 cells were seeded (500 cells) in 100-mm dishes and grown for 12 days. Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted and data from three independent experiments were expressed as the % of colony formation = (colonies formed/cells seeded)×100%. Statistically significant differences from the MDA Wt cell value are indicated as * <em>P</em>&lt;0.05.</p>
