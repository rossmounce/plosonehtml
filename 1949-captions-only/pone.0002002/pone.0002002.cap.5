                Figure 5.  DDB2 knockdown affects cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 cells.Parent cells (Wt), control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells and the two DDB2 siRNA-transfected cell clones (DDB2 siRNA cl.2 and cl.3) were synchronized by serum starvation for 48h, and induced to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum for 0, 3, 12 or 18h. MCF-7 cells were harvested for propidium iodide staining and analysed by FACS to determine the cell cycle fraction. FACS plots and data are representative of at least three separate experiments.
