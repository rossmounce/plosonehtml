                Figure 6.  DDB2 knockdown decreases the ability of MCF-7 cells to re-enter the S phase of the cell cycle.Parent cells (Wt), control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells and the two DDB2 siRNA-transfected cell clones (DDB2 siRNA cl.2 and cl.3) were synchronized by serum starvation for 48h, and induced to re-enter cell cycle by the addition of serum for 0, 3, 12 or 18h. At the end of each of these periods after serum addition, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 5 BrdU for 20 min and were harvested for propidium iodide staining before being analysed by FACS for determination of the G1/S subpopulation and the S-phase fraction. FACS plots and data are representative of at least three separate experiments.
