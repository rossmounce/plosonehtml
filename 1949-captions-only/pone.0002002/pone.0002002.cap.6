At the end of each of these periods after serum addition, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 5 BrdU for 20 min and were harvested for propidium iodide staining before being analysed by FACS for determination of the G1/S subpopulation and the S-phase fraction. FACS plots and data are representative of at least three separate experiments.</p>
