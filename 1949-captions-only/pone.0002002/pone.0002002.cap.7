                Figure 7.  Analysis of PCNA expression in DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cells.Parent cells (Wt), control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells and the two DDB2 siRNA-transfected cell clones (DDB2 siRNA cl.2 and cl.3) were synchronized by serum starvation for 48h, and induced to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum for 3, 12 or 18h. PCNA protein levels were analysed in the total protein (50 Âµg) extracted from different cells by Western blotting, using specific polyclonal antibodies. Membranes were then probed with specific polyclonal antibodies against tubulin or stained with Coomassie blue as the protein loading control for Western blot analysis.
