PCNA protein levels were analysed in the total protein (50 Âµg) extracted from different cells by Western blotting, using specific polyclonal antibodies. Membranes were then probed with specific polyclonal antibodies against tubulin or stained with Coomassie blue as the protein loading control for Western blot analysis.</p>
