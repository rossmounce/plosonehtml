                Figure 1.  Hypothesis of etiology-defined pathways to pancreatic fibrosis.Hypothetical influence diagram illustrating pathologic pathways linking proximal factor (Factor A and B) to PSC (pancreatic stellate cell) and fibrosis through multiple steps (e.g. a1, a2, a3). Etiological factors of type B activate trypsinogen to trypsin, and therefore their pathologic pathway to the PSC can be interrupted by SPINK1. Etiological factors of type A are independent of trypsin, and therefore will not be influenced by variations in SPINK1 expression or function.
