During the activated state, the nCTX showed low voltage fast activity and the HPC showed prominent theta at ~4 Hz. During the transition state, there was an increase in overall power with a shift to lower frequencies at both sites; raw EEG traces showed irregular and moderately high amplitude activity. During the deactivated state, there was an even more prominent shift to low (~1 Hz) frequencies with a further increase in overall power and raw EEG traces displaying prominent rhythmic high amplitude slow activity. B) Continuous EEG traces of a spontaneous transition from activated to deactivated patterns. Positions from where the expanded traces in A were taken are shown. The transition between activated and deactivated patterns was marked by a gradual increase in the amplitude of the signals whereas the transition between deactivated and activated patterns was more abrupt. C), Continuous EEG traces over an even longer time scale demonstrated a regular and cyclic alternation of state as observed by the fluctuations in amplitude. The position from where traces in B were taken are shown. D) A spectrographic representation of the neocortical trace shown in C. The most prominent fluctuation of power was centered at a frequency of circa 1 Hz. E) Plot of power at 1 Hz from the spectrograph in D. The power values showed a cyclic fluctuation in amplitude continuing over the entire time of recording with an average period of ~9 minutes. F) Autocorrelation of power values from the experiment shown in (E) that showed a prominent rhythmic fluctuation at a similar period (9 min). G) Scatter plot of alternation period across time. The period length for the experiment illustrated remained stable as shown by the linear fit with a slope value not significantly different from zero (p = 0.46). H) The left panel shows regression lines for cycle periods across time for all experiments having 6 or more cycles. Different experiments are represented by different colored lines and demonstrate a general lack of variation within, but some variation across, animals. Thirty eight of the forty one animals displayed here showed no significant regression at a p level of 0.05. The right panel is a scatter plot of the average periods for each experiment (equivalent colors to the right panel) and the overall average (10.3Â±0.4 min) across all experiments.</p>
