Spontaneous state alternations were temporarily abolished in favor of a continuous activated state following inactivation of the BF. B) Expanded EEG traces from neocortical and hippocampal sites prior and following the infusion. Deactivated patterns were elicited during inactivation of the BF and these effects washed out with time. C) Duration of evoked deactivated activity as a function of the amount of lidocaine infused in the BF. D). Histological representation of infusion sites. Open circles indicate ineffective sites. Site marked with arrow and triangle denotes experiment shown in A and B. Abbreviations: B: basal nucleus, CPu: caudate putamen, ec: external capsule, f: fornix, GP: globus pallidus, HDB: horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, ic: internal capsule, mfb: medial forebrain bundle, MPOA: medial preoptic area, POA: preoptic area, SCh: suprachiasmatic nucleus, SI: substantia innominata.</p>
