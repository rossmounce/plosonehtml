Subsequent to a series of moderate stimulation trains, which were each effective in promoting an activated forebrain EEG during application, there was a transient suppression of forebrain state alternations. B) Expanded EEG traces from neocortical and hippocampal sites demonstrate that activated patterns were elicited via stimulation and that deactivated patterns follow a stimulation train. C) Scatterplot and linear fit of frequency as a function of the stimulation intensity in the PPT showing a significant (p&lt;0.01) relationship between stimulation intensity and the peak frequency of theta activity recorded in the hippocampus. The frequency was normalized across experiments to the maximal frequency of theta elicited in each. D) Summary of histological findings for the site of stimulation across experiments. Abbreviations: ll: lateral lemniscus, PAG: periaqueductal gray, PPT: pedunculo pontine tegmental nucleus, rs: rubrospinal tract, xscp: decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle.</p>
