Although the overall amplitude of the signal increased following the supplemental dose, state alternations (apparent as rhythmic changes in signal amplitude) were still observed. B) Spectrographic power at 1 Hz for the traces shown in A. Following the supplemental dose, power continued to fluctuate at a similar periodicity although there was an increase in the overall power in addition to the time spent in the deactivated state (and consequently a decrease in the time spent in the activated state). C) Autocorrelation of power values in B demonstrating similar rhythmicity before and after supplemental urethane administration. D) Individual (paired for animal across conditions by symbol and line) and overall averages demonstrating the consistency of alternation period duration before and after the supplemental doses of urethane across all experiments. Neither the individual nor the overall averages were significantly different.</p>
