                Figure 3.  Anaesthetic level was comparable across state alternations.A) Individual (paired for animals across states by symbol) and overall averages of withdrawal latency across activated and deactivated states in response to a ramped infrared beam applied to the tail or hindpaw. Withdrawal latencies were comparable across states and neither the individual nor overall averages were significantly different.
