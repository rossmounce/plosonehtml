B) Superimposed spectral plots of cortical EEG taken during activated, transition and deactivated states in a urethane-anaesthetized animal. Note the spectral peak in the transition spectra centered at ~8 Hz (spindle frequency). C) Superimposed spectrographic power at low (0 to 2 Hz: black) and spindle (7 to 10 Hz: red) frequencies (top panel), and the simultaneous occurrence and duration of spindles across the evolution of all state alternations for one full experiment (bottom panel). Note the augmented presence of spindling activity at the transition points between activated and deactivated patterns. D) Average (across all experiments) of the cross correlation function between 1 Hz and spindle (7â€“9 Hz) spectrographic power (n = 5; standardized cycle in degrees). The temporal relationship of spindling to slow oscillatory activity at 1 Hz patterns showed a consistent lag of approximately half a period length (~180 degrees).</p>
