Regular fluctuations between REM and nREM sleep stages were highly comparable in their timing to the state alternations later observed under urethane. Plotted on the same time scale underneath the raw traces is the respective spectrographic power at 1 Hz extracted from the cortical signals. These fluctuations demonstrated a similar rhythmicity across both conditions. B) Scatterplot representing period lengths of alternations for all animals under both naturally sleeping and urethane anaesthetized conditions. There was a remarkable similarity in the distribution and average length of alternations for each animal as well as for the overall average for natural sleeping and urethane anaesthetized conditions.</p>
