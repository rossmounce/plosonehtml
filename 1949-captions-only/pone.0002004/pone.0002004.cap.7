Declines in EMG tone with transitions from nREM to REM sleep were also apparent under urethane anaesthesia with transitions from deactivated to activated EEG patterns. B) The average percentage loss of EMG amplitude across these transitions was consistent and significantly different across both natural sleep and urethane anaesthesia in the same animals. C) Simultaneous extraction of cortical spectrographic power at 1 Hz (top panel), heart rate (middle panel) and respiration rate (lower panel) demonstrating concomitant fluctuations. Increases in both heart and respiration rates appeared during the lowest EEG power readings (i.e. the activated state). As well, during the activated state, the peak frequency of respiratory cycle tended to show greater variation. D) Fluctuations in heart (top) and respiration rates (bottom) were rhythmically correlated with state changes as shown in the cross correlation of these variables to cortical power at 1 Hz. E) Summary data across experiments showing significant increases in both heart (top) and respiration rates (bottom) when comparing the activated to the deactivated state.</p>
