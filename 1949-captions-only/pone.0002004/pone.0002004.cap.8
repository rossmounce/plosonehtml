Following an i.p. injection of oxotremorine (4.0 mg/kg) spontaneous alternations between activated and deactivated states were abolished in favor of the activated state. This induced activated state was abolished in favor of the deactivated state with a subsequent i.p. injection of atropine sulfate (ATSO<sub>4</sub>: 50 mg/kg). B) Expansions of EEG traces from neocortical sites show the similarity of activated and deactivated patterns induced by cholinergic agonism and antagonism, respectively. C) A scatter plots demonstrating the duration of the oxotremorine effect as a function of dosage. The effects of oxotremorine were longer than those of physostigmine (<a href="#pone-0002004-g006">Figure 6C</a>). As in <a href="#pone-0002004-g006">Figure 6</a>, the effects of atropine showed no reversal.</p>
