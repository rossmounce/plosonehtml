                Figure 8.  State alternations were dependent upon central muscarinic neurotransmission.A) Long duration cortical EEG traces in addition to spectrographic cortical power at 1 Hz demonstrating the effects of agonism and subsequent antagonism of muscarinic receptor mediated transmission. Following an i.p. injection of oxotremorine (4.0 mg/kg) spontaneous alternations between activated and deactivated states were abolished in favor of the activated state. This induced activated state was abolished in favor of the deactivated state with a subsequent i.p. injection of atropine sulfate (ATSO4: 50 mg/kg). B) Expansions of EEG traces from neocortical sites show the similarity of activated and deactivated patterns induced by cholinergic agonism and antagonism, respectively. C) A scatter plots demonstrating the duration of the oxotremorine effect as a function of dosage. The effects of oxotremorine were longer than those of physostigmine (Figure 6C). As in Figure 6, the effects of atropine showed no reversal.
