                Figure 9.  Monoaminergic depletion affected neither the activated state nor the alternations between states under urethane anaesthesia.A) Continuous hippocampal EEG traces and spectrographic power at theta frequencies under urethane anaesthesia following reserpine (5 mg/kg) pretreatment. Alternations between states were obvious as fluctuations in the amplitude of the raw EEG in addition to the spectrographic theta power (5 Hz). A further supplemental i.p. administration of reserpine (5 mg/kg) was without effect upon either the activated state or the alternations between states. However, a subsequent i.p. injection of atropine (ATSO4: 50 mg/kg) completely abolished the activated state and subsequent alternations between state. Hippocampal B) EEG expansions and C) spectra from before and after reserpine supplement demonstrating intact theta activity in both cases. D) Scatterplots of peak power and frequencies for activated states pre and post reserpine supplement. There were no significant differences between pre and post supplement groups. E) Scatterplots of period lengths pre and post reserpine supplements demonstrating that alternations and rhythmicity were not affected by reserpine.
