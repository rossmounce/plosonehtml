                Figure 1.  Cre-activated AAV vectors confer cell-type specific and high-level gene expression in brains of Cre knockin mice.(a) Injection of a generic AAV-GFP virus into neocortex of a Pv-cre mouse labeled neurons non-specifically. Pyramids can be recognized by the presence of thick apical dendrites (black arrowheads) and projecting axons (white arrows). (b) Injection of the AAV-lox-STOP-lox (LS1L)-GFP virus into the neocortex of a Pv-cre mouse specifically labeled neurons expressing Cre-recombinase. The STOP cassette is shown in gray in the schematic and is described in detail in Methods. Δβgeo-3xpA, a modified beta-galactosidae/neomycin STOP cassette with 3 poly-adenylation sites. (c) Injection of the AAV-LS2L-RFP virus into the neocortex of a Pv-cre mouse specifically labeled neurons expressing Cre-recombinase. A different version of STOP cassette is used here, Neo-2xpA, a neomycin STOP cassette with 2 poly-adenylation sites. PCMV, CMV promoter and β-globin intron; scale bar, 250 µm for a–c. (d) Co-localization (white arrowheads) of GFP and parvalbumin (PV) in neocortical basket interneurons in neocortex of a Pv-cre mouse injected with AAV-LS1L-GFP; scale bar, 20 µm. Far right, high resolution image of basket cell axons with “basket-like” terminal branches and boutons (yellow arrowheads) around pyramidal cell somata (labeled with NeuN immunofluorescence) characteristic to PV+ interneurons; scale bar, 5 µm. (e) Co-localization of GFP and LacZ in neocortical pyramidal neurons in a Emx-cre-nlsLacZ mouse injected with AAV-LS1L-GFP; scale bar, 20 µm. Note that not all LacZ+ pyramidal neurons were positive for GFP. Far right, spines (blue arrowheads) along a pyramidal cell apical dendrite; scale bar, 5 µm. (f) Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity at the soma normalized to intensity of GFP-labeled pyramidal soma in Thy1-GFP mice; n = 15 cells for each group. The intensity range for both Thy1-GFP and AAV-labeled somata was large, only the brightest cells were selected for this particular comparison (see Methods for details). Thy1-GFP: 1+/−0.08; AAV-LS1L-GFP::Pv-cre: 1.5+/−0.1; AAV-LS1L-GFP:: Emx-cre 1.3+/−0.2). All AAV-injected tissue was fixed 12–15 days post injection of 1.5–3 month-old mice.
