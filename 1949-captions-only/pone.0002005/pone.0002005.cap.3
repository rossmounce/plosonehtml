                Figure 3.  Functional demonstration that the Cre-activated AAV vector is cell-type specific.Pv-cre mice were injected with AAV-LS2L-ChR2mCherry and acute slices for electrophysiological recording were prepared. (a–c) Light stimulation directly elicited depolarizing responses in ChR2-positive neurons. DIC and fluorescent images of a ChR2-positive cell targeted for recording (a); scale bar: 10 µm. Spike responses to light stimulation of increasing duration (7, 14, and 500 ms as indicated by blue line) were recorded in cell-attached mode (b); scale bars: 40 pA, 25 ms. ChR2-mediated current was maintained in the presence of TTX. (c); scale bar: 50 pA, 10 ms. (d) Electrical field stimulation evoked both inhibitory post-synaptic current (upper trace, holding potential set to the reversal potential for AMPA/NMDA-mediated current, 0 mV) and excitatory post-synaptic current (lower trace, holding potential set to the reversal potential for GABA-mediated current, −55 mV), recorded in a pyramidal cell in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode; scale bar: 40 pA, 20 ms. (e) Light stimulation specifically evoked inhibitory post-synaptic current (upper trace), no excitatory post-synaptic current was detected (lower trace); scale bar: 20 pA, 20 ms. Inset, both inhibitory and excitatory spontaneous synaptic events were detected using the same recording conditions; scale bar: 20 pA, 50 ms.
