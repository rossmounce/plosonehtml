                Figure 5.  Chronic 2-photon imaging of structural dynamics of basket interneurons in-vivo.(a) Example images of the morphology of an axon branch and boutons in which both were stable over the course of two days. (b) One-week imaging interval in which the axon branch and boutons were largely stable (yellow arrowheads), additions (blue arrowheads) and subtractions (red arrowheads) on the axon shaft were observed. Note, two far right boutons are not shown for day 7. (c) Proportion of axon bouton additions and subtractions (total number of boutons examined = 183, from three animals). (d) Example in which newly formed boutons persistented for at least two days (blue arrowheads). Scale bars: 5 Âµm.
