                Figure 11.  Weight of ringed seal females caught in the open water season.Filled circles refer to data from this study (PS), and open circles are data compiled from the seal data base at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (NRM). A linear regression of pooled data (y = 9.16xâˆ’7.97, R2 = 0.83) suggest that ringed seal females gain 9.2 kg per month from May up to December.
