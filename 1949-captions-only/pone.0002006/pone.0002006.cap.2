                Figure 2.  Proportions of dives to depth intervals from 2â€“5 m to more than 80 m of adult ringed seals.Females tagged in the Bothnian Bay (BB) not included. More than 90% of male dives were deeper than 5 m in June, which changed to 25% in October to again increase to about 80% in March. A similar flux was evident in females, but the dives were generally shallower than for males.
