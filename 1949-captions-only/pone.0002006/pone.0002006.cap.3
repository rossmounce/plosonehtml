                Figure 3.  Duration (min) of dives of Baltic ringed seals (excluding females from the Bothnian Bay).About 70% of male dives lasted longer than 2 min in early summer, which decreased to 30% in October. An increase to about 50% was seen up to December, after which dive durations decreased markedly up to March. A similar pattern was seen in females, but dives lasted longer in December and January. About 10% of male dives lasted longer than 10 min in the period from June to September, compared with 0.8% for females.
