The general form of the model suggests that the exact values of all the parameters used could have very large effects upon the qualitative predictions we can make about the visiting behaviour of pollinators to heated flowers. However, the sensitivity analyses conducted (described in the <a href="#s3">methods</a> section, and presented in the supplementary material, <a href="#pone.0002007.s001">figures S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0002007.s002">S2</a>, <a href="#pone.0002007.s003">S3</a>, <a href="#pone.0002007.s004">S4</a>) demonstrate that the qualitative trends described below are robust for bumble bees.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2"></a><p>From the model presented here, we would predict that the optimal length of time that the bee should spend on a flower will increase as the temperature of the flower gets closer to the body temperature necessary for flight (although the actual increase seen is small–<a href="#pone-0002007-g002">figure 2a</a>), if a bee is behaving in a manner that maximises the net rate of energy delivery to its nest. This is seen, for example, in the mining bee <em>Andrena bicolor</em>, which showed a positive correlation between visit length and floral temperature when visiting the solar-heated flowers of <em>Narcissus longispathus</em>, an early-flowering montane species <a href="#pone.0002007-Herrera1">[25]</a>. Coupled with this increase in visit length with temperature is an increase in the net rate of gain (<a href="#pone-0002007-g002">figure 2b</a>), suggesting that providing warmth for pollinators could be the equivalent of the plant providing an extra metabolic reward. In the model we are assuming that the only point at which the bee stops flying is in flowers, and therefore the model does not consider other non-floral environmental temperatures, which are combined into the catch-all net cost of travelling term <em>c<sub>t</sub></em>. This suggests that bees should spend longer per flower visit if the flower is warm (due to an increase in θ<em><sub>f</sub></em>), but less time in a flower if the costs of travelling are reduced (a reduction in <em>c<sub>t</sub></em>), such as through an increase in the temperature of the extra-floral environment through which the bee has to travel.</p>
