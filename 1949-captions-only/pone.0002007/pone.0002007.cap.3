In both figures, the solid black line uses the standard parameter set as described in the <a href="#s3">methods</a> section, where travel time τ = 10 s. The solid blue line uses the same parameter set, but τ = 20 s. The dotted and dashed lines demonstrate a change in the cost of flight <em>c<sub>t</sub></em> (standardised at 0.336 J s<sup>−1</sup>), representing one way in which non-floral environmental temperature can be included: the dotted lines use <em>c<sub>t</sub></em> = 0.9×0.336 J s<sup>−1</sup>, and the dashed lines use 1.1×0.336 J s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
