                Figure 1.  Outline of the different either larval or plant variables measured in this study.Four N. attenuata genotypes were used: untransformed wild type (WT) plants of the Utah genotype (WT); a homozygous T3 line of the WT genotype transformed with a construct containing a 175 bp pi gene fragment in an anti-sense orientation (AS-Natpi); untransformed plants of the Arizona (A) genotype; or plants of the Arizona genotype transformed with a construct containing the full-length pi gene in a sense orientation (S++). Two plant variables were measured at either the BOTTOM (S1) or the MIDDLE (S5) of plants: leaf protein content and NaTPI activity. M. sexta neonates were placed either at the MIDDLE or the BOTTOM of plants and five larval variables were measured: caterpillar mass, gut trypsin activity, effects of induced NaTPI on gut trypsin activity, stability of NaTPI in the gut and the recovery of inhibited trypsin activity after larvae moved to plants without NaTPI.
