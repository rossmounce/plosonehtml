Two plant variables were measured at either the BOTTOM (S1) or the MIDDLE (S5) of plants: leaf protein content and NaTPI activity. <em>M. sexta</em> neonates were placed either at the MIDDLE or the BOTTOM of plants and five larval variables were measured: caterpillar mass, gut trypsin activity, effects of induced NaTPI on gut trypsin activity, stability of NaTPI in the gut and the recovery of inhibited trypsin activity after larvae moved to plants without NaTPI.</p>
