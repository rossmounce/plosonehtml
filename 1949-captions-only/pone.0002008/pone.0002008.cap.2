                Figure 2.  Trypsin proteinase inhibitors (NaTPI) and protein contents of N. attenuata.A. NaTPI. B. protein contents (mean 1±SEM) in leaves growing at node S1 (BOTTOM) or node S5 (MIDDLE) which had been either UNINDUCED or INDUCED by caterpillars feeding for 4 days, and C. M. sexta larval mass (mean 1±SEM) 7 days after neonates started to feed on leaves at either S1 (BOTTOM) or node S5 (MIDDLE) positions of: WT, AS-Natpi, A or S++ plants. n.d. = not detectable in the A genotype. Symbols above columns indicate levels of significant differences with respect to untransformed genotypes either A or WT (*P&lt; 0.05, **P&lt; 0.001, ***P&lt; 0.0001).
