                Figure 3.  Gut proteinase activity (meanÂ±SEM) of M. sexta larvae.Larvae fed on leaves growing at either node S1 (BOTTOM) or S5 (MIDDLE) of WT and AS-Natpi genotypes. A. Second-instar caterpillar guts (5 days after hatching). B. Third-instar caterpillar guts (10 days after hatching). Gut proteinase activity levels of third-instar caterpillars that fed at the MIDDLE of plants were not measured (n.m.), as explained in Materials and Methods. Total gut proteinase activity was measured using azocasein as a substrate (black bars), and trypsin-like activity was measured using BApNA as a substrate (open bars). Symbols above columns indicate levels of significant differences between either WT and AS-Natpi genotypes at the BOTTOM of plants, or between the BOTTOM and MIDDLE of WT plants (*P&lt; 0.05, **P&lt; 0.001, ***P&lt; 0.0001).
