A. Second-instar caterpillar guts (5 days after hatching). B. Third-instar caterpillar guts (10 days after hatching). Gut proteinase activity levels of third-instar caterpillars that fed at the MIDDLE of plants were not measured (n.m.), as explained in <a href="#s2">Materials and Methods</a>. Total gut proteinase activity was measured using azocasein as a substrate (black bars), and trypsin-like activity was measured using BA<em>p</em>NA as a substrate (open bars). Symbols above columns indicate levels of significant differences between either WT and AS-<em>Natpi</em> genotypes at the BOTTOM of plants, or between the BOTTOM and MIDDLE of WT plants (*P&lt; 0.05, **P&lt; 0.001, ***P&lt; 0.0001).</p>
