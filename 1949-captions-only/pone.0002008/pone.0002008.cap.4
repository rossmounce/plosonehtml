Either A. different protein concentrations or B. NaTPI activity of WT leaves from either the BOTTOM (•) or the MIDDLE of plants (▴) were used as inhibitors. BA<em>p</em>NA was used as a substrate, and the inhibition of hydrolysis of the substrate by gut proteinases after incubation with NaTPI was determined from guts of third-instar caterpillars reared on artificial diet.</p>
