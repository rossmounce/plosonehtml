                Figure 4.  Kinetics of trypsin activities in M. sexta guts with different NaTPI levels and protein contents.Larval proteinases were inhibited by adding different dilutions of N. attenuata's trypsin proteinase inhibitor (NaTPI). Either A. different protein concentrations or B. NaTPI activity of WT leaves from either the BOTTOM (•) or the MIDDLE of plants (▴) were used as inhibitors. BApNA was used as a substrate, and the inhibition of hydrolysis of the substrate by gut proteinases after incubation with NaTPI was determined from guts of third-instar caterpillars reared on artificial diet.
