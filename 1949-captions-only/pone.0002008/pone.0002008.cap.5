Caterpillars were either reared on artificial diet or fed foliage from WT plants and gut trypsin activity was measured at the following developmental stages: A. second-instar caterpillar guts (6 days after hatching); B. third-instar caterpillar guts (10 days after hatching). NaTPI from the BOTTOM of WT plants either uninduced (U); induced after 4 days of caterpillar attack (Cat); or induced after 4 days of wounding followed by the application of <em>M. sexta</em> oral secretions (OS) to puncture wounds (W+OS) were used as the inhibitor in the <em>in vitro</em> assays. BA<em>p</em>NA was used as a substrate to determine gut proteinase activity. Within each diet of caterpillars and instars, bars with the same letter are not significantly different at P&lt; 0.05.</p>
