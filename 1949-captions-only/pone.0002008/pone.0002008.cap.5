                Figure 5.  Inhibited digestive trypsin activity (meanÂ±SEM) of M. sexta by NaTPI.Trypsin activity was inhibited (open bars) by adding N. attenuata's trypsin proteinase inhibitor (NaTPI). Caterpillars were either reared on artificial diet or fed foliage from WT plants and gut trypsin activity was measured at the following developmental stages: A. second-instar caterpillar guts (6 days after hatching); B. third-instar caterpillar guts (10 days after hatching). NaTPI from the BOTTOM of WT plants either uninduced (U); induced after 4 days of caterpillar attack (Cat); or induced after 4 days of wounding followed by the application of M. sexta oral secretions (OS) to puncture wounds (W+OS) were used as the inhibitor in the in vitro assays. BApNA was used as a substrate to determine gut proteinase activity. Within each diet of caterpillars and instars, bars with the same letter are not significantly different at P&lt; 0.05.
