                Figure 6.  Inhibited trypsin activity (meanÂ±SEM) of M. sexta gut proteinases.Trypsin activity was inhibited (open bars) by adding N. attenuata's trypsin proteinase inhibitor (NaTPI). We used the protein extracts from either A or S++ genotypes as inhibitors and BApNA as a substrate in the in vitro assays, and determined the inhibition of hydrolysis of the substrate by gut proteinases after incubation with NaTPI. Third-instar caterpillars were fed on leaves growing on either A or S++ genotypes. Bars with the same letter are not significantly different at P&lt; 0.05.
