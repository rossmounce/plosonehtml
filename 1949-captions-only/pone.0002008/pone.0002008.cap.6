We used the protein extracts from either A or S++ genotypes as inhibitors and BA<em>p</em>NA as a substrate in the <em>in vitro</em> assays, and determined the inhibition of hydrolysis of the substrate by gut proteinases after incubation with NaTPI. Third-instar caterpillars were fed on leaves growing on either A or S++ genotypes. Bars with the same letter are not significantly different at P&lt; 0.05.</p>
