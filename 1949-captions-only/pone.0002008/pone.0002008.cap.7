                Figure 7.  Stability of NaTPI against trypsin of M. sexta larvae.Leaf extracts of WT containing NaTPI incubated with 2 trypsin inhibitor units of third-instar gut proteinase for 0.5 h or 3 h at 30Â°C. Two controls were used: C1 (not incubated) and C2 (incubated without gut proteinases for 3h). Mixtures were resolved on 10% PAGE and then visualized for trypsin inhibitor activity using gel X-ray film contact print technique [60].
