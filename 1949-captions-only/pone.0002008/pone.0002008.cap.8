                Figure 8.  Recovery of inhibited trypsin activity after larvae moved to plants without NaTPI.Gut proteinase activity levels (mean±SEM) in third-instar M. sexta larvae that fed on leaves of either A or S++ genotypes. Half of the larvae feeding on either A or S++ genotypes were transferred from either A to S++ genotypes (A→S++) or S++ to A genotypes (S++→A), and after 24 h gut proteinase activity was measured. Total gut proteinase activity was measured using azocasein as a substrate (black bars) and trypsin-like activity was measured using BApNA as a substrate (open bars). Symbols above columns indicate levels of significant differences between either A and A → S++ or S++ and S++→A treatments (*P&lt; 0.05, **P&lt; 0.001, ***P&lt; 0.0001).
