pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.3:                Figure 3. Clusters of Hox-related homeobox genes in the Nematostella genome. Based on the current genomic assemblies, thirty ANTP class genes of Nematostella are distributed among seven homeobox clusters [52]. The location of the PRD class gene Dmbx is also shown. The arrangement of the Nematostella genes is shown in relation to the hypothesized "extended Hox cluster," that is presumed to have existed in the most recent common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes (gray box; [127], [128]). Horizontal lines connecting Nematostella genes indicate known genomic linkage. Double-arrows connect Nematostella homeodomains to their putative bilaterian homologs based on phylogenetic analyses of homeodomain sequences (Figure 1; supp figs. 1–2). Detailed diagrams of each of the eight Nematostella homeodomain clusters are presented in supplemental figures 3
pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.9:                Figure 9. Re-analysis of the Kamm et al. maximum-likelihood phylogeny. (A) The redrawn maximum-likelihood phylogeny presented by Kamm et al. [49]. The tree is unrooted. Based on the Dayhoff-PAM1 substitution matrix [129] the tree's overall likelihood is −2288.08809. Bootstrap proportions determined in the original study are shown above the relevant nodes. Bootstrap proportions determined in the current study are shown below the relevant nodes. Inferred lineage specific gene losses are represented by open circles (black for Bilateria and red for Cnidaria). Inferred lineage specific gene duplications are represented by solid circles (black for Bilateria and red for Cnidaria). Sequences inferred to have been present in the common ancestor are indicated by lettered squares. The names of gene families that contain cnidarian representatives are enclosed by red lines. (B) A tree we identified using global instead of local rearrangements with the Kamm et al. data and the Dayhoff substitution matrix. The tree's overall likelihood is −2280.76406. Bootstrap proportions determined in the present study are shown below the relevant nodes. The dataset used in this analysis is available as Figure S13.
pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.6:                Figure 6. Mean statistical support for select phylogenetic groupings. The mean statistical support for hypothetical clades linking each of six Nematostella Hox/ParaHox lineages with potential homologs in the Bilateria is depicted graphically. The mean statistical support is the average of the neighbor-joining bootstrap proportion, the Bayesian posterior probability, and the maximum-likelihood bootstrap proportion. It is expressed as a percent of trees in which the given grouping was recovered. Individual Nematostella genes were grouped into lineages (for example, anthox1-anthox1a) when the mean statistical support for the clade uniting them exceeded the mean statistical support for any other competing relationship. The final column depicts the highest support obtained for any pairwise relationship with another cnidarian homeodomain.
pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.10:                Figure 10. Phylogenetic mapping of Hox expression. The neighbor-joining and Bayesian phylogenies (Figure 2 and S1) were pared to remove all bilaterian sequences. The strict consensus topology shown here depicts the relative relationships among Nematostella sequences. Each of the Nematostella Hox-related sequences is coded according to whether its expression is restricted along the primary (O/A) body axis or the secondary (directive) body axis (Y = yes; N = no). A yellow Y in the directive column signifies that the expression is bilateral (both sides of the directive axis), and a red Y indicates that the expression is unilateral. The character state found in the terminal taxon is indicated in the colored boxes. The internal nodes are shaded to indicate the character states found in hypothetical ancestors. For each gene, the spatial expression is depicted on a diagram of the juvenile polyp. In the case of Dlx, anthox6a and anthox1, the expression pattern that is depicted actually occurs earlier, in the larval stage, but it is represented on a diagram of the polyp to facilitate spatial comparisons with the other genes. The polyp is drawn in lateral view with the overlying ectoderm (dark gray) partially peeled away to reveal the underlying endoderm of the body column (light gray) and the lumen of the pharynx (white). The pharynx is drawn as though everted. Only one representative tentacle is shown. The mesoglea, a largely acellular layer of connective tissue that separates the endoderm from the ectoderm, is depicted as a thin black line. Gene expression is depicted as black shading in the endoderm or ectoderm. The major regions along the primary body axis are demarcated with dotted lines: Ph = pharynx; H = head; C = column; F = foot. Cross-sectional views through the body column (at the arrowheads) are shown for Gbx, anthox7, anthox8a, anthox8b, anthox6a, anthox1a, and NVHD065.
pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.1:                Figure 1. Alignment of homeodomains included in the phylogenetic analyses. All sequences are aligned to the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain. Each Nematostella sequence is grouped with putative bilaterian homologs. The degree of statistical support (bootstrap proporation [BP] or posterior probability [PP]) for each of these homology assignments is indicated separately for the neighbor-joining (NJ), Bayesian (Bayes), and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. The average statistical support for each grouping is indicated in the far right column (NJ-BP+Bayes-PP+ML-BP/3). The dataset is available in Phylip format as Figure S12.

Bilaterian sequences are shown in black. Bootstrap proportions are presented at each node. Open circles depict implied gene losses for Nematostella (red) and Branchiostoma (black). Closed circles depict implied lineage-specific gene duplications for Nematostella (red) and Branchiostoma (black). The dataset used in this analysis is available as Figure S12.
pone.0000153/pone.0000153.cap.7:                Figure 7. Hox/ParaHox evolutionary scenarios. The phylogenies drawn here depict six mutually exclusive scenarios regarding the evolution of the Hox and ParaHox genes. Ten distinct Hox and ParaHox lineages are thought to have been present in the ancestral bilaterian (Hox1, Hox2, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5, Hox6–8, Hox9+, Cdx, Gsx, and Xlox). Five distinct Hox/ParaHox lineages are recognized for Nematostella. (Nematostella homeodomains that tend to cluster together in the phylogenetic analyses are grouped together here: anthox1/1a; anthox2/9; anthox6/6a; anthox7/8a/8b.) Assuming no gene loss in the Cnidaria, then the existence of five Hox/ParaHox lineages in Nematostella implies that the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor (CBA) could have possessed as few as one Hox/ParaHox gene (scenario A) or as many as five (scenario E). There is some indication that a central class Hox gene was lost in the Cnidaria [47], and that the CBA may have possessed six distinct Hox/ParaHox genes (scenario F). The ancestral Hox/ParaHox genes present in the CBA are indicated by solid squares. If a particular hypothetical clade is recovered on one or more of the phylogenetic analyses presented here, this is indicated above the relevant branch (NJ = neighbor-joining, Figure 2; Ba = Bayesian inference, Figure S1; ML = maximum- likelihood, Figure S2; φ = none). Below each branch, the average statistical support is indicated (NJ-bootstrap proportion+Bayes-posterior probability+ML-boostrap proportion/3). Each scenario implies a different number of lineage-specific gene losses.

Bayesian majority rule consensus phylogenetic tree for the amino acid alignment of vertebrate large lipid transfer modules rooted with galaxy coral. Numbers beside nodes indicate posterior probabilities (consensus of 6,500 trees from 650,000 generations). See methods for further details of phylogentic analyses and supplementary material (Table S1) for accession numbers. Schematic linear scale representations of the structure of the vitellogenin genes are drawn for each taxa with complete sequences in the databanks. Sub-domain structures were identified from conserved cleavage sites. The iPv1 of Pacific oyster is proposed to be the origin of the first polyserine domain in the vitellogenins of insects. The geological scale provides an estimate of the divergence of the genes. Since the Vtg genes were not clock-like, this scale is approximate. See text and Fig. 2 for an explanation of the gene duplication model. X = gene lost; (P) = pelagic egg; (B) = benthic egg.

pone.0000189/pone.0000189.cap.5:                Figure 5. Phylogenetic analysis of PDZ and LIM domains. (A) The evolutionary tree for the PDZ domains is shown. The percentages for Bayesian posterior probability (first number) and for Maximum Likelihoods (second number) are indicated at the branches. The tree is rooted using the PDZ domain of the yeast (S. cerevisiae) NAS2 protein as an outgroup. The percentage Bayesian posterior probability and percentage Maximum Likelihood are indicated at the branches (Bayesian/Likelihood). All species can be identified from the last two letters of the taxon labels. All species cluster according to their appearance in the tree of life (www.tol.org) with the exception of the LIMK1 for Xenopus tropicalis and Gallus gallus, which are in reverse order, this was already seen in the full length analysis of the LIM kinases for the frog and chicken homolog (Fig. 2D). (B) The phylogenetic analysis of the LIM domains is shown. The tree is rooted using the LIM domain of the yeast (S. cerevisiae) LRG1 protein as an outgroup. Percentage Bayesian posterior probability and percentage Maximum Likelihood are indicated at the branches (Bayesian/Likelihood). (C) Shown is the phylogenetic analysis of conserved intronic-sequences of LIM domains of tag204, eat-1, LMO7 and a Dictyostelium discoideum LIM domain as an outgroup.

(A,B,D and E) and PDZ domain sequences (C). In all phylogenetic trees shown, are the percentages for Bayesian posterior probability (first number) and for Maximum Likelihoods (second number) indicated at the branches. In figure C only the major branches are labeled for better overview. The two letter abbreviations used refer to genus and species, with the first capital letter and the second non-capital letter, respectively. All abbreviations used are given in material and methods. ENH is used for Enigma homolog (A) Shown is a phylogenic tree based on the full-length sequences of members of the Enigma subfamily. (B) Phylogenetic analysis for the ALP subfamily, based on full length sequences of selected homologs. (C) Evolutionary tree based on the PDZ domains of both ALP and Enigma subfamilies. (D) Phylogeny of the LIM domain kinases based on full length amino acid sequences. The root is placed on the Drosophila melanogaster homolog. The fruitfly homolog (which roots with the Uruchordate homolog found in Ciona intestinalis) gives rise to the common ancestor for the vertebrate LIM kinases. This ancestor then duplicates into LIMK1 and LIMK2, which are both present in all the vertebrate species investigated. (E) Evolutionary tree of LMO7 genes. The tree is rooted to the Caenorhabditis elegans sequence of tag-204, which has a similar structure to LMO7, albeit without the CH domain.
pone.0000189/pone.0000189.cap.6:                Figure 6. Evolutionary model for the PDZ and LIM encoding genes. The most parsimonious model derived from our phylogenetic analysis shows that the PDZ domain of all 10 different PDZ/LIM encoding genes share a common ancestor, with closest homology to LMO7. The combination of this PDZ domain with a LIM domain formed the common ancestor for both the LMO7 and the ALP/Enigma lineages. The single LIM domain in the ALP/Enigma lineage (closest to LIM2 in eat-1/tungus) then duplicated and gave rise to a PDZ two LIM domain structure. Subsequently the duplicated LIM (closest to LIM3 in eat-1/tungus), duplicated twice and generated a PDZ four LIM structure similar to eat-1/tungus. From this gene structure, through gene duplication and subsequent domain loss (loosing either three LIM domains (LIM2–4) or only 1 LIM domain (LIM1) for the ALP and Enigma subfamilies, respectively), the ALP/Enigma subfamilies evolved. The color code used for domains is PDZ (blue), LIM (yellow and green), CH (red), Kinase domain (black) and AM-motif (pink).
pone.0000204/pone.0000204.cap.6:                Figure 6.  Distribution and evolution of DANGER genes in metazoa.(A) The tree on the left summarizes the phylogenetic relationships of the informative species used. Numbers at nodes represent cell types adopted from [13]. Yellow boxes indicate the presence of a DANGER gene in a particular taxon. Numbers correspond to the number of genes found in each taxon. “X” indicates the absence of a DANGER gene in a particular taxon (blue boxes). Uncertain orthologous relationships are indicated by question marks (green boxes). “UN” indicates the unclassified DANGER proteins or the ones that could not be unconditionally assigned to a specific group. The choanoflagellate sequence from M. ovata assumes outgroup position in all phylogenetic analyses. Divergence times in million years ago (MYA) were taken from references [58], [59]. (B–C) Two alternative evolutionary scenarios explain the evolution of DANGER families in metazoa. Both scenarios presume that the genome sequence of the vertebrate ancestor encoded at least six DANGER lineages, namely D1–D6. (B) According to the first scenario, anthozoa contain two (D2, D6) of the six vertebrate DANGER lineages, while the remaining DANGER lineages have evolved by repeated cycles of gene birth (+) and death (−). (C) In the second scenario anthozoa species contain sequences orthologous to all vertebrate DANGER groups. This scenario presupposes that in ecdysozoa, hemichordates, and urochordates four DANGER groups were lost. Dotted lines correspond to ancestral stages. The order of events is presented according to the species tree.

Occurrence of TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR) genes in 226 completely sequenced Gram negative bacterial genomes, in ecological (A) or phylogenetic (B) contexts. TBDRs were detected by screening the Pfam database and the UniprotKB protein knowledge database using the two Pfam HMMs (PF07715, Plug; PF00593, TonB_dep_Rec). Only proteins displaying the two Pfam domains were considered. The habitat of bacteria (A) and their phylogeny (B) are represented by colour codes (see the legend boxes).
pone.0000235/pone.0000235.cap.2:                Figure 2. The blackcap parasite flock placed in a phylogenetic context. The tree A shows the phylogenetic position of parasites found in blackcaps (red), garden warblers (blue) and African hill babblers (purple), among 143 parasite lineages found in 48 bird species. Monophyletic parasite groups apparently exclusive to some species are encircled in orange (species names are mentioned and the number of parasites in each group is shown in brackets). The tree B shows the parasite flock (represented by a triangle in the tree A). Numbers represent &gt;75% support to internal branches, based on bootstrap replicates (above) or posterior probabilities (below). For six parasites in this cluster, the figure shows the match between phylogenies based on mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear DHFR-TS genes (the number of cases with each association of haplotypes is indicated, and bootstrap support is reported if &gt;75%).

pone.0000274/pone.0000274.cap.3:                Figure 3. Dewlap patterns mapped on to a phylogeny for Anolis species. Patterns are indicated in color on the phylogeny (color legend upper left). Polymorphic species are those that exhibited two or more pattern morphs (see text for how this was handled analytically). Patterns are defined in the text. This tree includes all of the species used in the tests for phylogenetic signal of dewlap characters. The tree is modified from Nicholson et al.'s [20] anole tree but has been pruned of taxa for which dewlap information was lacking. Analyses were based on an ultrametric version of this tree, but is reproduced here in cladogram form for enhanced viewing of dewlap pattern information.

pone.0000381/pone.0000381.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Phylogram representation of CE clan proteases in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes.Eukaryotic peptidases (in blue) belong to the C48 subfamily and can be separated into three groups: ULP1 (including the mammalian proteases SENP1, 2, 3, and 5), ULP2 (including SENP6 and 7), and the SENP8 group with proposed specificity for SUMO (ULP1 and ULP2 group) and Nedd8 (SENP8 group), respectively. Bacterial proteins are indicated with a preceding “B”, viral proteins with a “V”. We have further divided microbial protease homologs by color: green for biochemically tested proteases, red indicating the absence of published data on the function of these putative proteases, and yellow for the group representing elaD and its orthologs. The C5 family contains Adenovirus proteases with deubiquitinating activity, C55 comprises the bacterial YopJ homologs, and C57 the Vacciniavirus I7 peptidases. Based on sequence similarity, two bacterial C48 family groups can be distinguished: a group of Proteobacteria (located at one o'clock) which appear to be closely related to fungal SENP8 homologs (common node indicated with a circle, bootstrap support&gt;60%), and Chlamydiae, for which we had previously shown the presence of deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity. Three additional groups have not yet been assigned to specific CE clan subfamilies in the MEROPS database, including Mimivirus (“group I”), Gammaproteobacteria (“group II”), and Rickettsiae (“group III”). The African Swine Fever Virus protease and the I7 Vacciniavirus protease have not been tested for deubiquitinating or Ubl-specific activity, but they both require a glycine-based motif at the C-terminus of the substrate, as found in ubiquitin or Ubls. The unrelated CD clan peptidase Clostripain is used as outgroup in this phylogram. For clarity, this tree does not contain all orthologs and paralogs of the different groups or families. Sequence information is provided in Table 2.
pone.0000413/pone.0000413.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Negative relationships between the degree of intermale variation in sperm morphology and the level of postcopulatory sexual selection (see Table 1).(A) Intermale variation in sperm size is negatively associated with relative testes size (p = 0.003, n = 18). (B) Intermale variation in sperm length is negatively associated with levels of extrapair paternity (p&lt;0.001, n = 11). (C) Intermale variation in sperm design is negatively associated with relative testes size (p = 0.004, n = 18). (D) Intermale variation in sperm design is negatively associated with levels of extrapair paternity (p = 0.006, n = 11). All analyses were performed controlling for phylogeny and sample size using Generalised Least-Squares Models and transformed variables.

pone.0000461/pone.0000461.cap.2:                Figure 2.  UPGMA dendrogram of VNTR data from worldwide B. anthracis isolates: Fifteen VNTR loci and UPGMA cluster analysis were used to establish genetic relationships among the 1,033 B. anthracis isolates.In this UPGMA dendrogram, which was created using MEGA software [39], groups of genetically similar isolates are collapsed into black triangles that are sized in proportion to the number of isolates in that particular lineage. VNTR loci mutate at faster rates than SNPs and, hence, provide greater resolution for terminal branches. Longer branches, such as the B and C lineages, have length underestimation in this analysis due to mutational saturation. The scale bar indicates genetic distance. Also illustrated on this figure is the distribution of the canonical SNP groups relative to the MLVA phylogeny (right columns). The number of isolates (N) associated with each canSNP group is shown in the second column. The correlation between the phylogenetic clusters identified by the canSNP and MLVA analysis with regards to the world wide geographic distribution of these clusters can be seen in Figure 3.

Percentage of comparisons with matches for each prokaryotic species based on an environment and function metric.The top 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 nearest neighbors for each prokaryotic species were retained and their corresponding environmental and functional data were compared by computing the average number of matches across nine categories. This analysis was performed for prokaryotes on the niche map (circles) and the phylogenetic map (squares) as shown. In all cases, sequencing bias was taken into account by disregarding all pairs of prokaryotic species that had a Jaccard coefficient greater than 0.90 based on Pfam profile analysis (see Materials and Methods). A control (average of 10 trials) was also performed by randomizing the nearest neighbors for each prokaryotic species (hashes). Error bars for all three analyses are too small to be displayed.
pone.0000743/pone.0000743.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Construction of the niche and phylogenetic maps.The niche map is constructed by comparing all predicted proteins within each prokaryote (B1–Bn) against the Pfam database (a). Likewise, construction of a phylogenetic map is done by performing a multiple sequence alignment using the 16S rRNA sequence from each prokaryote. Each metric is then converted into a Pfam profile and 16S distance matrix, respectively (b). The Pfam profile matrix is further converted into a similarity matrix by applying Spearman's rank correlation (c). Each Prokaryote is then assigned an (x, y) coordinate by applying a combination of multi-dimensional scaling and force-directed placement to both similarity and distance matrices as shown in (d). Finally, a topographical map is generated using the computer program VxInsight.

In all cases, sequencing bias was taken into account by disregarding all pairs of prokaryotic species that had a Jaccard coefficient greater than 0.90 based on Pfam profile analysis (see Materials and Methods). A control (average of 10 trials) was also performed by randomizing the nearest neighbors for each prokaryotic species (hashes). Error bars for the randomized control are too small to be displayed.
pone.0000743/pone.0000743.cap.5:                Figure 5.  Clustering of prokaryotic species on the niche map.Three groups of prokaryotic species are shown, including the marine Gammaproteobacteria in NM11 that cluster according to phylogeny (a); the obligate symbionts and pathogens in NM10 and NM16 that cluster according to function (b); and the prokaryotes existing at the soil, plant, and human interface in NM14 that cluster according to environment. A high resolution view of each mountain is shown, in addition to the complete niche map labeled with the corresponding mountain (blue circles). The genus of every prokaryote in each mountain is also shown.
pone.0000754/pone.0000754.cap.5:                Figure 5.  Model for the origin of digits by temporal extension of distal Hoxd13 expression.Tree shows phylogenetic relationships of shark, paddlefish, zebrafish and mouse. Top row shows hypothetical timing for the transition of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) to apical ectodermal fold (AEF); note that the mouse maintains an AER and does not form an AEF. Green shading represents proliferative period for endoskeletal progenitor cells. Middle rows show Hoxd13 expression domains (blue) at early and late stages of fin and limb bud outgrowth. AER and AEF are shaded orange. Bottom row shows pectoral appendicular skeleton for each taxon. Endoskeletal bones are shaded as follows: green, propterygium; red, mesopterygium, yellow, metapterygium. Dermal fin rays are shown as unshaded elements within fin blade. The model suggests that a second phase of distal Hoxd13 expression was present in the paired fins of the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans (at position 1), and that loss of the distal Hoxd13 domain in teleosts (position 2) and its spatial expansion in tetrapods (position 3) may have been associated with temporal modulation of endoskeletal progenitor cell proliferation. Early conversion of the AER to an AEF would be expected to truncate or eliminate phase II expression of Hoxd13 and reduce the fin endoskeleton, as seen in zebrafish, whereas prolonged signaling by the AER would be expected to extend Phase II and expand the Hoxd13 domain, giving rise to digits in the tetrapod lineage. Clock model after [25]; skeletal patterns after [15], [31], [40], [74].

CCR2/CCR5 Haplotypes and abridged phylogenetic tree.Haplotypes were constructed based on the evolution of linked CCR2 and CCR5 mutations, including a valine to isoleucine substitution at codon 64 in the CCR2b gene (CCR2-64I), CCR5 mutations -2733A→G, -2554 G→T, -2459A→G, -2135C→T, -2132C→T, -2086A→G, -1835C→T, and the delta-32 deletion in the open reading frame of CCR5 (CCR5-ORF).
pone.0000847/pone.0000847.cap.2:                Figure 2.  Codon-pair context is species specific.A) Individual codon-pair context maps built for various genomes followed phylogeny indicating that codon-pair context is species specific. For instance, the human ORFeome map is more similar to that of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) than to the mouse (Mus musculus) map. B) This result was confirmed using differential display maps (DDM) that subtract two codon-pair context maps. For example, H. sapiens–M. musculus (H.s vs M.m); H. sapiens–P. troglodytes (H.s vs P.t). In these differential display maps major codon-pair context differences (above 15) are shown in light blue and darker maps correspond to species with more similar codon-pair context biases. In the present example, the maps of H.s vs M.m and H.s vs P.t have 6% and 1% of blue cells, respectively. C and D) The same phylogenetical relationship could be detected for bacterial ORFeomes, as exemplified for Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhi. The DDM built with these species have 55% (E.c vs B.c) and 20% (E.c vs S.t) of blue cells. E) Finally, the phylogenetical relationship was maintained when the above species were clustered according to the similarities of the codon-pair context maps. The yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe were added to include an intermediate group of lower eukaryotes in the tree. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps according to the color scale shown, so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts.
pone.0000847/pone.0000847.cap.3:                Figure 3.  Nucleotide context preferences can be detected in total genome sequences.A large-scale map for codon-pair context was produced using either the ORFeome (panel A) or the total genome (panel B) sequences of 119 species (see Figure 1 and Methods). Such patterns are either universal i.e. present in every species, or visible only in special phylogenetic groups. Surprisingly, most of the ORFeome patterns were also present in total genome sequences, implying that the major forces that drive the evolution of coding sequences are not necessarily connected to mRNA translation. Moreover, when a Differential Map Display (DDM) was built to compare the two former maps (panel C) it became clear that eukaryotes have a more heterogeneous behavior, since they showed greater resemblance between coding and non-coding sequences (darker pattern in the DDM), but they also produced the larger differences found in the DDM (*). These differences correspond either to two-codon context rules imposed by the translational machinery and hence specific of ORFeomes, or to genome biases that are strongly repressed in coding sequences, where they are probably associated to increased decoding error rates. ORFeomes were arranged in the map by domain of life (Eukaryota, Archaea and Eubacteria from left to right) and sorted as shown in Figure S2. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts, while in the DDM major differences (above 15) between residuals of the previous maps are shown in light blue.
pone.0000864/pone.0000864.cap.7:                Figure 7.  The evolution of hedgehog/Gli signalling in the Deuterostomia.The tree shows the phylogenetic relationships of the major deuterostome taxa. At the ends of the branches are representatives of each taxon, and adjacent to these are schematic diagrams illustrating the expression of Hh and Gli genes at key developmental stages, with arrows indicating the predicted direction of hedgehog signalling. Labelling on branches of the tree indicates predicted ancestral gene complement (in black) or actual gene complement in living taxa (in red). Single Hh and Gli genes are predicted to have been present in the common ancestor of the Deuterostomes. In the Ambulacraria (represented by the echinoderm Lytechinus variegatus and the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii), these genes do not appear to have duplicated, though hemichordate Gli has yet to be isolated. The spatial expression of Gli genes is unreported in Ambulacraria, however Hh expression has been reported as localised to the apical tip in S. kowalevskii and to the endoderm in L. variegatus. In the Chordata, midline Hh expression is observed in all three lineages, with corresponding Gli expression in adjacent tissues (though note neural restriction of Hh and Gli in C. intestinalis, indicating the loss of notochord Hh and associated mesodermal Gli expression from this lineage). Adjacent to the B. floridae and M. musculus diagrams are simplified representations of the diversity of activator and repressor forms of Gli present in each lineage. Superscript numbers adjacent to genes indicate the following references from which the data were taken: 1 [74]. 2 [39]. 3 [75]. 4 [6]. 5 [5]. 6 [38].

(B) Dissected nymphal T2 and T3 legs, showing enlarged femoral (fe) and tibial (ti) segments in the latter. (C) An abbreviated insect phylogeny illustrating a trend toward differential enlargement of hind leg segments. Plus and minus refer to the presence or the absence of increase in the T3 segment size (compared to forelegs), respectively. Two pluses indicate a great enlargement, while a +/− denotes a presence of size increase in some but not all of the members of the group. Note that the depicted leg size differential refers to that observed in first instar nymphs (for hemimetabolous groups) and first instar larvae (for holometabolous groups), and not to adult morphologies.
pone.0000884/pone.0000884.cap.4:                Figure 4.  Rodent, dog and lemur GC-D experienced purifying selection; marmoset and human GC-D pseudogenes evolved neutrally.A phylogenetic tree of dog, rat, mouse, lemur, marmoset and human is shown: topology was taken from accepted species trees [47]–[50] and branch lengths represent an estimate of the total number of substitutions per codon in the GC-D sequences examined, as determined by PAML's codeml algorithm. We considered only a subset of species; if all species had been used, missing sequence data (exon deletions and/or absence from available data) would have meant that the number of codons available for analysis was too low. Nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) rates of evolution were estimated for each branch using PAML's codeml (see Methods, Text S1). The Ka/Ks ratio is given above each branch, and the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, respectively, are given below each branch in parentheses. For each branch of the tree, a statistical test was performed to determine whether the sequences observed are consistent with the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Branches where the null (neutral) hypothesis was rejected with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.05 or less (i.e. branches where GC-D evolved under purifying selection) are drawn with thick lines.

pone.0001054/pone.0001054.cap.4:                Figure 4.  Three hypotheses for metazoan opsin relationships.These are statistically indistinguishable when considering only the likelihood of observed amino acid sequences. (A) Our preferred phylogenetic hypothesis where ciliary opsins are an outgroup to other opsin clades and cnidops is the sister to the rhabdomeric+Go clade. This hypothesis minimizes the number of gene duplication and loss events required to explain the evolutionary history of metazoan opsins and is consistent with morphological data [33]. (B and C) Phylogenetic hypotheses in which cnidops represents the outgroup to other opsins. Given our finding of a ciliary opsin in Nematostella, these hypotheses require the additional loss of ciliary opsin in the Hydra lineage and an additional loss of cnidops in bilaterian animals.

Summary of analyses to determine and root opsin phylogeny.Illustrated is each possible unrooted and rooted hypothesis, assuming monophyly of four major opsin clades. Trees in (A) 1–3 correspond to possible unrooted topologyies and those in (B) 1–15 represent all possible rooted trees, see Table 1. Orange X indicates that tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin-only dataset. Red X indicates tree had significantly lower likelihood in opsin+outgroup dataset. Yellow X indicates that tree implies additional gene duplication/loss events compared to minimum (tree 1 is minimum with 2 duplications 0 losses implied). Grey X indicates tree with cnidops as earliest branching opsin group–a result inferred in parametric bootstrap analyses, which incorrectly grouped cnidops+outgroup opsins because of long branch-attraction (see supplementary methods). Cil = ciliary; Rh = rhabdomeric; RG = Go/RGR.

pone.0001054/pone.0001054.cap.7:                Figure 7.  Summary of co-variation analyses and tests for selection.Previously described G protein binding states, together with amino acid sequences of the 4th cytoplasmic loop regions from our opsin dataset, were used to test the hypothesis that the two character sets co-vary across our opsin phylogeny. Co-variation was assessed using mutual information content (MIC). Shown here is a representation of these results. Predictive P-values (Bottom axis) based on MIC for co-variation between each residue in the 4th cytoplasimic loop and their respective G protein interactions (Right axis) are shown. These analyses were conducted using Bayesian mutational simulation mapping in SIMMAP [64]. We also tested possibility that these residues had evolved under a selective regime using the criterion of site specific rate heterogeneity as implemented in DIVERGE2 [29]. The two highest scoring residues from co-variation analyses (310 and 312) also retain the signature of selection (asterisk). See table S1 for citations. P = predictive P-value, M = the M statistic given by MIC.

Our preferred hypothesis for opsin phylogeny (figure 4A) reconciled to a conservative view of metazoan phylogeny.Black circles indicate gene duplication events. Tan ovals indicate the opsin complement at key nodes in metazoan phylogeny. By this hypothesis, both ciliary and cnidops opsins were present in the eumetazoan ancestor of Cnidaria+Bilateria while rhabdomeric and Go opsins evolved by gene duplication prior to the evolution of bilaterian animals, but not before.

The value for the Shimodaira-Hasagawa likelihood ratio test is given for the internal branches (only when P≥0.95). In both cases, the sequence from R. solanacearum is not clustered with the other β-proteobacterial sequences, this with a significant value for the clustering test.

Phylograms are from 50% majority rule Bayesian consensus. Shading of genes indicates confirmed expression of sequences in GenBank (dbEST:CF878787.1, CB906451.1, CF872359, CF865713, CB895628). Thick black branches denote strong support for the complete combined sequence (Bayesian posterior probabilities [BPP]&gt;0.95, maximum parsimony bootstrap percentages [MPB]&gt;85), and thick gray branches denote strong support from two of three individual genes (BPP 0.99 and/or MPB 70%). Strong support from maximum likelihood bootstraps ([MLB]&gt;80%) is indicated by an *. Actual support values for critical nodes are in Table 1. Clades labeled A (Ascomycota), B (Basidiomycota) and S (Sordariomycetes) follow James et al. (2006). Contributing phylogenetic analyses are in SI Fig. S1a,b.

Predicted orthologs verified by proteomic observations.A) Orthologs were predicted between consecutively greater numbers of bacteria, beginning with all pairwise combinations and ending with all of the 17 bacteria. Clustered results reveal a core genome of 144 genes and more exclusive orthologs between bacteria of the same species. B) Observed protein orthologs measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were included and given greater weight than predicted orthologs only. Clustering resulted in improved agreement with phylogenetic predictions. 105 of the 144 core genes were verified by protein observations, which represent the core proteome for the set of bacteria.
pone.0001567/pone.0001567.cap.2:                Figure 2.  Diagram depicting the synteny conserved between the myod-containing chromosome of human, with that of chicken, zebrafish, pufferfish, stickleback and medaka.A striking pattern of interleaved double conserved synteny can be seen where teleost genes are distributed between two regions as either single copies or paralogues. This, in contrast to the direct depiction of MyoD phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 1), suggests that a myod-containing chromosome duplicated in a common teleost ancestor. Genes are not scaled by size and are represented by arrows (identifying the direction of transcription) coloured by their orthology to human genes. Black arrowheads represent genes not conserved between humans and other species on the chromosomal region investigated. Double diagonal lines represent a gap of more than three genes. Teleost genes found on the two paralogous chromosomal regions are marked with a black star. The black arrow on zebrafish chromosome 7 marks the putative position where myod2 was non-functionalised. Teleost genes orthologous to those on zebrafish chromosomes 25 and 7 are respectively designated as Gene-1 and Gene-2, to identify their common paralogy. Multiple tandem tropI genes present on duplicated teleost chromosomes are labelled as a, b, c based on their left to right position and not by their inferred paralogy/orthology from phylogenetic reconstruction (Fig. 3d).

Taxonomic and metabolic potential of Bacteria and Archaea of the four atolls: A) Proportion of autotrophs, heterotrophs and potential pathogens identified by the 16S rDNA sequences in the microbial metagenomic fractions.B) Number of cultured Vibrio spp. (bar represents means±standard error) in the water column (F3,58 = 5.697, P = 0.002, Wilcoxon one-sided paired t-test showed significant differences for all atoll pairings at P = 0.05) and coral mucus (F3,42 = 3.514, P = 0.023, Wilcoxon one-sided paired t-test showed significant differences for all atoll pairings at P = 0.05, except between Kingman and Palmyra P = 0.299). C) The metabolic potential expressed by the seven most abundant subsystems, across the atolls. These subsystems varied significantly between Kingman and Kiritimati using both XIPE [37] and G-test (Supplementary data). Subsystems that are more closely associated with autotrophs are shown in green. The “potential pathogen” designation are known human pathogenic genera like Staphylococcus, Vibrio, and Escherichia, fish pathogens like Aeromona, and plant pathogens from the Xylella genera.

Phylogenetic tree of mature tRNA sequences in 45 archaeal species.The phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree was constructed by using mature sequences of 1953 predicted tRNAs from the complete genomes of 45 archaeal species. Clusters are numbered from 1 to 22, and tRNAs within each cluster are denoted by amino acids corresponding to the anticodon. Clusters including tRNAs from all 3 archaeal phyla (Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota) are shaded in blue. The amino acids corresponding to the split tRNAs are boxed.
pone.0001634/pone.0001634.cap.2:                Figure 2.  Local phylogenetic trees between 53 AAV cap sequences.Neighbour-joining trees were produced based on the nucleotide alignment for 3 regions: R1, VP1 unique; R2, between VP2 and VP3 N-termini; R3, VP3 coding region shared by all VP 1-3 (see Fig 1). Phylogenetic discordance between the three regions was observed for recombinant sequences. Tree structure difference between regions, particularly R1 versus R3, demonstrates the mosaic nature of the cap gene. Fifty-three sequences were selected by excluding sequences of non-mammalian origin (except an avian AAV used as the root), sequences derived from Tulane/F953 monkey and a number of ‘redundant’ sequences as indicated in Table S1. Bootstrap scores greater than 90 % are shown. Recombinant sequences depicted in Fig 1B–F are colour-boxed. A branch length scale common for all three trees is shown.

Orange vectors are statistically significant (α = .05) under an upper-tail Monte Carlo test of 10,000 trials and a sparse false discovery rate (sFDR) correction. Non-significant vectors are color-coded by Monte Carlo P value: the brighter the yellow, the greater the support. Quintiles are defined by breaks in ranked P values of more than .01, except within the final quintile. The map is based on satellite photos made available in World Wind 1.4 (http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/).

pone.0001764/pone.0001764.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Basal tree encompassing the roots of Native American mtDNA haplogroups.The tree is rooted on the haplogroup L3 founder and the position of the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) [49] is indicated for reading off sequence motifs. Closely related Asian branches are indicated in green. Detailed phylogenies for the four pan-American haplogroups (A2, B2, C1, and D1, highlighted in red) are shown in the corresponding figures. The complete sequences that are currently available for the other four Native American haplogroups (X2a, C4c, D2a, and D4h3, highlighted in red) are also displayed. Haplogroup D3 is common among Inuit populations [16], but all complete sequences available are from Siberia [13], [18]. As for A2a, the HVS-I motif (16111 16192 16223 16233 16290 16319 16331) of the reported sequence (no. 1) is common in Na-Dené groups [5]. Sequence no. 2 has been revised taking into account that the originally reported transitions at 4732 and 5147 [8] were artifacts due to a sample mix-up, while sequence no. 6 represents the shared motif of six Aleutian mitochondrial genomes [13]. Mutations are transitions unless specified: suffixes indicate transversions (to A, G, C, or T) or indels (+, d). Mutations back to the rCRS nucleotide are prefixed with @. Recurrent mutational events are underlined. Mutations in italics are either disease-causing or heteroplasmic or likely erroneous (and do not enter age calculations). We have followed the recent guidelines for standardization of the alignment in long C stretches [50], but disregarded any length variation in the C stretches that would then be scored at 309 or 16193 (which is often subject to considerable heteroplasmy). A number flagging a circled haplotype indicates the number of individuals sharing the corresponding haplotype (if &gt;1). Additional information is provided in Text S4, while Table S1 lists the source of the complete genomes.

Vocal learners are highlighted in red. Red dots: possible independent gains of vocal learning; green dots: alternatively, possible independent losses. B. Semi-3D view of seven cerebral vocal nuclei (red and yellow) found in vocal learners and of auditory areas (blue) found in all birds. Red-labeled vocal nuclei and white arrows: anterior vocal pathway. Yellow-labeled vocal nuclei and black arrows: posterior vocal pathway. Only a few connections in hummingbirds are known and that of songbird MO is not known. Based on serial sections of singing-driven IEG expression in this study, we see that NIf and Av are adjacent at lateral levels. Anterior is right, dorsal is up. Scale bars, 1 mm.

pone.0001903/pone.0001903.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Inventory of nonchemosensory GPCRs (nGPCRs) in vertebrates.Nonchemosensory GPCRs belonging to the rhodopsin class (A), the secretin class (B), the metabotropic glutamate class (C), and the Frizzled class (F) were identified from the genomes of human (N = 359), rat (N = 359), mouse (N = 382), chicken (N = 310), pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (N = 431), and pufferfish Takifugu rubripes (N = 438)(see Tables S1 A and S1 B for a complete list). Receptors belonging to different classes are indicated by different colors in the stacked bars. The rhodopsin class nGPCRs are subdivided into eight subclasses (A1–A8) based on their phylogenetic relationships and the chemical properties of the ligand [19].
pone.0001903/pone.0001903.cap.2:                Figure 2.  Radial evolution of nGPCR genes in tetrapods and teleosts.Based on phylogenetic analyses of nGPCR homologs from different vertebrate species, we deduced that the genome of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of tetrapods and teleosts encoded at least 269 ancestral nGPCR genes belonging to the four main classes (207 class A, 38 class B, 14 class C, and 10 class F) of vertebrate nGPCRs. A) The radar plot shows the number of paralogous nGPCRs derived from each of the 269 nGPCR ancestors in human, rat, mouse, chicken, T. nigroviridis, and T. rubripes (see complete list in Tables S2 A and S2 B). Each ring of the radar plot represents one copy of a paralogous gene, and the divisions of different classes of nGPCRs are indicated by dashed lines. The presence of duplicates is most widespread in T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes. B) Approximately 65% of pufferfish nGPCRs are derived from lineage-specific gene duplications whereas only 32.3–37.5% of nGPCRs in tetrapods evolved from gene duplications after the separation of tetrapods and teleosts (lower panel). Analyses based on a per ancestral gene basis showed more than 41% of MRCA nGPCRs evolved into more than one paralog in teleosts as compared to only 16.3–21.3% in tetrapods (upper panel).
pone.0001907/pone.0001907.cap.1:                Figure 1.  The number of niche dimensions subject to divergent selection and speciation of Timema walking-stick insects.Depicted are the two ecotype pairs and the species pair studied for the degree of phenotypic and evolutionary divergence in relation to the number of niche dimensions subject to divergent selection. A1 and C1 refer to ecotypes of T. cristinae (A = Adenostoma and C = Ceanothus hereafter). A2 and C2 refer to ecotypes of T. podura. A3 and C3 refer to the species pair T. podura and T. chumash, respectively. The ecotype pairs exhibit weaker divergence in morphology, host preference, and mtDNA than the species pair, and are also subject to divergent selection on fewer niche dimensions. A) Photographs of the three taxon pairs, and divergence in colour-pattern between them (brightness contrast, mean±95% C.I.). Host plants are also shown. B) Summary of divergence in host plant preferences and mtDNA (colours represent host plant use). Δ%C refers to the difference between each taxon pair in the percent of individuals choosing Ceanothus over Adenostoma in host preference trials [data from 78, 72, and the current study for T. cristinae ecotypes, T. podura ecotypes, and the species pair, respectively]. The phylogenetic trees are schematic for simplicity. The patterns depicted were robust to alternative methods for tree construction [75], [81 for details]. C) The nature of selection on crypsis and physiology for each taxon pair. For crypsis, the term ‘survival’ is used as a general y-axis label, representing the fitness of each insect host form on each host species. For ecotypes, the y-axes specifically represent 1- the proportion of insects eaten in predation trials with scrub jays [data from 72]. For the species pair, the y-axis specifically represents the proportion of each insect species on each host plant at the end of the field experiment (shown in more detail in Fig. 2). Further evidence that selection is exerted by visual predation stems from the observation that: (a) survival was measured using predation trials, or (b) divergent selection in manipulative field experiments was detected in the presence, but not in the absence, of visual predation [see also 70], [71]. For physiology, the y-axis represents lifetime fecundity in all cases (data on survival for the species pair are also reported in Fig. 2). The data depicted can be used to infer the presence versus absence of divergent selection, but should not be used to quantitatively compare the strength of selection (because somewhat different experimental procedures were used among taxa). For simplicity, error bars were removed for the current figure, but are depicted in Fig. 2. See text for statistical details.
pone.0001937/pone.0001937.cap.2:                Figure 2.  Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA (A) and whole proteome analysis (B).The phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from various Shewnaella species was constructed by neighbor-joining method using the programs of MEGA package. 1000 trial of bootstrap analysis was used to provide confident estimates for phylogenetic tree topologies. The phylogenetic tree based on the whole proteome sequences of the strains was constructed as described in the materials and methods with 100 trial of bootstrap.
pone.0001939/pone.0001939.cap.1:                Figure 1.  Cell lineage analysis based on somatic MS mutations.A. The cell lineage tree of an organism is a rooted labeled binary tree representing its development from a single cell until present time. Nodes (circles) represent cells (dead cells are crossed), and edges (lines) connect parent and daughter cells (dashed lines represent several divisions). Uncrossed leaves (nodes with no daughters) represent extant cells. Lineage trees are a snapshot of a specific timepoint, which constantly grow throughout embryonic development and the adult life of the organism. Any cell sample (colored leaves) induces a partial subtree, called the cell sample lineage tree (panel B). B. The genomic composition of cells in the sample tree at three MS loci is shown. Spontaneous somatic mutations (marked by X) in these loci are sufficient to encode the lineage relations between these cells. Cells that are genetically similar tend to share a longer common developmental path, consequently enabling phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the tree. Although idealized mutations are depicted, even potential hampering factors (such as coincident mutations) are not expected to disrupt analysis if a sufficient number of loci are analyzed [1]. C. Scheme of reconstruction procedure. DNA from isolated cells is amplified either by culture or whole genome amplification, after which each cell is analyzed over a large set of MS loci using PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary histograms are automatically analyzed yielding cell identifiers, which represent the mutations each cell accumulated in the MS set. Phylogenetic analysis of cell identifiers yields a reconstructed tree, which is an estimation of the lineage relations between analyzed cells.
