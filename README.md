plosonehtml
===========

Experiments with a test sample of full text PLOS ONE articles in HTML. All of these articles are CC-BY open access.

I'm aware PLOS ONE has an API but I'm happier doing it all myself on my desktop rather than through the API. Eventually I will be doing things that the API can't/won't so in the long run doing it this way may make more sense.
